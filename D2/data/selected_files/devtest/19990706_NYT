MARK SANDMAN, 47, MUSICIAN WHO LED THE BAND MORPHINE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Sandman, the leader of the idiosyncratic Boston rock trio
Morphine, died on Saturday during a performance at the Giardini del
Principe in Palestrina, near Rome. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
   Sandman collapsed in front of several thousand fans during a
performance on the second day of a three-day festival that was a
stop on the band's two-week European tour.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   There were few groups in the rock world like Morphine. Instead
of playing guitar, Sandman played a slide bass with only two
strings. He sang in a near-monotone baritone while his band mate
Billy Conway played delicate percussion. The third member, Dana
Colley, often played two saxophones simultaneously. Despite such a
limited palette, the band's songs were memorable, evocative and
accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Morphine's slow, smoldering albums often sounded like
soundtracks written for pulp-fiction novels, and its concerts
reflected Sandman's devilish, dry humor. The group's music appeared
on the soundtrack to many films, including ``Get Shorty,''
``Spanking the Monkey'' and ``Beautiful Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Before forming Morphine in the early 1990s, Sandman was a taxi
driver. He also played with the Boston group Treat Her Right,
throwing the occasional minimalist pop song into the band's
blues-based repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Morphine, he was signed to the leading independent label
Rykodisc and then to Dreamworks, releasing five albums, including
``Good,'' ``Cure for Pain,'' ``Yes'' and ``Like Swimming.''
Favorite songs among the band's cult, college-aged audience ranged
from those with silly lyrics delivered in a deadpan voice to those
with Sandman's more insightful beatnik-style poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Sandman also formed several bands as side projects, including
the more upbeat Hypnosonics, the country Pale Brothers and the
sarcastically titled Supergroup, with Chris Ballew of the joke-pop
band Presidents of the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   Sandman is survived by his parents.

BENITEZ, THE METS' SUBSTITUTE CLOSER, SAVES ANOTHER ONE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nights like the last two have to make people think
Armando Benitez is ready to assume the closer role full time with
the Mets, even after John Franco comes back from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Benitez struck out the heart of the Atlanta
Braves order to preserve a one-run victory, Vladimir Guerrero of
Montreal told Benitez that he would like to see Benitez come out of
the bullpen and do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Not every night I can do it like that,' ''
Benitez said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But he was close enough. Benitez walked the first batter he
faced in the ninth inning Monday night at Shea Stadium, then
retired three in a row to nail down his fifth save of the season
and a 2-1 Mets victory over the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been nights like last Wednesday in Miami, where
the hard-throwing Benitez surrendered a game-winning home run for
the third time this season. Consistency has been a question with
Benitez since he arrived in the major leagues in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Manager Bobby Valentine did not want to answer the
question of who would be his closer when Franco returns from his
15-day stint on the disabled list with a tendon injury to his left
middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until John comes back, I won't deal with any New York job
controversies,'' Valentine said. ``Johnny's not even bending his
finger yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Valentine said, Franco might not even be ready to come back
when he is eligible in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the job is Benitez's. Monday night, he saved the
victory for Turk Wendell (2-0), after the Mets scored the go-ahead
run when Brian McRae hit into a double play with the bases loaded
in the eighth inning. Surprisingly, Montreal Manager Felipe Alou
had his infield playing back with the score tied, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' pitching coach, Dave Wallace, said that Benitez has
overpowered batters because ``he has an idea of how to go after
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More so than I realized,'' Wallace added. ``He is ahead of
where I thought he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed looked sharp in seven strong innings of five-hit,
one-run ball. But because Dustin Hermanson was just as good, Reed
departed for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the seventh with the
score tied at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's chief problem was that he could not get Terry Jones out.
He allowed a triple to Jones, the game's second batter, but left
him stranded. In the third inning, Jones blooped a run-scoring
single to left just after Manny Martinez had belted a two-out
double to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time the Expos threatened against Reed was in the
sixth, when Jones singled with one out, stole second and advanced
to third on a ground out. But Guerrero popped to second to end the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson, meanwhile, kept the Mets in check until the fifth,
limiting them to only one runner in scoring position, Reed, who
doubled to lead off the third and never got farther.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets threatened again in the sixth, when John Olerud and
Mike Piazza singled to open the inning. But Hermanson stranded them
and was sailing until he had to leave in the seventh with cramps in
his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth against Guillermo Mota, Olerud walked, Piazza
doubled, Robin Ventura was walked intentionally to load the bases
and McRae hit into what turned out to be the game-winning double
play.

SLEEPLESS GUN FOR HIRE JOINS FIRST LADY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 9:15 Tuesday morning, a sleep-deprived Howard
Wolfson is to accompany a lawyer to the Federal Election Commission
in Washington as the lawyer files a piece of paper establishing the
Hillary Rodham Clinton for U.S. Senate Exploratory Committee. After
tending to the television cameras, and perhaps savoring a small
role in history, Wolfson will go to Albany, N.Y., and begin caring
for 200 reporters from around the world who are to trail Mrs.
Clinton, starting Wednesday, on a four-day campaign trip across New
York; the opening day, simultaneously, of the wildest ride of
Wolfson's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in at 6 this morning and I'll probably be here until
midnight,'' Wolfson said distractedly but not unhappily over lunch,
as his pager vibrated steadily against his hip.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, 32, is Mrs. Clinton's press secretary for her
exploratory committee, a job he has held for a political eon, 11
days.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, June 25, Harold Ickes, Mrs. Clinton's
political adviser, offered Wolfson the job of press secretary to
the first first lady to explore running for political office on her
own. By the following Monday, Wolfson was out of the Capitol Hill
offices of Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester County, N.Y., where he
was the chief of staff, ensconced in a corner of Ickes' Washington
lobbying firm. Since then he has been, basically, on the phone. Not
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be nuts,'' said Josh Isay, the chief of staff
to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who is a good friend of Wolfson's.
``He's perfect for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Isay, Schumer's campaign manager for his 1998 Senate race while
Wolfson was Schumer's director of communications, meant his
assessment as a compliment. In short, Isay said, Wolfson has just
the right amount of obsessiveness, aggressiveness and capacity for
hard work required in a race that will rival a presidential
campaign. (New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is Mrs. Clinton's likely
opponent in the New York Senate race, although neither has
officially declared a candidacy.)
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson was one of those responsible for the Schumer campaign's
daily ``rapid response'' counterpunches to attacks by former Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, who was thought unbeatable at the beginning of the
race. ``If he uses a fist, you use a bat,'' Wolfson told his troops
each day, citing a line from the movie ``The Untouchables'': ``If
he uses a knife, you use a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson raced with Isay to Elaine's late one night in search of
former Police Commissioner William Bratton, hoping to find him to
get assurances that he would appear at an endorsement news
conference the next morning. (They didn't find him, but Bratton
turned up in the morning nonetheless. Wolfson was in before that,
at 5:30.)
</P>
<P>
   Such is Wolfson's stock among New York politicians that Ms.
Lowey, his former boss, called up unsolicited to say nice things
about him. ``He is overwhelmed,'' she said. ``It's a huge job. But
he's up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey, who announced last month she would not run for the
Senate because, she said, Mrs. Clinton's intentions were clear,
also offered the unsolicited view that Mrs. Clinton had not lured
Wolfson away. ``Several people have been saying that she stole
him,'' Ms. Lowey reported. ``That wasn't the case at all.'' After
she dropped out, Ms. Lowey said, she called Mrs. Clinton and
offered Wolfson for an interview. ``And she was very grateful,''
Ms. Lowey said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the object of the women's affections, Wolfson, was
trying to concentrate the other day over his grilled chicken
sandwich at Luna, a restaurant across from Ickes' office, but he
kept looking at his watch, worrying about his pager and trying,
apparently, to be uninteresting, lest he say something delicious
that might offend his new boss at the White House. (He spent an
hour with her before he got the job, and described her as ``very
warm'' and ``funny.'')
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson wouldn't say what the two talked about, but it is
probably safe to say that Mrs. Clinton was pleased to hear that
Wolfson grew up in an apartment in Yonkers, N.Y. His parents, who
divorced when he was a toddler, were teachers; his father taught
social studies at a junior high school in South Orange, N.J., and
his mother special education at public elementary schools in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson went to Yonkers public schools until the fifth grade,
switched to the Fieldston School in Riverdale, the Bronx; graduated
from the University of Chicago, got a master's degree in American
history at Duke University and read the Theodore White ``Making of
the President'' books throughout. He got his first job on Capitol
Hill in August 1992, with Rep. Jim Jontz of Indiana, who lost his
bid for re-election in November. ``It was not an auspicious way to
begin a career,'' Wolfson said. He was hired in 1993 by Ms. Lowey,
who lent him to Schumer last year. Wolfson's girlfriend, Terri
McCullough, is a lobbyist for the National Abortion Rights Action
League in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Wolfson said he had no knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's
house-hunting forays or vacation plans in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only vacation plans I'm aware of are my own,'' he said.
``I have none.''

NEW YORK: working dog.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps no dog has received more attention in Manhattan than
Boomer, the golden retriever who belongs to Parks Commissioner
Henry J. Stern. But of late, the most publicized office dog in the
city is Lil, a bichon-wheaten terrier mix and the constant
companion of Marilyn Mode, the deputy commissioner for public
information of the New York City Police Department. It seems that
Lil's every misdeed, whether swiping a lunch or nipping a
sergeant's foot, is reported by the Newsday columnist Leonard
Levitt, who covers the police department.
</P>
<P>
   It was big news last year when an anonymous letter was sent to
the city's Health Department complaining of Lil's presence, and
Police Commissioner Howard Safir, after asking the legal department
to look into it, then declared that Lil could stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hours are rather unpredictable, and the commissioner
indulges me,'' Ms. Mode said in a recent interview. But she has
grown weary of Levitt's sardonic scrutiny of 20-pound Lil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Roosevelt said about Fala,'' she said, referring to
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his beloved Scottish
terrier. ``When FDR was accused of sending a gunboat back to pick
up Fala, he said he was used to the press taking shots at him and
his family, but he resented their going after Fala. Well, Lil
resents it, and so do I.''
</P>
<P>
   MBS Associates, a marketing firm in Montrose, which promotes
animal adoptions and pet products, participated in last month's
Take Your Dog to Work Day. The firm sponsored contests like ``best
dressed,'' ``most congenial,'' ``best trick'' and ``most
obedient.'' The president, Mal B. Schwartz, who has a mutt named
Dvorak, is thinking of allowing dogs every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy should be explored,'' he said. ``It adds to the
camaraderie around the office. People feel really good about it.
You know, there's more to working than getting work done.''

 (ATTN: Conn., Mass.) 
THE RECEPTION OF DiCICCO IS LOUD AND CLEAR 
 (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Tony DiCicco's mother was born, her parents
were so happy to have a daughter, after three sons, that they named
her Welcome. DiCicco has been just as gladly received as coach of
the women's national soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of my motivation for women's athletics from my
mother,'' DiCicco said. ``She used to shoot baskets with me in the
driveway. She was a great swimmer. I always knew girls could play,
because I played with her.''
</P>
<P>
   At 50, with four sons of his own, he still lives in his hometown
of Wethersfield, Conn., a mile from his parents. On Saturday, he
will coach the biggest game of his life when the United States
meets China in the final of the Women's World Cup at the Rose Bowl
in Pasadena, Calif. Naturally, the welcome mat has been rolled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if my mother is coming, but I've got a ticket for
her if she does,'' DiCicco said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his parents' close friends during Tony's childhood had a
great niece who turned out to be a decent soccer player _ Mia Hamm.
Funny how the whole world can fit into a phone booth. It was Hamm
who offered DiCicco the aphorism that he has hung out on his
coaching shingle: ``Coach us like men, treat us like women.''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women are far more similar than dissimilar from a
coaching standpoint, DiCicco said. The women on the national team,
many of whom have been together for three World Cup tournaments,
want to be pushed and challenged like all elite athletes, and they
play with ravenous assertion, but they do not want a coach in their
face, yelling, singling anyone out for criticism in front of the
others, he said. They are not rushing out to buy tapes from the
Bill Parcells school of motivational speaking.
</P>
<P>
   When DiCicco joined the national team as an assistant coach in
1991, he criticized midfielder Kristine Lilly during a film session
after a loss in China. Several days later, it got back to him that
Lilly was blaming herself for the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With guys, you can yell in their face and they don't worry
about it, but I think women take it more personally,'' said Joy
Fawcett, considered by DiCicco to be the world's top defender.
``The game is different to us. It's more about building
relationships between ourselves and the coaching staff than just a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   A former team captain and all-American at Springfield College in
Massachusetts, DiCicco played professionally for five years in the
American Soccer League and had a cup of coffee with the men's
national team in 1973. He succeeded Anson Dorrance as coach of the
women's national team in 1994 and has built a supremely fit,
attacking team that he runs with a democratic style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony's not a dictator; he's open to input,'' goalkeeper Briana
Scurry said. ``And he always gives 100 percent. With Tony, you know
he leaves no stone unturned.''
</P>
<P>
   He appears to have achieved a balance that suits the needs of
his players. Before the World Cup, the players trained for six
months in Orlando, Fla., away from husbands, friends, family
members. Once every four weeks, DiCicco gave the players a week's
break, saying that ``when they disconnect with those relationships,
it unsettles them.'' He uses his captains, Carla Overbeck and Julie
Foudy, as weather vanes to let him know which way the mood of the
team is blowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very open to listening to what our bodies need,'' Foudy
said. ``He talks to the captains, and he's always asking, `What do
you need? Do you need more fitness? Jogging? A day off?'''
</P>
<P>
   He has a calm demeanor, which seems to transfer to a team that
never panics. If there is pressure for the Americans to win the
World Cup, DiCicco said, that is better than the alternative,
having no chance to win. ``It's less pressure than opportunity,''
he said. He has made his players accessible to both the public and
reporters, aware that they are pioneers as well as athletes, that
they have to sell their game as well as play it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that DiCicco hasn't made mistakes or faced contentious
moments. The players say they felt overtrained during the 1995
Women's World Cup, when the Americans settled for the bronze medal.
He says he now wishes he had made changes to a four-defensive-back
alignment and a possession-type offense earlier rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, forward Debbie Keller took the U.S. Soccer
Federation to arbitration, saying that she had not been invited to
training camp because she had filed a sexual harassment suit
against Dorrance, the former national team coach who also coached
her at the University of North Carolina. The federation stuck by
DiCicco, and Keller lost in arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts when you hear that your morals are being challenged
and basically you're being told you're professionally dishonest,''
DiCicco said, adding that retaliation was not the reason that
Keller, the team's second-leading scorer a year ago, was given only
a brief tryout before the World Cup. ``Debbie had a great season
last year, but the teams we need to beat, I think she's limited to
play against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss in the 1995 World Cup was redeemed in 1996 when the
United States won the gold medal at the Summer Olympics. But
DiCicco and his players want soccer's version of the double play,
simultaneous titles in the Olympics and the World Cup. If male and
female athletes prefer to travel different motivational roads, they
still want to reach the same destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony came into the team not really knowing a lot about the
head coaching position,'' said the forward Tiffeny Milbrett. ``He's
made some hard decisions. Sometimes hard decisions are looking at
players and situations and saying, `Do I need them? Do I cut them?'
Sometimes hard decisions are evaluating your own liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '95, we lost the enjoyment of soccer. It was almost like
burning out. It's a delicate balance. You can't do the same drills,
you can't approach the game the same way you did 10 years ago. You
have to evolve. That's what Tony did, to the better of his
coaching, to the better of the team.''

WALLACE HOWELL, 84, FAMED RAINMAKER IN DROUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Ore., Colo.)  (mk) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Wallace Howell, a meteorologist whose celebrated rainmaking
efforts during a water shortage 50 years ago were admired by
parched New Yorkers and detested by drenched Catskill farmers, died
on June 12 at Thornton Medical Center in La Jolla, Calif., where he
lived. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, Howell traveled the world, seeding
clouds with dry ice and silver iodide, trying to make rain for
agriculture and hydroelectric power in countries like Canada, Cuba,
Peru and the Philippines. In the 1960s, he developed one of the
first snow-making machines for ski resorts. He was a president of
the weather observatory on Mount Washington in New Hampshire, and
spent 15 years with the federal Bureau of Reclamation, studying
ways to increase the snowpack in the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of publicity, both good and bad, nothing rivaled
his work in New York during the water shortage of 1949-50.

   Those were desperate times, with reservoirs in the Catskill
watershed getting lower every day and newspapers filled with dire
forecasts of when they might be empty. Pools were closed, lawn
sprinkling and car washing banned. ``Shaveless Fridays'' were the
norm. The Roman Catholic archdiocese urged parishioners to pray for
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Howell had become interested in meteorology as an undergraduate
at Harvard in the 1930s, and had been a weatherman with the Army
Air Corps during World War II. In 1948 he received a doctorate from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied the
physics of clouds and cloud seeding, particularly the use of
ground-based smoke generators to provide the silver iodide crystals
around which water droplets could form.
</P>
<P>
   New York City hired him in early 1950 ``for the magnificent sum
of $100 a day,'' said Charles Wetterer, who was later a partner
with Howell. ``For a meteorologist, that was big, big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell planned his campaign like an army general, scouting out a
headquarters for his operation, settling on a hilltop field in
Calicoon, N.Y., that afforded a commanding view of the approaching
weather over the watershed. He obtained a surplus military radar
system. For aerial seeding, police planes and pilots were at his
disposal.
</P>
<P>
   His first flight, on March 28, 1950, was a failure, and rain was
to blame. When Howell arrived at Floyd Bennet Airport in Brooklyn,
rain and fog kept the plane on the ground. When it finally took off
four hours late with 100 pounds of dry ice aboard, promising clouds
over the Catskills had dissipated. The only dry ice that was tossed
overboard was a small amount thrown by the pilot to make sure it
would clear the plane's stabilizer struts.
</P>
<P>
   He had better luck with later sorties, however, and with his
ground-based generators. Howell was in the newspapers every day,
his movements tracked as regularly as storm clouds over the
Catskills. He was even profiled in The New Yorker. ``I didn't know
I was going to be a celebrity,'' he told the magazine. ``And I
don't want to be one.'
</P>
<P>
   Rains came, and the reservoirs began to fill again. There was
even a freak snowstorm in mid-April; ``Howell's snow,'' it was
called. Water restrictions were eventually lifted, and in February
1951, with the reservoirs at more than 99 percent of capacity,
Howell's contract ended.
</P>
<P>
   In the Catskills, the rains had made farmers and resort owners
furious. Charging that crops had been harmed and vacationers scared
off, they filed suit against the city and its rainmaker. ``I know
some people up there that would shoot Howell on sight,'' one farm
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The question of just how much credit for the rains should go to
Howell and how much to nature was always an open one. The city had
been pleased with the rainmaking efforts, but with the filing of
the lawsuits (which were eventually thrown out), officials were
forced to take a more skeptical attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Howell had always been modest in his claims. After refusing to
take credit for months, he finally acknowledged in August 1950 that
``I have made rain.'' But he hedged by saying his work probably had
produced ``very little rain that would not have fallen anyway.''
Later, he estimated that he had increased rainfall that year by 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He had his defenders, however. One letter writer to The New York
Times noted that the total rainfall during July 1950 was only about
six inches, far less than in some other years when no one had
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those years was the resort business ruined?'' the writer
asked. ``No. Were all crops destroyed by too much rain? No. One
could not sue nature. But one can sue Howell.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell is survived by his wife of 58 years, Christine Howell;
two daughters, Jane, of La Jolla, and Holly, of Del Mar, Calif.;
three sons, Stephen of Del Mar, Jeremy of North Bend, Ore., and
James of Idaho Springs, Colo., and 13 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His caution about taking credit for the rain helped his
reputation and his business in later years. Rainmaking was a
controversial subject, with little empirical proof that it worked
and plenty of unsavory characters offering their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people who were just selling snake oil,''
said Manuel Lopez, who was hired by Howell when he came to Cuba in
the 1950s, and who worked with him over three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Howell was a scientist, Lopez said, and above all was honest
with his potential clients. ``He'd say, `I think this works, but I
can't prove it,''' Lopez said. ```But you should weigh the cost of
action versus inaction.'''

EDOUARD BOUBAT, 75, PHOTOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Edouard Boubat, one of France's most celebrated postwar
photographers who was best known for his poetic images of children,
died here last Wednesday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, said Liberation, the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Boubat traveled widely during a career that lasted almost 50
years, but unlike many photographers of his generation he showed no
interest in political events. His rule, ``no bodies, no blood, no
war,'' even earned him the nickname of peace correspondent, given
to him by the French poet Jacques Prevert.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, what attracted him was the beauty of life, wherever he
found it. He liked photographing women, animals, trees and nature
as well as children, and his use of light gave his work a special
quality. Invariably the emotion evoked by his images is tenderness,
as in one of his most popular photographs, ``La Petite Fille aux
Feuilles Mortes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a marvelous photographer and a photographer of the
marvelous,'' Michel Guerrin wrote in Le Monde on Thursday. ``His
rich and complex body of work was dominated by three elements:
autobiography, poetry and mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paris, he studied photo-engraving and seemed headed for
a job in industry. But in 1943 he was sent to join hundreds of
thousands of Frenchmen who were doing forced labor in Germany.
Later he recalled seeing Leipzig in flames from Allied bombing.
``We saw the Nazi crimes,'' he said. ``I saw the horrors.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war he found work in a factory in Paris, but he was
drawn to photography and began taking pictures on Sundays. By 1951
he had gained enough recognition to be invited to exhibit with a
group of well-known photographers, including Brassai and Robert
Doisneau. The next year he worked as a staff photographer at
Realites, a successful photography magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``While other photographers took many images so that our
employer could make lots of money, Boubat made a point of not
`covering' his subjects,'' recalled Jean-Philippe Charbonnier, a
former colleague. ``He would take just a few photos and would
return when he felt like it, but there were always three images
that you could not forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Boubat traveled in Europe, Africa and Latin America, always
searching for moments of purity and peace, as with his photograph
of a Portuguese man in dark trilby and vest looking out to sea as
he holds a sleeping child in his arms. In 1967 he resigned from
Realites and worked as an independent photographer associated with
the Top/Rapho agency.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Sophie, and their son, Bernard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something instinctive about the moment you choose to
`take' a photograph,'' he once explained. ``It's not the result of
thought or reflection. The strength of the composition is always
born of the instant of the decision. It reminds me of archery.
There is the tension of the bow and the free flight of the arrow.''

SURVEY CITES ABUSES BY MANAGED CARE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years after New York state enacted sweeping
laws to combat abuses by managed care companies, a survey of city
doctors suggests that many of those abuses not only continue but in
many cases have grown worse.
</P>
<P>
   The state laws, called the managed care bill of rights, are
similar to protections passed in a few other states, and they
resemble a national plan supported by President Clinton to try to
level the playing field between customers and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   New York's regulations detail everything from the information
insurers have to disclose to the way they have to process
hospitals' requests for medical treatments. The laws even dictate
how quickly managed care companies are supposed to return phone
calls. Penalties include fines and interest charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Green, the city's public advocate, said the survey of
257 doctors, conducted in May by his office with the help of the
New York County Medical Society, showed that many parts of the law
are being routinely ignored. This has led, he said, to countless
delays in procedures that doctors consider medically necessary. In
some cases, doctors reported that patients were even forced to wait
on operating tables during minor surgeries because it took insurers
hours to grant authorization for the procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said that over the last two years insurers had added
a range of minor procedures and tests _ like X-rays _ to those that
require preauthorization. And while nearly all routine,
nonemergency requests by doctors are approved within the law's
three-day time limit, managed care companies commonly take much
longer to approve more complicated, expensive procedures, according
to some doctors surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Brescia, the medical director of Calvary Hospital in
the Bronx, reported, for example, that insurers always take longer
than three days to approve requests for pain management treatments
for the hospital's end-stage cancer patients. ``We have families on
the phone screaming for help _ `Mom is suffering!' _ and all we can
say is, `We're doing our best to get her admitted,''' Brescia said.
</P>
<P>
   Green called the report as much an indictment of the state
Departments of Health and Insurance as of the managed care
companies, because the state agencies are responsible for enforcing
the laws. ``They have allowed themselves to become so
ineffectual,'' he said, ``as to become anti-consumer.'' He added
that compared with those in other states, New York's fines assessed
against insurers under its law were incredibly small.
</P>
<P>
   But Allison Klimerman, a spokeswoman for the Insurance
Department, said that she believed that the report, one of several
by Green critical of the Pataki administration's oversight of
health care, was politically motivated. Green has plans to run for
mayor in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Green is trying to get some headlines by taking some
cheap shots,'' she said, adding that the department had imposed
$190,000 in fines against insurers for their failure to pay
health-care providers promptly from the time that law went into
effect in 1997. Under the law, the companies are also charged 12
percent interest daily on amounts not paid quickly enough to
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a slap on the wrist by any stretch,'' Ms.
Klimerman said. ``We've seen companies start to take notice and be
concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Smith, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health, said
that while the department has imposed minimal fines against
insurers starting in 1997, it does conduct undercover surveillance
of managed care companies' practices and forces them to correct
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Green's report, the refrain from those interviewed was that
managed care companies do not appear to be increasing outright
denials of medical treatments, but instead create such a confusing
and frustrating gantlet for obtaining permission that medical
providers are often discouraged from trying.
</P>
<P>
   One Manhattan gastroenterologist, who insisted that his name not
be revealed in the report, told the surveyors that problems with
approvals often led to long delays in crucial colonoscopies _ a
test used to determine cancer in the colon _ and other endoscopy
exams.

<P>
   Halfway through its last season of the 1900s, NASCAR is a little
like a farmer who just won the lottery. He knows he's on a roll and
has money to burn, but he isn't quite sure what to do with it or
how it will change his life.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup racing is America's fastest-growing sport, but
booming success also brings changes that must be addressed. Here
are three key issues NASCAR faces in the future:
</P>
<P>
   The demand for more races _ Winston Cup added a race in Miami
this year, bringing the schedule to 34 points races and two
all-star race weekends. But other speedways are being built across
the country, and each one wants a Winston Cup date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 36 weekends in '99,'' said NASCAR executive vice
president Mike Helton. ``The issue is, can we make it 37 or 38 or
39? We think there is still room. We just don't know how much
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracks are being constructed in Kansas City, Chicago and
northern Kentucky. Plans are under way for speedways in New York,
Denver, Baltimore and maybe Houston. Some drivers are apprehensive
about expanding the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a driver, I want to race every day,'' said STP Pontiac
driver John Andretti. ``If it was strictly a driving thing, I'd say
let's run four or five times a week. Of course, that's not very
realistic. The crews wouldn't be able to keep up, you'd never have
enough cars, and the costs would be astronomical.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is tracks in major markets that want two dates a
year, like Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of stretching the schedule by going somewhere a second
time, right now we are choosing to go somewhere for the first
time,'' Helton said. ``We want to tap into new markets for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's healthy for the car owners and their sponsors when we go
to new markets. We can tell them they will be able to expand their
opportunities in new market areas _ and that's a driving force when
it comes to which tracks we go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe the solution is to take one race from
smaller markets that have two dates _ like Martinsville,
Darlington, Dover and Richmond _ and give those dates to big-market
tracks that have only one annual date. But NASCAR president Bill
France Jr. says he has no plans to take dates from current track
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Bruton Smith, who owns Texas Motor Speedway and five other
tracks, thinks he has the answer: Split the series, and make two
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the cure,'' Smith said. ``If you have two leagues, then
you could run 60 events instead of the 30 or 40. We have talked
about this for three or four years now. We could fill 300,000 seats
in one day because of two races.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says his plan, which would put one league on the East
Coast and the other on the West Coast on a given weekend, would
offer drivers more chances at seat time and victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a potential sponsor, you're interested in your car
winning,'' he said. ``Your car might win eight times in your
league, but in the Winston Cup we're running today, you might not
finish in the top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   But France says track owners and promoters would never warm to
the idea of Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt driving on opposite
sides of the country. He also sees a problem with drivers not
competing in their home state or the state of their sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say there's a race in Texas, but (Corpus Christi native)
Bobby Labonte isn't racing there,'' France said. ``The first thing
that's going to happen is (team owner) Joe Gibbs is going to come
to me and say he's got to be there because Bobby's a Texan and the
corporate headquarters for Interstate Batteries (Labonte's sponsor)
is there. You couldn't dictate who goes where.''
</P>
<P>
   The spiraling costs in Winston Cup _ Many people in NASCAR are
concerned about the staggering costs of fielding a competitive
Winston Cup team. While the series is booming, the price of
sponsoring a Winston Cup team has doubled in the last five years.
It costs $8 million to $10 million a year to run a top team.
</P>
<P>
   Elite drivers command seven-figure annual salaries. Top crew
chiefs are earning $250,000 a year. DuPont will spend $12 million
this season to sponsor Gordon. Chevrolet is spending $10 million to
sponsor Earnhardt's No. 3 Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   For their big bucks, most sponsors want a driver who runs up
front. Last week at Daytona, Skoal told team owner Andy Petree it
would no longer sponsor driver Ken Schrader after this year, and
Tide officials informed Ricky Rudd they were ending a nine-year
association as his sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the first time I've ever experienced anything
like this,'' Rudd said. ``NASCAR is growing, and it's changing, and
hopefully it's all for the better. But I think, unfortunately, a
lot of the guys who paid their dues and helped create the sport are
tending to get run over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd and Schrader are veteran drivers who have had long and
successful careers, but sponsors want to win and win now. Sponsors
have to be sold on a team's potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably guilty of working way too many hours and worrying
way too much about this race team,'' Rudd said. ``I should have
been going up to the sponsors with a fancy briefcase and a nice
PowerPoint pen presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton said this year there have been more conversations than
ever with car owners about keeping a cap on expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one part of our business that makes it more complicated,
though, is operating as an independent contractor, the car owner is
in total control of his own labor costs,'' Helton said. ``NASCAR
can't do much about the labor side of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing pressure on drivers _ ``The demands on these guys is
unbelievable now,'' said Richard Petty, NASCAR's all-time
winningest driver. ``When I was accessible in the garage area, I
was accessible to 20,000 people. These guys have to be accessible
to 120,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, they can't get to the people because the press is in the
way. There's almost as much media now as there used to be fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers are expected to do a lot more than drive these days.
They must entertain sponsors, answer dozens of media requests and
test cars at tracks across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest problem for drivers today is the demand on
their time,'' Rudd said. ``In the late 1970s and early '80s, we'd
sit on the pit wall and sign autographs for two hours. It wasn't
just Richard Petty doing it; everybody did it. But back then, you
didn't have to be somewhere Monday or Tuesday. Now there are
responsibilities that come with major sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for NASCAR's popularity with fans has been its
open-door policy at the track. Fans have been able to walk in the
garage area on race mornings and talk to the drivers. But the
volume of people has increased so much that changes must be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers tell us their concerns,'' Helton said. ``We don't want
them to be known as guys who don't want to give an autograph, so
we're ready to take the hit and say, `If you do give an autograph
at certain times, we're going to penalize you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup champion Gordon says the days spent away from the
track are what burn out most drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big sport now,'' said Gordon. ``There's a lot of
money involved, a lot of sponsors with commitments for the drivers
and the crew chiefs that keep you busy. You've got to learn how to
say no. You've got to make sure you're fulfilling your commitments,
but most of all you've got to fulfill your commitment to the race
team and to what really is making this all go around.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There is a price to pay for stardom, as more NASCAR drivers are
learning. There also is a price to be paid for success, which
NASCAR officials are starting to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision-making process is: What is good for the sport?''
Helton said. ``We want to make it as safe as possible, as
affordable as possible and competitive as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through its 51st season, NASCAR is at a crossroads. The
popularity of the sport is at an all-time high, but keeping it
there will depend on how NASCAR handles its success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough deal,'' Andretti said. ``You want to grow
quickly, because it's exciting to grow fast. But you want to grow
with some control, because it's easy for any business to outgrow
itself.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I work in a very disorganized office.
Everything is a last-minute emergency. On one project, the boss
asked several people to do the same job, and I spent two days on a
project that had been assigned to someone else. My manager said we
just need to get used to it. The turnover rate is extremely high,
with many people leaving in disgust. Their complaints never make it
past middle management. Is there any hope, or should I just jump
ship? L.G.
</P>
<P>
   A. You are in a company that practices management by chaos. With
firefights here and crises there, the company thrashes through the
turbulence of the workday, with employees hanging on and trying to
figure out who is supposed to be doing what. It sounds like things
have gotten to the point that many employees have opted to neither
hang on nor hang around.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts claim that organizations like yours are exciting,
vibrant, and creative. Everything happens very fast, and those who
survive are strong, dynamic and sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts claim that such organizations are absurd. There
are outrageous errors, overlaps and omissions, with dissatisfaction
being voiced by anyone who has anything to do with such companies.
The survivors are treated like furniture, and can easily end up
being damaged goods.
</P>
<P>
   Based on topside inaccessibility and lack of responsiveness, you
are not going to be able to do much to change this company. Some
people can adjust to these environments, and others cannot. You
need to look carefully at yourself and decide what kind of a change
you want to make.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I started a new job nine months ago, and the company just
announced that it is review time. Their method of reviewing
employees seems perplexing as they have the employee do a
self-evaluation, and then compare it with your manager's evaluation
of you. I find this difficult, as I would not want to rate myself
too high or too low, yet my pay increase is based on the review.
Can you please suggest a way that I can evaluate myself? M.A. &QL; 
A. It is interesting to note that you use words like ``they'' and
``their,'' rather than ``we'' and ``our,'' when referring to your
company. Usually, after nine months of employment, an employee
expresses a stronger sense of attachment and belonging. This
mind-set may be affecting your view of the appraisal process and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies today have appraisal systems that include
self-evaluations. They can serve as an opportunity for employees to
look closely at their own performance, present the manager with
data that might have been missed, increase the likelihood of a real
dialogue and be treated as adults. Hence, the best advice is for
you to be honest when completing your self-evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Effective employee reviews are accompanied by a good deal of
managerial feedback and guidance during the evaluation period.
Typically the employee will have a clear idea of the effectiveness
of his or her performance prior to completing a self-evaluation
form.
</P>
<P>
   You should ask your manager for more information on the way in
which the evaluation process actually works. In fact, this
information should have been given to you in the first place, as it
is the kind of communication that can help move your thinking from
``they'' to ``we.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. The company where I work had a ``no husband and wife policy''
until recently. Now we are having many problems with the first
married couple in our area. They defend each other, do each other's
work, and talk about their relationship incessantly. Many of us
have complained to management, but we are told that human resources
allows married couples to work in the same area. What do you think?
R.R.
</P>
<P>
   A. Although this marriage is not bringing bliss to your
department, the marriage itself is not causing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is that there are two employees who are isolating
themselves from the others, talking incessantly about nonwork
issues, and, as a result, are interfering with teamwork,
cooperation, and coordination in the department. That these two
lovebirds are married has nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   When you complained about allowing married couples to work
together, you focused the discussion on marriage rather than
performance. You should meet with management again, focus on
specific behaviors that are interfering with the effectiveness of
the department, and ask for management's help.
</P>
<P>
   In a broader sense, it is not a great sign when management
quotes personnel policy when told about a problematic situation. If
management goes into a policy-quoting mode again, this may be a
sign for you to reconsider how wedded you are to this organization.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WE watch him the very same way we watched Secretariat gallop down
the homestretch at the Belmont 31 lengths ahead of the field. With
jaws dropped in awe.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger, Tiger, burning bright.
</P>
<P>
   Two magnificent athletes, clearly a breed apart. One a powerful,
four-legged thoroughbred. The other a sleek, hungry cat.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods wins the Motorola Western Open _ his third victory
in his past four tournaments _ and regains his status as the
world's No. 1-ranked golfer. And we know what that means.
</P>
<P>
   Tigermania is back. Just in time for the British Open. Maybe
just in time for golf to nose its way back in front of the X Games
on the radar screen of our sports consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   A market study recently revealed that in 1998 the interest of
Americans in golf fell back to traditional levels. In other words,
the same consistent, solid _ and high-income demographic _ level
that it had enjoyed for roughly three decades until Tiger kicked
open the doors and let in the masses. The reason was plain and
simple. So many of those instant converts, who had just learned to
tell a birdie from a bogey, believed their man would treat every
golf course like Augusta National and every tournament like the
1997 Masters, taming it, beating it, body-slamming it into
submission to win by, oh, a dozen shots.
</P>
<P>
   That was Tiger's amazing margin of victory at the '97 Masters _
12 shots _ and it not only captured worldwide attention but also
made many of the fans, new and old to the sport, think it was
always going to be that easy.
</P>
<P>
   It probably made Tiger believe that as well. Made him think he
could step up to the first tee every Thursday and dominate through
the 72nd hole on Sunday. But in 1998, he managed only one win on
tour and no major titles. And the excitement fizzled out like the
fuse on a wet firecracker.
</P>
<P>
   While Tiger groused and fumed and tried to figure it out, the
masses who are quickly bored these days looked elsewhere for their
special-event fix. This is an audience _ and a society _ that wants
its hits to be loud and big like Star Wars and its memorable
moments able to be placed in the microwave, zapped and served on
demand.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of instant gratification, America doesn't want to be
told that the McGwire-Sosa home-run race might happen only once in
a generation or a century, and it doesn't want to hear _ or even
think _ that the mighty Tiger can't devour every single golf
tournament like it was a slab of raw meat. There is SportsCenter to
fill with highlights every night, and there are TV spots for Nike
and all the rest to tell us that Tiger isn't just a cut above _
he's entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   With his good looks, youth, beaming smile, sinewy muscles and
immense talent, Tiger fills the bill on all counts. He has not only
the ability to play the game but the charisma to transcend the
game, taking what is still a monied sport and delivering it to
every street corner of every town in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the linear descendant of Michael Jordan in terms of
marketable sports figures, an icon for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Unflashy Tim Duncan uses solid fundamentals to be named Most
Valuable Player of the NBA Finals, and it's like watching a master
carpenter build a cabinet. Polite Pete Sampras wins his sixth
Wimbledon title, and it's, well, good tennis.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Fourth of July, Tiger takes his third win in four
times out _ the only miss when Payne Stewart's putter comes up big
at the U.S. Open _ and the air is suddenly filled with color and
cannon fire and sparkling possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the measure of a megastar is whether he can draw
attention even when there is no real competition. We used to tune
into basketball games with Jordan just to see if he could dazzle us
with some new move, even if it was in a 30-point rout of Denver.
Now we stay glued to the TV to watch Tiger, even when he can
virtually do the backstroke with a final-round 71 and still win by
a comfortable three shots.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the way he attacks those drives, roaring like a Tiger.
It's in the way he gets himself out of trouble, in the rough or in
a bunker, with one of his trick shots. It's in the way he takes us
with him on an emotional roller-coaster ride. He pumps his fist
when celebrating. He throws his clubs when aggravated. He smiles
like the boy next door. He curses like a sailor.
</P>
<P>
   But he demands our attention. Oh, there are complaints that he
gets too much of it, from the TV networks, from newspapers. Maybe
some of it is still rooted in racism. Maybe some of it comes from
knowing you can't get away, can't take your eyes off him.
</P>
<P>
   Tigermania. Hear the roar.

ANALYSIS: PAKISTANI'S PULLOUT VOW IS A VERY HARD SELL AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS to insert new 3rd and 4th grafs on Sartaj Aziz)  (See also INDIA-PAKISTAN-PUNJAB) 
(nk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan _ Once he gets home from his Washington
tete-a-tete with President Clinton, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif is likely to find it difficult to deliver on his pledge to
the Americans that he would seek to withdraw Pakistani-backed
forces from the Indian side of the cease-fire line in the disputed
territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Few in Pakistan saw Sharif's sudden decision to call on Clinton
on Sunday _and his promise to take ``concrete steps'' to restore
the cease-fire line _ as a breakthrough that would help end a
limited, undeclared war with India. Rather, the moves were viewed
by most Pakistanis either as a sell-out of the Kashmir cause or
another ill-fated move in a diplomatic game of chess.
</P>
<P>
   Already Monday, Pakistan's foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz, seemed
to be giving Sharif a way to avoid withdrawal. He told the BBC that
it would be difficult for Pakistan to persuade the Islamic
militants to pull out of Indian-held Kashmir unless the status of
Kashmir was put back on the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, he said Monday in Washington, ``they would
not obviously respond to our appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition political parties sharply criticized Sharif on Monday
for apparently giving away what they believe to be hard-won
military gains in Kashmir for nothing much in return.
</P>
<P>
   The main Islamic opposition group, the Jamaat-e-Islami party,
which is known more for its street power than its voting strength,
called for rallies all over the country on Tuesday to protest what
it called the prime minister's treasonous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic militants fighting in Kashmir _ whom Sharif has all
along said Pakistan does not control _ denounced the deal and vowed
that they would not withdraw from the mountain peaks on the Indian
side of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure whether Nawaz Sharif or even the military have
the influence to get the mujahedeen to withdraw,'' said Rifaat
Hussain, a professor of international relations at Quaid-I-Azam
University in Islamabad. ``They do get support from Pakistan, but
that doesn't mean they're willing to do Pakistan's bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Political experts also questioned whether Sharif, who has
quickly backed away from other unpopular decisions, would have the
political will to insist on a withdrawal if it cost him dearly with
the powerful military establishment, Islamic fundamentalist groups
and the Pakistani people, who for the most part revere the forces
in Kashmir as freedom fighters battling for the rights of Kashmir's
Muslim majority.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of a visit to Pakistan by Clinton would not be
enough to sell a pullout, the experts said. Rather, Sharif would
need a reciprocal withdrawal of Indian forces from the Kargil and
Dras sectors of Kashmir, where fighting has raged for two months,
or the strong prospect that India _ under pressure from the United
States _ would seriously talk about settling the Kashmir conflict
once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   But India, which maintains that Pakistan has been a devious
aggressor in this conflict, reiterated Monday its unequivocal
position that the invaders must withdraw before India will talk
about any issue.
</P>
<P>
   And a day after its military triumphantly claimed victory in
recapturing the strategic Tiger Hill ridge, an observation point
overlooking a crucial supply route, India was in no mood for
compromise. Asked if there was an acceptable timetable for a
Pakistani pullout, Raminder Singh Jassal, spokesman for India's
Foreign Ministry said, ``Yes, there is a time frame, which is
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   India, whose army turned to another large operation in Kashmir
on Monday, attacking positions in the Batalik sector, also plainly
stated that there is no role for the United States in settling the
dispute. And Washington, for its part, has reaffirmed its long-held
position that it cannot serve as a mediator on Kashmir until India
requests American help.
</P>
<P>
   The festering, periodically violent conflict over Kashmir dates
to 1947, when the two nations were created from the British Raj.
Predominantly Hindu India claims Kashmir as one of its states,
while Pakistan says the Muslim-majority territory should have the
right to choose whether to be part of Pakistan or India.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations have fought two wars over Kashmir, in 1947 and
1965, and the fighting this year is the most serious in almost 30
years. It is the first that has threatened to explode into
full-fledged war since India and Pakistan became declared nuclear
weapons states a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Already Monday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz seemed to
be giving Sharif a way to avoid withdrawal. He told the BBC that it
would be difficult for Pakistan to persuade the Islamic militants
to pull out of Indian-held Kashmir unless the status of Kashmir was
put back on the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
   India scoffs at such statements because it says the men fighting
in Kashmir are mainly Pakistani army regulars. But even if the
fighters are Pakistan-backed militants who refuse to leave, it
seems that the Sharif government could eventually force them to do
so by cutting off their food and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Majid Nizami, 70, chief editor of the Lahore newspaper The
Nation as well as a friend and sometimes critic of the Sharif
family, said he believed that there would be no withdrawal because
the Kashmir cause is too close to the heart of most Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it won't be implemented because it would be political
suicide for Nawaz Sharif,'' he said. ``He will come home and say,
`I'll try to persuade the mujahedeen to come back.' After a month
or two, there will be the rainy season in Kargil. In areas the
mujahedeen have held, they will stay if they can. If not, because
of weather, they will retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether Pakistan's military, which has
repeatedly usurped civilian authority in the last 50 years, would
back Sharif's withdrawal plan. Some experts believe he consulted
top military officers about his Washington strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But others worry that powerful elements in the military will not
tolerate a unilateral withdrawal from Kashmir and fret about the
possibility of a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community has to be very careful about the
demands it makes on Nawaz Sharif at this time,'' said one political
expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Several retired senior military officers lashed out Monday at
Sharif's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply succumbed and surrendered to the U.S. and to India
and deprived the mujahedeen of whatever advantage they had hitherto
gained,'' said the former army chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam
Beg.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Hameed Gul, also retired, said, ``It is a total
sell-out.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CINCINNATI _ The Astros still don't have an answer for Ron Villone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cincinnati's reborn lefthander continued his mastery of the
Astros on Monday as the first-place Reds moved one game ahead of
Houston in the National League Central with a 5-2 victory at
Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Villone a few times, and that's not the same Villone
I've seen before,'' Astros interim manager Matt Galante said after
his team split a four-game series with the Reds. ``I can't explain
it. There are a lot of things in baseball that can't be
explained.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the rest of the NL must be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Villone (4-2) picked up his third consecutive win, two of them
against the Astros. In his last three starts, Villone has held the
Astros to one hit, limited Arizona to one hit in a game that
featured 17 strikeouts by Randy Johnson, and allowed the Astros two
runs and six hits through seven innings Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He threw 100 pitches in sweltering heat that reached 154 degrees
on the artificial surface at game time. Villone had a streak of 21
scoreless innings _ second-longest in the majors this season _
snapped when Matt Mieske hit a two-run homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros played without scheduled starting pitcher Mike
Hampton, who was scratched two hours before game time because of a
strained left wrist. The loss of Hampton was a setback for the
Astros, who have lost only twice in his last 16 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Holt, pitching on three days' rest, made the emergency
start and allowed five runs and 10 hits in 5 innings. Joe Slusarski
made his Astros debut, allowing one hit in 1 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm felt great. I was completely ready,'' said Holt, who
was told late Sunday he might be needed to pitch a day ahead of
schedule. ``It didn't bother me to come back one day earlier. It
was easy to get loose, especially in that heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a couple of strides. It may not look good in the box
score, but I went after hitters, and that's what I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros wasted several early scoring opportunities and were
1-for-9 with runners in scoring position. They left a runner at
second in the second inning and stranded runners at second and
third in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a shot or two early and didn't get it done,'' Galante
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati wasted no time in getting it done, scoring once in
the second inning and twice in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin singled with one out in the second, and Aaron Boone
singled to right-center. Mike Cameron then reached on a fielder's
choice as Larkin scored from third base.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds got four hits in the third inning, including RBI
singles by Greg Vaughn and Boone, who had three hits for the second
straight day.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati went up 5-0 in the sixth when Cameron sent a 2-0
pitch from Holt over the right-field wall with Boone on base.
</P>
<P>
   Holt said he implemented some of the strategy discussed in a
film session last week with Galante and pitching coach Vern Ruhle.
But it wasn't enough to prevent him from suffering his ninth loss
in 10 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One and nine is not a good pitcher. Even though I'm a 1-9
pitcher, I'm capable of doing better,'' Holt said. ``I could easily
be a lot better than that. Some crazy things have been going on
this year. I've just got to change this luck around.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Villone has done. The Reds gave him a chance to
become a starter last month after 162 career relief appearances but
considered sending him back to the bullpen only two weeks ago after
three bad outings.
</P>
<P>
   Since suffering a first-inning knockout against Milwaukee on
June 19, Villone has been almost untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a change of scenery will help a guy out,'' Astros
first baseman Jeff Bagwell. ``We used to have a guy (in relief)
named Curt Schilling who's doing pretty good as a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Graves pitched the ninth for his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are 8-3 against the Astros, and the teams don't meet
again until the final week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After losing three pitchers _ Sean Bergman, Brian Williams and
Hampton _ while splitting a four-game series with the Reds, the
Astros have to feel fortunate to come away trailing by only one
game.
</P>
<P>
   But Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon believes his club has left an
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (the Astros) went back home realizing, `These
guys can play with us. We're not running away with this thing,'''
he said.

SOUNDING SIREN TO END CAR CHASES 
</HEADLINE>

 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until about three years ago, Liz Rice hardly ever noticed the
terrible stories in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Some kid boosts a car and the cops chase him and he runs a
couple of red lights and ``bam'' _ somebody dies.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day, that somebody was Jennifer Lynn Rice.
</P>
<P>
   She was 23 years old and engaged to be married. Early on the
morning of Sept. 8, 1996, she was heading to her parents' house to
have breakfast with them.
</P>
<P>
   They were close that way.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer had no idea that two teenage boys had stolen a car in
north Phoenix, then raced away from a Maricopa County sheriff's
deputy after he tried to pull them over.
</P>
<P>
   The boys had been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Their car was doing 80 mph when it shot through a red light at
Bell Road and 40th Street, crashing into Jennifer's car.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, detectives arrived at the home of Bob and
Liz Rice, knocked on the door, and handed Liz her daughter's bloody
purse.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing since has been the same.
</P>
<P>
   Those newspaper articles Liz barely used to notice now whack her
in the gut like a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened last week. &QL; 
POLICE PULL BACK
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old and a 16-year-old jumped in a van outside a
Scottsdale deli and were spotted by police. There was a brief
chase, but then police pulled back. They do that now.
</P>
<P>
   If a helicopter is available, police use it to keep tabs on the
punks, who always drive too fast on streets filled with too many
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   This time the van made it all the way to Osborn Road and 16th
Street in Phoenix, where it plowed into a car driven by 26-year-old
pastry chef Dion Ybarra, father of a 3-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since her daughter's death, Liz Rice has seen too
many of these stories.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was the young offenders who got her attention.
There were two boys in the car that killed Jennifer. One died of
injuries from the crash. The other was sent to a juvenile detention
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Liz went on a crusade to have underage criminals charged as
adults. They are now. The driver who killed Dion Ybarra could be
tried as an adult for murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, while I think that's a good thing, that we should try
kids as adults, I think it's even more important that we step back
a minute and look at the bigger picture,'' Liz said. ``Why do we
chase these kids at all?''
</P>
<P>
   She knows the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say if we announced there would be no pursuits
whatsoever, thieves would declare open season on automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, not many people in law enforcement believe juvenile
car thieves care one way or the other. &QL; 
A FEW OPTIONS
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately,'' Liz said, ``we have to ask ourselves if it's
worth it. Are the risks acceptable? Once a kid steals the car,
there are only so many things that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There's escape, of course.
</P>
<P>
   There's capture.
</P>
<P>
   There's the body of Jennifer Rice.
</P>
<P>
   And of Dion Ybarra. And of whoever's next.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also the families, like mine,'' Liz said. ``Every day
we face the reality of a daughter who's not there, who's never
going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer's fiance recently moved out of state. Even after three
years, the memory of what happened to the woman he planned to marry
was just too much for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great young guy and he's trying hard, but his life
isn't what it was supposed to be,'' Liz said. ``He's having a real
hard time dealing with that. And what about the kids who commit
these crimes? They didn't start out to be killers. Most of them
probably never would have become killers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no good options here.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, we either have a thief on the loose with a hot
car, or we have a killer in custody and a corpse.
</P>
<P>
   I know which one Liz Rice would choose. &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER:   THE FINAL SHOWDOWN ON INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The right to love and live with the person we choose is
fundamental to the concept of freedom. But laws that made it a
crime to marry, live with or have sex with someone of a different
race restricted that freedom over much of the country for more than
three centuries. Laws against interracial marriage were enforceable
in 17 states when the Supreme Court declared them invalid in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The old Confederacy did its best not to comply. Two states _
South Carolina and Alabama _ actually reached the '90s with the
invalid prohibition inscribed in their constitutions. South
Carolinians voted to expunge the bigoted language in 1998. The
Alabama legislature approved a similar referendum last month, and
its sponsor, Rep. Alvin Holmes, is struggling to get it on the
ballot as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Modern liberals typically see the Southern obsession with
interracial sex as a product of Confederate hysteria. But during
the Civil War and Reconstruction, Northern abolitionists like
Wendell Phillips, Harriet Beecher Stowe and the madcap Horace
Greeley did much to inflame Southerners about the question of
interracial intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of the Civil War, the notion that racial problems
could be solved only by merging the races had become a standard
abolitionist theme. Phillips, for example, wrote that race-mixing
was ``God's own method of crushing out the hatred of race and
civilizing and elevating the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Greeley, the founder of The New York Tribune, wielded the idea
like a weapon against the South. In a 10-point program for
``miscegenation,'' Greeley wrote: ``The solution of the Negro
problem will not be reached in this country until the public
opinion sanctions a union of the two races. ... As the Negro is
here and cannot be driven out there should be no impediment to the
absorption of one race in another. ...'' Greeley thundered that
``It is the duty of anti-slavery men everywhere to advocate the
mingling of the two races.''
</P>
<P>
   Scandalizing slave owners who had slept with the property,
Greeley sneered that ``Legitimate unions between whites and blacks
could not possibly have any worse effect than the illegitimate
unions that have been going on for more than a century in the
South.''
</P>
<P>
   The abolitionists' enthusiasm for race-mixing drew lengthy
condemnations in Congress. Rep. Samuel Cox of Ohio read Greeley and
Phillips into the record and ridiculed them for wanting to top the
Capitol dome with a brown-skinned statue of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Cox joked about this. But whites in the plantation South took it
seriously. Mixed-race children had become so numerous by 1850 that
the government began to count ``mullatoes'' as a separate category
in the census. In areas of the Cotton Belt where slaves outnumbered
masters by substantial margins, white families sometimes went
``black'' and fell completely across the color line.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that whiteness might be swept away, Southern states
passed laws or amended their constitutions to preserve ``racial
purity'' _ which was laughably futile after 300 years of
interracial sex. Alabama tried to close the door for all time with
a constitutional provision in 1901 that read: ``The legislature
shall never pass any law to authorize or legalize any marriage
between any white person and a Negro, or descendant of a Negro.''
The legislature later went further, making interracial sex a felony
punishable by two to seven years in jail
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court overturned these laws in the 1967 case of
Loving vs. Virginia, which concerned a white man and a black woman
who were arrested for the crime of being married and banished from
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day Alabama has seen nothing so blatant as that. But
Holmes contends that rural judges sometimes make it difficult for
interracial couples to marry even today. He expects the referendum
to pass, but not by a landslide, given the state's history of
intense commitment to segregation. But as in other Southern states,
Alabama elections are sometimes decided by progressive whites and
blacks voting as a bloc. This was the case in the last
gubernatorial election. When the issue of interracial marriage
comes up for a vote, Americans will know how much of Alabama is
trapped in the past and how much has arrived in the present.

FIREWORKS EMPLOYEE WHO SUFFERED BURNS IN PEORIA ACCIDENT DIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   A fireworks expert, severely burned while she set up displays
for a Fourth of July celebration in Peoria, died Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators still don't know what caused the explosion that
injured four of her co-workers just hours before the annual
celebration was set to begin at the Peoria Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real mystery right now,'' said Mike Tellef, a spokesman
for the Peoria Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The accident canceled the fireworks event, which was expected to
draw more than 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Galanda, 36, of Moorpark, Calif., was burned over 95
percent of her body and died Monday morning at the burn unit at
Maricopa Medical Center. Two co-workers also were severely burned.
One was in good condition, but the other was in critical condition
late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks began exploding Sunday about 5 p.m. as a crew from
Lantis Productions Inc., a Salt Lake City fireworks company, began
unloading them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fireworks may have gone off right at their feet,'' said
Larry Bettendorf, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms. About 15 investigators from the federal
agency lent their expertise to Peoria officials to try to find out
what sparked the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Bettendorf said Lantis workers had dug several trenches and set
up a big steel tube to hold the fireworks once they were hooked up
to a control board.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said they heard 50 to 60 explosions as some families
set up blankets and ice chests about 400 yards from the display for
pre-fireworks picnics.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, more than 20 local and federal investigators slowly
swept through the field for unexploded fireworks. The task is slow,
Tellef said, adding that investigators won't even reach the
explosion's site until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, investigators may be able to determine if human
error or some mechanical malfunction, including static electricity,
sparked the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Lantis had 1,074 shells set to explode Sunday night, Tellef
said. About 150 to 200 pounds of them remained in a truck near the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators interviewed two Lantis workers who weren't
seriously injured and also talked to several Peoria workers who
were near the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   They have not yet been able to talk to the surviving burn
victims at Maricopa Mecical Center: Jeff Fraizer, 36, of
California, who remained in critical condition; or Joyce Gyorffy,
of Newbury Park, Calif., who is in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are trained, they are professionals, they do this
for a living,'' Tellef said. ``So, we just don't know what caused
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lantis officials were not not available for comment Monday, said
a woman who answered the phone at their Salt Lake City
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which staged last year's show in Peoria, also has
set fireworks off at Los Angeles, the Aloha Bowl and in fireworks
competitions across the country.
</P>
<P>
   On the company's Internet web site, it says Lantis uses
``trained, state-licensed pyrotechnicians and laser artists who
adhere to strict standards of safety and professionalism.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Before game time, Los Angeles Sparks coach
Orlando Woolridge wrote a message for his team: Great intensity
from the start. The Sparks did not seem to act on the suggestion
until late in the second half, but at least they rallied and edged
the Cleveland Rockers 74-72 before 5,947 on Monday night at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   With just under four minutes remaining, Mwadi Mabika, who was 1
of 7 in the first half, sank two 3-pointers in 0:34 seconds to give
the Sparks a 71-69 lead. Later, Cleveland's Alisa Burras, who
finished the game with 16 points, made only one of two free throws
to recapture the lead for the Rockers at 72-71.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles reserve center Nina Bjedov, who scored 12 of her 14
points in the second half, made a 14-footer with 1:24 left to give
the Sparks the lead (at 73-72), which they clung to for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cleveland) has some really talented players and on any given
night they can beat any one,'' said Woolridge. ``It (has to be)
business as usual, whether its Houston or Cleveland. There's a
certain way we come to work and we have to come with that certain
frame of mind and not have any letdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamila Wideman's expectations of picking up a win against her
former team fell short. The former Spark, who was traded to the
Rockers for Jennifer Howard in late June, didn't have as much
impact as teammate Eva Nemcova, who was 8 for 8 from the free-throw
line and finished with 20 points. Wideman played for only nine
minutes and registered two points and one assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to come out and play hard,'' said Cleveland
coach Linda Hill-MacDonald. ``I think we allowed L.A. to come back
and beat us on the boards. That's what really got us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying focused against Cleveland, the last-place team in the
Eastern Conference, proved to be difficult for the Sparks early on.
Fortunately for Los Angeles (8-4), the bench came through.
</P>
<P>
   With this win, the Sparks move into second place in the Western
Conference standings, tying the Sacramento Monarchs, who lost to
the New York Liberty 76-63 on Monday night at Madison Square
Garden.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week construction workers began dismantling the
24-foot-high, 917-foot-wide Edwards Dam on Maine's Kennebec River.
This was an important moment in the struggle to restore the
nation's rivers to good health. It marked the first time that the
federal government had ordered the destruction of a private
hydroelectric dam against the owner's wishes. It could also inspire
the removal of other dams whose environmental costs now outweigh
their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remove the Edwards Dam was 10 years in the
making, and would not have happened without outside pressure and
independent scientific studies underwritten by private groups like
American Rivers and Trout Unlimited. But once the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission _ which regulates the nation's 2,300
nonfederal hydroelectric dams _ studied the facts, the decision was
relatively easy. The dam generated only one-tenth of 1 percent of
Maine's annual energy usage. Removing it would open up the river
for recreation and give nine species of Atlantic fish access to
their traditional spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hydroelectric dams do not produce any of the gases that
contribute to smog or global warming. But some have outlived their
usefulness, and experience suggests that nature benefits when any
dam comes down. A recent study by American Rivers of 12 dam
removals, all voluntarily undertaken by the owners, cites the case
of California's Butte Creek, where four small dams were breached
last year. Chinook salmon runs began to rise.
</P>
<P>
   There should be other success stories soon. The commission has
warned the owners of the Condit Dam on Washington State's White
Salmon River that they may have to build elaborate fish ladders.
The owners are considering removal instead. Meanwhile the utilities
that own the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams, which have virtually
wiped out the salmon populations on Washington state's Elwha River,
have agreed to sell their dams to the federal government, which
awaits only a Congressional appropriation before tearing them down.
</P>
<P>
   This administration has been favorably disposed to dam removal,
but its biggest test lies ahead. It is under a court order to
devise a plan by the end of the year to save endangered salmon runs
in Washington state's Lower Snake River. Many fish biologists say
the salmon will never recover unless Congress agrees to dismantle
four large dams on the river. The fate of these dams, which also
supply cheap power, is an emotional issue in the Pacific Northwest,
and several members of the House are trying to block removal as an
option. As with the Edwards Dam, the administration should go where
the science takes it.

<P>
   Two years after Hong Kong was returned to China, the
independence of its courts has been breached. At the behest of Tung
Chee-hwa, the man Beijing chose to be the territory's chief
executive, the mainland's legislature last month overturned an
important immigration ruling by Hong Kong's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   China's action does not technically violate its agreement with
Britain on the special status of Hong Kong. That permits the
mainland legislature, under certain circumstances, to ``interpret''
decisions by Hong Kong courts. But by inviting China to invoke this
right, Tung has undermined confidence that the territory's judicial
independence can survive.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Hong Kong's high court broadly interpreted a
law giving children of Hong Kong residents a right to move there.
China objected that this could mean more than a million additional
immigrants over the next decade, straining Hong Kong's social
services. In striking down the court ruling last month, the
mainland legislature imposed narrower eligibility standards. How
many people would actually have immigrated under the court's
interpretation, and when, is unclear. China's estimates may be
unrealistically high. It would have been wiser for Tung to see if a
serious problem actually developed before taking such a drastic
step as inviting mainland intervention.
</P>
<P>
   China has so far meddled less crudely in Hong Kong affairs than
many critics feared. But the decisive test will be how much
judicial independence Hong Kong can preserve. Hong Kong's impartial
judiciary has been a key to its extraordinary economic success,
with average incomes some 20 times those on the mainland. To
sustain that prosperity Tung must do a better job of protecting
Hong Kong's courts from mainland interference.

DODGERS FALL TO ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Davey Johnson spent 45 minutes before Sunday's win in a
closed-door meeting with his players to talk about the club's
shortcomings, and when everyone emerged the Los Angeles Dodgers
played one of their best games.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers manager can come up with 3,690 more minutes of
invigorating prose and soliloquy, it may be enough to get the
Dodgers back into playoff contention. After all, momentum seems to
last but a day for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, the first half of the season is one game away after
another setback, this one an 8-4 loss to the Rockies in the opener
of a four-game series Monday at Coors Field. The fast-fading
Dodgers are 8-19 in series openers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep going out there and keep playing and give it your
best because you never know if something can pop up like San Diego
and you win 14 in a row,'' Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw said. ``I was
talking to (Colorado's) Lenny Harris before the game, and he said
he couldn't believe we were playing the way we were with our
talent. It doesn't look like this team can win 14 straight right
now, but you keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after Johnson aired his displeasure about the ongoings of
his club, he was ejected for arguing during a five-run Rockies
seventh inning that broke the game open.
</P>
<P>
   More carnage?
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's to the point where the Dodgers can't even count on ace
Kevin Brown, who lost his second straight start for the first time.
Brown (9-6) allowed six runs on 11 hits in 62/3 innings and has
given up 15 runs on 22 hits in his past two starts. For the second
straight start, Brown wasn't around after the game.
</P>
<P>
   The last-place Dodgers (35-45) are again 10 games under .500,
and if losing seven of eight isn't indicative of their play, try
losing 10 of 13 _ or 19 of 26. During the string, the Dodgers have
scored more than five runs just eight times. They were 1 for 10
with runners in scoring position against Rockies starter Darryl
Kile (5-6) and two relievers, and the consistently close games
takes a burden on the pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a pitcher throw more pitches, you're much more
careful,'' Dodgers pitching coach Claude Osteen said. ``It's even
to the point where if you get ahead in the count, you re-check the
strike zone and it makes you pitch much more careful. It wears on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Dodgers certainly don't handle well is adversity,
which manifested itself in the seventh inning. They folded and the
Rockies, mired in their own slump of having lost 10 of 12, attacked
and took control.
</P>
<P>
   The inning's turmoil began when Brown threw errantly to first on
a pickoff attempt, which led to a Neifi Perez RBI double. A batter
later, Darryl Hamilton grounded to first and, with Brown covering,
was ruled safe on a close play. Brown argued, Johnson followed, and
he was tossed by first base umpire Bob Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him touch it from where I'm at,'' Johnson said. ``He's
going to call him out and has a brain cramp and calls him safe. He
said (Brown) missed the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was pulled and Dante Bichette and Vinny Castilla followed
with two-run singles, both while behind in the count, to give the
Rockies an 8-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi batted with one out
and runners on third earlier in the game and neither could get the
run in. Mondesi hit a trickler in front of the plate and Sheffield
struck out. Instead of possibly tying the game, the Dodgers trailed
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Sheff in a situation with second and third and one out
and we didn't get a run in,'' Johnson said. ``We have to get a
run... It's the difference, the little things.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Paging Dr. Harding.... Paging Dr. Harding.
</P>
<P>
   It might be time to bring in Los Angeles Dodgers team
psychiatrist Herndon Harding to try to make sense out of what's
become of pitcher Chan Ho Park. No one else can.
</P>
<P>
   Park's fastball is in the mid 90s, his curve has plenty of bite
and yet his results are brutal. Even Park himself admits his 4-7
mark and gaudy 6.19 ERA are more a product of his mind than his
arm. Everyone else seems to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all mental,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``If
you think you can hit a guy, you hit a guy. If you think you can
get him out, you get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, one of the more cerebral managers, was asked if a
psychiatrist could help a player shake a funk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it. Absolutely,'' Johnson said. ``Whether it was
Frank Robinson talking to himself in the on-deck circle so he knew
what he was going to do before he got to the plate.... When you
picture what you're going to do, it's easier to do. You can talk to
yourself, just don't talk too loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Park was the Dodgers' No. 2 starter who would complement ace
Kevin Brown. But Park last won on May 26, and in his six starts
he's allowed 32 earned runs in 32 innings. Since being suspended in
early June, Park is 0-4 with a 10.71 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful Park (he's 26) has outside influences working
against him, which he hasn't handled well. He's the biggest sports
star in his native Korea, a pressure he realizes, and he's got a
contract to think about. Though he's eligible only for salary
arbitration after the season, he said he was affected by long-term
contract talks during the first month of the season. He's never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's letting everything affect him,'' Johnson said. ``Part of
it's experience. You have to be able to put that shield over him.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Dodgers are hoping _ nearly on blind faith, the way
things have gone _ is that Park turns it around soon, as he did a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Park went 7-5 with a 4.76 ERA before the all-star break in 1998.
He was 8-4 with a 2.78 ERA after the break. In his career, Park is
17-12 with a 3.94 ERA before the break and 17-10 with a 3.31 ERA
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concentration thing with him,'' pitching coach Claude
Osteen said after Park threw a bullpen session. ``He admits it.
Last year he thought negative things out on the mound and replaced
them with positives. He's not been able to do that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Park is slated to start the series finale against the Colorado
Rockies on Thursday afternoon. Of course, this might not be the
best place for him to begin a turnaround. He's 1-1 with an 11.57
ERA at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Watch your head: Now this is when you know things aren't going
well. Jason Repko, the Dodgers' top pick in last month's amateur
draft, missed the last week after suffering a mild concussion when
he was hit with a baseball _ thrown by one of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Repko, a shortstop playing with Great Falls (Mont.) in the
Pioneer League, was knocked out on a peculiar play. Center fielder
Shane Victorino fielded the ball and attempted to throw home, only
to hit Repko in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Repko, who's hitting .318, is expected to miss another few days.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Johnson said shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek, who went 1 for 2 in four innings in his third day of
rehabbing with Single-A San Bernardino, probably won't rejoin the
club until it returns home Friday for three games against
Seattle.... Reliever Antonio Osuna could begin a rehab with San
Bernardino as early as today.... Third baseman Adrian Beltre
returned to the lineup after missing two games with a strained left
groin.... Right fielder Raul Mondesi, who left Sunday's game with
tightness in his right leg, started against the Rockies.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was announced Monday that Nomar Garciaparra
of the Boston Red Sox was voted by the fans as the starting
shortstop for the American League for next week's All-Star Game in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In a close vote, it was Garciaparra who edged out New York's
Derek Jeter and Cleveland's Omar Vizquel.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an early season knee injury has made fans forget about
Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, whether it was his intention or not, sent a powerful
message back to the fans with his hitting display as the
homer-happy Mariners' led the suddenly-homesick Angels 8-0 after
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's message: He still is one of the elite shortstops in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' shortstop of the present and future homered twice
and singled in providing the 36,987 fans at Edison International
Field with some pre-and postgame fireworks. Rodriguez, whose third
and fifth inning solo homers were his 15th and 16th of the season,
had a lot of help from some familiar names.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., who will make his 10th All-Star appearance next
week, also homered _ his 28th _ as did Edgar Martinez, Russ Davis
and John Mabry.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of Seattle's third six-homer display this season
were spot starter Shigetoshi Hasegawa, recent Triple-A Edmonton
call-up Jarrod Washburn, and reliever Al Levine. Hasegawa, a key
middle reliever/setup man for the Angels, got the ball in place of
injured starter Tim Belcher on Monday night. He was gone after 21/3
innings _ giving up long balls to Griffey, Martinez (a 430-foot
blast to left-center) and Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed Washburn was tagged by Russ Davis (his 17th) and
Rodriguez. And Mabry took Levine off the wall in right-center field
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The six homers allowed by Angels pitchers were the most since
the club allowed eight to Oakland on June 27, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's one-sided effort is the fourth such home showing by
the Angels. Anaheim, now nine games behind Texas in the American
League West, was outscored 32-5 in three straight home losses to
the Rangers last week.
</P>
<P>
   While Seattle added to its already well-documented reputation as
a team of run-producers, the Mariners also had to be pleased with
the outing of once-struggling left-hander Jeff Fassero. He struck
out eight Angels while surrendering just three hits over the first
72/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' only early sniff at a rally came in the second
inning. Steve Decker, making a rare start at the designated-hitter
spot, singled to open the second and Troy Glaus followed with a
walk. Matt Walbeck singled sharply to right field one out later.
While Decker was being held at third base by coach Larry Bowa,
Glaus wandered too far off of second base.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Mabry's throw home was cut off by first baseman
David Segui, who then caught Glaus and threw to Rodriguez for the
inning's second out. Gary DiSarcina struck out to end the inning
and the Angels' only threat to that point.

DiSARCINA FINDS HITTING STROKE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina appears to be
finding his rhythm at the plate since returning to the lineup after
missing three months with a broken left forearm suffered in spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting .182 (4-22) in his first eight games, DiSarcina
went 5 for 12 during the Angels' three-game weekend series in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My swing is coming around. I'm still in survival mode,''
DiSarcina said.
</P>
<P>
   Rest for the weary: Omar Olivares' complete-game, five-hitter in
Oakland could turn out to be a huge lift to the Angels and their
fatigued bullpen in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim started right-hander Shigetoshi Hasegawa (his first
start since Sept. 27, 1997) on Monday night against Seattle in the
opener of a three-game set. Hasegawa has been the Angels middle
reliever and setup man since the '98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to stay out there, Olivares said of his 5-2
win at Oakland on Sunday. ``We needed an outing like that to give
our bullpen a rest. With Shige going, that makes it a little bigger
right there...''
</P>
<P>
   The Kid hits 10: Seattle's Ken Griffey was selected to his 10th
All-Star Game on Monday. The Mariners center fielder was named one
of three American League outfield starters along with Cleveland's
Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton.

WASHINGTON TALK: IN SHADOW OF REPUBLICANS' DOLE, DEMOCRATS SEEK A
WOMAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Calif., Md., N.H., N.Y., Wash.)    (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The name game always starts with Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, which is no surprise. With her high profile and decades
of political experience, Feinstein, a D-Calif., has long been
considered a credible vice-presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But can the same be said for Rep. Nita M. Lowey, a Westchester
Democrat little known outside New York? Or Sen. Mary L. Landrieu,
D-La., with all of 2 1/2 years in national politics? Or Lt. Gov.
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland, who plays second fiddle in a
state that is a pivotal battleground for little except soft-shell
crabs?
</P>
<P>
   All these names, plus those of many other women, dance in and
out of conversations about what Vice President Al Gore might do
when it comes time _ assuming he wins the Democratic nomination for
president _ to choose a running mate for the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the early, undoubtedly ephemeral buzz about Democratic
vice-presidential possibilities is thicker with women than at any
other time since 1984, when Geraldine Ferraro actually made the
ticket, not to mention history. Any decision by Gore is political
eons away, but the degree and range of the chatter about women is
telling, an outgrowth of both the panic among Democrats about
Gore's poll numbers with women and the absence, despite decades of
advances for women in politics, of a tidy, short list of obvious
female contenders to share the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   With few unassailable choices, many names are mentioned, and the
tree of floated notions branches out in unexpected directions. Rep.
Nancy Pelosi of California stokes interest for being attractive and
articulate, then gets nixed for a liberal voting record. Ditto for
Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, who carries the double whammy of
being an in-law of the Clintons. (Her daughter married Hillary
Rodham Clinton's brother.) For Gore, a candidate trying to get
separation, that might fairly be characterized as a tether.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray of Washington is deemed too anonymous. Sen.
Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, first elected to the Senate in 1998,
gets points for a historic last name, but she is still unpacking
her bags.
</P>
<P>
   Into the subsequent gap of possibilities steps Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen of New Hampshire, the lone woman among the meager crop of
Democratic governors. She might give Gore a toehold _ though not
exactly a foothold _ in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Ms. Lowey, who was actually asked by an
interviewer on the Cable News Network a week and a half ago if she
was interested in the job of vice president. (Ms. Lowey ducked the
question, saying she was honored to serve in Congress.)
</P>
<P>
   ``These other names pop up almost by default,'' one dispirited
Democratic aide said. Another added: ``It's pathetic. Other than
Dianne Feinstein, we really don't have one woman who makes any
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of all the gossipy match-making for Gore boils down to the
presence, on the other side of the political aisle, of a candidate
whose name recognition arguably trumps that of all of these
Democrats: Elizabeth Dole, a Cabinet secretary in two Republican
administrations and the former president of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Dole's campaign for the presidency looks like an
increasingly long shot, she could theoretically find herself in
contention for the No. 2 spot on a Republican ticket, a prospect
that gives the shivers to Democrats, who depend on an advantage
among women to win elections.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how decisively these voters would respond to
a female vice-presidential candidate. But some Democrats _
including, of course, the women whose names are being bandied about
_ assume it would have to make some sort of difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if it were the right woman, it would generate more
support,'' Ms. Landrieu said.
</P>
<P>
   Is she that woman? Ms. Landrieu, 43, said she was flattered by
the talk and had the kind of moderate voting record _ restrained on
financial issues, tempered on social ones _ that Gore might deem
prudent. But as the mother of two young children, ages 7 and 2, she
said that a higher office would not make sense for her family right
now.
</P>
<P>
   She chalked up all the chatter to a widespread sense that it is
about time for a second act to Ms. Ferraro. ``I think the pressure
is really building,'' Ms. Landrieu said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feinstein agreed. ``I think it's kind of a natural
progression,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading to her?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to be coy,'' Ms. Feinstein said, ``but I've had no
indication that that's the thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party's desire to hold on to Ms. Feinstein's
Senate seat in the 2000 campaign, which Ms. Feinstein intends to
do, is a potent argument against having her run with Gore. But
there are other reasons. Her husband has had business ties to
China, a fact that would be chum to shark-toothed Republican
researchers. It would also serve as a constant reminder of Gore's
own troubled dealings in that part of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Feinstein, too, slides at least halfway off the list,
leaving space for others. Several Democratic aides swear that Donna
Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, has been
mentioned.

ANGELS FALL TO MARINERS

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixes byline, fixes third graph to say Angels lose 10-0)

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was announced Monday that Nomar Garciaparra
of the Boston Red Sox was voted by the fans as the starting
shortstop for the American League for next week's All-Star Game in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In a close vote, it was Garciaparra who edged out New York's
Derek Jeter and Cleveland's Omar Vizquel.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an early season knee injury has made fans forget about
Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, whether it was his intention or not, sent a powerful
message back to the fans with his hitting display as the
homer-happy Mariners beat the suddenly homesick Angels 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's message: He still is one of the elite shortstops in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' shortstop of the present and future homered twice
and singled in providing the 36,987 fans at Edison International
Field with some pre-and postgame fireworks. Rodriguez, whose third
and fifth inning solo homers were his 15th and 16th of the season,
had a lot of help from some familiar names.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., who will make his 10th All-Star appearance next
week, also homered _ his 28th _ as did Edgar Martinez, Russ Davis
and John Mabry.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of Seattle's third six-homer display this season
were spot starter Shigetoshi Hasegawa, recent Triple-A Edmonton
call-up Jarrod Washburn, and reliever Al Levine. Hasegawa, a key

money _ as much as $900 a month _ on an expensive medication by
compounding it. The announcement seemed to take the FDA by
surprise, coming as it is trying to develop new rules to keep
compounding within certain limits. Officials say they are trying to

   SEATTLE _ Despite the good vibes that Safeco Field's first open
house created Monday, fans, politicians and ballpark officials all
demanded that the Mariners now do their part by producing a winning
team that can make the new stadium a lasting monument to baseball
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today and the July 15 opening game is the first day of their
organizational life,'' said Ron Judd, a member of the Public
Facilities District that oversaw construction of the $517 million
ballpark. ``They need to be focusing on the health and vitality,
the excitement and the energy and the support of the fans. We've
given them the ability to provide the forum to take baseball to the
next level in this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners president Chuck Armstrong, one of the main speakers at
the dedication and ribbon-cutting ceremony, acknowledged that the
team has a responsibility to field a competitive team. And that
includes trying to retain players such as Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best ownership in all of sports and they told me
to do everything we can. We are committed to trying to sign them,''
Armstrong said of Griffey and Rodriguez. ``Ken and Alex have to
want to stay here. We hope they do and we hope they spend the rest
of their careers in a Seattle uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, media reports have uncovered the fact that Mariners
owners have brought up the Griffey and Rodriguez contract
negotiations in an effort to get more public funds to cover about
$100 million in cost overruns on the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Owners have contended that they might not be able to retain
their superstars if forced to pay for the overruns. Both players
are signed through the 2000 season and could then become free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Griffey has said he's unhappy that his name
surfaced in connection with the owners' efforts to use public money
for the overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Because of comments Griffey made Sunday about the situation,
Armstrong spoke Monday with the center fielder's agent, Brian
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comments were taken out of context,'' Armstrong said of
Griffey's rebuke of management. ``I think Ken knows where we stand
and how much we want him to stay here. To the best of my knowledge,
he's not being used as a bargaining chip (on the cost overruns).''
</P>
<P>
   M's owners were noticeably absent from the list of speakers, and
John Ellis, chairman and chief executive officer, was a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he hopes the new stadium will provide the team
with the amount of revenue that makes it possible to sign both
players and compete with bigger market teams like the New York
Yankees, Baltimore Orioles and Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't build a major league ball team, you don't build a
major league ballpark if you're not going to be able to keep you
homegrown players,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ballpark was funded through a combination of public
sources, such as tax increases and lottery proceeds, as well as the
sale of naming rights by the team, the M's will be in charge of
operations and expect the new stadium to be a money maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballpark allows us to have the revenue opportunities that
just were not available in the Kingdome,'' Armstrong said. ``We
know that Major League Baseball is a closed loop system _ for every
winner, there's a loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there's so many nice things in the (new) ballpark, that
fans will come here for the entertainment, the enjoyment and all
the wonderful things that we have. ... Without a new ballpark,
there really wasn't a lot of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope was evident everywhere Monday as 32,000 to 35,000 fans
streamed into the new facility to get their first glimpse of
Safeco. But most hoped the new ballpark would put the team on a
winning track once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Steve Van Luven, R-Bellevue, one of the key
politicians who helped piece the stadium legislation together,
called Safeco Field one of four wonders of the world that now exist
in Washington state along with Mount Rainier, the Space Needle and
Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fifth wonder now,'' he said. ``We wonder how soon
Griffey, Rodriguez and (Edgar) Martinez will bring us a World
Series to Safeco Field.''
</P>
<P>
   Edo Vanni, 81, who played with the old Seattle Rainiers of the
Pacific Coast League, criticized M's ownership for the timing of
their dispute over the cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is separating the fans and you don't like
that,'' Vanni said. ``This town doesn't deserve that. In order to
have a team spirit and get on a winning ballclub, you have to get
them all together. But if they keep on going like they are now,
you're going to get them going in two different directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans also expressed their displeasure with the recent disputes
between the M's owners and the Public Facilities District.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disconcerted with what has been going on with the PFD and
the recent talk about Griffey and A-Rod,'' said Jack Blake, an M's
fan from Burien. ``I'd be outraged, absolutely outraged, if they
blow that. I'm real upset about that whole situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blake wasn't about to let the controversy spoil his first
impressions of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was awestruck,'' he said of Safeco. ``Just glancing in to
the green grass and the atmosphere, I was blown away. I started
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd noted the timing couldn't have been worse when the dispute
with the M's was made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``To bring up the cost overruns and taxpayer dollars since we've
known from Day One it's been controversial doesn't get them any
closer to their goal,'' Judd said.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong said the controversy shouldn't overshadow the
importance of getting an outdoor baseball stadium built after 20
troubled years at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, I wasn't sure if we were ever going to have this
happen,'' Armstrong said. ``But now we have the best ballpark for
the best fans for generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, too, was filled with hope, even as a few boos greeted
him when he stepped up to the microphone at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing a fan can have is apathy,'' Armstrong said.
``These fans are not apathetic. They care passionately about their
ballclub. I welcome their passion and their interest, and I just
hope we can fulfill their trust.''

SAFECO OPEN HOUSE GOES STRAIGHT FOR THE HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After a drive from Tacoma, Desmick Louis and his
mother, Doris, were walking away from a ticket window, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought tickets even before we went inside,'' he said.
``Then we went inside, came out and bought more tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   In the business of baseball, the Mariners' new stadium, the
Guilty Pleasure, had perfect execution Monday: It ran the play to
the heart, avoiding the head.
</P>
<P>
   The Louises were among thousands charmed and awe-struck Monday
by their first viewing of the most expensive playfield ever,
including anything built in the Old Testament or by NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The sunny open house did for the franchise what sunny open
houses are supposed to do in real estate: create impulse buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot prettier than I thought,'' said Russ Tate, a Yakima
native who was with his nephew, Darren Clark, of Grant's Pass, Ore.
They are the kind of baseball fans who haven't been reading the
intimate details of cost overruns and back-room blackmailing that
have been the principal features of the run-up to the July 15
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were in the highest row of the third-base
grandstand. When they looked down, they saw a pristine greensward
surprisingly close. Over their shoulders was a view of a
mountain-draped harbor full of ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will,'' he said, ``be back.''
</P>
<P>
   The franchise is counting on it. They are counting on this park
to be an attraction on its own, for locals as well as tourists, so
that all the baseball missteps and management misdeeds will be lost
behind the romance of old-timey grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   As fig leaves go, it's a dandy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is different from Kingdome baseball, so much so that we
offer some early public-service advisories following the first day
of real crowds that enlivened the steel and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   (DESK NOTE: BOLD-FACE LEAD-IN ITEMS)
</P>
<P>
   Daughters of darkness: On a 70-degree day, young women who came
in shorts and halters and sat in the shade nearly went hypothermic.
In dressing for the Guilty Pleasure, except for all but the warmest
day games in the outfield bleachers, two words of advice: Think
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Getcher Wappler Dopplers here: The hottest selling sidewalk
game-day items will be amateur meteorology kits. If high pressure
prevails, the wind comes from the north, so the upper right-field
grandstands are well-sheltered, comfortable and a best buy. When
low pressure brings in rain from the southwest in April and May,
hunker down in the upper grandstand between first and third bases.
Not only are those seats max-protected, the smoke from your
campfires will be high enough so as not to interfere with many
other spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Roooof! Roooof! The massive carport-on-rails is so fascinating
that watching a game here may prove to be like maintaining eye
contact in a conversation with Dolly Parton: Eventually the mind
and eye drift to questions of engineering, architecture and the
sheer overdoneness of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Itty-bitty-bladder contest winners welcome: Unlike the Kingdome,
which apparently was constructed before the invention of kidneys,
there are so many bathrooms that the only excuse anymore for
wetting oneself will be when Piniella picks up the bullpen phone.
</P>
<P>
   Trying too hard, food division: The ``Ivar dog'' is fried
whitefish in a hot-dog bun. I don't know what I was expecting when
I ordered, but that wasn't it. Coming soon to a stadium kiosk:
Black &AMP; Decker strawberry shortcake.
</P>
<P>
   There was much to be fascinated by Monday, not the least of
which is seeing how a half-billion dollars looks and feels.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Caldwell of Seattle saw more than the tactile and the
visual.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is gives the Mariners more credibility in terms
of a franchise,'' said Caldwell, another upper-grandstand denizen
and longtime Mariners fan who also has been to the new yards in
Denver and Phoenix. ``Until '95, the Mariners were never taken
seriously. Now with this, they can compare with the big boys.''
</P>
<P>
   But Caldwell, long a stadium advocate who was happy to pay the
restaurant taxes for the building, couldn't avoid a cringe when it
came to assessing the owners' recent gambit for more tax money
after promising they would filch no more: ``That seems to me to be
a real boondoggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kinner of Edmonds was more direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real crime what the owners have done,'' he said as he
gazed from the main concourse. ``They led us down the garden
path.''
</P>
<P>
   But will that really affect your enjoyment of Mariners baseball,
Ron?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too old for that,'' he said, laughing. Then he grew
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, actually, it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as with any temptation for which you've overpaid, or
acquired in dubious fashion, it's a guilty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday was for the pleasure. As long as we're thinking
Scottish, a wool sweater and a wee dram would help make the guilt
go away with the cold.

FASSERO FINDS GROOVE; MARINER MATES BELT SEVEN HOMERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's called gripping, and it's slang for
trying too hard, putting pressure on yourself, stressing out.
</P>
<P>
   All those things may have contributed to Jeff Fassero's
struggles. But the literal meaning of gripping played its part,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his last start, Fassero discovered that he'd been
gripping the ball too hard and decided to loosen his hold. He
wasn't rewarded that time, but he was Monday night. The Mariners
left-hander tossed eight shutout innings against the Anaheim
Angels, allowing three hits and striking out 10 in a 10-0 victory
at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   He was boosted by the bombs bursting in air. Before the postgame
fireworks show, the Mariners clubbed seven home runs, matching a
franchise record and setting a new standard for gopher balls by
Angels pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had failed to homer in the first four games of this road
trip. But that wasn't what pitching coach Stan Williams meant when
he offered this two-word summation of the game: ``Welcome back.''
</P>
<P>
   The innings and strikeouts were season highs for Fassero, the
hits a season low. After going the first 80 games without a
shutout, Seattle now has thrown them in back-to-back games for the
first time in three years. John Halama blanked the Texas Rangers
Sunday, and Paul Abbott completed Fassero's masterpiece with a
1-2-3 ninth. The win brought the Mariners within four games of the
American League West-leading Rangers, who lost to Oakland Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting close to where I should be,'' said Fassero, who
improved to 4-8. ``Right now, I'm just trying to carry all the good
parts into my bullpen and then into my next game. I used the last
five innings against Oakland (last Wednesday) and took them into
this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Location was the biggest thing tonight; everything was down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero walked four, but he used his walks wisely: three were to
the most dangerous hitter in the Angels' lineup, Mo Vaughn. He
threw 127 pitches, the most by a Mariner this season, and manager
Lou Piniella couldn't grant Fassero's request to pitch the ninth.
No matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we've been waiting for from Jeff,'' Piniella said.
``He really threw the ball well. The ball had life on it. He used a
good changeup late in the game, and he had a good breaking ball,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   And none of them were gripped too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``His last outing turned it around for him,'' Williams said.
``He was out there squeezing the ball, not pitching nice and
relaxed. When you're squeezing the ball with your hand, your whole
arm tenses up, your whole body tenses up. He'd been laboring trying
to throw the ball, and it took away all his movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels threatened only in the second, when a Matt Walbeck
single should have loaded the bases with one out. But Troy Glaus
overran second on the play and was thrown out, and Gary DiSarcina
fanned to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Mariners had built a 3-0 lead off spot starter
Shigetoshi Hasegawa (1-3), thanks to a solo homer from Ken Griffey
Jr. and Edgar Martinez's two-run shot in the first. For Griffey,
the home run was his 28th of the season and 378th of his career _
exactly halfway to 756, which would eclipse Hank Aaron's all-time
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I don't think about,'' Griffey said. ``I'm
just trying to help our club any way I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and Martinez would have company in the home run parade.
After singling and scoring on Martinez's homer, shortstop Alex
Rodriguez went deep in the third and fifth innings, giving him 16
on the season _ and, no doubt, making a tougher decision for
All-Star manager Joe Torre, who could pick three reserve shortstops
when he chooses the team later this week. Rodriguez had his first
four-hit night of the season and improved his batting average to
.317.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was 2-for-24 before the Rangers series over the
weekend, 9-for-18 since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got to get better,'' he said. ``Tonight was a fine
game for me, but I wasn't feeling as bad as I was doing in Oakland.
I felt pretty good, and I'm beginning to feel a little better at
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Torre decides to put me on the team, I'd be more than
honored to go and represent the American League for my fourth time.
If not, I'll go home and rest my knee for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Another homer came from third baseman Russ Davis, who led off
the fourth with his 17th of the season. In the seventh, John Mabry
hit his first homer in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez added the final blow, a two-run rocket over the
center-field fence that was his 14th of the season.

ANGELS OVERPOWERED BY MARINERS

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The question is who DIDN'T hit a home run for
the Seattle Mariners on Monday night at Edison Field?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are Brian Hunter, David Bell, David Segui and Dan
Wilson. Everyone else in the Mariners starting lineup had at least
one home run against the suddenly homesick Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez each homered twice. Ken
Griffey Jr., Russ Davis and John Mabry also went deep in the
Mariners' 10-0 victory over an Angels team that has been outscored
42-5 in four straight home losses.
</P>
<P>
   The seven home runs by Seattle tied a club record for the third
time. The Angels pitching staff had not allowed this many balls to
leave the yard since it surrendered eight against Oakland on June
27, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what they do,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said of
the Mariners. ``We were putting the ball over the plate too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss sends the last-place Angels (37-44) 9{ games behind
American League West-leading Texas at the halfway point of the
season. To make matters even worse, the Angels once again
surrendered offensively to a veteran pitcher who came to town with
his own mound woes.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Texas' Mike Morgan and John Burkett shut them
down here last week, Seattle lefty Jeff Fassero looked nothing like
the 3-8 pitcher with a 7.21 ERA who started Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero pitched a three-hitter (all singles) over eight innings
and he struck out a season-high 10. Paul Abbott pitched a 1-2-3
ninth inning that met with some scattered boos from some of the
36,987 fans who stuck around for another fireworks show after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time I've seen him dominate a game,''
Collins said of Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, whose starting rotation has been bitten by the
injury bug, gave middle reliever/setup man Shigetoshi Hasegawa the
ball against the potent Mariners. He was gone after 21/3 innings.
He gave up four runs on homers to Griffey (solo) and Martinez
(two-run) in the first inning and Rodriguez (solo) in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were expecting me to throw strikes,'' Hasegawa said. ``I
tried to do that as often as possible. Starting was exciting, maybe
too exciting. It was a good opportunity and a good decision. It
just didn't work out too well.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins was uncertain if Hasegawa would get a second start in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the roster moves, I'm not sure if he'll get that
opportunity,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Triple-A Edmonton call-up Jarrod Washburn surrendered a
fourth-inning homer to Davis and Rodriguez's fifth inning home run.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry homered off of Al Levine and Martinez hit another two-run
shot, this time in the ninth off Mike Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz was sent to Triple-A Edmonton following the game to make
room for tonight's starter, Mike Fyhrie, who will be making his
big-league starting debut.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, seemingly forgotten among elite shortstops these
days, also added two singles to complete a 4-for-5 evening in which
he also scored four runs.

RED SOX KEEP DEVIL RAYS AT BAY
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-DEVILRAYS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The top three batters in the Red Sox
lineup didn't get the ball out of the infield the entire night. The
drowning Jose Offerman struck out four times in a game for only the
third time in 1,073 big-league games.
</P>
<P>
   This, it would seem, was no way to retaliate against a Tampa Bay
Devil Ray team that last week slapped the Sox around for 23 runs in
two nights at Fenway Park. Especially with Nomar Garciaparra, the
newly elected All-Star, playing spectator for the third straight
night.
</P>
<P>
   But in the air-conditioned comfort of domed Tropicana Field,
where the temperature was roughly 30 degrees cooler than the
sizzling sidewalks outside Yawkey Way Monday night, the Sox chilled
the Devil Rays, 4-2, while simultaneously applying a little more
heat to the New York Yankees in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   With Mike Stanley providing the long ball, Troy O'Leary the
rally-starting double and the rookie bottom-feeders in the order
doing the rest, the Sox closed to within two games of the Yankees,
9-1 losers to the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Portugal, who now has one more win against Tampa Bay
(three) than he has against everybody else he has faced (two), gave
the Sox six productive innings, holding the Devil Rays to two runs
on seven hits. His pitches were dancing so much, according to Jose
Canseco, that the All-Star at one point asked the umpires to check
the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had them check the ball because I thought he might be
scuffing it,'' Canseco said. ``But there was nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox managed only two singles over the last five innings.
But by then, Stanley's 10th home run gave the Sox a 1-0 lead in the
second, and O'Leary's double, which extended his hitting streak to
13 games, started the Sox' three-run rally in the fourth, in which
Lou Merloni walked, Wilton Veras delivered an RBI single, and Trot
Nixon came through with a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   After walking Randy Winn to start the seventh, Portugal gave way
to Derek Lowe, who may not be quite ready to close, but still has a
knack for getting big outs with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe had the tying runs on base with none out in the seventh
with three veteran hitters waiting their turn _ Dave Martinez,
Canseco, and Fred McGriff. None of them put the ball in play in
fair territory. Martinez fouled to third baseman Veras, and Canseco
and McGriff went down swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco didn't call for another inspection of Lowe's sinker. The
movement on his pitches is well-known by now, even if this is just
his second full year in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those pitches he threw to Canseco and McGriff went straight
down,'' raved pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``There was no
side-to-side action at all, just straight down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Lowe gave up a one-out single to Wade Boggs, then
hit Bubba Trammell in the elbow with a 1-and-2 pitch. Once more,
Tampa Bay was ripe to tie. Instead, Lowe induced Aaron Ledesma to
roll to Veras, who turned a nifty 5-4-3 double play, ending the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   His work done for the night, Lowe made way for Tim Wakefield to
accept the handshakes that come to the closer when his team wins.
Wakefield pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his ninth save and second in
two nights, and the Sox were winners for the third time in four
games on this 10-game trip that leads to the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe figured to get first call as closer when Tom Gordon had
elbow problems, and that's what happened the first time Gordon went
on the DL. But Lowe scuffled in that role, and when Gordon went
down (and out until mid-August at least), the Sox chucked that idea
and opted to recast Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   They put Lowe back on the timeline Kerrigan mapped out for him
back in January, when he was doing pitcher profiles on his laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the bottom of his profile, I wrote, `Should be a dominant
closer in two years,' '' Kerrigan said. ``People don't understand,
you don't get to be either a starter or a closer overnight. It
usually takes three or four years. John Wetteland scuffled. Jeff
Shaw, he was in the (John) Wasdin role for four years. These things
take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's time will come. In the meantime, he's thriving in the
comfort zone of setup man, allowing just one earned run in his last
11 appearances, for an 0.56 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence goes a long way,'' he said. ``I think I was trying
to do too much early in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   No one did more in the first six weeks of the season than
Offerman, who as late as May 19 was batting a team-best .346. But
his average over the last 41 games is .226 (37 for 164), dropping
his overall average to .284, and he's hitless in his last 16
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The strikeouts have been coming with alarming frequency: the
four Monday night, nine in his last five games, 16 in his last 11.
Three times he was called out on strikes, usually while looking at
a pitch in the vicinity of the outside corner. Most of those
pitches, Offerman maintained, haven't been strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my zone,'' he said, ``and usually those pitches are
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman has been taking the classic approach to trying to snap
a slump, hitting the ball the opposite way. But nothing is falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a slump,'' he said, ``no matter where you hit
it, you hit it right at somebody. (Monday) was the only day I've
felt really bad at the plate. I may be trying to do too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to relax and let it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how hard it would be to relax if the Sox were losing.
But they're not. ``We just find a way to win,'' Lowe said, reciting
a familiar theme. ``It's happened all year, and I don't see it
stopping.''

GARCIAPARRA IS STAR STATER
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-GARCIAPARRA-ALL-STARGAME-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ This wasn't quite the same as JFK taking
Illinois away from Richard Nixon in the dead of a November night in
1960 with the help of some ghost voters in Boss Daley's Chicago.
But after coming from behind to win a position as the American
League's starting shortstop in the 70th All-Star Game, Nomar
Garciaparra of the Red Sox can now stake his own claim on winning
an election that appeared all but lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are shocked, too,'' Garciaparra said to reporters
here Monday night after overtaking both Derek Jeter of the Yankees
and Omar Vizquel of the Indians in becoming one of nine players
voted to start for the American League team next Tuesday in Fenway
Park. ``It's nice, but I'm probably as shocked as you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who trailed Jeter by 30,655 votes in balloting a
week ago and had also fallen behind Vizquel, won by 20,446 votes
over Jeter, with Vizquel trailing by more than 51,000 votes. He
becomes the first Red Sox shortstop to be voted an AL All-Star
starter since 1977, when Rick Burleson nosed out Bucky Dent of the
Yankees by just over 7,000 votes, and the first Sox player to be
elected a starter since Wade Boggs in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn started at first base in the 1996 game for the AL, but
Vaughn replaced the elected starter, Frank Thomas of the Chicago
White Sox, because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody must have stuffed the ballot box for Nomar,'' said
Vaughn with a half-smile before Monday night's Angels-Mariners game
in Anaheim, Calif. ``He was way behind last time I looked. You
never know how those things turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Courtney, public relations manager for Major League
Baseball, said Monday night that while the polls closed June 26, a
large number of votes were not counted until last week. Besides
balloting at the ballpark, fans had the opportunity to vote on the
Internet, at WalMart, and through Pepsi-Cola outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honest truth is, there's no rhyme or reason when the votes
come in,'' Courtney said. ``Some teams will send their votes in
five or six different shipments, while others send more at the end.
They come in sporadically, so they don't follow a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the homestand the Red Sox had at the end helped a
lot, because by then it was a big story. I think (the outcome) was
a little surprising because Jeter had been leading the whole time,
but they were so close, we realized anything could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A story by the Associated Press credited the Red Sox'
``high-tech campaigning'' for shifting the election to Garciaparra,
but the Red Sox only issued one release on their website
(redsox.com), back on June 8, informing fans they could vote on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra laughed at the idea that Boston's huge and
Internet-savvy college-age population wore their computers out
voting for him. ``Yeah, I guess a lot of people got on the Internet
and stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the Cleveland Indians, who lead the majors in
attendance, made the starting lineup. Jim Thome (1,364,692) will be
at first base, and Roberto Alomar (2,793,891) starts at second.
Teammates Kenny Lofton (1,676,595) and Manny Ramirez (1,898,430)
join leading vote-getter Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey became the leading All-Star vote-getter for the fourth
straight year and seventh time overall. Griffey, elected to start
for the 10th consecutive time, got 2,918,055 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the AL starting lineup: Texas' Ivan Rodriguez
(1,897,774) at catcher, Baltimore's Cal Ripken (1,285,728) at third
base, and Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco (1,664,282) at designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who missed his third straight game Monday night
with a strained left groin, was told of his selection during
batting practice by Red Sox publicist Glenn Wilburn. The first clue
that the election had swung his way came when he stood behind the
protective screen at second base and shook hands with close friend
Lou Merloni.
</P>
<P>
   With Fenway Park serving as host for the All-Star Game for only
the third time, Garciaparra is expected to share the role of
hometown favorite with pitcher Pedro Martinez, who will be named to
the 30-man AL squad Wednesday when the reserves and pitchers, as
selected by manager Joe Torre of the Yankees, are announced. A
15-game winner, Martinez is a lock to be selected as the starting
pitcher by Torre, who openly had campaigned for his shortstop,
Jeter, in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is second in the American League in batting with a .372
average, 6 percentage points ahead of Garciaparra, who is third at
.366. The Yankees shortstop is also second in the league in hits
(115) and leads in triples (7) while ranking third in runs (71) and
total bases (192).
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek, look at what he's doing, it's unbelievable,''
Garciaparra said. ``Ask me, I believe he deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was not much concern in New York Monday night. Callers to
New York's all-sports radio station WFAN were more concerned about
the current status of the Yankees than Jeter's non-selection by the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour and a half of calls, only one person, who said
that Jeter was robbed, talked about the situation. Host Richard
Neer responded by comparing the two players' offensive stats and
went on to say that New York fans don't take voting for the
All-Star game as seriously as other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra hit .394 in June, and before reaggravating his groin
injury last Friday night in Chicago, he had extended to 17 games
his season-best hitting streak, one in which he is batting .531 (34
for 64) with four home runs, 10 doubles, and a triple. He has
driven in 14 runs during his streak while scoring nine. He's also
hitting .360 with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice it's here at home,'' he said, ``but I'm concerned
right now about getting healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who met with reporters in New York prior to the Yankees'
game with the Orioles, indicated he had no quarrel with the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation where there are so many great shortstops in
the league, you can pick any one,'' Jeter said. ``If I was voting,
I would have voted for Nomar.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who had started at short for
the AL stars in each of the last two seasons, missed the first
month of the season because of an injury and finished fourth in the
voting, more than 450,000 votes behind Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Indians manager Mike Hargrove added Jeter and
Vizquel as reserves while leaving Garciaparra off the team.
Hargrove was booed loudly in Boston when the Indians came to town a
week later, while Garciaparra finished runner-up in the voting for
the league's Most Valuable Player Award.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, asked how he'd pick among Garciaparra, Rodriguez, and
himself, said: ``Flip a coin, if you can find a three-sided coin.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Jeter said, he would like to have been named starter, but
he noted even that might have had its pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to start,'' he said, ``but that's a Catch-22.
(The game) is in Boston. I don't know what the fans would say.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 38 years since the All-Star Game was played in
Boston. Pitcher Don Schwall was the only Sox player to appear in
that game, and he gave up the National League's only run in a 1-1
tie that was called after nine innings because of rain.

   Five Sox players were on the 1941 AL team _ Joe Cronin, Dom
DiMaggio, Bobby Doerr, Jimmie Foxx, and Ted Williams. Williams won
that game with a ninth-inning home run that is widely considered
the most dramatic moment in All-Star history. Garciaparra almost
certainly won't have a chance to match that feat; with so many
shortstops at Torre's disposal, his night probably will be long
over by the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   But Garciaparra's selection eventually could be worth $1 million
to him. A clause in his contract stipulates that if he is an
All-Star four times in a five-year period that began last year when
he signed his multi-year deal with the club, he will be paid an
additional $500,000 in each of the two option years of his
contract.

IF I WERE THE EDITOR . . . 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `I'm not the editor,'' I was explaining to the questioner in the
audience, ``so . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you were the editor,'' he persisted, ``what would you
do?''
</P>
<P>
   If I were the editor . . .
</P>
<P>
   Well. If by some wholly unforseeable concatenation of
circumstances I became the editor of a newspaper _ not necessarily
(itals)this(unitals) paper, you understand _ the first thing I
would do is make corrections much more conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing errors should be a matter of pride, not embarrassment,
for people in the news business. They deal in a perishable
commodity and have to turn it around on very tight deadlines; of
course they make mistakes. If I were an editor, the paper would
highlight its commitment to accuracy every day by giving
corrections the same prominence as the errors they are meant to
repair. And whenever possible, corrections would appear where the
error appeared: Sports mistakes would be fixed in the sports
section, business mistakes in the business section _ and mistakes
in op-ed columns would be corrected on the op-ed page.
</P>
<P>
   If I were running the paper, reporters would report the news.
Period. They wouldn't provide ``news analysis'' or commentary _
that would be done by analysts and commentators, who would not hold
themselves out as reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The lines would not be blurred: It would be the job of reporters
to tell readers what happened, not what the news means or what
their personal opinion of it might be. News analysts would be
chosen for their expertise _ military developments might be
analyzed by a retired general, for example, or Wall Street's
gyrations by a stock-market scholar. The venting of opinions would
be restricted to editorial writers and columnists, and not just in
the paper, either. There would be a standing rule in my newsroom:
Reporters would not be permitted to jeopardize their reputation for
objectivity by going on TV to pontificate.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of TV: I would cut way back on the amount of newsprint
devoted to reviewing television shows. TV is the enemy of
newspapers, and I feel no obligation to provide publicity for my
enemy. Once upon a time in America, everybody read the paper; in
some cities, readers could choose from four or five dailies, most
of which put out new editions every few hours. Then came
television, and newspapers began their long decline. No TV show
urges couch spuds to turn off the tube and go read a paper. Yet
newspapers are forever coaxing readers to check out the latest
sitcom or HBO special. Here's one editor who won't play that game.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what burning need do TV critics fill? A review can be
indispensable in helping to judge whether a play or movie is worth
the price of admission. But the price of admission to ``Friends''
or ``Mystery!'' is nil. Viewers have no trouble deciding for
themselves which shows they like and which they are happy to miss.
A few hundred harsh words from a theater critic can close a play.
But what impact has a newspaper review ever had on the fate of a TV
series?
</P>
<P>
   If I were the editor, word abuse would be a felony. The use of
impact as a verb would be banned on grounds of ugliness. The
alleged word proactive would be replaced in all circumstances with
active, which is what it means. Diverse would no longer be used as
a synonym for multiracial. And great caution would be taken with
the loaded word reform _ a bill's proponents may hail it as
``education reform'' or ``campaign finance reform;'' reporters and
headline writers may not.
</P>
<P>
   In the right hands, an obituary can be great journalism _
stylish, informative, memorable, compelling. It is a great pity
that American journalists tend to disdain obituary-writing as grunt
work. Our British brethren know better. Here is how the Times of
London began last Friday's sendoff of Viscount Whitelaw:
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Whitelaw was one of the most influential British
politicians of his day. He was also a quintessential Conservative.
Large, ebullient, amiably noisy, and sometimes marvellously
confused in his use of the English language (he once warned against
the dangers of prejudging `the past'), he made friends and disarmed
enemies with remarkable ease. His highly idiosyncratic comments on
life and politics . . . were widely savoured _ none more so than
his celebrated complaint in 1974 that the Labour Party was `going
around the country stirring up apathy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Marvelous! Give me a paper to run and I'll make the obit desk
one of the newsroom's prestige posts.
</P>
<P>
   Something else I'll do: Require stories about opinion polls to
quote the relevant questions. How a poll query is framed can make a
huge difference in the results. A question about ``affirmative
action'' will generate one set of numbers; a question about
``racial preferences'' will generate a very different set. Readers
should be able to glance at a sidebar and learn exactly what was
asked.
</P>
<P>
   I could go on, but this column can't. So one last answer for the
fellow in the audience: If I were editor, job applications from
aspiring reporters with journalism degrees would go to the bottom
of the pile. Journalism isn't a body of knowledge to be learned
from textbooks and lectures. I'd want reporters who made use of
their college years to study something substantial _ history,
anthropology, art, physics. What sets good journalists apart is not
courses in ``Feature Writing'' and ``Enterprise Reporting.'' It is
curiosity, energy, and mental discipline. Got those on your resume?
When I become editor, let's talk.

BALKAN LEADERS' DAYS ARE NUMBERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ Franjo Tudjman, the father of his country, is
77, physically shrunken by cancer, politically diminished by the
corruption and economic malaise in which his nine-year rule of
Croatia has bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   Alija Izetbegovic, the father of his country, is 74 and mentally
exhausted, marking time until he can pass the stewardship of
Bosnia, which is also economically stagnant, to a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, the stepfather of his country and its
best-known alleged war criminal, is only 57, but _ as events of
last week underscored _ he is under intense pressure from growing
numbers of his own people and the governments of the entire Western
world to give up his decade-long control of Serbia-dominated
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for fundamental changes in leadership in one of the
most volatile regions of the world _ changes that will affect the
stability of southeastern Europe and deply influence European and
American ideas of whether it is possible to bring hate-ravaged,
politically under-developed countries into the democratic world.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of the importance of Milosevic's staying or going is
everywhere: On the airwaves, in the councils of the G8, in the
scores of international aid agencies and governments which find
themselves trying, with little success, to put the Balkans back
together again after the shattering of multi-ethnic Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There is less talk of Croatia and Bosnia, even though the
leadership succession in those countries will be crucial to the
future of the region. As the men who led the Croats and Muslims
through their wars for independence pass from the scene, there will
be power shifts and adjustments of alliances throughout the Balkans
regardless of what transpires in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   For while Serbia remains most populous and developed of the
former Yugoslav republics, both Croatia and Bosnia have better
chances to ``join'' Europe, politically and economically _ or to
destroy any hope NATO has left that it can accomplish more in the
Balkans than just keeping people from killing one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the leadership changes, we're going to have difficult
problems,'' says Jacques Paul Klein, an American diplomat and
retired Air Force major general who has filled top United Nations
posts in Croatia and Serbia. ``Until there is democracy in Zagreb
and Belgrade, Bosnia, indeed the whole region, is problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   The current leaders, Klein says, all formed their ideas about
government and administration during a period of orthodox communist
rule and tight central control, and though political parties now
champion nationalism rather than communism, ``on all three sides,
unless you're a party member you don't get a loan, you don't go to
school, you don't open a new business.''
</P>
<P>
   The next good shot at changing this system will come in Croatia,
and not simply because illness is loosening Tudjman's grip.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party, the Croatian Democratic Union, is an
impossibly broad coalition of groups ranging from far left to far
right, held together by Tudjman personally and by the nationalist
sentiments of the struggle for independence. Tudjman's death or
retirement would lead to a struggle between people whose top
priority is integration into the European milieu and those who
still dream of Croatia annexing Herzegovina, the southernmost
region of Bosnia, which has a large Croat population.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons to hope that the Europeanists will win
out.
</P>
<P>
   One is that, under sharp prodding from the US and other
countries, Tudjman's government has revealed its formerly secret
payments to Croat forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Disclosure that
$200 million a year was being siphoned off for this purpose when
the Croatian government is unable to pay pensions or jump-start its
own economy has angered many citizens and alienated them to the
Herzegovina cause.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Foreign Minister Mate Granic, a top-level Croatian
official since 1992 and the odds-on favorite to succeed Tudjman, is
a staunch Europeanist, who said in a recent interview that the
strategic aims of Croatia are membership in the European Union,
NATO, and the World Trade Organization _ goals which are out of
reach until Croatia moves decisively toward liberalism and away
from conflict in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   European nations ``have told the Croats repeatedly that the
basis for normal relations with us was return of the Serb refugees
(to their pre-war homes), freedom of the press, speech and
religion, and . . . forgetting about acquisition of Herzegovina,''
says Albert Rohan, secretary-general of the Austrian Foreign
Ministry, who has been deeply involved in Balkan affairs. ``But in
fact they don't want the return of the Serb refugees and have
obstructed it, efforts to have a free media and reduce corruption
also have failed,'' and territorial ambitions persist among some
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Granic works hard at selling Croatia as the most stable country
in the region, the most welcoming of returning refugees, the most
loyal and helpful to NATO. But, according to a senior cabinet
source, the foreign minister ``is looking to the future'' and is
ready to do what must be done to achieve the coveted organizational
affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is far murkier in Bosnia, where Izetbegovic appears
ready to go _ if he could only find a plausible successor. But with
the country's future relations with Serbia and Croatia unsettled,
and foreigners countries around the world running or influencing
policy at all levels, potential future leaders are laying low.
</P>
<P>
   Izetbegovic ``is tired,'' says Klein, who sees the Muslim leader
frequently. ``He feels he's done his part and that its time for a
new leader to manage privatization, and take a more managerial
approach to administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps saying they can't get local officials to make
decisions, and everything floats up to him,'' Klein says. ``No one
wants to make the wrong move. He in a sense is stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems only one crucial question about the post-Izetbegovic
Muslim leadership: Will it be secular or religious?
</P>
<P>
   At present there is no indication of broad support for a
religious state. Now, as through most of its history, Bosnia's fate
is in the hands of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   A right-wing, annex-Herzegovina swing in Croatia, or a
continuation under a new regime of Tudjman's attitudes on refugee
returns, freedom of speech, and corruption, probably would push the
Muslims away from liberalism and secularism too. So would a
resurgence of support for Milosevic or Serb nationalism. The
Bosnians, with a flexibility born of centuries caught in the
middle, will wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tudjman two or three years ago announced that Croatia was not
part of the Balkans, it was part of central Europe,'' says Jakob
Finci, head of the Soros Foundation's efforts to build an open
society in Bosnia. ``Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland? That is
not so nice. When we decide we are not in the Balkans, we will
declare we are in North America.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's future is hardest of all to divine. It is hard to see
how Milosevic can stay in the face of opposition from the Serbian
Orthodox Church and growing numbers of ordinary citizens as well as
the whole of Europe and much of the rest of the world. But it also
is hard to see how he can go short of an improbable forcible
removal, when that likely would land him in The Hague to stand
trial as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special problem,'' says Klein. ``You have here a
wounded bear with nothing to lose, because he already has lost
everything. The (war crimes) indictment means he can't leave
Yugoslavia and we can't negotiate with him. Yet we have to'' find a
way to get him off the stage ``if we are to bring Serbia and the
Serb people back into Europe.''

CITY'S SCARS FROM ITS SOVIET PAST RUN DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DNEPROPETROVSK, Ukraine _ The house mothers who maintain a
24-hour vigil on every floor of the hotel offer the first clue of
how much hasn't changed here since the Communists were swept out.
</P>
<P>
   They collect and dispense room keys and hand tally long-distance
phone charges, a reminder to anyone who had been here before the
Iron Curtain was lifted of the days when the ``dejournaya'' also
helped the Communist Party keep tabs on guests' comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   There are more reminders in the rooms at the sprawling Hotel
Dnepropetrovsk, which rent for $20 a night if you're from around
here and more than $100 if you're from the West. Shower water flows
from a tube attached to the sink, and cold is typically the only
option. The toilet sometimes flushes, and it always sounds like a
passing train.
</P>
<P>
   A ride around this city, or any other in the now-independent and
democratic Ukraine, dredges up other memories. Of major highways
that are barely paved and have only two lanes, and the thrill of
trying to pass another car before the oncoming truck reaches you.
Of Ladas, Volgas, and other Russian-built cars still clogging the
roads and the air.
</P>
<P>
   When you're out at night, the dearth of street lights seems
romantic at first, offering a clear view of the stars even in major
urban centers. Then you recall what street lights are for as you
try to cross the road, and hope oncoming cars can spot you.
</P>
<P>
   Dnepropetrovsk, an industrial city of about 1.3 million, has its
own special tributes to its dysfunctional Soviet past. Rusting
cranes hover over the rusting skeleton of a hotel whose
construction was launched 30 years ago, and is unlikely to be
completed. Two ends of a bridge reach out from opposite banks of
the Dnepr River, but they never meet. The money ran out before the
span could be completed, and one segment has sunk so deep in the
riverbed it is tough to imagine that it ever will.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lots of things have changed in the decade since the
Soviet Empire collapsed, thanks in part to a seemingly endless flow
of US aid. But the changes are not always for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Prostitutes are everywhere, from hotel doorways to the lush park
that lines the riverfront. So are short skirts, shorter than
anything America saw in the '70s _ or since. And jazz has come to
town, no matter that musicians at the Jazz Cafe don't know any Duke
Ellington tunes and the cover charge is higher than most
pensioners' monthly pension.
</P>
<P>
   The life of a pensioner is different, too: thousands have taken
to peddling cigarettes and candy as rents soar and incomes shrink
in the face of inflation. When they don't have enough, they simply
don't pay the rent, one of many signs of economic distress that
opposition candidates are trying to exploit in the ongoing
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   High-priced apartment houses and restaurants have sprung up
across the country, but the economy now is so sick that half the
apartments remain unsold and the expensive eateries are half-empty.
And that's not the only worry for this nation's new breed of
entrepreneurs: They are also concerned about staying alive, which
is why armed bodyguards have become a standard feature of the
Mercedes, Audis, and other luxury cars visible across the city.
</P>
<P>
   Long lines used to be the surest sign that you were in a
Communist country, but they're tough to find today.
</P>
<P>
   You can find air conditioners and Coke, along with lots of other
consumer items that have transformed life here for those who can
afford them.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want a telephone you can get it within a matter of
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest problem that was solved,'' says Uri Laber,
the American-born president of Optima, a company here that is
involved in everything from telecommunications to real estate
development. ``In the old days it involved paying a bribe or
waiting 30 years.''

PEC CITIZENS VOW TO REBUILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ For seven generations, the Pepa family lived
in a grand, four-story home of hand-hewn stone decorated with
antiques and artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Now their home is a heap of charred rubble. Only one wall is
left, offering a glimpse of the elegance that once stood there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs destroyed everything. They did not just burn the
home, or loot it. They bulldozed it. They were trying to destroy
more than our homes, they were trying to destroy our culture, our
confidence,'' said Mercia Pepa, 50, the matriarch of one of the
most prosperous families in Pec.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Albanians of Pec are very hard workers,'' she said,
using the Albanian pronunciation, ``Peah,'' which had been outlawed
under Serb rule. ``We will rebuild. We will start over and we will
rebuild Pec just as beautiful as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Pec suffered by far the worst damage to homes and property at
the hands of the Serb forces who set out on a well-orchestrated and
methodical campaign to rid the province of its majority ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In Pec, 80 percent of the housing stock was destroyed. Almost
all of the major industries were burned and their essential
machinery stolen. And now returning ethnic Albanians bent on
revenge continue the destruction by destroying Serb homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   So Pec is left in ashes, and posing the greatest challenge to a
massive international effort to help Kosovo rebuild. The
undertaking will require billions of dollars and years of work.
Estimates for rebuilding Kosovo are in the $5 billion range, but
for the whole Balkans they soar to $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Postwar reconstruction will mean more than providing sufficient
money to rebuild homes and businesses. It will mean reestablishing
government on a local and national level because virtually all of
the Serbs, especally those in positions of power, have fled.
</P>
<P>
   It will mean repairing a ravaged infrastructure of roads,
bridges, power plants and water systems _ much of which is
intricately woven into neighboring Serbia. And all of this will
have to be mapped out in compliance with the US insistence that no
financial support go to a Serbia controlled by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere does the task seem more daunting than in the northern
town of Pec. This town and its surrounding villages of 120,00
people was the heart of prosperity and culture for the Kosovar
Albanians. It is the ancient seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church's
patriarchate and a holy land to the Serbs. But now it is in rubble,
for Kosovar Albanians and Serbs alike. Destroyed along with it is
any hope that Kosovo can retain its multiethnic identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepa family owned a chain of a dozen photo development
stores known as ``Foto Pepa.'' All were set ablaze. The Fuji film
processing machines that cost millions of dollars were stolen by
the Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Searching through the charred brick and collapsed stone of what
was once their home, Mercia and her daughter, Lirika, 24, found her
wedding photo album. Lirika, cried when she saw the family
portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all just a memory now,'' she said, in a neighborhood
where house after house and block after block was reduced to
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   In Pec, one of few commercial buildings not destroyed is the
Peqko Pivo brewery, which employed 500 people. A large state-owned
bakery is also intact and will provide jobs for about 150.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned ``Crevena Zaztava'' auto parts assembly plant,
which employed 5,000 people and was the middle class backbone of
Pec, was destroyed, and the Serbs stole its machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Pec had the largest privately owned shoe factory in Yugoslavia
which was ravaged and looted, leaving 4,000 more people out of
work.
</P>
<P>
   A brick factory, which employed about 300, was demolished. This
is the first plant that officials say they will focus on getting up
and running. They will need a lot of brick in Pec. The primary need
is housing.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Curtis of World Vision said the American, Christian-based
international aid agency, was being contracted by the European
Union countries to coordinate the home rebuilding effort. He said
the original intention was to keep the refugees in the camps until
homes could be rebuilt. But the mass return was spontaneous and
uncontrollable. Now they are left trying to help equip homes to
withstand the harsh Balkans' winter.
</P>
<P>
   In Pec, there are virtually no municipal services. No
functioning fire trucks. No local police. Phone service is still
cut. Water is scarce. Streets are mounded with garbage and refuse
which lies putrefying. Flies and rodents are omnipresent. Fears are
growing of an outbreak of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a long way from establishing order. And we will have to
do that before we can begin to rebuild,'' said Gafor Alshane, 41,
proclaimed civil administrator of Pec for a provisional government
that may or may not hold onto power.
</P>
<P>
   The new provisional government for Pec has been set up in the
Kosovo Liberation Army's makeshift headquarters in a publishing
house. The KLA's eagerness to lay claim to power, and the Kosovar
Albanian business establishment's reluctance to accept it, is
playing out on the municipal level in Pec and on the national level
in the provincial capital in Pristina. How it will be resolved
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Rinaldo Locatelli, a senior representative for the UN Mission in
Kosovo, was touring Kosovo compiling a document that will address
the primary needs of Kosovo and an analysis of the best way to
restore government to the province.
</P>
<P>
   In Pec, he walked through the burned out rubble and pronounced,
``This is the hardest-hit place we've seen. All of Kosovo seems
apocalyptic at times, but Pec especially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have anarchy here at this point,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the anarchy, the few Serbs left are suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtyard of the 14th century ecclesiastical compound
that is the Serbian Orthodox Church's patriarchate, Archbishop
Amfilohije Radovic was surrounded by Serb refugees, mostly elderly
women evacuated by NATO. One had a large pancake-sized black eye
from KLA fighters who she said stormed into her home. The
archbishop had just finished a burial service for a mentally ill
woman who he said had been raped and strangled by KLA soldiers in
the Serb paramilitary stronghold of Belo Polje near Pec.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Amfilohije was among the church leaders who embraced
Milosevic when he soared to power more than a decade ago. Now the
bishop is among those calling for his resignation, as the onetime
alliance between the church and Milosevic lies in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need penitence,'' Archbishop Amfilohije said, as buses
idled at the front gate to transport the last of Kosovo's
frightened Serbs to Serbia. ``The rebuilding of Kosovo will have to
begin with the rebuilding of morality.''

IN VILLAGE, SEARCH FOR KIN TURNS GRUESOME

<P>
   LJUBENIC, Yugoslavia _ The stench of the decaying bodies on the
hillside was so pungent, Vjollca Ukshinaj had to cover her face to
keep from vomiting. But she needed to know: Was one of the dead her
father, whom she has not seen for months?
</P>
<P>
   It seemed not, based on the 20-year-old Ukshinaj's squeamish
inspection of what was left of the two figures. The corpses were
fairly fresh, but animals had gnawed at the remains, leaving
returning villagers concerned that neither local people nor
forensics specialists will be able to know for sure who was killed,
and how.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all looking for our people,'' a teary Ukshinaj said.
``I don't know where my father is.''
</P>
<P>
   Elhame Haradinaj is sadly certain what happened to her own
father. Weeping, Haradinaj holds a sock and eyeglass case engraved
with her father's name, items she found dumped at the side of the
road where survivors of a mass killing here say he was
machine-gunned.
</P>
<P>
   Haradinaj said she hasn't seen her father since being forced to
leave Ljubenic for Albania. ``But the witnesses say he was
killed,'' after attempting to convince a Serb soldier that the
small village never made trouble, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 75 men in this hillside, western Kosovo village are
believed slain in what survivors describe as a massacre by Serb
paramilitaries early April 1. Three men were killed separately, and
about 70 other men perished in a 5-minute machine-gun attack on a
line of Kosovar Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 bullet wounds, 57-year-old Gani Bushati still can't
believe he survived the attack. ``I was pretending to be dead,''
Bushati said.
</P>
<P>
   After about 40 minutes, he struggled to his feet. ``I said, who
is alive? Get up!'' Bushati recalled. Nine males walked and crawled
to a nearby forest, where they waited in fear for 12 hours. A
16-year-old boy died soon after they arrived, and the remaining
eight ultimately fled to Albania, returning only a few days ago to
search for relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The only physical evidence of the massacre is the bones of at
least two bodies, still lying in a courtyard near the massacre
site. Residents believe the rest of the bodies were burned inside
the adjoining house.
</P>
<P>
   This attack, Ukshinaj fears, killed her own father. She has
examined the clothes and shoes _ some of them with bloodstains _
near the site, but she can't identify any as her father's.
</P>
<P>
   Locals want to bury the two sets of bodies, but they are waiting
for war-crimes investigators to examine the evidence first. Until
that happens, Ljubenic villagers _ most of whom have just returned
from refuge in Albania _ can only go house to house, comforting one
another, exchanging information about relatives, and trying to
ignore the pervasive smells of decomposing bodies and burned
houses.
</P>
<P>
   The Ljubenic massacre presents just one more set of grim
questions for international war-crimes investigators, who are
determining the extent of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war may be over, but tens of thousands of people are still
unaccounted for,'' said former senator Bob Dole, chairman of the
International Committee on Missing Persons. Dole is scheduled to
travel to Kosovo today, visiting mass grave sites and meeting with
Serb and Albanian community members.
</P>
<P>
   No one from the international community has come to investigate
Ljubenic, residents say, although NATO troops put a span of plastic
tape across the house and courtyard where the bones lay.
</P>
<P>
   Even more bodies, locals say, are in the mountains, as refugees
were executed by Serb forces. Based on the number still missing,
Ljubenic residents estimate that as many as 60 from five villages
may be dead.
</P>
<P>
   Nazmi Gashi found his own father on this mountain. The man was
one of 25 dead _ 12 from one family _ discovered by a group of four
young men who made the three-hour trek up the mountain to look for
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were waiting for UNHCR to go with us to look, but we got
tired of waiting for help,'' said Gashi, 24, referring to the UN
refugee agency. ``Now, we are going alone to put white sheets''
over the bodies.

RUSSIA RAIDS CHECHNYA AS WAR TENSIONS RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Moscow wrangles with NATO over its role in keeping
the peace in Kosovo, Russia's own Muslim-dominated breakaway region
_ Chechnya _ is sliding back toward war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian helicopter gunships and artillery have launched raids
against a large group of gunmen in Chechnya. The attack followed a
pledge by Russia's top police official to bring order to the
Caucasus region, where Moscow fought a brutal campaign from 1994 to
1996, in an unsuccessful attempt to end a separatist rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The attack Monday was met by threats of retaliation from
Chechnya's leaders in the capital Grozny and speculation of
sinister political intrigues in Moscow. The dark theory held by
many observers here is that the Kremlin plans to foment violence in
the Caucasus to create an excuse for canceling upcoming
parliamentary and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo, who heads Russia's police
force and large internal army, said his troops struck at a group of
150 to 200 Chechen militants just over the region's eastern border
with the rest of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Rushailo said the strike came in retaliation for a rash of
attacks by Chechen gunmen against border posts near the separatist
region that have left dozens of Russian troops dead. He promised
the attack would not be the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will strike against them without waiting for them to attack
us,'' Rushailo said.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands died in Chechnya during the two-year war, but
the region remained under rebel control after Russian troops
withdrew in early 1997. The region elected a president, Aslan
Maskhadov, who commanded the Chechens during the war, but whose
authority has been greatly reduced amid infighting among armed
factions. Moscow says Maskhadov has no control over armed gangs
numbering in the thousands that conduct raids in neighboring
Russian regions and hold hostages for ransom. Chechnya's leaders do
not acknowledge the existence of any armed gangs on their
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Rushailo's words were met by a threat of terrorist acts against
Russia from the rebel government in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``For each explosion of a shell or bomb in Chechnya, tens of
thousands of explosions will rock Russia,'' Maskhadov's press
secretary, Mairbek Vachagayev, was quoted as saying by the Interfax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, a prominent liberal member of parliament suggested
the new violence in Chechnya was one of several strategies being
tried out by the Kremlin to keep President Boris N. Yeltsin in
power after his term is due to end next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The legislator, Yury Shchekochikhin, published what he said was
a copy of a presidential decree declaring a state of emergency over
violence in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Answering the terrorists' next raids, `surgical' strikes will
be carried out against the bases of the Chechen fighters . . .
using the experience of NATO in Yugoslavia,'' Shchekochikhin wrote
in the weekly Novaya Gazeta. ``The `surgical' strikes will provoke
the most boisterous Chechen commanders. The result is a state of
emergency, and all that goes with it, including postponing''
parliamentary cember and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, in an interview being published in Izvestia, says he
has no intention of hanging on to power when his term ends in July
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But much of Moscow's political establishment is convinced that
Yeltsin's Kremlin entourage, known as ``The Family,'' is scheming
to make it possible for the president to stay on.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that Chechnya might be used to this end heated up
last week after Russia's official news agency Itar-Tass published
an anonymous report detailing recurring violence against the ethnic
Russian minority living in Chechnya. The report said that 21,000
Russians had been killed in Chechnya since 1991 _ not including
casualties of the war _ and that about 800 were still being held
hostage. The document also said that 46,000 people had been forced
into slavery and that 100,000 apartments of ``non-indigenous
people'' in Chechnya had been seized.
</P>
<P>
   The document never mentioned Kosovo, but the unspoken parallels
were clear, as was the hint that action needed to be taken. On
Saturday, Rushailo told the Federation Council, the upper house of
parliament, that he had ordered the ``preventative airstrikes''
against armed gangs in Chechnya. The house, composed of Russian
regional leaders, asked Yeltsin to take ``decisive measures'' to
protect Russians in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, when we are talking about the Kosovo
conflict, we find the means and the political will, but in our own
house we can't put things in order,'' said a Federation Council
member, Alexander Shiyanov, who is from Stavropol, a region just
across Chechnya's border that has been plagued by kidnapping and
armed raids.

CHINA SPURRED BY A GOAL RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There were two fireworks displays at Foxboro
Stadium Sunday night, the postmatch holiday celebration that
entertained the fans who had come to watch the Women's World Cup
semifinal between China and defending champion Norway and the
offensive pyrotechnics provided on the field by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The next time China takes the field will be Saturday at the Rose
Bowl against the United States, a team it defeated, 2-1, April 25
in New Jersey, ending a 50-match US winning streak on American
soil. And based on Sunday's dominating, precise, and spirited 5-0
romp over Norway, the US will have to be at the top of its game to
avert another defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that China will be the favorite for me,''
said Norwegian coach Per-Mathias Hogmo. ``But they will face a very
enthusiastic US team. The most important issue will be the speed of
both teams. We looked at China for the last three matches and were
a little shellshocked. They have really strong players. Their
defense is so strong, and the way they attack through the midfield
is very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese keeper Gao Hong, through an interpreter provided by
World Cup officials, remarked after her team's semifinal win that
she wasn't surprised at the outcome but was surprised at how
quickly her team scored. ``That I did not expect,'' she said. Hong
was never really pressured during the match, in which China scored
in the third and 14th minutes while torching Norway's defense in
the transition game and taking advantage of its free kicks and
corner kicks. Four of its goals came off set plays.
</P>
<P>
   That was the lament of Norway's captain and defender Linda
Medalen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was never in control,'' she said. ``They were very
good at free kicks and corner kicks, and I think the US team should
watch out for them in those situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Medalen said that even if Norway had been able to score the
first goal, the outcome probably would have been the same. ``They
were just very tough on the ball. They did a great job. We had no
possibility to show our best today. They were much better than
us.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case earlier in the decade. After a
disappointing loss to Sweden in the quarterfinals of the inaugural
1991 World Cup (won by the US), the Chinese shut down their women's
national team program for two years. There has been a steady climb
to the top echelon of international women's soccer since the
program was revamped. China rebounded to advance to the semifinals
of the 1995 World Cup. It also made it to the gold medal match of
the '96 Olympics, losing to the Americans, 2-1, and it defeated the
US in two of three matches this year.
</P>
<P>
   Medalen, like her coach, feels the United States will face a
hard test Saturday. ``It's the two best teams in the final. No
doubt about that. The Chinese team we saw today was the best I've
seen them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of scoring had been a weakness in China's game, but no
longer, thanks to the presence of talented veterans like Liu Ailing
and captain Sun Wen (each of whom scored twice against Norway) and
the speedy and elusive Zhao Lihong, who made life miserable along
the flanks for Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think their passing and discipline are top-notch,''
said Boston University men's soccer coach Neil Roberts, who has
watched the World Cup games and been impressed with the Chinese
style of play. ``They never lose their shape. They're never out of
position. They counterattack well, but when they lose possession,
it seems they always get players back. They're an attacking team,
but they never seem to get exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't always the case with the Americans, Roberts analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference may be that the US team, when it attacks, gets
exposed defensively on occasion,'' he said. ``The Chinese haven't
done that yet, from what I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite their high-pressure offense, the Chinese did not
allow a shot on goal in the first half. On more than one occasion,
when a Norwegian attacker found a little breathing room, she was
quickly marked by two or three defenders. Anticipation and team
play were key components of China's game, described by its keeper
as ``spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem to have that one dominant physical player,
like Hamm or Lilly. They're just collectively very good,'' added
Roberts. ``I was talking recently to a soccer official who has been
to China, and he said they have an academy where they have trained
their national teams and they are bringing in players as young as 6
years old for 10 months at a time for schooling and physical
training.''
</P>
<P>
   So what can we expect from the United States in the wake of
China's rapid improvement and its demolition of Norway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony (DiCicco) is obviously a great coach, and they know all
about China,'' said Roberts. ``The US women will be playing in
front of 90,000 people, and I expect they'll do what they always
do: go out and attack and try to score goals. They're not going to
overestimate or underestimate them. They will respect them, but
they won't fear them.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically, said Roberts, China may find it difficult matching
up to the US, especially on re-starts or corner kicks. ``The US
team has been close to perfect in their set plays,'' he said.
``They've worked too hard and put too much on the line to be afraid
of anybody. But what would concern me if I were in the US camp is
the quick counterattack by the Chinese. They find the open lanes
very easily _ at least they did against Norway.''

DIET SUPPLEMENTS UNDER SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KRISTIN VAUGHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They vow to help you trim down, boost energy, put muscle on, and
even take cellulite off.
</P>
<P>
   Go to any health food store, fitness center, or grocery store
and you'll see shelves stocked with energy enhancement and sports
performance pills, drinks, and bars. And consumers are hungrier for
them than ever.
</P>
<P>
   They spent more than $6.5 billion in 1996 on over-the counter
dietary supplements, according to the US Food and Drug
Administration's latest figures. And nutrition groups say that
sales are rising each year.
</P>
<P>
   But do these supplements actually work? And, more importantly,
are they safe?
</P>
<P>
   While the FDA can alert consumers to products that could be
dangerous, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994
limits the agency's latitude in regulating supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike drugs that get FDA approval before they are marketed,
dietary supplements must be proven unsafe before regulators can
restrict the use of a product.
</P>
<P>
   While the FDA forbids labels that ``state or imply that the
product can help diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent a disease (for
example, `cures cancer' or `treats arthritis')'' consumers should
be wary of products that are marketed as ``miracle cures,''
``wonder drugs,'' and ``new breakthroughs,'' according to the
agency's website.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the FDA has issued warnings about the danger of
over-the-counter supplements containing ephedrine, a powerful heart
stimulant, and gamma butryolactone, or GBL, a central nervous
system depressant.
</P>
<P>
   In January, muscle and performance boosting products containing
GBL had to be pulled from gym and store shelves after the FDA
banned the product when some consumers experienced vomiting, slowed
heart rate, seizures, comas, and even death.
</P>
<P>
   Weight loss, muscle building, and energy boosting products
containing ephedrine have not been recalled by the FDA, although
the agency issued several warnings after it investigated more than
800 adverse health events including heart attack, stroke, seizure,
and more than 30 deaths associated with products containing
ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the FDA advised consumers to restrict their intake of
ephedrine (derived from the ephedra plant) to 8 mg per dose and no
more than 24 mg per day and not to use the product for more than
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Products containing ephedrine _ commonly labeled as ephedra, ma
huang Chinese ephedra, and epitonin _ are often found in
weight-loss, energy boosting, and body building supplements.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the dietary supplement industry are at odds with the
government's descriptions that some supplements _ particularly
those containing ephedrine _ are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Metabolife International Inc., sued WCVB-TV Channel 5,
its anchor Susan Wornick, and Dr. George L. Blackburn of Harvard
Medical School after the Boston station reported on health risks
related to the use of ephedrine-containing weight-loss dietary
supplements, including the top-selling Metabolife 356, which the
San Diego-based company makes.
</P>
<P>
   The report included a comment from Blackburn, who, when
discussing the safety of ephedrine-containing products such as
Metabolife, said ``you can die'' from taking them.
</P>
<P>
   Metabolife claims his comments, as well as the broadcast, were
false, and are damaging to the company, which sold an estimated
$600 million worth of the supplements last year.
</P>
<P>
   Motions to dismiss Metabolife's lawsuit were filed last month by
attorneys on behalf of Blackburn and by those for Wornick and
WCVB-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn's attorney Jeffrey R. Martin called Metabolife's
lawsuit ``frivolous'' and said ``we are doing our best to get it
dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Metabolife's president Michael J. Ellis has also threatened to
sue the Washington Post over a similar report and has battled
successfully in states, such as Texas, to stop legislatures from
requiring prescriptions for weight-loss products containing
ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some stores have voluntarily pulled ephedrine from
their shelves. Bread and Circus Whole Foods Markets, a small
Massachusetts chain, stopped selling about 12 products containing
ephedra around the time the FDA warned in 1996 that the product was
an ``amphetamine-like stimulant'' that can damage the heart and
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled everything. None of our stores carry ephedra
products or ma Huang _ `speed' _ as we like to call it,'' said
Allyn Kunz nutrition coordinator for Bread and Circus's northeast
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies actually changed their formulas so we would
keep their products on the shelf,'' she said, while others ``took
out the ma huang and added another herb very high in caffeine
called guarnana and they advertise it as `ephedra free,''' Kunz
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bread and Circus doesn't carry products containing guarana
either, she added.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of supplements are not dangerous, consumers
shouldn't buy or use products just because the label says
``natural,'' according to Dr. David Levitsky a nutrition and
psychology professor at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is natural,'' Levitsky said. ``Somehow there is the
idea that if you use a plant directly or extract a tea it will be
more effective and have less side effects (than approved drugs) and
that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Levitsky, who is studying the effects of several herbal
supplements, memory-aiding products and mood supplements seem to
show the most promise. Despite volumes of testimonials from users,
many who have been paid to make them, fitness, energy, and
weight-loss supplements don't appear to produce a measurable
effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Where weight-loss is concerned, ``the more you believe in them
the more they work...there is something to the placebo effect,''
Levitsky said. ``If you reduce caloric intake you are going to lose
weight, no question. If you think what you're doing (with
supplements) is helping, then you will stick with it,'' believing
the supplements helped, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Spellman, a registered dietician at the Boston Athletic
Club, said that creatine, a popular strength-increasing supplement,
seems to ``have some promise,'' but she tries to steer (her
clients) away from most supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for that quick fix. People think that they
can take creatine or other supplements and sit on the couch for two
hours to get more muscle and it ain't gonna happen,'' Spellman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a supplement is ``easier to swallow than hearing that
you'll have to go to the gym a lot and watch what you put in your
mouth.''
</P>

COLOMBIA THE GEM OF THE COPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Copa America is the world's oldest continental championship, and
it remains among the most eventful, thanks to Martin Palermo of
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Palermo missed three penalty kicks in a 3-0 loss to Colombia in
a first-round match Sunday in Luque, Paraguay, a series of errors
that could be costly not only to Argentina but to the player.
Palermo was the leading scorer in Argentina while playing for Boca
Juniors this year, but European teams have been reluctant to take a
chance on him and will be even more so now.
</P>
<P>
   Palermo, 27, banged the first penalty off the crossbar, sent the
second one over the goal, and had the third penalty saved by
goalkeeper Miguel Calero.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombians took the lead on a ninth-minute penalty by Ivan
Cordoba, who celebrated by revealing an undershirt with the No. 2
as a tribute to Andres Escobar, the central defender who was slain
in Medellin during the 1994 World Cup. That would be the only
successful penalty of five awarded in the match, as Colombia's
Hamilton Ricard had his shot blocked in the second half by German
Burgos.
</P>
<P>
   If there were not enough drama in the first two-thirds of the
game, the action soon accelerated. With the score 1-0, Argentina's
Javier Zanetti was red-carded by Paraguayan referee Ubaldo Aquino
in the 68th minute, and coach Martin Bielsa was ejected for
protesting.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two minutes after replacing Ricard, Edwin Congo scored
Colombia's second goal. Another substitute, 16-year-old Johnnier
Montano, who has been linked to Parma in Italy, added the final
goal in the 87th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian president Andres Pastrana told coach Javier Alvarez
this was an accomplishment that shows the potential of the country.
This is a revamped Colombian team, with only Jorge Bermudez among
the holdovers in a key role. Colombia's national team needs to
redefine itself, but this group has far to go to match the
accomplishments of the Carlos Valderrama years, which included a
5-0 win over Argentina _ in Buenos Aires in US '94 qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   But this tournament will likely be recalled as the coming-out
party of another Brazilian Ronaldo. Brazil has two Ronaldos on its
roster, the one who plays for Internazionale in Milan and Ronaldo
de Assis Moreira, a 19-year-old from Porto Alegre who is also going
by the name ``Ronaldinho Gaucho.'' Ronaldinho was only named to the
team after Edilson was dropped because of his showboating while
playing for Corinthians. He scored a spectacular goal in a 7-0
victory over Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barcelona and Real Madrid are bidding on him, according to
Spanish publications. Italian teams will not be far behind. But
Ronaldinho's club, Gremio, is apparently holding out for a record
price.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A female future
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Women's World Cup started last month, FIFA president
Sepp Blatter reiterated his prediction that ``the future of
football is feminine.'' Pele' heard the remark and admonished
Blatter by saying: ``What future? Look around you. It's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the WWC has made a significant impact. And, yes,
women's soccer is here to stay. Actually, women's soccer has been
here for some time, though marginalized. But after the championship
game in Pasadena, what will be the future that Blatter and Pele'
have discussed?
</P>
<P>
   To determine such answers, the past must be first examined.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for the success of the US national team is mostly being
given to the Title IX ruling that legislated equal opportunities
for men and women in colleges. This, however, ignores the extensive
club programs that augment the college teams and actually provide
the basis for young girls' involvement in the sport, long before
they reach high school or college age.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we should start looking beyond Title IX, because the
future of feminine football is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The US national team has set some high standards and will not
likely improve very much while depending on the current system of
team selection. Meanwhile, Brazilian women who couldn't tell the
difference between Title IX and the Ten Commandments could be
setting the pace within a few years. Countries such as China and
Germany, Nigeria and Russia, have a chance to surpass the US
despite enormous cultural/sexist barriers. Even small countries
such as Norway can keep up with the US because of their club
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The US does not need to radically change its development system
because a club system already exists. Simply, the clubs that supply
the players to the colleges should be recognized for their role,
encouraged, and supported.

IT'S BEEN A FULL CUP FOR THE US TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're finally where everybody had assumed they'd be before
they ever started. In the sold-out Rose Bowl, in the World Cup
final. All the US women's soccer team ever had to do was go through
the annoying formality of actually getting there.
</P>
<P>
   If you watched the Nike ads and the TV promos, the road to
Pasadena (have we had enough of that phrase?) seemed like a Babes
of Summer victory tour, all high-fiving and ball-signing and a few
kick-arounds with obliging Nigerians and Koreans. If only . . .
</P>
<P>
   Once they'd held off the Brazilians on Sunday by the length of
Briana Scurry's outstretched fingers, the Americans walked off
smiling but drained, gave a few war whoops in their dressing room _
and collapsed on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game has been physically and emotionally taxing,''
captain Carla Overbeck was saying. ``We've been playing in front of
the best fans in the world against the best teams in the world.
There's a sense of accomplishment and relief when every game is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   For Overbeck and her band of ``Watch Me Play'' role models, this
tournament has been going on for months. It began in March, with a
wave-the-flag exhibition tour that dragged them from Los Angeles to
Hershey, Pa., to the Meadowlands to Charlotte to Atlanta to
Milwaukee to Chicago to Orlando to Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   This team, which has been together so long that its members can
identify each other in the dark, didn't need anywhere near that
many tuneups and certainly not in that many cities. But that was
never the point anyway. The point was to get the hosts seen by as
many ``ponytailed hooligans'' and their parents as possible and to
lay the groundwork for the L-word: legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer people will tell you that whether the US actually wins
the World Cup is almost irrelevant in the long run. This team has
already done everything else asked of it. It packed NFL stadiums at
top-dollar prices. It got more than respectable TV ratings. It was
terrific with the media (what other athletes ever thanked
journalists for talking to them?). It was wonderful to its fans,
signing everything thrust under a pen. It modeled any role you
wanted _ soccer mom, sex symbol, medical miracle,
black-woman-in-white-sport.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere through all that, folks seemed to forget that the home
team was also supposed to get to the final _ and win. ``That's an
awesome enough task,'' coach Tony DiCicco was saying. ``That's one
reason why this team sometimes played a bit nervous. Getting here
was no easy chore.''
</P>
<P>
   The men never had to do that five years ago. All they needed to
do was make it to the second round. They weren't expected to
inspire a generation of young boys. They didn't have to lay the
groundwork for a national pro league (that was already going to
happen). They had no Road to Pasadena tour. They didn't have to
walk along a five-deep rope after practice scribbling their names
and numbers in 90-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the Chinese women. Not that they got fast-laned to
Pasadena, either. They spent seven weeks away from home this
spring. They crossed the country four times in 12 days living on
McFood. They had to play the defending champions in ungodly steam
heat in a half-empty stadium. But all the Chinese have had to do is
play.
</P>
<P>
   For the US women, the playing seemed to be just one more thing
on a To Do list that got longer, not shorter, as the Cup went on.
``I'm just thankful that it's this team playing this tournament,''
Mia Hamm was saying. Because a less experienced team might have
blown apart.
</P>
<P>
   For the Hamms and Overbecks and Akerses and Lillys and Fawcetts
and Foudys, this is the third time around. They have won the Cup.
They have lost the Cup. They have won an Olympic gold medal in a
full stadium at home. And they had played the contenders often
enough to know that there was no locker room reserved for them at
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known from Day One that it wasn't going to be easy, and
it hasn't been easy,'' Hamm said. ``The Germany game stretched us.
The Brazil game stretched us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has stretched the Chinese, who played the most impressive
match in Cup history when they destroyed the Norwegians. They were
equal to the Americans when they played them twice in April, and
right now, they are better. They haven't given up early goals. They
haven't scored on themselves. They haven't needed one-handed saves
from their keeper. ``We will have to be a better team on Saturday
than we were today,'' DiCicco conceded, after his team had edged
the Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, that may be the easy part for this multi-tasked bunch.
They're finally where they're supposed to be. All they have to do
(how simple!) is play.

IN AUSTRALIA, A LOOK INTO THE `CURSE OF BLACKBUTT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKBUTT, Australia _ The pilgrimage began on the east coast,
in Brisbane, simply because my friend, Aurelio, likes to see where
memorable things and people got started. Since she does the
driving, how could I and a frequent passenger, Ron Sampson, object?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we were curious, too. For years I had wondered if such
a seemingly quaintly-named place, Blackbutt, even existed. Roy
Emerson, a jovial country boy and great athlete, had told me he was
a Blackbutt native. That was the first time he appeared at Boston's
Longwood Cricket Club to play tennis a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Emmo, as he's known, is also known as an energetic (though
good-natured) practical joker, certainly capable of fabricating a
hometown. Anything for a laugh. One time, at a place called Mermaid
Beach on the Queensland coast he took me, for a tutorial, into some
``very gentle surf so you'll get the feel of body-surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, so gentle. Suddenly I was lifted, pitched, and spun so
vigorously to the sandy bottom that I had to look for my trunks
when I surfaced spouting and gasping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sorry,'' he guffawed loudly, ``I guess that was what we
call a dumper. You'd better get dressed again.'' After I retrieved
the trunks, the surfing lesson continued without further incident.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago Aurelio had met Emmo at Longwood where he was doing
TV commentary at the US Pro. Luckily she drew him as her partner in
the Bob Dunbar Memorial press tourney, a giggler at best, without
any idea that he was a Hall of Famer, holder of the record that
Pete Sampras is currently chasing: 12 major singles championships
(Pete entered Wimbledon holding 11.) But playing softly, sportingly
in the hackerly company he was keeping, Emmo didn't flaunt his yet
formidable prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on learning of his accomplishments, among them
spearheading Australia to eight Davis Cups, she shrieked, ``Was
that really my partner!''
</P>
<P>
   None other. ``The pride of Blackbutt,'' I said. ``If there is
such a place.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brisbane we pored over maps, and _ voila! _ found Blackbutt
to the west in Nanangoshire. We would also find out about the
``Curse of Blackbutt.' According to a lifelong resident, Kevin
Allery, the Curse has been protecting native son Emerson's record
that has stood since 1967, and will shield him from Sampras and any
other predators. Allery's name had been given us by a friend,
Queensland authority James Corvan, with, ``Just ask anybody in
town. Everybody knows Kev.''
</P>
<P>
   The route took us past the intriguing Glasshouse Mountains, a
set of three 1,000-foot volcanic plugs where a Bostonian (that's
Boston, England), the exploring mapmaker Matthew Flinders, had
camped in 1799. They're near the tidy town of Beerwah amid
pineapple and sugar cane fields.
</P>
<P>
   An up-and-down rural drive, with the curving two-lane road
mostly to ourselves and logging trucks, it took us over the
Blackall Range and through small, neat towns such as Mapleton,
Montville, and Peachester, which has a race track for
thoroughbreds, and Kilcoy.
</P>
<P>
   Kilcoy's ``dunny'' (public toilet) is imposing, an architectural
masterpiece of brick with a step-stair facade, Romanesque archway,
and slate roof. ``A prize winner on any continent,'' proclaimed
Sampson. ``Worth a stop whether you need it or not.'' We stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Forests and cattle were numerous. The most compelling town was
Eumundi, home of another tennis player, Patrick Rafter, the US Open
champ who will visit Boston next week as the main man of the
Australian Davis Cup team. Eumundi's lively Saturday market and its
county fair atmosphere is famed throughout the region. The stalls
and platforms are crowded with artists, artisans, musicians,
dealers in a wide variety of foods and goods. Aurelio bought a
handsome dish from potter Barbara McIvor. Gary Sutherland quelled
hunger with his kebabs and falafels.
</P>
<P>
   We got there late, decided to stay, and that evening blue lights
sparkled as driver Aurelio was pulled over by a cop named Belinda
Weedman for a breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had anything to drink, constable,'' she pleaded in
most clearly enunciated voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a random check, the kind of thing we do on a Saturday
night,'' smiled Weedman. ``Blow, please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a rookie at this, but I'll do my best,'' said Aurelio,
puffing into the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Her heavy breathing was perfect. ``Have a nice evening. You're
sober as a judge,'' pronounced Constable Weedman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not some of the Boston judges I know,'' interjected Sampson, a
lawyer by trade.
</P>
<P>
   More mileage . . . and, at last, a sign _ BLACKBUTT, Est. 1888 _
informs the pilgrims they've arrived. The sign doesn't mention the
Curse that may be stalking Pete Sampras
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful that Sampras could even identify Blackbutt, a
one-saloon town of 800 souls on the outskirts of nowhere. But the
residents, depending on cattle and timber for a living, can
identify him, all right: the Yank who wants to steal their bloke's
record, Emerson's 12 major singles (six Australian, two each
French, Wimbledon, US). For 32 years that mark has stood as firmly
as the dark-trunked eucalyptus trees from which the community gets
its name and substantial sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   Although Roy Emerson, 62, is too mature now to defend himself
from the covetous Sampras, the Curse seems as strong and protective
as ever. You can feel it lurking like the deadly snakes in the
grass where the Emersonian journey began. Eventually it became a
campaign of conquest of the rectangular citadels of New York,
London, Paris, and Melbourne between 1961 and 1967, as well as
unequaled Davis Cup feats.
</P>
<P>
   This rectangle, the rude, homemade ant bed court on which the
jocular Emmo first struck a ball, lies shrouded in deep grass and
weeds. It hasn't been played on for decades, since the Emerson
family moved off the dairy farm where he developed those strong,
sharp-volleying wrists by ``milking hundreds of cows as a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such rural courts were widespread during Australia's planetary
supremacy when country boys served as prominent cogs. The
``Rocket,'' fellow Hall of Famer and pal Rod Laver, was launched
from one, on his family's Queensland station (ranch).
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, now a teaching pro at the Palace Hotel in Gstaad,
Swizerland, remembers, ``It wasn't hard to build one. With the
tractor you just knocked down some termite or ant hills that were
plentiful, looking like traffic cones. Spread the red grit on a
fairly level space. Put up a couple of chicken wire fences and a
net. You built it and the neighbors came to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the net posts remain in his tennis field of reveries, the
tips barely showing. They seem mysterious relics of a departed king
of long ago. Visiting what amounts to an Australian shrine _ though
virtually unknown _ amid low green hills and unending
bluer-than-blue sky is like poking around a pyramid where a pharoah
left his curse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, yeah, this is the home of the Curse,'' asserts 72-year-old
Kevin Allery, a Nanangoshire councilman and Blackbuttian since
birth. He believes, ``Sampras will never overcome it even though he
has 11 titles. I knew it when another dinkum Queensland boy, Pat
Rafter, beat him at the US Open last year. And what about the
others?''
</P>
<P>
   He means principally Bjorn Borg and Laver, who stalled at 11.
``The Curse,'' he says with a smile. ``Everybody thought those
two'd roll Roy, eh?''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. Laver completed his second Grand Slam in 1969 at
the US Open, his 11th major. He was No. 1, a factor for another
five years who seemed a cinch. But . . ..
</P>
<P>
   Borg, a mere 25 on winning an 11th, the French of 1981, lost his
next two major finals, Wimbledon and the US Open, to John McEnroe _
and was through. Allery points out that greats Ken Rosewall, Jimmy
Connors, and Ivan Lendl had potential to go beyond their eight
titles, and McEnroe his seven. Were they accursed?
</P>
<P>
   Allery just smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson feels Sampras ``will break the record, and good on him.
Pete's a great champion. I didn't even know I held the record until
Pete started getting close.'' In 1967 Emmo took it from Bill Tilden
by winning his 11th, the Australian. Five months later he reached
his destiny's dozen at the French. ``Nobody talked about records
then. It wasn't mentioned in the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   He disclaims any involvement with the Curse, but Emmo has
friends. Allery hints at consultation with an aboriginal witch
doctor over in Morgo to give the Curse a booster. ``We want to keep
the record in Blackbutt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep it in Australia,'' says Beverly Knight of
Melbourne, perhaps the nation's foremost dealer in aboriginal art.
Therefore, she, too, has contacted a witch doctor on Emmo's behalf
in the Northern Territory. ``It can't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Long the town champion, Allery ``rolled Emerson _ and Laver,
too. Had 'em for dinner one after the other when I won the
tournament at Kingaroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson confirms: ``We were kids, but, yeah, Kev beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiry white-haired Allery, who has been cowboy, cane-cutter,
lumberjack, beams at the recollection. He beat the man who beat the
illustrious Tilden's record. However, if the Curse prevails against
Sampras there will be no gloating or dancing in Coulson Street, the
town's one-block main drag. Dominating the street on a corner is
the wooden L-shaped Blackbutt Hotel in cheery tones of blue and
yellow, two-stories with balcony and the welcome barroom. ``But,''
promises Allery, ``we may raise a glass whenever Pete loses a big
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaded by jacaranda and hoop pine, Allery is standing on a plot
of crimson earth beside the onetime Emerson homestead, a yellow,
one-story frame house on 5-foot steel stilts that encouraged air to
circulate in pre-AC days. About a mile distant, long-since razed,
was Nukku Grammar School. There Emmo was ``last in my class _ but
also first, the only one'' _ and sometimes followed to school by a
pet calf in the style of Mary's little lamb.
</P>
<P>
   As Allery peers downhill at the lonely, thickly overgrown
shrine, the farm's current proprietor, Eric Wilson, says, ``I'd be
careful about walking down there, mate. Lots of (lethal) brown
snakes. I shot a 5-footer in the pantry last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Pete Sampras snakebit by the Curse of Blackbutt as he treads
in Emmo's sneaker steps, or has the Curse run out of venom?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' says the amiable Allery. Meanwhile, he suggests
we go back his home where his pleasant wife, Jane, fixes tea for
the pilgrims.

DO YOU WEIGH LESS AT THE EQUATOR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Because the Earth is spinning, does a person weigh less at
the equator than at the poles?
</P>
<P>
   L.E., Charlestown, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you want to lose weight without giving up the ice cream
and pizza, head for the equator. The Earth is spinning on its axis
at 1,040 miles per hour. The centrifugal force at the equator
counteracts enough of gravity's pull that a person weighing 150.8
pounds at the poles, comes in at a svelte 150 pounds on the
equator. This new weight loss program is not all due to centrifugal
force, though. The spinning of Earth tends to flatten it out a bit.
It's wider across the middle than it is top to bottom. A person
standing on the equator is 13 miles further from the center of the
Earth than a person at the poles. The further you are from the
center of a mass, the less gravitational pull it exerts on you.

   Q. Why do the planets keep spinning?
</P>
<P>
   N.F., no address
</P>
<P>
   A. Scientists believe planets formed when particles of dust in
post-Big Bang space either collided, or were drawn together by
gravity, the bigger one pulling in the smaller. As each piece was
drawn in to join the growing planet, it was moving as it arrived.
That got planets spinning a little bit. But as gravity pulled those
pieces in from the distant reaches of the solar system, everything
condensed, speeding up the spin, like a spinning ice skater pulling
in her arms. Since the material in each planet was moving in
different ways, they ended up spinning at wildly different speeds.
The spin of planets is changing all the time. Sometimes it's
because the planet gets whacked by some piece of space debris big
enough alter its rotation. But mostly planetary spin is being
altered by the gravitational pull from all the other large bodies
in the solar system: the sun, the other planets, and their moons.
The Earth has slowed a lot since the time when its moon formed 4.5
billion years ago. Scientists think that back then, the Earth spun
one complete revolution on its axis every 5.5 hours, compared to
today's roughly 24 hour spin cycle. And we're still slowing down.
The day gets longer by about one second each year, according to MIT
Geophysicist Tom Herring.

<P>
   In one corner, the forces for fitness and health; in the other _
longstanding lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the government, doctors, health insurers, and
employers have been warning Americans that their sedentary ways are
harming their health. People struggle with this knowledge, trying
to find the will to exercise _ and stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   But lethargy seems to be winning out, despite clear evidence
that it takes only moderate activity to reduce the risks of heart
disease and other conditions and invigorate body and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   What has appeared to be a fitness boom in recent years is
deceiving. An estimated 60 percent of US adults don't do enough
exercise to improve their health and 25 percent do none whatsoever.
So it's no surprise that 1 in 3 Americans is now considered
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Many people say they're too busy to exercise, and technology _
home computers, remote controls, cars, elevators, escalators _
increasingly act as deterrents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, when they think about exercise, think about what
they had to do in high school P.E. or the military. That's what
keeps a lot of people sedentary,'' says Steven Farrell, an exercise
physiologist at the Cooper Institute for Aerobic Research in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But surprisingly, some of the newest data suggest that so-called
``lifestyle'' activity _ walking, bowling, doing yardwork, and so
forth _ may produce similar benefits to more structured exercise,
such as aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has so much evidence supported the value of
physical activity so non-strenuous that you don't need to shower
afterward, and which can be done in bite-sized, 10-minute segments.
The important thing is to make sure it adds up to 30 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers compared structured and lifestyle activity in
experiments that were reported earlier this year in the Journal of
the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, 235 sedentary men and women were assigned either
to supervised sessions of aerobic exercise (20 to 60 minutes five
days a week) or got to choose among moderate-intensity lifestyle
activities. After two years, the volunteers in the two groups had
made comparable improvements in activity, cardiorespiratory
fitness, blood pressure, and percentage of body fat. The
improvements translated into a 15 percent reduction in mortality.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the two years, the volunteers in the lifestyle
group had more effectively incorporated physical activity into
their routines.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the Cooper Institute, said this was the
first demonstration that sedentary people can make such positive
changes without having to go to a fitness center and do strenuous
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Generally though, ``most physicians find that it's awfully hard
to change people's long-term behaviors,'' says Dr. Steven Matfis,
an internist with Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates in Quincy who
is on a campaign to get his patients to exercise more. ``If you
just tell people, `I want you to do more activity' they say, `yeah,
yeah, I'll try' but it may not go much farther than that,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   While he has had some success and can name patients who are
doing more and feeling better, he feels it's an uphill struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The key, say experts, is for people to find something they enjoy
doing, because they're more likely to become active and stay that
way.
</P>
<P>
   For Beth Kirschen, 26, finding an activity she loved made all
the difference. For years, she tried gym exercises _ the
stairstepper, exercise bike, weights _ but soon tired of each of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, she tried mountain biking and became
captivated by the strenuous sport that involves riding up and down
rugged terrain for hours at a time. Now she says she's in ``pretty
great shape'' and has added calisthenics to strengthen her upper
body.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone can, or will, exercise at this level. A person
needs to ask himself or herself, ``what am I trying to
accomplish?'' says Dr. James Rippe, a Tufts University School of
Medicine cardiologist and director of the Center for Clinical and
Lifestyle Research in Shrewsbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your goal is to lose weight or improve aerobic capacity,
the means will be different from someone who wants to lower their
risk of heart disease,'' says Rippe, ``and those will be different
from that of a 70-year-old who's trying to prevent osteoporosis.''
</P>
<P>
   But either way, says Rippe, you should adopt a ``mind-set of
always looking for the nooks and crannies in your life where you
can put some physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   For Peter Davis, a 64-year-old retiree, it was walking. He had
doctors' orders to stay active following a kidney transplant and a
cardiac bypass operation. But, he said, ``I got lazy'' and slowed
down. What got him going again was acquiring a dog that he walks
several times a day. ``I have a 5-minute route, a 15-minute route,
and a 30-minute route,'' he said in an interview from his summer
place on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he goes three times a week to a Boy's Club where he
walks on the treadmill and lifts light weights. Now, he says, he's
feeling stronger and sleeping better, and _ most important _ has a
better self-image. ``I was becoming a couch potato,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Sergeant Richard Ham is 44, but he fast-forwards in his
mind to retirement. Policemen, he says, often let themselves go
physically when they retire, and they die earlier. He's determined
to avoid that fate, and so he's enthusiastically working out at
HealthPoint, the luxurious fitness center in Waltham, Mass. owned
by CareGroup, the health corporation, and has the new Boston
Celtics training facility on its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have Popeye muscles,'' says Ham, ``I just want
to feel good and be in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes four or five times a week to the center, where he works
out on a variety of machines. He's spent extra to get the services
of a personal trainer, which he calls ``a tremendous motivational
thing'' because she keeps him focused and has taught him how to do
the exercises correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The latest U.S. Public Health recommendation is that to enjoy
better health, everyone should accumulate, on most days, 30 minutes
of moderately strenuous activity. That can be brisk walking,
playing a sport, gardening, bicycling, or any other activity that
burns about 150 calories.
</P>
<P>
   This guideline was based on research that showed a sedentary
person who moves to this level of activity can significantly reduce
his or her risk of heart disease, diabetes, colon cancer, and other
conditions. More activity, of course, is better, but the greatest
incremental gain is in going from doing nothing to doing something.
</P>
<P>
   To improve fitness, the American College of Sports Medicine
recommends more strenuous workouts. For aerobic fitness, the
guidelines say you need to do 20 minutes of exercise, three days a
week, at an intensity that speeds your heart to 55 to 90 percent of
its maximum rate. That usually means jogging, running on a
treadmill, using a stairstepper, or doing some other form of
aerobic exercise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, fitness experts say that everyone, particularly
older people, should use weights or exercise machines twice a week
to improve strength in the major muscle groups and increase bone
mass, chalking up 8 to 10 repetitions of each exercise. And
stretching exercises for flexibility should be part of the routine.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Rosenthal, who is 81, says he's gained confidence and
strength from a weight-training program for members 80 and above
run by his health plan, Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, at its
West Roxbury, Mass.facility.
</P>
<P>
   He and other 80- and 90-year-olds spend an hour twice a week
going through arm and leg exercises with progressively heavier
weights. They've also been given bags to carry the weights home for
a third session during the week.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after two years, Rosenthal says he's stronger, has better
balance, and needs no help getting out of a chair. ``I have less
fear of falling from being off-balance, and that's important,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, Marie Warren, 64, discovered to her dismay
that she had been gaining a pound or two a year since age 50. When
she went to the doctor after a long interval, Warren was told she
was 30 pounds overweight, was developing diabetes, had high blood
pressure, and some abnormal blood cell measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse practitioner Mary Kane in the Burlington, Mass. center of
Harvard Vanguard sent Warren to a dietician and put her on a
regimen of walking 30 to 45 minutes a day, as well as strength
training.
</P>
<P>
   Rippe, the Tufts cardiologist and exercise specialist,
commented, ``She got good health care. Good for her doctors for
saying that her weight was her biggest risk _ she had probably
tripled her risk of heart disease and quintupled her risk of
diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated the idea of being sick, so I really buckled down,''
says Warren. Within four months she had shed her extra weight, her
blood pressure and blood sugar readings became normal, and she
says, ``I'll never feel the way I did in my 30s, but I think I
should feel better in my old age.''

EVERYTHING IS GO FOR EUROPEAN TRAVEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the end of fighting in Kosovo, travel to Europe by
Americans is expected to accelerate through the summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is go _ again,'' said Joseph Buhler of Switzerland,
US chairman of the 29-nation European Travel Commission. There had
been reports that travel to Europe had ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Buhler said that the Kosovo conflict caused few cancellations to
Europe; however, a larger but unknown number suspended or delayed
bookings especially to the areas near Kosovo. ``We expect that most
of these people will renew their plans with their travel agents,''
said Buhler. ``Europe is just too good a deal to pass up.'' Buhler
said the European Travel Commission continues to forecast a record
5.95 million departures by Americans to Europe this summer, or 5
percent more than last year, and that this would be followed by a
record traffic in autumn when off-peak prices go into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the areas that have been affected by travel are
destinations in the Mediterranean region and cruises there and
along the Danube. Travelers who have put off plans for these
vacations might reconsider, especially now that many tours and
cruises are on sale. Reduced prices of from $100 to $500 a person
on tours to Greece are being featured in advertisments cosponsored
by the Greek National Tourist Organization.. ``These prices are
unbeatable,'' said George Kouros, director of the Greek National
Tourist Office in New York. ``And the options will suit any
style.'' For information, call the Greek Tourist Office at
212-421-5777 or send an e-mail to GNTO(at)greektourism.com.
</P>
<P>
   Buhler notes that Europe's calendar is full of unique events,
and ``we've even arranged for an eclipse of the sun (Aug. 11), with
the path of totality crossing the heart of Europe.'' For a free
copy of events and other information, call 800-816-7530 and request
a copy of ``Planning Your Trip to Europe.''

Nude week
</P>
<P>
   If you like to travel light, this is the week to do it: Nude
Recreation Week continues through July 11. Some 233 clubs, resorts,
and RV campgrounds in North America are participating with open
houses, festivals, and other events. If the thought of a
clothing-optional vacation is of interest, call the American
Association for Nude Recreation for the location of events:
800-TRY-NUDE or www.aanr.com.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
Kosovo help
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers are being sought to help Kosovo refuges rebuild their
lives. Cross-Cultural Solutions, a nonprofit organization that
regularly sends volunteers overseas to work on educational, health,
and social projects, is seeking people who can volunteer three
weeks and fund their own way to immediately assist ethnic Albanian
refugees along the Macedonian border. The program is not for
everyone, the organization reports. Volunteers should be over 21,
emotionally stable, and mature and willing to face potentially
disturbing situations, temperatures up to 100 degrees, modest
living arrangements, and uncertainty as to work assignments. The
program costs $2,400, including food, lodging, and staff guidance
but does not include air fare. For information, call Cross-Cultrual
Solutions at 800-380-4777 or, on the Web, visit
www.crossculturalsolutions.org.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
Upcoming
</P>
<P>
   The 30th anniversary celebration of the Apollo 11 mission will
be held July 18-20 at the US Space &AMP; Rocket Center in Huntsville,
Ala. Apollo astronauts, including moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, will
attend. For information, call 256-837-3400.
</P>
<P>
   The rich music and dance traditions of the Southern Appalachians
will come to life in downtown Asheville, N.C., when performers hit
the stage during the 72d Mountain Dance and Folk Festival, and the
smaller and more spontaneous Shindig on the Green. For information
on the Aug. 5-7 event, call 828-257-4530. The Shindig on the Green
is being held Saturday nights now through Sept. 4. For more
Asheville information, call 800-280-0005.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Boston's Harborfest ends this week doesn't mean the
fun ends in Beantown. Next weekend marks the 70th All Star Game &AMP;
Weekend, and while not everyone can get into Fenway Park, the John
Hancock FanFest at the Hynes Convention Center promises lots of
activities for all ages. Later in the summer there's the 100th
Davis Cup July 16-18 and the Ryder Cup/PGA Sept. 19-27. For all
that's happening, call the Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau and ask for the 88-page Boston Travel Planner, including a
Family Value Pass loaded with discounts: telephone 888-SEE-BOSTON
(888-733-2678).

<P>
   The annual Native American Festival and Maine Indian
Basketmakers Sale will be held Saturday, July 10, at the College of
the Atlantic in Bar Harbor. Artists from the four Maine tribes _
the Maliseet, Micmac, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot _ will
demonstrate and sell their work. Festival events include
storytelling, traditional drumming, dancing, and singing. Native
American food will also be sold. The festival is known for the

Lyme warning
</P>
<P>
   Vacationers headed to wooded, bushy, or overgrown grassy areas
might consider the new vaccine for Lyme disease, an infection
caused by bacteria transmitted via the bite of ticks that live on
deer or white-footed mice. ``But, the new vaccine might prove
tricky for travelers who do not plan their trips far in advance,''
said Dr. Cliff Dacso with the Travel Medicine Service at Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston. ``Recommendations call for vaccine
doses to be given in three injections over the course of a year.
Booster shots may be needed over time.'' Dacso noted that no
vaccine offers perfect protection protection so he encourages
nature enthusiasts to practice standard preventive measures such as
wearing protective clothing, using tick repellent, and removing
attached ticks s quickly as possible. Caught early, Lyme disease is
highly treatable. Left untreated, in rare cases the illness can
lead to a disabling arthritis and neurological problems.
Individuals who are at high risk are those who live or play in the
Northeast or Mid-Atlantic states, particularly along the coastal
areas from Maine to Virginia.

Canoe adventure
</P>
<P>
   The legends of Lewis and Clark, mountain men, pioneers, and
native Americans will come alive on canoe voyages of discovery on
Montana's Upper Missouri River. Participants travel on modern,
34-foot'long voyageur canoes, which replicate those used by early
fur traders. Thirteen four-day and three six-day safaris will be
featured. Prices begin at $850. For information, call River

 &HT;    `There is nothing left ... I feel like I have died'

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Skender Rahimi, 41, is married and has three
daughters and two sons, ages 14 to 20. He worked as a technician in
a battery factory in Gnjilane, population 50,000, in Kosovo. He had
an eight-bedroom house, two tractors and land to grow corn,
potatoes and other crops for his family. He tells his story below.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing left of our past. I lost all those memories.
I feel like I have died. Everything is burned down of our home. The
Serb army took all our possessions out of the house _ the
furniture, the washer, dryer, clothes, photos _ and torched
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grenaded our village. Some people escaped, and those who
didn't they killed them. What possessions the Serbs couldn't carry
with them, they torched.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stayed after (the attack), they would shoot you down or
slit your throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even describe the terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any normal person with a normal conscience would never expect
they'd one day be forced to leave their homes and their way of
life. That's how we felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here two months in the United States. Our first
day in this apartment, our Vietnamese neighbor gave us some food
and this (root beer) soda. I feel bad as the head of the family
that I can't provide like I've done all my life. My wife, Vahide,
is also an outstanding tailor. And my oldest daughter had just
finished studying to be a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone were to give me U.S. citizenship, I would take it
right away. I would, and then go back to live in Kosovo, and if
things went wrong again, then we could come back with no problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two sisters and a mother and father in Kosovo. I do not
know if they are dead or alive. They do not know if I am dead or
alive. They are always on my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something has happened to my sisters, they could give me
the whole United States and it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't be
anything.''

 &HT;    Scarcity of jobs among problems Kosovar refugees face
 &HT;    (EDS: WITH PHOTOS AND SIDEBARS (REFUGEE-PROFILES and
REFUGEE-HELP.)

<P>
   ATLANTA _ They arrived with nothing and everything.
</P>
<P>
   And months after fleeing their homes and homeland in tears and
terror, that is what many Kosovo refugees still have as they start
over in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in terms of possessions. Everything in terms of the
people they love.
</P>
<P>
   They want to embrace their new country. But most have seen
little of it, beyond their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Their apartments are modest, yet functional and clean. Some pass
time in bare living rooms, sitting on metal folding chairs
patiently waiting for trucks to deliver donated furniture. Many
watch show after show on donated television sets, but usually only
the children catch a recognizable English word or two.
</P>
<P>
   Often, mothers and fathers share mattresses with sons and
daughters, while grandparents, uncles, nephews or aunts sleep in a
second bedroom. Wives and daughters try to cook familiar food, but
they're often stymied by not knowing the English word for a key
ingredient. Yeast to bake bread, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Although resettlement agencies provided a few days of
orientation that included how to count American money, call 911 for
emergencies, shop in a supermarket and ride MARTA, some refugees
lack the confidence to hop a bus or walk beyond the corner
convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gladstone Apartments in southeast Atlanta, one of several
new Kosovar enclaves, refugees are surrounded by neighbors who
don't look like them and cannot converse with them. Did they make a
mistake? Should they have waited it out, like the others they see
on CNN _ the hundreds of thousands of other former tent city
refugees picking up the pieces of their shattered towns in Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, I wouldn't want to go back right now,'' says Halim
Kaleshi, 35, who lives at Gladstone across the street from his
sister. ``I don't know if my house is destroyed or if anything is
left. And there are no jobs there, so why go back?''
</P>
<P>
   A construction worker, Kaleshi knows that eventually he would
find his kind of work in Kosovo, but too many land mines and acts
of revenge make it unsafe now _ and for who knows how long.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kosovo, we all worked for the Serbs. They controlled
everything, so it is better for us here,'' Kaleshi says through
translator Miro Vran, a Croatian who lives in nearby Sandy Springs.
``Just give us a job. We can do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   About 300 Kosovar refugees have been resettled in Georgia by six
nonprofit agencies contracted by the U.S. State Department. The
refugees are spread throughout the Atlanta area: Decatur, Stone
Mountain, Marietta, Lawrenceville; 30 still reside at Jubilee
Partners near Athens, learning skills before they move to Atlanta
in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   They will be given a time frame, courtesy of Uncle Sam, when
they can return to Kosovo to live. But their towns must first be
declared safe, says Sgt. Major Hal Glassman, an Army reservist at
Fort Dix, N.J., where the Kosovars were formally processed. ``The
United States is sponsoring them all, and it is our feeling it is
not yet safe for them to go back,'' Glassman says. ``There will be
a six-month window after the military says it's safe to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees who decide to stay are expected to repay the federal
government the cost of their one-way flight once they get
established and have a job. The loan is about $3,000 for a family
of four to travel from Macedonia. All refugees coming into the
United States (78,000 are expected this year from all countries)
must sign this transportation loan. About half eventually pay it
back, a State Department official said; those who don't are marred
by bad credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 4,042 Kosovars taken in at Fort Dix has asked to
return. ``We haven't had any requests (to turn around and go back)
since the first flight or the last flight from Macedonia,''
Glassman says. ``I think the people who stayed here have a better
understanding of what's happening because we kept them informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more refugees were also processed in Macedonia and
flown directly to New York, then flown to their host cities.
Officially, the United Nations evacuation from Kosovo is over. But
5,000 people who had signed up for U.S. refugee status are still
arriving. The final tally expected: between 12,000 and 13,000.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds still at Fort Dix are expected to be in their new
American cities, ranging from San Diego to Sarasota, Fla., to
Detroit and Dallas, by Saturday. Then Fort Dix's Albanian village
will convert back to a military quarters for the National Guard and
Army Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal Refugee Act, the Kosovars are eligible for
cash assistance, food stamps, Medicaid, Medicare and Social
Security cards. But most choose not to accept cash assistance and
instead sign up for the Early Employment program, says Peter
Herbert, regional director for the International Rescue Committee.
</P>
<P>
   With Early Employment, people attend six weeks of English
classes and learn other skills while using food stamps in the
interim. The agency assists with job placement. Typical beginning
jobs are in manufacturing, hotels, restaurants or in their former
trades such as landscaping and auto repair; refugees with
professional degrees _ teachers, lawyers, physicians, engineers _
typically can't find work in their fields, because of licensing and
language barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Resettlement agencies commit to providing basic housing and
amenities for the first month, along with intensive case management
the first 90 days, including English and how to use public
transportation. Refugees also are linked to volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   After one year, refugees can apply for permanent residency.
After five years, they can take the U.S. citizenship test. They can
retain their U.S. citizenship if they return to live in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Seven U.S. Kosovars already have their citizenship because they
were born here. After the first boy_ named Amerikan_ was born at
Fort Dix, May 6, six more birthdays occurred, Glassman says. ``This
refugee effort was different from others in that we had a lot more
young mothers and a lot more children. And seven new American
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   They sit on a sloping grassy hill under the shade of an oak
tree, lighting GNP generic cigarettes with a communal orange Bic
lighter, and ponder the haves and have nots of their new worlds.
They are brothers, cousins, a brother-in-law, an uncle, nephew,
sons, or new friends.
</P>
<P>
   All live in small two- or three-bedroom brick Gladstone
Apartments. The complex of individual units and looping roads is
often used as a starting point for refugee and immigrant families,
and Catholic Social Services. The agency is now assisting 70
Kosovars, a number expected to soon double.
</P>
<P>
   As firecrackers pop in the distance, the men repeatedly express
thanks to the United States. ``I am very grateful for NATO and
President Clinton for what they have done,'' says Sylejman Dedushi,
a 30-year-old accountant. ``I hope they will solve the problem in
Kosovo and the situation will be much better. ... Now the world
knows we are just people. We're just trying to be who we are and be
left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Alive and intact with their wives, sons and daughters, they know
they are lucky. And, just now they are realizing how fortunate they
were under Fort Dix's ``Operation Provide Refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   There, they received medical and dental checks, vaccinations,
new clothes, toys and English lessons. Plenty of Albanian
translators helped them with American newspapers, magazines and
television news. They even heard ``Voice of America'' and the BBC
in their native language. And in front of 15 computers, they surfed
for Internet Yugoslavian news.
</P>
<P>
   They spent no money, and three times a day, they filed into a
mess hall for hot, hearty meals. Twice daily, the American Red
Cross drove around, Good-Humor style, giving out snacks. Even
Muslim prayer rugs were provided. And when they were sent off to
their new cities, each adult left with $50; teenagers, $20.
</P>
<P>
   But Fort Dix may have been too good. Now, there's not so much
hospitality or help. It's not for a lack of commitment from
resettlement staffs. It's the sheer numbers of this humanitarian
effort.
</P>
<P>
   While it sparked an unprecedented in-flow of clothes,
furnishings, cash and promises of volunteerism from Atlantans in
May, that enthusiasm has waned. The men in this new Albanian
enclave say they need more help translating, someone to drive them
on errands, take their kids to a playground, answer everyday
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Why, for example, have government documents needed to work been
slow in coming? Can someone explain the refugee entitlement system
to them again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I received a check for $140 to take care of seven people in my
family, but I don't know how long it is to last. A week, a month? I
don't know,'' says Mitat Berkolli, a 50-year-old who worked as
postal carrier in the capitol, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to complain. ... We are ready to work, to do
anything, absolutely anything,'' adds Kaleshi, the construction
worker. ``But many of us have not left this complex since we got
here. We don't know what Atlanta looks like. It would be great to
get on a bus and see downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again among the Kosovo men, two names are mentioned
with great warmth _ Rebecca and Michael. Both work for Catholic
Social Services, which has a community center at Gladstone
Apartments and a staff of 30. Rebecca is Rebecca Kloss, assistant
to the agency director, and Michael is Michael Gaertner, a
volunteer who often stops by to take them shopping, help with
English, and let the teenage boys send electronic mail on his
laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Kloss listened to their concerns recently and expressed as much
frustration as her clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time, time, it takes time. But knowing they want to work is
good, and we are trying as best we can to address all their
problems'' she says. ``But honestly, the situation is too many, too
soon. We've had seven families arrive in the last two weeks. Our
caseworkers are overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars also present a unique challenge because they are
not a ``typical'' refugee from a poor country, Kloss says. They are
European, mostly upper-middleclass professionals with families used
to such material trappings as computers, cell phones, video games,
and nice cars. They are also an ethnic population not prone to
migrate, so there are few pockets of Albanians in the United
States, and hardly any in Atlanta, Kloss says. That means there's
no established Albanian community to help newcomers, unlike
communities for Vietnamese, African and Cuban refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one Albanian translator and we just hired him. We're
looking, but we haven't found another translator,'' she says.
Although many can understand other languages within the former
Yugoslavia, it's not easy to predict how they'll interact with
Croatians, Bosnians or others who might volunteer to interpret,
Kloss explains.
</P>
<P>
   Maryellen LeDuc, a volunteer with Catholic Services who teaches
English to the dozen Berkolli children every Tuesday, introduced
them to her Victoria Estates neighborhood near Emory University
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   They watched an Independence Day parade, ate watermelon and
communicated with hands and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is once my neighbors get to know them and where they
live, they'll start interacting with them,'' LeDuc says. ``One plan
I have is to take them all to a Braves game. The kids are getting
very excited about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Andi Williams, her husband, Jeff, and two children may soon live
above a Kosovar family being resettled by World Relief.
</P>
<P>
   In Peachtree City, the Williams family has a spacious basement
apartment to use as temporary housing for the refugees. Their
effort is just one of many at Providence United Methodist Church,
which is sponsoring the family. Another member is donating use of a
new home he just purchased, so the families can initially live
there, Williams says. Donated furnishings will fill it, and
mortgage and other living expenses have been raised to cover the
families' first three months.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a handle on golf-cart driving is also part of
resettlement for Williams' guests in the city lined with 60 miles
of golf-cart paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be easier for them instead of needing a car to drive,
they can just go to the grocery store or zip through McDonald's in
a golf cart,'' Williams says. ``The one thing we don't have is a
translator, but I think they'll understand when they see a golf
cart in everyone's driveway.''

 &HT;    Race car team slaves away for solar car
 &HT;    By Erin J. Walter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's the middle of the night, and an incessant
buzzing noise fills the dark basement of the University of Texas
Experimental Sciences Building. The maintenance workers, who fill
the void during the day, have long since gone home, leaving the
cluttered, un-air-conditioned dungeon almost unattended.
</P>
<P>
   But not quite.
</P>
<P>
   In a workshop that, with fencing for walls, can only be
described as an oversized cage, members of the Longhorn Solar Race
Car Team slave away for their master, a solar car named Solstice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an obsession,'' said Amrou Al-Sharif, team president and
recent UT mechanical engineering graduate. ``In the past year I've
only taken two classes. My senior design project was on the plan to
race this car. Sometimes we sleep in the shop.''
</P>
<P>
   The solar race car team, a club of about 30 students from
various academic disciplines, has whittled down to a few seriously
devoted engineering majors during the past three months. The
reason: Sunrayce '99, a race in June that took student-built solar
cars on a 10-day trek along the East Coast and demanded major time
commitments from student automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many sleepless nights in the basement, the Longhorns did
not get the Solstice car completed in time for the race. But club
members traveled to West Virginia for the trials, working on the
car along way.
</P>
<P>
   That determination in the face of probable disappointment has
been typical of the team, which placed second in the 1991
California Clean Air Race and fourth in the 1996 American Tour de
Sol, Al-Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In April, we drove 24 hours to the Michigan trials just to be
there and see how we fit in,'' he said. ``They gave us the Yearn to
Learn award for the university that drove the farthest knowing they
couldn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that race season is over, Austin's resident solar-power
enthusiasts are turning their attention to local audiences. The
club plans to complete the car this summer and take it on a tour of
schools and businesses to generate interest in solar and electric
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you drive a solar car to work and park it out in the sun
for seven or eight hours, it could be charging its battery while
you work,'' said Gary Hallock, team adviser and UT engineering
professor. ``It could make a good commuting vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Solstice racer is not much smaller than a normal car, but it
sits low to the ground to reduce wind resistance. The car contains
a 15-horsepower motor, weighs about 850 pounds and has just enough
room for one driver. Seven hundred 4-by-4-inch solar cells cover
the vehicle's tubular aluminum frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car has no air conditioning, and it isn't the most
comfortable thing in the world to be driving,'' Hallock said. ``But
the machining and parts are like a work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept for that unconventional artwork was hatched two
years ago, but limited money meant the team could not buy parts and
start building the car until a few months ago. While schools near
automotive centers, such as Detroit, had little trouble finding
money, the Longhorns did everything from selling nachos at Wal-Mart
to digging into their own pockets to pay for the $120,000 car,
Al-Sharif said. Ford Motor Co. chipped in $5,000, and the
university added $2,000, but much of the money raised came from
Adopt-A-Cell donations from members' friends, family and
professors.
</P>
<P>
   The team has vowed to zoom past the checkered flag at the next
Sunrayce, in 2001, but for now is back in the basement workshop it
has called home for so many nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the classic underdog challenge,'' said Dave Conrad, the
team's corporate relations chairman and a recent UT mechanical
engineering graduate. ``We go up against schools with 10 times as
much money as us. I couldn't pass that up.''

 &HT;    Texas legislation price tag increased
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If anyone wants to recreate the 1999 legislative
session, here are the necessary ingredients: 140 days, 181
lawmakers, a governor eyeing the White House, a freshman lieutenant
governor, hordes of lobbyists and about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. With the final bills trickling in, state lawmakers
spent about $20 million during the five-month session that began
Jan. 12 and ended May 31.
</P>
<P>
   That's nearly one dollar for each Texan, or $3,000 per bill
filed (nearly 6,000) or $12,000 per bill passed (1,638, including
some resolutions).
</P>
<P>
   While that's a big number, it's merely a drop in the state's $94
billion budget bucket _ and not enough, according to at least one
government watchdog organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need and deserve more staff and information and resources
to make their decisions,'' said Tom `Smitty' Smith, head of Public
Citizen in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A penny-wise legislative budget costs pounds later, Smith said.
That's because Texas' 150 House members and 31 senators often rely
on lobbyists and special interest groups that provide incomplete or
misleading information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the relatively short period of time that our Legislature
has to debate multibillion-dollar budgets and policies that
literally affect the rest of the nation, it's shortsighted to keep
them on such tight budget,'' Smith said. ``We ought to provide our
legislators with the tools they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a former legislative staffer, said he's seen lawmakers
and staffers rely on lobbyists for information about bills because
lawmakers have inadequate information before voting on bills.
</P>
<P>
   Texas spends a healthy amount on its Legislature, compared to
other states. For fiscal year 1997, which ended Aug. 31, 1998,
Texas ranked fifth in the nation in total dollars spent on the
Legislature, but 41st nationally for legislative spending per state
resident, according to the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million figure for the 1999 session is less than half
the money lawmakers set aside for all legislative spending from
Sept. 1, 1998, to Aug. 31, 1999. Other money goes to interim
studies, keeping the lights on and preparing for the next session.
</P>
<P>
   The amount spent on the Legislature _ an amount lawmakers decide
during debates on the overall state budget _ has steadily
increased. In fiscal year 1993 _ Sept. 1, 1992 to Aug. 31, 1993 _
Texas spent $51.25 million on the House and Senate. During the
current fiscal year, lawmakers set aside $59.11 million for the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Erickson is a senior research analyst for the national
legislatures conference. Despite increases, she said, legislative
spending remains at less than 1 percent of the overall budget in
every state, including Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that legislative branch expenditures, compared
to other government expenditures, are very small,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   So how can Texans decide if they're getting enough bang for
their millions of bucks? Suzy Woodford, head of Common Cause Texas,
said it depends on who's asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not people will consider it money well-spent
depends on whether they got the legislation they wanted,'' she
said. ``I'd say that's conservative (spending).''
</P>
<P>
   Woodford agreed lawmakers need more resources and flexibility to
hire more staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to rely on somebody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, spokesman for the Senate's presiding officer, Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry, said the best way to assess spending is consider
how much the Legislature accomplishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature meets infrequently, spends frugally, works
effectively and then goes home to live under the laws that they
pass,'' he said. ``The Texas Legislature accomplishes more in 140
days than many states do in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bender, director of communications for the House, said
technology and hard work from representatives help keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great difference between our Legislature _
particularly the House _ and say, Congress, because so much of the
work on researching and drafting legislation is done personally by
the members rather than being completely done by staff,'' Bender
said. ``The House has made significant investments in new
technology and information systems that make the members and the
public better informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan also said legislative staffers, about 1,500 of them,
and smart lawmakers spend the money wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never have too much information, but the process works
well,'' Sullivan said. ``The citizens have been well served.''

other states. For fiscal year 1997, which ended Aug. 31, 1998,
Texas ranked fifth in the nation in total dollars spent on the
Legislature, but 41st nationally for legislative spending per state
resident, according to the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million figure for the 1999 session is less than half
the money lawmakers set aside for all legislative spending from
Sept. 1, 1998, to Aug. 31, 1999. Other money goes to interim
studies, keeping the lights on and preparing for the next session.
</P>
<P>
   The amount spent on the Legislature _ an amount lawmakers decide
during debates on the overall state budget _ has steadily
increased. In fiscal year 1993 _ Sept. 1, 1992 to Aug. 31, 1993 _
Texas spent $51.25 million on the House and Senate. During the
current fiscal year, lawmakers set aside $59.11 million for the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Erickson is a senior research analyst for the national
legislatures conference. Despite increases, she said, legislative
spending remains at less than 1 percent of the overall budget in
every state, including Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that legislative branch expenditures, compared
to other government expenditures, are very small,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   So how can Texans decide if they're getting enough bang for
their millions of bucks? Suzy Woodford, head of Common Cause Texas,
said it depends on who's asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not people will consider it money well-spent
depends on whether they got the legislation they wanted,'' she
said. ``I'd say that's conservative (spending).''
</P>
<P>
   Woodford agreed lawmakers need more resources and flexibility to
hire more staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to rely on somebody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, spokesman for the Senate's presiding officer, Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry, said the best way to assess spending is consider
how much the Legislature accomplishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature meets infrequently, spends frugally, works
effectively and then goes home to live under the laws that they
pass,'' he said. ``The Texas Legislature accomplishes more in 140
days than many states do in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bender, director of communications for the House, said
technology and hard work from representatives help keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great difference between our Legislature _
particularly the House _ and say, Congress, because so much of the
work on researching and drafting legislation is done personally by
the members rather than being completely done by staff,'' Bender
said. ``The House has made significant investments in new
technology and information systems that make the members and the
public better informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan also said legislative staffers, about 1,500 of them,
and smart lawmakers spend the money wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never have too much information, but the process works
well,'' Sullivan said. ``The citizens have been well served.''

 &HT;    Emission woes? Find trained mechanic
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About this time last year, I was trying to find a
repair shop for my daughter's car after it had failed its emissions
test. I created a fictitious though probable situation, a NOx
failure, and called around to various shops in search of repair.
</P>
<P>
   I asked specific questions about mechanics' credentials and shop
equipment for repairing emission failures. Unfortunately, the
results of my calls confirmed my suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of auto repair shops that can competently diagnose and
repair vehicles that fail the state emissions test is indeed
shallow. However, the situation is far from hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   If your vehicle fails its emissions test, the inspector is
supposed to hand you, or direct you to, a blue-and-white pamphlet
containing information about what to do if your vehicle fails.
</P>
<P>
   I know that when your car fails the test, the last thing you
want to be bothered with is reading, but this little document
contains a bunch of great information. I know _ I helped put it
together.
</P>
<P>
   The insert headed ``If your vehicle does not pass the
inspection, don't panic'' is a valuable guide that will point you
in the right direction for getting your car fixed. It's not
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The use of technical terminology is prefaced by: ``When
selecting a repair technician/mechanic, ask a few basic questions.
Relax. You don't have to understand the questions; just make sure
the answers are yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds easy enough so far, right? Let me elaborate on some of
the items that you want a ``yes'' answer to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has your mechanic recently completed a state-certified
emission repair or factory training program, or are they
ASE-certified in A6 and A8 and L1 categories?'' Ask to see their
certifications.
</P>
<P>
   Several states provide for or require mechanics performing
emissions test failure-related repairs to complete an approved
course. Georgia's course, which is offered at four area technical
schools, is voluntary. Mechanics who pass the course are issued a
certificate from the school they attended and get blue patches for
the sleeves of their uniforms. These help consumers identify those
who have passed the state training.
</P>
<P>
   Factory training is good for new cars but is not much help with
older vehicles that fail the test. A mechanic's ASE certificates
should be displayed in a customer access area. They have a light
gray background with a blue gear in the upper corner. One with a
blue gear and a gold sticker is better.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanic's name and status will be printed in large type.
The areas of proficiency (A1 through A8) will be listed to the left
with the corresponding expiration date on the right. A6 and A8
certifications pertain to electrical systems and basic engine
performance. These are minimal skills when repairing emissions
failures.
</P>
<P>
   The L1 credential, for advanced engine performance, is a
separate certificate signifying the mechanic has passed a special
test on vehicle computer controls and emissions systems, ideal for
dealing with these types of failures.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to expiration dates of certifications. Additional
certificates issued by aftermarket companies, such as Snap-On Tools
or NAPA in the areas of fuel, electrical, ignition and gas
analysis, are also a good indication that the mechanic is keeping
abreast of current repair technologies and procedures.

 &HT;    Complaints about TV show illustrate sex-education divide
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If you've ever wondered what state-run TV is like
in other countries, you'd have had a sense of it one night last
March on local ABC affiliate KXXV.
</P>
<P>
   That night the station essentially handed over a prime-time hour
to the state for what would appear to be a very good cause:
teen-age abstinence from sex.
</P>
<P>
   The program, ``Parents, Teens, Sex and Answers,'' was presented
as if a KXXV news production and introduced on the news set. In
effect, though, it was co-produced by the state _ by the McLennan
County Collaborative Abstinence Program _ MCCAP.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAP has a two-year budget of $657,950 to deliver an abstinence
message to the teens of McLennan County. That's from a pool of $50
million authorized by Washington in the welfare reform act of 1995,
funds administered by the Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Many will praise it as a good deed by KXXV, by a Republican
Congress and by Austin. But here's what others said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We can no longer depend on this station for newsworthy
information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dismayed by the lack of accurate and significant
content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did this program exclude some necessary information,
but (it) was extremely misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements were contained in letters to ABC and KXXV
management from local viewers including some physicians. Their
general thrust: While abstinence is a commendable theme, the
program offered no balance on a controversial subject.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it didn't. The program did what the state funded MCCAP
to do, which is present one side of a public issue. Abstinence
education as funded by the '95 Congress meant abstaining from that
balance.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the program leaned heavily on the asserted
fallibility of condoms to protect against sexually transmitted
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``A condom is of little or no value in protecting patients from
the (human) papilloma infection,'' read an on-screen graphic.
</P>
<P>
   But Emory University's Contraceptive Technology, using Centers
for Disease Control data, says that used consistently and
correctly, latex or plastic condoms ``provide highly effective
protection against bacterial and viral STDs (sexually transmitted
diseases).''
</P>
<P>
   It's a point MCCAP not dare acknowledge. Advocacy against sex is
its mission, and condoms come with sex, or so we must hope in the
age of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Condoms do pose risks, and do not provide 100 percent protection
against disease. Yes, there's no such thing as ``safe sex.'' But
there is safer sex. Dismissing condoms because they don't provide
100 percent protection from STDs is like saying, ``Don't bother to
wash your hands. You'll still get germs.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ``focus group'' portrayed on the program, no one supported
teaching students about contraception in sex education class. (The
only thing we should teach about contraceptives, says the
abstinence-only line, is that they fail to protect.)
</P>
<P>
   The focus group was portrayed as a sampling of people just like
you and me. But in a broader sampling released in June by the
Sexuality Information and Education Council, nine of 10 people said
information about contraception, birth control and condoms should
be given to high schoolers in the context of abstinence-based sex
education.
</P>
<P>
   Though MCCAP's sexuality education curriculum is being used in
school districts throughout the county, its abstention from a
balanced discussion of contraception in part led to its rejection
by Waco Independent School District trustees after the WISD Health
Advisory Council opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's more than one side to the spiel Congress funded and
MCCAP promotes. The goal is worthy: abstinence. Too bad it doesn't
deem open discussion just as worthy.

 &HT;    Y2K stockpiling supplies available through Internet
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Barry Levinson was part of the problem. In his
view, he's now part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   The computer consultant said he helped write some of the old
codes that have hobbled the world's computers, setting up a
potential year-end crash because they can't read the digits 00 as
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Levinson isn't one of the army of computer programmers doing
remedial coding to fix the Y2K bug. Instead, he started stockpiling
emergency food supplies for his family, as a hedge against major
economic disruptions, then turned to selling emergency food to
others on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife said I was nuts,'' Levinson said. ``I told her it's
like insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Y2K analysts increasingly see a diminishing of such fears among
the public. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, for instance, recently took
down his alarming Web site on Y2K, saying he now foresees fewer
problems than he once did.
</P>
<P>
   But some people in the Austin area are still following
Levinson's and other Y2K entrepreneurs leads, despite assurances
from government and business that the computer bug is being fixed
and will not close banks and groceries, turn off electricity or
water, hogtie the police or cost people their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Electric generators, for instance, which can replace
utility-supplied electricity if they are powerful enough, have been
selling well in the Austin since January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not selling them as feverishly as we were back in March,
but we still get calls every day,'' said Bill Bellinghausen, a
salesman with Austin Power Generation Systems. ``Not everyone buys.
Some have sticker shock. A nice (generator) is probably $1,200.
They go up to $25,000.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stadtmiller of Austin bought a generator for his home,
where he also stockpiles emergency food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling people for five years to get their beans and
Bibles ready,'' said Stadtmiller, who hosts a satellite radio
program called Truth Radio which focuses on possible Y2K
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Energy, the city-owned electric utility, discourages
people from hooking generators to homes ``because they impact the
system and may cause a problem,'' said utility spokesman Ed Clark,
such as starting fires or interrupting utility service to other
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the utility announced it is ready to provide
electricity on and after Jan. 1, 2000, with no anticipated
disruptions. But Levinson said some people won't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see brownouts and disruptions,'' he said. ``It's not the big
cities that are going to be the problem. It'll be the little ones,
and they'll demand power from the rest of us. We're so dependent on
technology that if the electricity was cut off for just a few
weeks, well.''
</P>
<P>
   For every official assurance that the Y2K bug won't be as
fearsome as alarmists predict, Levinson has an anecdote to turn the
conversation in the opposite direction. There's his friend in
Washington, D.C., for example, who recently packed up his family
and moved to New Zealand. Why New Zealand?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never communicated that,'' Levinson said. ``My guess is
it's a more civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson recently sold his CSIN.com (``America's Discount Source
for Y2K Supplies``) because the business was becoming more than he
could handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Nutting, operations manager at Banna Bay Trading Company,
understands. Last spring, Nutting couldn't keep MREs in stock. The
military's Meal Ready to Eat comes in cases of 12 for around $80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers had dried the supply up and were driving up the
price,'' said Nutting. ``We're still selling quite a few, but it's
tapered off considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadtmiller, who took over Levinson's CSIN.com, thinks emergency
food is a viable business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales have slowed due to the government putting out
misinformation on Y2K,'' Stadtmiller said. ``It was running half a
million dollars a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson got out of the food business to devote time to a new
Web venture, Letsgotobelize.com, which sells condominiums and
building lots in the Central American nation of Belize to Y2K
worriers who want to leave the country until the anticipated
disruptions ease.
</P>
<P>
   Belize isn't as far away as New Zealand, and some Texans already
vacation there, so it's familiar territory and a good place to buy
a vacation home. And, being relatively untechnological, Levinson
said, Belize isn't expected to have many Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson got rid of his family's emergency food stockpile. He
doesn't need it anymore. He's got a waterfront condo in Belize
where he plans to spend New Year's with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if everything's fine afterwards, we'll come back,'' he
said.

<P>
   Karl Nutting, operations manager at Banna Bay Trading Company,
understands. Last spring, Nutting couldn't keep MREs in stock. The
military's Meal Ready to Eat comes in cases of 12 for around $80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers had dried the supply up and were driving up the
price,'' said Nutting. ``We're still selling quite a few, but it's
tapered off considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadtmiller, who took over Levinson's CSIN.com, thinks emergency
food is a viable business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales have slowed due to the government putting out
misinformation on Y2K,'' Stadtmiller said. ``It was running half a
million dollars a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson got out of the food business to devote time to a new
Web venture, Letsgotobelize.com, which sells condominiums and
building lots in the Central American nation of Belize to Y2K
worriers who want to leave the country until the anticipated
disruptions ease.
</P>
<P>
   Belize isn't as far away as New Zealand, and some Texans already
vacation there, so it's familiar territory and a good place to buy
a vacation home. And, being relatively untechnological, Levinson
said, Belize isn't expected to have many Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson got rid of his family's emergency food stockpile. He
doesn't need it anymore. He's got a waterfront condo in Belize
where he plans to spend New Year's with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if everything's fine afterwards, we'll come back,'' he
said.

 &HT;    History has been fickle in its dealings with La Grange
 &HT;    By Chuck Lindell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA GRANGE, Texas _ If not for Sam Houston's mile-wide stubborn
streak, this could have been the capital of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Austin got the lawmakers and lobbyists while La Grange
found fame down other paths _ a fruit-topped pastry and a
whorehouse widely acclaimed as the best in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   History, you understand, has been fickle in its dealings with La
Grange.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this town halfway between Austin and Houston deeply
appreciates its past. Maybe because every visit to La Grange's
courthouse square is a 1950s tour of bakery smells, window shopping
and pharmacies that deserve an ``apothecary'' sign out front.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one block off the square is a 102-year-old railroad
depot, its ornately carved gables painted dark red and green. This
building is for sale _ the minimum bid a reasonable $35,000. But
before scraping together the earnest money, know that the depot
will not necessarily be sold to the highest bidder, but to the best
potential user.
</P>
<P>
   How else to keep history from being demolished or carried off to
grace another town?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would just would break my heart to see something happen to
it,'' said Gale Lincke, a La Grange railroad buff who intends to
bid for the depot. ``You look at it and you can picture the steam
training pulling in, the women in petticoats . . . with carriages
pulling up to carry them home.''
</P>
<P>
   This German-Czech town has lost other old buildings to nearby
communities that lacked La Grange's long history, but sought to
capitalize on the cachet of age. That won't happen this time.
</P>
<P>
   The La Grange Area Chamber of Commerce bought the depot in 1981,
fixed it up and outgrew it 10 years later. The chamber moved into
the renovated county jail _ where the hanging rope is on display
and prankster ghosts are said to prowl _ and rented the depot to a
beauty shop, a hair salon and today's tenant, a video rental shop.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to get out of the real estate business, said Margo
Johnson, the chamber's president.
</P>
<P>
   Sealed bids are due by July 28 and will be evaluated by the
chamber's board based on price, intended use, time line for repairs
(the slate roof needs a $6,000 fix-up), whether the depot would be
moved and whether the new owner will accept deed restrictions so
the building cannot be moved or torn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that the depot needs some attention,'' Johnson
said. ``It probably needs to be turned into a museum, but the
chamber doesn't have the financial wherewithal.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsure anybody would be interested in the depot, Johnson made
her first telephone call to Lincke, one half of a husband-wife
train enthusiast team who think nothing of driving for hours and
waiting late into the night, all to see a certain train whistle by.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what rail fans do. This is their high,'' said Lincke,
who runs a Hallmark card shop out of the courthouse square's oldest
structure, built in 1855. ``Rail fans are a nutty bunch of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Just nutty enough to offer to buy the depot, said Lincke, who
serves on the boards of the local school district and Lower
Colorado River Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The city has also stepped in, led by a train nut of its own _
Arnold Romberg, ``a rail buff and City Council member, in that
order,'' he said by way of introduction. Romberg envisions a museum
and public meeting space that would anchor the town's grand plans
for new sidewalks and improved pedestrian access.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just history. It's the future, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the ways of government are slow, Romberg said, and he's not
sure the City Council can meet the chamber's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be a problem. A coalition is forming between the
city and its train nuts, both of whom envision a rail museum
stocked with memorabilia sitting in attics from days when rail was
king in La Grange.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it means that we can preserve this thing, I'll buy it,''
Lincke said. ``But I think it will be a group of citizens willing
to invest and work with city.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber has received three letters of intent to bid on the
depot _ from the Linckes, the city and a La Grange woman who did
not state her intentions. Interest has been high, and other
possible buyers have expressed interest in turning the depot into a
pub or artist's studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first wanted to sell it, we were concerned nobody
wanted to buy it. Now, everyone wants it,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   When the train line came through La Grange in the 1850s,
everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of settlers brought expanded business opportunities and a
building boom. La Grange became a center for trade. The train shook
up the social scene, putting folks a relatively quick ride away
from the big city. Rail's heyday ended as highways and the
automobile took precedence, and the last passenger train stopped in
La Grange sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Left behind
was the depot built by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad in
1897 to replace a 12-year-old station that had burned down.
</P>
<P>
   A postcard bearing a 1910 postmark shows the train station has
changed little beyond a darker coat of paint, an air conditioner,
landscaping and a paved parking lot. Many windows contain the
original glass, and the charm of the wood-finish interior can't be
hidden by peeling paint or flashy posters advertising the latest
video release. Sliding wooden doors still open into a rough-hewn
room where cargo once was stored.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,423-square-foot depot, appraised at $34,760, sits on a
quarter acre.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other intangible factors that inflate the
station's value to a city changed by rail, Romberg said. ``We have
a nice downtown here, and this is one piece of that fabric,'' said
the rail buff.
</P>
<P>
   The Lukas family has been serving fruit-topped pastries known as
kolaches for 52 years. On good days, Lukas Bakery's intoxicating
aroma wafts across Main Street to envelope the Fayette County
Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Made fresh every day, by hand, no preservatives,'' Lucille
Lukas said with evident pride.
</P>
<P>
   A five-decade resident of La Grange, she was pleased to hear
that the old depot will be staying right where it is. ``I thought
somebody would probably buy it and move it off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Weikel's Bakery near Texas 71, Lukas Bakery is
helping redefine La Grange as a kolache capital. But for every
pastry-minded motorist stopping for sweets, there's another visitor
asking after La Grange's most famous attraction _ the Chicken
Ranch, the nearby brothel that inspired the play and movie, ``The
Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothel shut down in the early 1970s. Nothing is left, and
you couldn't get there anyway, Johnson said. It's all private
property.
</P>
<P>
   Such notoriety is a sore spot for residents who, given the
choice, would not have their town's name synonymous with sin.
Others are like artist Sally Maxwell, who shrugs her shoulders,
noting that any publicity is good publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed bag,'' Johnson admits. ``But when people get
here, they see there's so much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson believes the town's population has begun to slowly swell
as casual visitors drop in and fall in love. La Grange has about
4,200 people, up about 250 this decade. So instead of rushing to
find that One Big Employer, the city's chamber of commerce is
working to help existing businesses grow one or two employees at a
time. And business and civic leaders are working to preserve
buildings, like an old train station, that connect La Grange to its
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are standing up and taking notice,'' Johnson said.
``The town was built around that depot. It has always played a
major role.''

 &HT;    Miata's 10th birthday treat
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If not for modesty, Mazda should have gone ahead and
called its 10th anniversary special edition of the MX-5 Miata a
``collector's car.'' The sapphire blue convertible with two-tone
interior is just exclusive enough _ 7,500 for sale worldwide, with
about 3,000 destined for North America _ to qualify for that
status.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost a given that it will, too, with Miata owners being
such a rabid lot that the Miata Club of America has 30,000 members
and a ``Save the Wave'' campaign urging owners to flash their
lights and trade salutes when they meet on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most Miata owners have such fun driving
their cars that they're reluctant to turn loose of the steering
wheel and shifter. Mazda has made playing with the latter even more
fun by shortening the throw so that what was a snick-snick
operation now is a snicksnick process. There's another gear to play
with, too, and having six speeds instead of five does make for
easier touring on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessors, however, the '99 Miata _ no matter
whether it's the $19,770 standard model or the $26,875 anniversary
edition _ is best appreciated on two-lane roads. Sure, you see them
buzzing through heavy traffic in the city and on expressways, but
anyone who says they're comfortable mixing it up with
sport-utilities, vans and trucks whose tires are taller than the
48.3-inch two-seater has fallen victim to over-the-top Miata mania.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable, though. The Miata continues to offer the
sort of driving pleasure and appeal that marked its debut in 1989
and triggered what can only be called a rejuvenation of the
two-seater market, which includes pricier offerings such as BMW's
Z3, Mercedes-Benz's SLK, the Plymouth Prowler and the Panoz
roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Although refined during its decade-long run, the Miata remains a
car that forces its driver to remain in touch with the road, with
plenty of inputs. Feel the bumps, feel the turbulence, feel the
power being fed to the rear wheels and feel the sheer pleasure of
driving a car so basic and simple that the nonpower top can be
raised and lowered without ever leaving the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   The seating is a bit cramped for many because there's only 37.1
inches of headroom with the top up, and almost any driver's knees
will get jammed. Top-up driving also means stopping way short of
overhead traffic lights in order to see them, and the canvas top
does little to eliminate external noise.
</P>
<P>
   The body-color-matching top is the first other than black or tan
for the Miata. Its two-tone, blue-and-black interior is another
first. The colors of the blue synthetic-suede-and-leather seats are
matched by the three-spoke steering wheel and shift knob.
</P>
<P>
   Both the regular and special edition '99 get a seven-horsepower
boost to 140, with peak power coming at about 6,500 rpm, about
1,000 rpm more than the point at which the four-cylinder engine's
torque crests at 119 pounds-feet.
</P>
<P>
   That's sufficient power to give the 2,299-pound Miata zing,
provided the shifter _ no automatic for this version _ is
frequently and properly employed. Maneuverability is exceptional,
thanks to the Miata's short wheelbase (89.2 inches) and a slightly
stiffer suspension that keeps the '99 nearly dead level during
turns.
</P>
<P>
   The collector, uh, anniversary edition clearly isn't for
everyone who wants a two-seater because of its inflated price. But
it does stand out, as does the lesser version, in a niche market
segment catering to traditional sports car enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Mazda MX-5 Miata 10th anniversary edition
sports car
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $28,225 (base: $26,875)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (140
horsepower), six-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, optional power anti-lock disc
brakes ($550)
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: air conditioning, $900
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 24 mpg regular unleaded city; 29 mpg highway

   Y2K-PRECAUTIONS - AUSTIN, Texas - Barry Levinson was part of the
problem. In his view, he's now part of the solution. The computer
consultant said he helped write some of the old codes that have
hobbled the world's computers, setting up a potential year-end
crash because they can't read the digits 00 as the year 2000. But
Levinson isn't one of the army of computer programmers doing
remedial coding to fix the Y2K bug. Instead, he started stockpiling
emergency food supplies for his family, as a hedge against major
economic disruptions, then turned to selling emergency food to
others on the Internet. Y2K analysts increasingly see a diminishing
of such fears among the public. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, for
instance, recently took down his alarming Web site on Y2K, saying
he now foresees fewer problems than he once did. But is it wise to
take Y2K lightly? (Stanley, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

whorehouse widely acclaimed as the best in Texas. History, you
understand, has been fickle in its dealings with La Grange. And yet
this town halfway between Austin and Houston deeply appreciates its
past. Maybe because every visit to La Grange's courthouse square is
a 1950s tour of bakery smells, window shopping and pharmacies that
deserve an ``apothecary'' sign out front. (Lindell, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

 &HT;    Miata's 10th birthday treat
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If not for modesty, Mazda should have gone ahead and
called its 10th anniversary special edition of the MX-5 Miata a
``collector's car.'' The sapphire blue convertible with two-tone
interior is just exclusive enough _ 7,500 for sale worldwide, with
about 3,000 destined for North America _ to qualify for that
status.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost a given that it will, too, with Miata owners being
such a rabid lot that the Miata Club of America has 30,000 members
and a ``Save the Wave'' campaign urging owners to flash their
lights and trade salutes when they meet on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most Miata owners have such fun driving
their cars that they're reluctant to turn loose of the steering
wheel and shifter. Mazda has made playing with the latter even more
fun by shortening the throw so that what was a snick-snick
operation now is a snicksnick process. There's another gear to play
with, too, and having six speeds instead of five does make for
easier touring on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessors, however, the '99 Miata _ no matter
whether it's the $19,770 standard model or the $26,875 anniversary
edition _ is best appreciated on two-lane roads. Sure, you see them
buzzing through heavy traffic in the city and on expressways, but
anyone who says they're comfortable mixing it up with
sport-utilities, vans and trucks whose tires are taller than the
48.3-inch two-seater has fallen victim to over-the-top Miata mania.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable, though. The Miata continues to offer the
sort of driving pleasure and appeal that marked its debut in 1989
and triggered what can only be called a rejuvenation of the
two-seater market, which includes pricier offerings such as BMW's
Z3, Mercedes-Benz's SLK, the Plymouth Prowler and the Panoz
roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Although refined during its decade-long run, the Miata remains a
car that forces its driver to remain in touch with the road, with
plenty of inputs. Feel the bumps, feel the turbulence, feel the
power being fed to the rear wheels and feel the sheer pleasure of
driving a car so basic and simple that the nonpower top can be
raised and lowered without ever leaving the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   The seating is a bit cramped for many because there's only 37.1
inches of headroom with the top up, and almost any driver's knees
will get jammed. Top-up driving also means stopping way short of
overhead traffic lights in order to see them, and the canvas top
does little to eliminate external noise.
</P>
<P>
   The body-color-matching top is the first other than black or tan
for the Miata. Its two-tone, blue-and-black interior is another
first. The colors of the blue synthetic-suede-and-leather seats are
matched by the three-spoke steering wheel and shift knob.
</P>
<P>
   Both the regular and special edition '99 get a seven-horsepower
boost to 140, with peak power coming at about 6,500 rpm, about
1,000 rpm more than the point at which the four-cylinder engine's
torque crests at 119 pounds-feet.
</P>
<P>
   That's sufficient power to give the 2,299-pound Miata zing,
provided the shifter _ no automatic for this version _ is
frequently and properly employed. Maneuverability is exceptional,
thanks to the Miata's short wheelbase (89.2 inches) and a slightly
stiffer suspension that keeps the '99 nearly dead level during
turns.
</P>
<P>
   The collector, uh, anniversary edition clearly isn't for
everyone who wants a two-seater because of its inflated price. But
it does stand out, as does the lesser version, in a niche market
segment catering to traditional sports car enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Mazda MX-5 Miata 10th anniversary edition
sports car
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $28,225 (base: $26,875)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (140
horsepower), six-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, optional power anti-lock disc
brakes ($550)
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: air conditioning, $900
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 24 mpg regular unleaded city; 29 mpg highway

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: When ``hate'' leads to murder
 &HT;    (For release July 7, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A man who identifies himself as Reverend Matt Hale Pontifex
Maximus was distancing himself from Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, the
lunatic who shot blacks, Asians and Jews in Indiana and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   As head of something called the World Church of the Creator _
which I will no further identify as a church as it would be a gross
insult to Christianity _ Pontifex Maximus admitted that Smith once
belonged to his organization but that it does not advocate violence
or illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Pontifex Maximus may say that but anyone reading the sect's
manual or other documents on the Web would easily come to a
conclusion that violence is exactly what it prescribes and can
assume that Smith paid close attention to it while gunning down
people.
</P>
<P>
   How else would you interpret this: ``Destroy and banish all
Jewish thought and influence from society. Work hard to bring about
a White world as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Commandment 8 of the order's 16 commandments; note the
use of the word ``destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Commandment 7 tells the members, ``Phase out all dealings with
Jews as soon as possible. Do not employ niggers or other
coloreds.''
</P>
<P>
   But most significant is a contrast in proclamations. The cult
says in one place that ``Nowhere in our book do we suggest killing
anybody.'' That's likely the part Smith didn't read. What he might
have read, however, was this: ``Whereas Christianity says to `love
your enemies' and to hate your own kind, we say just the opposite.
We say that in order to survive, we must overcome and destroy those
that are a threat to our existence.''
</P>
<P>
   There's that word again: destroy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I am being too literal, but the dictionary definition of
``destroy'' is to tear down; demolish; bring to total defeat;
crush; do away with; kill...
</P>
<P>
   By its own written admission, the coven is a hate group. In its
manual, it says that a person joining this organization
``recognizes both love and hate as the two most powerful driving
forces in life; that both emotions are healthy and essential to
life, and to possess only one and to be deprived of the other is to
be as crippled as a bird with only one wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the manual commands, a member ``hates his enemies, namely
Jews, niggers and mud races.'' (I confess: What's a mud race? Is
that what haters call Asian-Americans?)
</P>
<P>
   This is what Smith had read and it no doubt influenced him. Add
to that: ``To the fulfillment of these religious beliefs, we
Creators forever pledge our Lives, our Sacred Honor, and our
Religious Zeal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clearly stated in the manual that any member of the cult
who commits a crime will be subject to expulsion. The call for the
destruction of the Jewish, black and mud races, to them, is not a
crime but a passive crusade.
</P>
<P>
   But Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, as an alumnus of the organization,
gave literal attention to the ``destruction'' part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Likely Pontifex Maximus does not hand out .380-caliber handguns
to his disciples, but the creed he asks them to follow is
tantamount to creating a time bomb. Smith's bomb went off over the
Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Don't some of those ``commandments'' have a familiar ring to
them, such as something you might read in ``Mein Kampf'' or the
Nuremberg Laws of 1935? Well, yes, the cult admits in writing, but
``whereas Hitler's program was similar to what we are proposing, we
have learned from his failures and have made some significant
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment protects a lot of garbage, both written and
oral, but it's here to stay _ the cost of a democracy, it is
argued.
</P>
<P>
   To hate as fanatically as the group does only can lead to
violence, no matter how often a passive caveat is written in. What
Pontifex Maximus advocates, the economic embargo and destruction of
Jews, blacks and others not deemed to be ``white,'' is the very way
Hitler started. First put them out of business, then ship them off
to the camps, then ``destroy'' them.
</P>
<P>
   Smith took his cue from his hateful alma mater and did what he
felt he had to do. Now Pontifex Maximus is distancing himself from
the horrible crime. It seems to me he'd be better off reading his
manual and other documents, and recognizing that their
hate-inspiring, violence-inducing language was just as responsible
for the crimes of Benjamin Nathaniel Smith as was Smith himself.

 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First came Tae-Bo. Now Tae-Bo injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Tae-Bo fitness craze, with its rhythmic kicking and
punching, added a new spark to aerobic exercise routines. For some,
though, Tae-Bo also is offering new ways to get injured.
</P>
<P>
   Some Tae-Bo exercisers, energized at first by the martial
arts-like movements, are turning up with muscle strains, painful
hips and lower backs, even injured knees and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Morgan of Lee's Summit tried an exercise videotape by
Tae-Bo pro Billy Blanks. She developed so much hip pain she needed
eight physical therapy sessions to get over the strain.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan hadn't done Tae-Bo before, but she regularly worked out
with aerobics tapes and lifted weights. Although she thought she
was performing the kicks as instructed, she figures she didn't have
the technique down just right. The pain lasted for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might still do the tape but eliminate the kicking portion,''
said Morgan, who has two young children. ``I don't have time to be
down like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hensley, a physical therapist with St. Luke's-Shawnee
Mission Health Systems, has seen several Tae-Bo injuries. People
who aren't used to the moves can suffer strains to the groin, hip
and lower back, among other places, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're kicking and you're not stabilizing your spine,
you're going to twist your pelvis,'' she said. ``It rotates and
gets locked.''
</P>
<P>
   What's good about Tae-Bo, said Jody Schnakenberg, an aerobics
instructor at Gold's Gym in Westport, is that it uses large muscle
groups while providing aerobic exercise. And it's popular with men,
who sometimes shy away from other aerobics classes. But the
potential for getting hurt is real, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can easily injure yourself because this is a little bit
more about body and posture alignment,'' Schnakenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Knees and elbows are other danger spots, she said. Exercisers
throwing hard punches and kicks, who make the mistake of fully
extending their arms and legs, can suffer joint damage.
</P>
<P>
   The American Council on Exercise in San Diego lauds
cardio-kickboxing exercises such as Tae-Bo because they can improve
strength, aerobic fitness and flexibility. The movements can
enhance reflexes and balance. But correct technique must be
learned, and even basic kickboxing classes require above-average
strength and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to do Tae-Bo, here are some ideas from local experts
and the American Council on Exercise to avoid injuries:
</P>
<P>
   - Because of the potential for muscle strains, do more
stretching and warming up than you would ordinarily do for an
aerobics class.
</P>
<P>
   - Reduce the time and intensity of your workouts until your body
adapts. Many Tae-Bo classes move too quickly for beginners _ or
even for those who do other aerobic exercise.
</P>
<P>
   - Get help learning proper form and technique before jumping
full-speed into a class.
</P>
<P>
   - Beginners should specifically avoid high kicks until they gain
flexibility and become familiar with routines.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't lock joints when kicking or throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't wear weights or hold dumbbells when throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch the infomercials, you see so much grace,''
Schnakenberg said. ``But when you teach it, you see people just
trying to find their center of gravity. You're not going to be a
pro. It takes awhile.''

`CHRIS ROCK: BIGGER &AMP; BLACKER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CALVIN WILSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Chris Rock struts back and forth across the stage of the
Apollo Theater in New York, the question is not whether he'll say
something outrageous, but just how shockingly funny it will be.
</P>
<P>
   In his new special, ``Bigger &AMP; Blacker,'' debuting Saturday on
HBO, the outspoken comedian takes caustic aim at racism, police
brutality, homophobia, corporate greed and single mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, single mothers. Rock's tendency to confront social issues
without apology or compromise places him in the tradition of such
earlier satirists as Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce and Dick Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   It also sets him apart from the prevailing trend toward
gross-out comedy, as exemplified by ``There's Something About
Mary,'' last summer's box-office smash, and ``Big Daddy,'' the
current Adam Sandler hit.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in ``Bigger &AMP; Blacker'' _ Rock's first special
since the Emmy-winning ``Bring the Pain'' in 1996 _ the comic
challenges the notion that violent movies and song lyrics were
somehow to blame for the recent tragedy at Columbine High School:
``Whatever happened to crazy? Did we eliminate crazy from the
dictionary?''
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to suggest that if Americans really wanted a safer
society, they'd focus less on gun control and more on bullet
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bullet costs $5,000,'' he concludes, ``there'll be no
more innocent bystanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock also questions whether Hillary Clinton, notwithstanding her
popularity among some people, can really be called a ``hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, she ain't,'' he insists. ``Aquaman's a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hour-long special, the comic is constantly in
motion, his jokes exploding like land mines in his wake, his
insights into the American mentality at once eye-opening and
side-splitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock is out there to entertain, but I have the feeling that
he's also trying to say something about a society _ that it's not
simply yucks for yucks' sake,'' said Mel Watkins, author of On the
Real Side: A History of African American Comedy (Lawrence Hill).
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he is being accepted, that he's doing as well as
he is, is very encouraging. Because it means that there is an
audience out there that wants something outside of the `Dumb and
Dumber' genre of comic entertainment. It means that something else
is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In his performance style, Rock combines the persuasive rhythms
of the African-American preacher with the street-smart cool of the
hip-hop generation, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's put the two together, and it's a very interesting
combination,'' he said. ``That's one of the things that make him so
viable. If he didn't have part of that hip-hop cadence, he wouldn't
be able to appeal to the young audience the way he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rock has a definite edge.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the ``Pain'' special, he earned instant
notoriety when he invoked a racial expletive to explain the
difference between African-Americans who behave civilly in public
and those who don't. The routine was shocking but courageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes, humor is something that certainly is going to rub
some people the wrong way, that some people are going to find
objectionable,'' said Daryl Dance, author of Honey, Hush!: An
Anthology of African American Women's Humor (W.W. Norton).
</P>
<P>
   ``But one characteristic, historically, of black humor is that
it looks at our situation as black people in this nation,'' she
said. ``And he's just as hard on the black community as he is on
the white community.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock's ability to say outrageous things without alienating his
audience has as much to do with his formidable technique as his
innate likability, said Joe Keefe, a producer with the Second City
improvisational theater in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't demand that you agree with him, necessarily,''
Keefe said. ``He just demands that you think it's funny. Whether
you like him or not doesn't really matter that much to him. And
because of that, people love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout ``Bigger &AMP; Blacker,'' the camera is constantly
recording the faces of audience members (most of them
African-American) as they register I-can't-believe-he-said-that
expressions. And not just because of Rock's frequently blue
language.
</P>
<P>
   Such reactions are not unlike those elicited in the 1950s by
such comics as Bruce, Mort Sahl and the team of Nichols &AMP; May.
</P>
<P>
   But Rock is also in the tradition of savvy, envelope-pushing
African-American artists like Pryor, Gregory, Moms Mabley and Redd
Foxx (pre-``Sanford and Son''). Indeed, in matters of race, Rock
can say some things that no white comic, in these days of political
correctness, could possibly get away with.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe noted that comedy today is in some ways more restrained
than it was in the socially conservative 1950s or the politically
volatile '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '50s and '60s, the Cold War, and civil unrest in the
United States, gave you an awful lot of opportunities for
material,'' he said. ``But today the climate's different. People
have to be so damn careful about what they say, and how they say
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The response among many comics is to play it safe, emphasizing
sex and toilet jokes to the exclusion of anything that might
genuinely engage the intellect. Hence the popularity of ``There's
Something About Mary,'' ``Booty Call,'' the Austin Powers films and
the Sandler ouevre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attraction to titillating sexual references, an
attraction to juvenilia, that I thought we'd passed,'' said
Watkins. ``But Rock stays away from it. Much like Richard Pryor, he
tends to take comedy and human beings and society more seriously,
and to deal with humor in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Rock chastises single mothers for being too lax in
bringing up their children, he does so with a barely submerged
affection. His real point is not that some of them are
irresponsible, but that we live in a society in which things can be
completely out of balance and no one notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satirists are usually people who are struggling to understand
the world themselves,'' Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to figure things out, and through that, they
see the hypocrisies or the oddities of society. And that's how they
get to their comedy.''

LIPS ARE SEALED ABOUT `EYES WIDE SHUT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a movie
virtually nobody has seen, has tongues wagging and the Internet
humming with hearsay and speculation about what the film may show.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its allegedly sexually explicit nature and the star power of
real-life married couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman have set the
rumor mills rumbling and led to widespread curiosity _ and, in some
cases, apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Most film buffs view the release of any new movie from reclusive
director Stanley Kubrick as a major event. The man made only 13
films in his career (the last was ``Full Metal Jacket'' in 1987),
and most of those are considered classics.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the fact that Kubrick died in March, just a week
after completing the editing of the movie, and ``Eyes Wide Shut''
becomes even more of a cinematic Holy Grail, the final testament of
a movie giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie has a lot going for it coming out of the box,''
Nancy Kirkpatrick, senior vice president for publicity for Warner
Bros., said by telephone from Los Angeles. ``You've got Stanley
Kubrick, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. It's hard not to pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you add to that the fact that Cruise and Kidman are
naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly it's the sexthat keeps ``Eyes Wide Shut's'' hype
machine running on overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The first glimpse of Kubrick's footage came in March, when he
released to an exhibitors' convention a snippet of a nude Cruise
and Kidman in the early stages of making love. The images are
widely available on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a couple of commentators mention that Kubrick never
made movies about sex,'' said KXTR radio personality Patrick Neas,
who describes himself as a major fan of the director's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think almost all of his movies were about sex, only he took
a very dark view of it. Now for him to be looking back on the
subject as an older man and summing up his attitudes _ I think the
movie will probably be dark and nasty but very intriguing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Mary, a Johnson County restaurant employee who declined to be
identified by her last name, said she was concerned that the
combination of Cruise, Kidman and the R-rated movie's supposedly
lurid elements would be a magnet for impressionable young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to teen-agers, and they're really eager to see
this movie,'' she said. ``I think a lot of people who normally
won't go see a movie with nudity or sex will come to see this one
just because Cruise and Kidman are so famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the rumor (the result of an early review of ``Eyes
Wide Shut'' written by a British friend of the Kubrick family) that
Cruise's character has a sexual relationship with a dead woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Necrophilia?'' marveled a worried film booker for a local
theater chain. ``Maybe that flies on the West or East coasts, but
here in the Midwest? People aren't going to want to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile hard facts about ``Eyes Wide Shut'' are hard to come
by. A television commercial being shown in 30- and 60-second
versions emphasizes suspense elements and is made up of seemingly
random images without dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Screenings for theater owners originally planned for last
Thursday were called off; they were to be rescheduled this week.
Critics around the country won't see the film until just a couple
of days before its July 16 opening.
</P>
<P>
   And while Cruise's and Kidman's handsome features stare out at
us from the magazine racks (the stars are gracing the current
covers of Time, Vogue, US, Rolling Stone, Harper's Bazaar ... even
Good Housekeeping), the stories inside are uniformly devoid of
details about the movie's content.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems that the less we know about ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' the
noisier the buzz.

WHAT IF THE WALL OF SEPARATION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE FELL? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   As the
controversy over funding religious schools with tax dollars heats
up, some citizens are claiming that the concept of ``separation of
church and state'' is only a myth. While it is true that the phrase
does not literally appear in the U.S. Constitution or the Bill of
Rights, the principle of the wall of separation is imbedded in the
two religious clauses of the First Amendment and Article VI of the
Constitution.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The First Amendment states, in part: ``Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof; ...'' The Establishment Clause means that
government cannot support or endorse one or all religions. It also
means that government must be neutral in regard to religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Exercise Clause means that the government should not
interfere with religious worship unless it has a compelling reason
to do so for public safety or because of societal mandates or laws.
The Free Exercise Clause does not protect human sacrifices, incest,
or polygamy as a part of religious worship.
</P>
<P>
   Article VI of the Constitution states, in part: ``no religious
test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or
public trust under the United States.'' This clause is a further
barrier to mixing church and state. It doesn't matter what a
person's religious beliefs are, that person can run for office. A
person's religious beliefs cannot be used to disqualify that person
from sitting on a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The Founders were well aware they were creating a secular state.
There is no mention of God or a Supreme Being in the Constitution
or in the Bill of Rights. The Founders and their parents and
grandparents had witnessed the persecution and civil unrest in
England and Europe because of unholy marriages between church and
state. The colonies became home to those who were escaping
religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
   The Founders knew the evil promulgated when government can
enforce religious doctrine or religious beliefs. The separation of
church and state was very much on their minds as they crafted our
Constitution and our Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The separation of powers is also a principle that isn't
literally named in the Constitution, but is implied by the very
structure of the Constitution. The document spells out the powers
of Congress, of the president, and of the courts. The phrase ``fair
trial'' cannot be found in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights,
but it is implied in those documents.
</P>
<P>
   But let us suppose for argument's sake that the principle of
separation of church and state does not exist, that it is an
erroneous reading of James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. What would
be the ramifications if that wall suddenly fell?
</P>
<P>
   Law professor Douglas Laycock of the University of Texas at
Austin, who is an expert in church-state law, said flatly that such
a supposition is a mistake, that it gives support for the recent
rhetoric that dismisses the principle of the separation of church
and state. That principle, he said, is imbedded in the religious
clauses of the First Amendment. ``Separation of church and state''
is merely the slogan for what those clauses mean.
</P>
<P>
   But, Laycock said, if you want to make the supposition, then put
it this way: ``Without separation you can't get to free exercise.
The government would be free to meddle and eliminate free exercise
for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, gave a list of ramifications that
would be the result of denying or eliminating the wall of
separation: Churches would vie for public money and it is likely
that minority religious groups would always lose in the
competition. Schools, businesses and public offices could start
their day with prayers of the majority religion. There could be a
renewal of the Bible riots that plagued our nation after the Civil
War. Blasphemy laws might be enacted and enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Rogers, associate general counsel of the Baptist Joint
Committee, added to the list. It is likely we would see violence
against minority religions, she said. Religious entities would then
be treated by the government in the same manner as any secular
organizations _ that is, there would be conditions tied to any
public funds given to churches; religious groups would have to hire
and fire according to federal law; religious organizations could
not discriminate based upon religion when hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Mincberg, legal director of People for the American Way,
summed it up this way: ``If the doctrine of separation of church
and state fell, religious freedom, religious practice would be much
less free.'' The autonomy of religion from state powers disappears,
he said. Government could promote religion. Some states could
endorse one religion and discriminate against others. Courts could
get involved with deciding church issues. He also noted that where
religion and state are bound together, there is religious conflict
_ as in Kosovo and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Professor emeritus of humanities Robert Alley of the University
of Richmond, Va., speaking of the Bible riots in the 1800s, said:
``The ((separation)) principle in the First Amendment may have been
violated in the short run, but there it was, nevertheless, as a
guardian that righted the ship and now we don't have the kinds of
religious persecution that were fairly common in communities in the
19th century. I genuinely believe that without the First Amendment
interpreted in a strict way, this country would quickly find itself
in the throes of serious religious conflict between religious
groups. And that can only get worse as more and more different
religious groups take on the character of numbers sufficient to
have weight. We have a growing diversity. The First Amendment is
far more important to us now than it has been in any point in our
history. We've avoided what Europe has gone through, what's going
on in the Balkans right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Gaustad, professor emeritus of history at the University
of California at Riverside, was emphatic about what would happen if
the principle of separation of church and state were ignored: ``The
most horrifying but most obvious example is religious warfare _
because that was true of England in the 17th century, of the
continent in the 16th century. Any time you put the power of the
state, which is to say the power of the sword, behind conformity
and religion, you're calling for religious persecution, you're
calling for religious martyrdom, you're calling for religious
warfare. All you have to do is look at the history of the Western
world to find example after example after example. From our relaxed
point of view in 1999, we say, `Oh that could never happen.' But
the fact is it happened over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who argue that the wall of separation between church and
state has made us a godless nation ignore the reality. Our country
has a growing religious diversity, thousands of vital and active
religious groups, and a religious liberty on a scale never known
before in the history of humankind. We should be grateful to
Madison and Jefferson for the wall of separation that protects us
all.

RED, WHITE AND BLUE FOR A DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Where I was brought up there were three things
you didn't talk about: sex, money and patriotism. In New England,
these are powerfully private matters.
</P>
<P>
   In my family, at least, flag wavers are as distrusted as those
who flaunt their wealth or sexual conquests.
</P>
<P>
   Where I live now there is only one thing you don't talk about:
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco Bay Area, in many circles anyway, you can
wave anything sexual or financial, but not the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Except one day a year. On the Fourth of July, all of us,
liberal, conservative, old American or new American, can glory in
Old Glory. On that day, any shyness about displaying the flag
disappears.
</P>
<P>
   We go to small town parades, city parks and fireworks shows, and
we observe that all Americans are people of color, namely red,
white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Rich folks who don't know Thomas Paine from Paine Webber wear
Ralph Lauren sweaters with American flags on the front, and I don't
even resent them. They love this country, not just the money it
gave them.
</P>
<P>
   Poor people who probably think the Concord Bridge is a overpass
on Interstate 680 wave flags, and they know exactly why.
</P>
<P>
   They love this country, despite the money they haven't made yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth of July is one day we are liberated from tired
debates about anti-flag burning amendments, or cant about American
imperialism. It's our flag, the flag of those who made this
country, freed the slaves, defeated totalitarianism and marched for
civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   We wave it for a while, and then we go to barbecues and watch
fireworks. We talk about baseball, movies, cars or the stock
market, not patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it ought to be. This is America, not Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Bay Area, not a Republican convention. Patriotism is
something to be demonstrated when needed, not proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   I got to thinking about this when I was back on Cape Cod for
vacation. My folks had a cocktail party and invited two of my
father's former scientific colleagues. The three men sipped white
wine and reminisced about the work they did together in the '50s
and '60s. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., or Rep. Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, wouldn't have been able to follow the conversation
about underwater acoustics, but Tom Clancy might have.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the days when they learned how to listen to
all the noise in the ocean. My dad and his pals were part of the
team that developed the SOSUS net of underwater listening devices
that tracked every Soviet submarine in the seas.
</P>
<P>
   To put it baldly, these three gentle Ivy League intellectuals,
including my father, who fought the loyalty oaths demanded of
professors during the McCarthy era, helped defeat the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they'd never say anything that silly, immodest and
perhaps inaccurate. What they loved was science, and at the time
they were scientists solving problems in the national interest, two
words that nowadays sound almost old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   Life isn't a Clancy novel. It's not as deadly dull, for one
thing. It also isn't a fight between good guys on the right and bad
guys on the left.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union's might was neutralized by liberals as well as
the less liberal, and by mild-mannered academics as well as
military men. My father and his colleagues knew many of these
military men as colleagues and friends, and I don't think they ever
talked about patriotism. They talked about the same kinds of things
we talk about at our Fourth of July barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   What I know for sure about my father is that he is a true,
unapologetic liberal, and heaven help those who say liberals are
unpatriotic. He wouldn't say a conservative who wraps himself in
the flag is desecrating it. My dad would just say he's a blowhard.
He used that word a lot during recent impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Already I've talked too much about patriotism, at the risk of
violating family rules and Bay Area customs. But let me say a
little more.
</P>
<P>
   I like the way we take our caps off and how everyone sings along
with the National Anthem at ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   I like the way suburbanites carrying flags set up folding chairs
hours before the start of small-town Fourth of July parades.
</P>
<P>
   I like the way the contingent of Vietnam veterans always gets
the biggest hand, at least in the towns of the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   I like the fact that no one has to say why.
</P>
<P>
   My father and I differed on many things during that war, and I
like the fact that we don't now.
</P>
<P>
   I like the way my dad once stood on a beach in Cape Cod, pointed
out to sea and said, ``Once there was a Soviet missile submarine
right out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He just shook his head. He didn't have to say anything else.
</P>
<P>
   We went home and fired up the barbecue.

NO COMPASSION FOR WOMEN, POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ So far as you can see down the line of
Republican candidates for president, you find no one willing to
trust women with their own reproductive systems.
</P>
<P>
   Not Mr. Compassionate Conservative Moneybags, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Vietnam War hero, John McCain. Not the great female
hope, Elizabeth Dole. Not Steve Forbes. Not Dan Quayle. Not Orrin
Hatch. Not John Kasich. And certainly not Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Every person who has even an outside chance at the GOP
nomination _ and thus a shot at the White House _ is anti-choice.
</P>
<P>
   When the issue is women's wombs, ovaries and fallopian tubes,
GOP contenders want more government involvement, not less _ as much
as that goes against traditional Republican values.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal, right? The abortion plank is always one of the
best-polished in the Republican platform. So what else is new?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, except that this country is only a single Supreme Court
vote from overturning Roe vs. Wade. That action would not eliminate
abortion in the United States; nothing ever has and nothing except
foolproof, thoroughly accessible birth control ever could. But a
5-4 vote to overturn Roe would make abortion what it was before
1973: unsafe and a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents appoint Supreme Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   They also have the power to veto congressional legislation that
does not have a two-thirds majority capable of an override.
</P>
<P>
   Say what one will about President Clinton caving in on any
number of campaign promises, he has kept his promise to women that
he will try to keep the federal government out of their uteruses
and allow them to decide if, when and how often they bear children.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, when the Republican-controlled Congress passed specific
legislation that would have limited the ever-shrinking reproductive
rights of females in the United States, Clinton exercised his veto.
Overrides have passed in the House but failed in the Senate by a
handful of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Put Bush, Dole or McCain in the White House, and American women
will be a step closer to their sisters in the Third World, where
biology is still destiny and XX chromosomes ensure second-class
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   One in four existing (not ``pre-born'') children in this wealthy
nation lives below the poverty line, and one in three has no health
insurance. But the Republican-dominated Congress has busied itself
for the last five years with anti-abortion legislation: 102 pieces
between 1994 and 1998. Almost all the prohibitions were tacked onto
sweeping funding acts that defied presidential veto. All but 15
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the meanest, most immoral and anti-American of these was
the work of a man who described a seven-year extramarital affair
that he conducted in his mid-40s as ``a youthful indiscretion'' _
family values champion Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Tacked onto an omnibus appropriations act, the Hyde Amendment
showed low- and no-income women that two very real sets of laws
exist in the USA: one for the rich and middle-class, another for
the poor. Although abortion is still legal, the Hyde Amendment
banned federal funding of it for poor women, effectively denying
them access to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   (Compassionate conservative that Hyde is, his rider does exempt
poor women who were impregnated through rape or incest or whose
pregnancies likely will kill them.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the nation's foster care system is as overcrowded as
its prisons, the Republican-controlled Congress has concerned
itself far more with limiting fetal tissue research and access to
birth control than with caring for children who already walk, talk
and breathe.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few congressional victories for pro-choice
advocates _ ``victory'' meaning ground was not lost _ the House
failed by 24 votes to destroy New York Democrat Nita Lowey's plan
to require the insurance plans of federal employees to cover
contraceptive drugs and devices.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 198 members of the House tried to neutralize the
coverage by reclassifying some of the most common contraceptives as
``abortifacients,'' or agents of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, as the Republican presidential candidates continue
their swings through Iowa, New Hampshire and California, nothing's
new under the Big Tent. It's anti-choice business as usual: Every
American woman's right to privacy and reproductive freedom is still
in the GOP cross hairs.

SMILE (AND WORK): YOUR EMPLOYER MAY BE WATCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBY McGILL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ever find yourself watching the clock at work?
Be careful, it may be watching you.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing miniaturization of video surveillance equipment
is making prying eyes at the workplace a more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the American Management Association, a New
York-based trade organization with 70,000 members, found that 32.8
percent of major U.S. companies record and review employees
communications and activities while on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance is used by employers as a productivity tool, to see
who is working and who is not. Others see it as a security measure,
particularly in technology-sensitive manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The minuscule size of today's high-resolution cameras are an
Orwellian dream come true, said David Simms, a private investigator
with Robert E. Morton and Associates in Danville, Calif. ``You can
put them in a fan, a smoke detector, a light switch, you can put
them in any number of places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yuriko Crehan, vice president of marketing for Advanced
Electronics Group Inc., a Los Angeles-based manufacturer and
distributor of surveillance equipment, explained that many of the
cameras her company sells to businesses are for covert
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warehouses usually use a wall clock or smoke detector, offices
use a pencil sharpener or computer speakers or sometimes a lamp,''
Crehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Butts is the security manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Though he declined to give specific
details about the laboratory's video surveillance, he was
forthright about the use of technology for monitoring the employees
as well as potential intruders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use about every camera you can think of, covert or overt,''
Butts said. ``We are trying to head off internal threat problems
and external threat problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Fineran, a spokesman for the National Association of
Manufacturers, a 14,000-member trade organization, said employees
shouldn't fret over what he sees as an overplayed threat to their
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a great headline: `Your boss is spying on you.' If
you didn't know that, you should,'' he said from his office in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Fineran acknowledged the possibility of abuse. ``There are
mid-level managers and small business owners out there that I would
not want to work for because of what they can do, and what they do
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees may have little legal recourse to challenge the use of
surveillance equipment. There is a common law of privacy in every
state, but that is very rarely used in surveillance cases, said
Lewis Maltby, the director of employment rights for the American
Civil Liberties Union in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But not every employer likes the covert approach to
surveillance. Kevin Saucier, director of safety at Guess Jeans Inc.
in Los Angeles, prefers to use visible cameras. ``It keeps a lot of
people honest,'' he said.

   CARE _ Until she reached 92, Mildred Bengston maintained her
independence. She lived alone in the same Kansas City, Kan.,
neighborhood she had called home for 40 years. And with her
daughter and grandchildren nearby, help was always at hand. But in
spring 1996, she became bedridden with assorted ailments. The
nation's home health-care system, which through Medicare has helped
many elderly patients stay out of costly hospitals and nursing
homes, stepped in to help. A nurse treated Bengston at home three
times a week. But the system is in a tailspin, rocked by financial
and regulatory restrictions. For millions of in-home patients
throughout the country, the outlook is unsettling. David Goldstein.

LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE OF THE MUSIC OF OUR CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When Michael Steinberg arrived as music critic of the
Boston Globe back in 1964, he ignited firestorms of controversy.
``When,'' he asked after the premiere of Leonard Bernstein's
``Kaddish'' Symphony, ``will Lenny grow up?''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg has spent a distinguished career stirring up
controversies ever since, in posts (one wants to write ``from
pulpits'') at the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco
Symphony, the Minnesota Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic.
But he has also lived long enough, argued and advocated his causes
so persuasively, that many of his beliefs have become truths
universally acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Last month he was the keynote speaker at the annual meeting of
the American Symphony Orchestra League, a service organization that
brings together orchestra managements, board members, and
supporters. Steinberg's address was fervently applauded in Chicago,
and it reached a wider audience when it was printed in the Sunday
New York Times. His subject was the music of the 20th century: what
orchestras must do about it, and why; what stands in the way; what
orchestras can do, and how.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was brilliantly and entertainingly argued. Speaking
of the standard repertory, the 50 ``greatest'' pieces that are at
its core, Steinberg said, ``Too often we are on cruise control. `Oh
yes, the Brahms First, isn't that nice,' and we tick off the
familiar events much as we register a familiar series of subway
stops or cross streets or highway exits on our way to work. . . .
Onstage, too, `Oh, the Brahms First again' is not an unfamiliar
response _ probably without the `isn't that nice' attached. But
that is not what it is about. . . . That is not why Friedrich
Nietzsche said that without music life would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg believes that one way to keep Beethoven or Brahms
fresh is to give them ``new neighbors at table''; the challenge for
orchestras is to choose those neighbors in such a way as to assure
lively conversational interaction _ and to attract rather than
repel the audience that is paying for the experience. Steinberg
spoke of programming skills, of the necessity for honesty in
marketing, and, above all, of the importance of conviction in
performance (Serge Koussevitzky, he said, ``didn't mess with focus
groups or count how many bows he had taken; in fact, if a work had
not gone down well, that could be all the more reason for bringing
it back: he believed the piece needed to be heard, and that was
enough''). He also spoke of ways of making the audience feel at
home, through intelligent program notes, occasional and carefully
prepared comment from the stage, enterprising use of new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's speech left little room for disagreement, but a
panel afterward viewed the same landscape from the differing
perspectives of orchestra manager (Deborah Borda), composer
(Christopher Rouse), music director (Robert Spano), and the media
(John Rockwell of The New York Times, and this writer).
</P>
<P>
   Borda commented on the progress that had been made over the
years, noting how 50 years ago network radio refused to broadcast
some of the New York Philharmonic's performances of Mahler
symphonies _ works that are now central to the repertory. She
referred the audience to the model of museums, which are enjoying a
particular flush of popularity. ``Museums are `with it' and
`happening.' We need to ask ourselves why and how that happened. I
think accessibility is part of the answer _ the flexible
scheduling, the pricing, the element of choice, the quality of the
educational materials and merchandising, the dress codes. Museums
have created an accessible and personalized experience. Opera's
rise in popularity is directly correlated to the introduction of
surtitles that make the experience more accessible. What we have to
think about is how to relate to our audiences before, during, and
after concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   Borda emphasized a need for variety in programming but also for
coherence: ``We don't want to display an undifferentiated
inventory, to be a restaurant serving sushi, nouvelle cuisine, and
pizza on the same plate.'' She too looked at technology, citing a
study that established that it took radio 38 years, and television
13, to make the impact the Internet has achieved in four. She also
emphasized the importance of spending money on improving the
product. ``Imagine the difference it would make if we invested 2
percent of our annual budget on preparing for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Spano pondered some paradoxes. ``Music is ephemeral. It passes
through time and is gone _ yet we box and market music as eternal
masterpieces. Musical history is fueled by the creative impulse,
but our orchestras function as museums. And great art has not
always had market value.'' He then talked about some of the things
the Brooklyn Philharmonic has done to attract and hold on to its
audience; the most important of them ``was to make the assumption
that our audience is extremely intelligent, and eager to make
connections between old and new, exotic and familiar. It is a
mistake to program apologetically, and marketing should always
reflect what the content actually is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell spoke not only out of his experience in journalism but
from his years as artistic director of the Lincoln Center Festival.
He spoke in particular of ticket pricing, which tends to reduce
potential audiences at the concert hall and the opera house. ``What
we found is that the highest-priced tickets for special events like
Pfitzner's opera `Palestrina' and the lowest prices substantially
sold out, but the bulk of tickets in the middle price range didn't
sell.'' He also referred to the paradigm of Pierre Boulez's ``Rug
Concerts'' at the New York Philharmonic in the early 1970s. The
period atmosphere would have to change _ back then, a sideburned
audience in bell-bottoms sat on rugs because there were no chairs _
but the informal ambience of exciting, affordable, challenging
programs could and should be re-created.
</P>
<P>
   Rouse spoke of the necessity for an ``organized plan'' for
presenting new music. ``There is a lot of accessible modern
literature that makes a good place to begin. We lived too long with
the assumption that anything `easy' must be by definition inferior;
we celebrated inaccessibility for far too long. Programs must be
pragmatic and responsive to the needs of the constituents.'' Rouse
conveyed his belief that there is plenty of new music that excites
and moves an audience on first hearing _ and that awakens and
rewards curiosity to hear more.
</P>
<P>
   This writer, in a contrarian mood, wondered about just how
personalized the blockbuster museum-show experience can be; more
than once he felt herded and hurried past the Monets before being
dumped to spend as much time as he wanted in the gift shop, where
he could buy souvenirs of an experience he really hadn't had.
</P>
<P>
   He also charged at the billowing red flag of the word
``accessibility.'' Access to the arts is a real and serious issue;
``accessibility'' of the art lies in the eyes and ears of the
concertgoer _ and in the conviction of the performers. The string
quartets by Elliott Carter are now part of the permanent
chamber-music literature because of decades of brilliant advocacy
by committed ensembles; Carter's no less masterly orchestral works
have not entered the repertory not only because they are difficult
for performers and audience, but because there have not been
conductors and orchestras to lead and play them with comparable
belief and persistence (conductors like Oliver Knussen and Spano
are beginning to do the job). ``Trust us,'' said the Juilliard
Quartet, and they rewarded our trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accessibility'' has increasingly been used as the most
important criterion for quality rather than one possible such
criterion. ``Accessibility'' has been used to mask all kinds of
lazy, opportunistic, and retrograde work that both panders to the
audience and condescends to it _ too often if the marketers are
telling us something is accessible, they mean it will make
Khachaturian sound avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``elitism'' has become a code word for
anything challenging and therefore unmarketable and undesirable.
Everyone wants an elite baseball team, dentist, plumber, brain
surgeon, and auto mechanic. The only places where the American
public doesn't seem to want quality are in the arts _ and in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, there can be quality in evey genre of music. New
York composer-critic Gregory Sandow rose from the floor to make the
common-sense observation that Proust will always be less popular
than Hemingway, a Rossini overture more ``accessible'' than
Mahler's Ninth Symphony. That does not make either work better or
worse than the other, more or less necessary. Accessibility and
elitism are not parallel to good and bad; the qualities intersect
at different angles.)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the American Symphony Orchestra League convention any
visitor would have been struck by a dual commitment _ to quality of
every kind, and to the challenge of finding new ways of putting
quality onto the marketplace and making it competitive there. The
marketing department and the artistic direction of a symphony
orchestra, or any other cultural enterprise, may not be natural
allies, but they are also not natural enemies; they need each
other. Spano cited the most provocative paradox of all when he
said, ``A donkey with a load of holy books is still an ass.''

<P>
   It's finally over.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law _ created 21 years ago to end the
president's abuse of power _ last week was laid to rest in order to
end the independent counsel's abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The law's origin was honorable. It was enacted primarily in
response to the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' of 1973, when two
attorneys general resigned rather than carry out President Nixon's
demand that they fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. A
generation later came independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
five-year, $40 million investigation that began with Whitewater but
resulted in the impeachment and acquittal of President Clinton over
a White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The public and Congress _ well aware of the difference between
high crimes and misdemeanors and a private sex scandal _ decided
that they had had enough of Starr's unlimited abuse of power and
taxpayer money. And the public proved to be a lot wiser than those
conservative Republicans who thought they could fool enough
Americans into believing that Clinton actually committed crimes so
serious as to warrant removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   What the public actually saw was Starr's office evolving into a
version of the Spanish Inquisition, a dangerous and far-reaching
political body answerable to no one, yet determined to bring down
the Clintons and destroy the lives of several close friends and
associates.
</P>
<P>
   To a lesser degree, controversy over independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh's investigation of the Reagan administration's
Iran-Contra affair also played a role in the law's demise. But
Starr is the main reason the law was allowed to lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Now control over independent counsels has been returned to the
attorney general, as it was before the enactment of the law. The
attorney general has the power to appoint or remove a special
counsel as well as define what will be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concern of some that an attorney general could abuse
those privileges, events of the last few years demonstrate that it
is far better to have such a law under his or her control than
under the unlimited authority of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every member of Congress, including House and Senate
Republicans who unsuccessfully tried to use Starr's report to
remove Clinton, wanted the law to simply expire as of Wednesday
night. Attorney General Janet Reno and Starr agreed, perhaps for
different reasons, that the law was too flawed to even try to
repair or amend. Reno, like other members of the Clinton
administration, saw the law as far too abusive to be allowed to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Starr no doubt saw that his use and abuse of the law did more
damage to his own reputation than it did to his chief target,
Clinton. Starr himself suggested that his lack of popularity was a
key reason why he decided to end the Whitewater investigation by
working out a plea bargain with Webster Hubbell, former associate
US attorney general and an Arkansas friend of the Clintons, rather
than go forward with a scheduled August trial.
</P>
<P>
   By pleading guilty to a misdemeanor involving failure to pay
income tax and failure to disclose a potential conflict of
interest, Hubbell will do a year's probation and no jail time.
Starr claimed he could prove the charges against Hubbell, but
decided not to go forward with a trial because, according to
reports, he suspected the public sentiment against him would prompt
a jury to acquit Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is more than coincidental that Starr's Whitewater
investigation ended the same week, almost to the day, that the
independent counsel law came to its end. After all, they owe a lot
to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, meanwhile, said last week that he was trying to wrap up
other investigations not related to Whitewater. He was apparently
referring to his probe into whether Hillary Rodham Clinton had a
role in the 1993 firings of the White House travel office staff,
and an aspect of the Kathleen Willey case involving a Maryland
developer and Democratic Party contributor.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr wants a chance to repair his damaged reputation, he
might consider dropping those investigations now rather than face
more professional embarrassment and more public outrage over his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Republican and Democratic presidential hopefuls might
appreciate Starr fading from the public eye and the political
landscape during the campaign. None would care to see their names,
or faces, next to his in the news.
</P>
<P>
   What they, and the electorate, want to see is the end of another
era highlighted by an unwanted but stern test of our democratic
process. The nation survived Starr and his abuse of the independent
counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   With both fading into history, the nation can look to the future
with hopes of a brighter, if not more enlightened, era.

HISTORIAN PURSUES BULLRING'S ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DEATH AND MONEY IN THE AFTERNOON 
A History of the Spanish Bullfight 
By Adrian Shubert 
Oxford University Press, 270 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To its followers, bullfighting is an enthralling display of
grace and bravado, a tantalizing primal dance to the death between
man and beast. In his classic meditation on the sport, ``Death in
the Afternoon,'' Ernest Hemingway spoke of ``the emotional and
spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by
a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for centuries, bullfighting has also been lambasted as an
orgy of savagery and stupidity. Spanish intellectuals have long
decried the best-known spectacle of their homeland, which Eugenio
Noel characterized as a symbol of everything that is ``negative,
corrupted, bastardized, deteriorated.'' Some writers, belonging to
the group known as the Generation of 1898, even went so far as to
blame bullfighting _ in their estimation, evidence of a nation's
failure to modernize _ for Spain's defeat in the Spanish-American
War. More recently, a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, which criticized Madonna for featuring bullfighting in her
``Take a Bow'' video, dressed as a bull and followed Pope John Paul
II during his visit to a Mexico City cathedral to protest the
pontiff's reluctance to condemn the sport.
</P>
<P>
   What, many ask, does it say about a society if it still has a
place for a sport featuring some sop in brocade capri pants playing
catch-me-if-you-can with a weakened bull, who is then stabbed to
death to the roar of a bloodthirsty crowd? In ``Death and Money in
the Afternoon,'' Adrian Shubert does not make excuses for the
barbarity of the corrida. Instead, in this absorbing history of
Spanish bullfighting, he puts aside moral judgments to explore the
sport in a historical and social context.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Shuburt writes, ``we escape from the idea that it's
a peculiarly Iberian activity and can begin to compare it to
similiar spectacles elsewhere. There are numerous comparisons
available in the many other entertainments for which large numbers
of people pay money to get in special buildings to watch the
performances of highly paid professionals, who are objects of great
popular adulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although practiced in France, Portugal, Mexico, and numerous
South American nations, bullfighting is most associated with Spain.
The earliest bullfights, however, date back thousands of years:
Gladiators fought bulls in the Roman Colosseum. Bullfighting in
Spain has existed since the 16th century, and its early advocates
were artistocrats, institutions such as hospitals, and the church.
The reason for their involvement was immediately clear: Bullfights
were moneymakers. They were often held as fund-raisers to help
victims of accidents and natural disasters. While some officials,
Shubert writes, ``felt that the bullfight was not a desirable
custom,'' its ability to draw customers and cash ``usually trumped
any qualms officials had about their nonmonetary value.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure and simple, the bullfight was a business _ and one, of
which, everyone wanted a piece, especially as it blossomed in the
19th and 20th centuries. As its popularity rose, it spawned a
cottage industy of promoters, breeders, agents, and journalists to
cover the events, whether they championed the spectacle or
condemned it. It also introduced the notion of the athlete as
celebrity, and the sport became a means for poor young men to seek
fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Much the way boxing and basketball have in this century allowed
dispossessed young American men an avenue out of poverty,
bullfighting offered upward mobility in Spain. Surprisingly, it
even provided some opportunities for women who could make enough
money to live independently, though their presence in the sport was
hardly welcomed. In the book's best chapter, Shubert acknowledges
that there were always toreras, or female bullfighters. None
achieved the stardom of their male counterparts _ sexism, and the
general feeling that the sport was inappropriate for women even to
watch, let alone participate in, prevented that. Still, some, like
the Catalan Lady Bullfighters, earned a grudging respect from
critics, one of whom wrote, ``They fight with more art than some
bullfighters from the ugly sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Shubert, who chairs the history department at York University in
Toronto, has written extensively about Spain, and his knowledge of
that nation shines. And ultimately, it doesn't matter than he
avoids taking sides in the bullfighting debate. With textbook
precision, he reveals how the corrida shaped Spain's culture, and
provided the blueprint for the modern sporting industry. He has, in
essence, contributed a valuable history on the marriage between
sport and commerce as we know it today.

PAINT MAKERS FACE SUITS OVER LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paint manufacturers, who have withstood lawsuits more
successfully than their old lead-based product weathered wear and
tear, are facing an aggressive new legal attack that borrows its
key strategy and players from the battle against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   While recent attention has been focused on lawsuits that use the
tobacco litigation as a model for suits against gun makers, cases
against the paint industry are quietly pending or planned in Ohio,
New York City, Buffalo, Rhode Island, and elsewhere, with several
more expected in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The suits generally accuse paint and pigment manufacturers of a
long-term, concerted effort to mislead regulators and the public
about the dangers of lead paint, charges the industry denies. The
lawsuits seek millions of dollars in financial relief for victims
of lead poisoning and reimbursement to state and local governments
that have borne the costs of preventing and treating lead-related
maladies.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the highest-profile, lead-paint suits are being
pressed by the same lawyers who played leading roles in the tobacco
litigation that led to a $246 billion settlement, including the law
firm of Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos and South Carolina
attorney Jack J. McConnell. Both were also involved in successful
suits against asbestos makers.
</P>
<P>
   Their involvement and approach _ soliciting individual victims
and state and local governments as clients _ have raised the hopes
of antilead activists that paint and pigment makers will be forced
to pay billions of dollars for lead abatement efforts, medical
costs, and compensation for physical and emotional damage to
victims. In other words, a tobacco-like deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lead industry has a sorry track record over the 20th
century of obscuring the scientific evidence, intimidating
researchers, and stonewalling regulation. That certainly has
striking parallels to tobacco, and these suits reflect those
parallels,'' said Don Ryan of the Washington-based Alliance to End
Childhood Lead Poisoning. The alliance, a nonprofit public interest
organization, is not a party to the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Lead industry officials and paint manufacturers say the lawsuits
are groundless because the industry did nothing more than promote
and sell a then-legal product, never withholding information nor
misleading anyone about its toxicity. For instance, lead-paint
makers cite a 1996 decision in a Baltimore case in which a judge
wrote: ``There are no facts which indicate that these defendants
conspired with each other to conceal the knowledge of the dangers
of lead paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials also note that in most cases they began
phasing out lead paint for interior use 50 years ago _ long before
it was banned in 1978 _ and any current problems should be
attributed to landlords and homeowners who fail to prevent old
paint from peeling, flaking, or otherwise disintegrating. As many
as two-thirds of the 100 million housing units in the country are
believed to contain some lead paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic problem with all of these suits is nobody has sold
interior lead paint for almost half a century,'' said Don Scott, a
lawyer for NL Industries, formerly National Lead. ``It stopped
being sold because the industry took the leading role to protect
children from the potential risks of lead paint.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead industry has gained support from the US Chamber of
Commerce, which has criticized state attorneys general for using
private trial lawyers to press claims against industries in
exchange for a portion of any judgment or settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it violates the whole process of government when you
have state attorneys general making these kind of decisions and
having no checks and balances on them,'' said Larry Kraus,
president of the chamber's Institute for Legal Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, a federal judge in Boston rejected a landmark
attempt to blame the industry for the lead poisoning of a
1-year-old Boston girl in the early 1970s. That effort failed
largely because lawyers for the girl, Monica Santiago, were unable
to say which company manufactured the lead paint she ingested, and
the judge refused to spread blame among five paint and pigment
companies named in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent legal efforts against the industry have also failed,
and the only victories for victims of lead poisoning have involved
cases brought against landlords, ranging from small-property owners
to government agencies that failed to remove lead from homes and
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   But lead poisoning victims, liability lawyers, and activists
have long hoped to hold the industry directly accountable for the
damage done to children who ingest lead paint _ most often by
eating paint chips, residue, or powder. The problem is greatest in
cities with an older housing stock, such as Boston, New York, and
Philadelphia. When added to paint, lead made it spread easily, kept
it flexible in changing temperatures, and helped to form a tight
bond with wood.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health officials say the number of children with
elevated lead levels has dropped in recent years as a result of the
ban on residential lead paint and the removal of lead from gasoline
and water supplies. Still, they estimate that 890,000 children have
elevated blood-lead levels nationwide. In Massachusetts, a reported
13,566 children have elevated lead levels; 269 Massachusetts
children have ingested enough lead to be deemed ``lead poisoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Elevated lead levels can cause changes in brain chemistry
resulting in behavior problems, impaired growth, and lowered
intelligence; high levels can cause comas and even death.
</P>
<P>
   One lawsuit that has drawn interest is moving through the courts
in Cleveland, where a judge this summer is expected to rule whether
to turn it into a class-action suit involving an estimated 30,000
Ohio lead victims.
</P>
<P>
   Among the initial plaintiffs is Janessa Lascko, who was 15
months old in 1990 when she, her mother, and her half-brother moved
from a California homeless shelter into a mustard-colored,
Victorian-style house in Cleveland's Ohio City neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Like most toddlers, Janessa explored the world with her hands
and her mouth, touching and tasting whatever caught her attention.
Some parts of Janessa's world were coated with sweet-tasting lead,
possibly from flaking paint, and by her second birthday her blood
had more than five times the amount of lead federal health
authorities consider cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   For Janessa, now nearly 10, the only memories of the episode are
the long needles used at the hospital where she was treated. She
has shown no signs of mental or development problems, but her
mother said she lives in fear of what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know how this might affect her,'' said
Janessa's mother, Janice Lascko, who said she is a former Marine
sergeant who recently retired on a disability pension. ``I wonder
about her ability to grow up, have kids, fall in love, though not
necessarily in that order.''
</P>
<P>
   Lascko said she tried to sue her landlord, but the suit was
dismissed when she was unable to prove that Janessa's lead
poisoning resulted from paint ingested in their apartment, and not
from a house next door where large flakes of old white paint still
rain down from the clapboards. But she is intent on winning damages
from the industry, for the money and to prove a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we can't afford to live out in the suburbs
doesn't mean we're not trying to be good parents, and our children
shouldn't be exposed to the dangers of lead poisoning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another plaintiff in the suit, Selina Gainer, has two
lead-poisoned children who suffered ``significant permanent
physical, psychological, and developmental injury,'' the suit
claims.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly all previous lawsuits against the lead paint industry,
an insurmountable hurdle for plaintiffs has been the inability to
pin blame on a specific manufacturer. By contrast, victims of
tobacco-based illnesses knew what brand of cigarettes they smoked
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers in lead paint suits have responded by taking
a ``market share'' approach, claiming that manufacturers'
responsibility for damages can be apportioned based on the
percentage of the lead paint market they controlled. That approach
worked in lawsuits against makers of the drug DES, which was used
to prevent miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   Judges repeatedly rejected market share liability in lead paint
cases until February, when a judge in Buffalo said he would apply
that standard ``in the interest of justice and fairness.'' That
ruling, which is under appeal by paint makers, bolstered the hopes
of trial lawyers nationwide and has helped to fuel the boom in lead
suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a plaintiff who is injured by a product that has
no signature on it, it would be brutally unfair for a court to say
there is no way for them to recover,'' said Michael O'Shea, a
lawyer in the Cleveland case. ``That would afford defendants
absolute immunity, no matter how egregious their actions are,
solely because their products are unidentifiable once they're
manufactured.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the defendants in the suits are paint makers including
Glidden Co., Sherwin-Williams Co., and Benjamin Moore &AMP; Co.; lead
pigment manufacturers including E. I. du Pont de Nemours &AMP; Co.; and
a trade group called the Lead Industries Association.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, the biggest share of damages could be borne by NL
Industries, which by some accounts controlled more than 50 percent
of the market with its Dutch Boy White Lead Paint.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, around the corner from the Lasckos' former home
in Cleveland is a storefront for a business called Consumers
Wallpaper &AMP; Paint Co. A large sign above the store window
advertises Dutch Boy Paints, and an old sign heralds the
availability of ``childproof paint.'' But just as the Lasckos have
moved away, so too has the business, and through a dusty window an
ever-present sign reads, ``Closed.''

SNIP-ITS AIMS TO CUT THE FIDGETS OUT OF HAIRCUTS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joanna Meiseles, daughter of a Hollywood producer and
granddaughter of the late comic Jack Benny, wants to do for
children's haircuts what McDonald's has done with Happy Meals and
Chicken McNuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Only Meiseles has thrown her show-business heritage into the
mix. With bright color schemes, original cartoon characters looming
large, and electronic game stations at every pump-up chair, her
four Snip-its are theme parks of the tonsorial arts, a string of
salons for tots where the haircut is high theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of Chuck E. Cheese,'' says customer Marianne
Pilegaard, who recently took her two young daughters in for summer
coiffures at the newest Snip-its in Boston's Chestnut Hill section.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the tooth fairy of kids' haircuts,'' Meiseles
explains. ``We want to make haircuts an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years after opening the first Snip-its in Framingham,
Meiseles is eyeing a fifth Massachusetts site in Braintree and
possible expansion into Connecticut. If all goes according to plan,
she would build a nationwide chain and a national brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this can do well in Framingham and Chestnut Hill, it can do
well in Chicago, Florida, and Seattle,'' Meiseles says.
</P>
<P>
   She sees kids' barbershops as an untapped niche.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffrey S. Stein isn't so keen on kids-only barbershops. An
analyst with McDonald Investments in Cleveland, he tracks the
highly fragmented US haircutting industry with its estimated
250,000 salons, most of them mom-and-pop operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything magical about kids' haircuts,''
says Stein, who closely follows Regis Corp., a Minneapolis company
with $798 million in sales that operates such chains as Regis
Hairstylists, Supercuts, and MasterCuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't walk in (to salons) by themselves,'' Stein says.
``They come with their parents, so you might as well target the
parents, too. Catering to kids only _ I don't think you can
maximize your upside doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   From a Wall Street perspective, Stein's view may make sense. But
for a parent attempting to coax a recalcitrant or terrified moptop
into a barbershop, such arguments may not hold weight.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, customer Pilegaard took her 2-year-old
daughter, Freja, to a regular salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to leave because she was crying,'' she says. ``They
told me, `Come back another day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of coming back, Pilegaard, her 5-year-old daughter,
Sara, and Freja hopped on public transportation, making a haircut
pilgrimage from their Boston neighborhood to the Chestnut Hill
Snip-its.
</P>
<P>
   After some early tears, Freja was coiffed without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lollipop is our secret weapon,'' says Snip-its stylist
Cindy White, whose chairside manner seems to draw equally on the
technique of Sassoon and the wisdom of Dr. Spock.
</P>
<P>
   Snip-its charges $11.95 for a regular haircut. According to
Meiseles, that's about $2 more than the going rate for a kid's
haircut at a walk-in discount salon.
</P>
<P>
   For the extra two bucks, the kids get a show, as well as a
haircut, with Meiseles as the maestro of the planned hilarity.
</P>
<P>
   To keep unruly young males occupied, each barber's chair is set
up so the occupant can play several games on a nearby large TV
screen. The games were designed by Meiseles's husband, a software
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The trick was to make the games fun _ but not too much fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was Nintendo, the kids would never want to leave the
chair,'' she says, something that could cause gridlock and delays
in the Snip-its waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Meiseles, 34, was inspired to start Snip-its after a bad
first-haircut experience with her son Ben six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a video camera, Meiseles took Ben to the salon that
coiffed her hair. But at the first sight of a tot and his mama, the
veteran stylists all skedaddled, leaving Ben in the unskilled hands
of a rookie too new to know any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an awkward experience,'' Meiseles recalls. ``I was
the kind of customer I now complain about.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from family and friends and investing $100,000 of her
own money, Meiseles vowed to come up with a better way, thinking
long and hard about why kids find haircuts as terrifying as a trip
to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Her conclusion: Kids are told to stay away from strangers. Kids
are told to stay away from scissors. Then they go to the barber
shop, and a stranger wielding scissors is coming straight at their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   In designing a salon that would transform a scary haircut into a
fun-filled adventure, Meiseles was part entrepreneur, part
impresario, consulting with a Florida artist who specializes in
decorating children's bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   With the artist's help, Meiseles came up with such cartoon
characters as Snips the Scissors, Curly Comb, Flyer Joe Dryer, and
Marlene and Charlene, the Clipettes.
</P>
<P>
   These characters are prominently displayed in each Snip-its.
Each has his or her own story. Each has his or her own song. The
idea is to take objects such as scissors that otherwise might scare
a kid and turn them into a lovable Disney-like icon.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Snip-its innovations involve show-biz glitz.
</P>
<P>
   The grooming stations are designed with a chair for a parent
right next to the barber's chair; that means a parent can monitor _
or videotape _ the stylist's every move.
</P>
<P>
   All those extras added up. Meiseles says it cost nearly $400,000
to open the first Snip-its in 1995. Now that the
haircut-as-entertainment format has been refined, opening costs
have been roughly halved.
</P>
<P>
   So far the formula shows promise. In its first full year of
operations, the first Snip-its had sales of $430,000. By last year,
sales at that store rose to $500,000, Meiseles says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers come from as far away as New Hampshire and
Connecticut,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Snip-its seems to be a big hit with preschoolers. But by the
time a youngster has reached third or fourth grade, a Snip-its
haircut can be sniffed at as kids' stuff for 5-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Already Ben Meiseles, now 8 1/2, has expressed some interest in
the adult emporiums where barbers are skilled in buzz cuts, flat
tops, and neck shaves.

   Nothing much prepared Meiseles for a career in kid's hair. She
grew up in Beverly Hills, where her father, Robert Blumofe, was a
movie producer. His credits include such classics as ``Some Like it
Hot'' and ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for Meiseles to draw on her show-biz roots as
she refined Snip-its. At one point, she nearly scrapped the idea,
telling her father she didn't think she had the business savvy to
launch her own chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an artist,'' she told her father. ``I'm not a business
woman. I'm just a girl with an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' her father roared back. ``You're a producer!''
</P>
<P>
   If Meiseles is a producer, then Snip-its is her movie.

`ASSET INFLATION' A PROBLEM FOR GREENSPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, who has calmly navigated the nation's economy
through the longest peacetime expansion in history, may be losing
his cool.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has expressed in his
public remarks a growing frustration with a stock market that just
won't quit.
</P>
<P>
   His fear, Fed watchers say, is that stock prices have become so
high that this ``asset inflation'' _ an increase in the value of
individuals' portfolios, including stocks, mutual funds, and homes
_ may pose a bigger threat to the economy than old-fashioned price
inflation, which has not reared its head.
</P>
<P>
   If stocks fall, consumers would feel poorer and would stop
spending, causing the economy to slow dramatically. In the worst
case, the stock market is increasingly looking to some economists
like a bubble that could pop, wreaking havoc on the financial
system and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan's nervous about it,'' said Karl Case, professor of
economics at Wellesley College, but he ``doesn't know what to do
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's rocky relationship with the stock market came into
focus last Wednesday after the Federal Open Market Committee, which
sets interest-rate policy, voted to nudge the federal funds rate up
a quarter percentage point to try to slow an economy that barrels
along, creating an estimated 268,000 jobs last month.
</P>
<P>
   While the FOMC's modest rate hike was widely anticipated on Wall
Street, its surprise decision to withdraw its bias toward raising
rates further in coming months sent the Dow Jones industrial
average soaring beyond the 11,000-point milestone to an all-time
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do not need is for the stock market to go higher,
which adds to the wealth effect, which adds to the growth in the
economy,'' said Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial
Group Inc. The Fed action, he said, was ``bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the FOMC announcement, the Dow has gained 324 points, and
closed Friday at 11,139.24.
</P>
<P>
   While Fed actions clearly can influence stocks, managing the
market is not part of Greenspan's mandate, which is to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving aside the notion of some sort of crash, which would
threaten to make financial markets fragile, their interest in the
stock market is mostly indirect,'' said Benjamin M. Friedman, an
economics professor at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but Greenspan's remarks about the stock market
have appeared with increased frequency and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman first broached the problems the stock market
poses for FOMC members in December 1996. He grabbed headlines by
using the term ``irrational exuberance'' to describe the market.
The Dow at that time was around 6500.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he has become preoccupied with stocks in his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In January, speaking to the House Ways and Means Committee, he
said gains earned in the stock market have created a ``wealth
effect.'' Translation: Consumers feel rich, confidence has soared
to levels unseen since 1968, and they are driving the economy for a
100-month expansion. The Fed estimated that the stock market
contributed an estimated 1 percentage point to the growth in the
gross domestic product over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 17 speech before the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress, Greenspan said stocks have reached ``unsustainable
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this concern, Fed members are not inclined to do
anything about bloated asset prices, Greenspan said, adding that
``monetary policy is best primarily focused on stability of''
prices. He concluded by virtually admitting the Fed is helpless to
do much about the stock frenzy: ``It is useful to preempt forces of
imbalance before they threaten economic stability,'' the chairman
said. ``But this may not always be possible _ the future at times
can be too opaque to penetrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to Greenspan's testimony, veteran Fed watcher David
Jones of Aubrey Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York said he believes that
Greenspan ``is more worried than anything else about the wealth
effect of a runaway stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones added, ``It's a concern because it means the economy is
growing faster rather than slower at a time the Fed wants to slow
it down. The Fed could lose control.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that asset-price inflation is relatively uncharted
terrain for traditional economists _ including economists at the
Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Fed members ``don't have any sure way to say (stocks are)
overvalued or undervalued _ unlike traditional inflation models,
where you do have a way of determining that,'' said Lawrence
Horwitz, managing director of Primary Decision Economics in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But Wellesley College's Case said it is possible to determine
how much wealth is being created by higher asset values.
</P>
<P>
   Take rising housing prices in the Boston area. Based on repeat
sales of houses, Boston housing prices rose 10 percent for the year
ended February 1999. That one-year gain created about $1.4 billion
in wealth in the Boston area alone. ``I'm convinced that a lot of
the prosperity we're experiencing right now is a result of asset
inflation,'' Case said.

`AFFLICTION' COMPELLING; `HILARY AND JACKIE' GRIPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Affliction'' _ Paul Schrader's stirring
adaptation of Russell Banks's searing novel about fathers and sons
was one of last year's most compelling films, as bleak as the New
Hampshire landscape it portrays. Nick Nolte, James Coburn, and the
overlooked, but not overshadowed, Sissy Spacek and Willem Dafoe
give great performances. See the movie, read the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Jackie'' _ This tale of talent and madness, and two
sisters tragically linked, is grippingly told. Emily Watson, who
was superb in ``Breaking the Waves,'' is just as convincing in this
one, as cellist Jacqueline Du Pre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Winds'' _ For those who appreciate art films, this
little number is worth renting. Michael Nickles's 1995 film is
being released on video, no doubt, because of the presence of
Hollywood's latest femme, Heather Graham. Although she gives a
terrific performance, she's not the only reason to watch this truly
independent film. Nickles, who also stars, brings an able eye with
both his camerawork and casting. Look for Adam Ant and B-movie
bombshell Monique Parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The King and I'' (cartoon): This animated adaptation of the
live-action film that starred Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr is
inadequate. The drawings are thin and flimsy, and the characters
are as flat as the artists who drew them. Even the songs seem trite
and silly.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``My Son the Fanatic'' A hugely winning comedy of
cultural chaos. When a tolerant Pakistani taxi driver in London is
distressed to find his grown son attaching himself to Islamic
fundamentalists, he turns for companionship to another outsider and
regular customer, Rachel Griffiths's call girl. She does wonders at
avoiding cliche. Om Puri, as the driver with no control over his
destination, is unforgettable. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR) !!! 1/2 ``Run Lola Run'' A buoyant up-up-and-away lark that
zips all over the mixed-media map in dishing out three versions of
what happens when a sweet but dumb drug courier botches a buy and
puts in a desperate phone call to his girlfriend, who has 20
minutes to save his life. Franka Potente's Lola is adorably warm
and smart and spirited _ and fast. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Summer of Sam'' Spike Lee's long hot movie about the long hot
summer of 1977, brought to a boil by the serial killer nicknamed
Son of Sam. Although he lurks around the film's edges, it's mostly
about the way fear dissolves the bonds among lifelong pals in an
Italian-American neighborhood and causes them to turn on each
other. Flawed in its larger ambitions, it's nevertheless sizzlingly
acted and richly evocative. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Wild Wild West'' This film, based on yet another fondly
remembered TV series, keeps things pretty bland between reluctant
buddies and post-Civil War lawmen Will Smith and Kevin Kline. As
the bad guy, Kenneth Branagh (wallowing in a Southern accent) seems
to have the most fun, but this outing is stolen by its huge
steam-powered toys, gadgets, and gizmos. (PG-13)

BOOM TIMES DRIVE TASTE FOR LUXURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There's a robust market for luxury goods, fueled
by the powerful combination of low unemployment, low inflation, the
bullish stock market and heady consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of the San Francisco Bay Area, where the
technology industry has helped create a boom economy that contrasts
with stark times earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Blackstock, manager of the Jaguar division at British
Motors, said new models and slightly lower prices have fueled sales
at the San Francisco dealership that are almost double from last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On Nob Hill, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel's occupancy rate is running
``in the mid to high 90s,'' driven as much by pleasure as commerce.
Cheryl Oliva, the Ritz-Carlton's director of business travel, said
guests increasingly ``stay on through the weekend, and they bring
their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Dario Frederick, manager of the Travel Bug, an agency
specializing in luxury travel and customized travel to Italy, said:
``The computer industry has boosted the economy for a lot of years.
People are willing to spend, especially since the Bay Area economy
is doing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   The boom has brought millions of small investors into the stock
market, putting more money into the hands of more people. Consumers
are living large and trading up.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Wine Institute, the industry's nonprofit, San
Francisco-based trade association, sales of premium wine are
surging, even as overall wine sales nationally have plateaued.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Institute statistics show that the greatest growth in
California table wines last year _ 15 percent _ came in
super-premium wines priced at $7 to $14 per bottle. Ultra-premium
wines over $14 were close behind, with growth of 11 percent. At the
bottom of the market, sales of jug wines under $3 per bottle fell 3
percent during the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Good taste and good incomes are driving the shift, according to
industry analyst Jon Fredrikson, of Gomberg, Fredrikson &AMP;
Associates in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``American consumers are moving upscale to high-end varietal
wines, shifting their preferences away from many white and blush
jug wines,'' Fredrikson said.
</P>
<P>
   Connoisseurship embraces not only fine wines but deluxe hotels.
At San Francisco's Ritz-Carlton, where corporate travel accounts
for 60 percent of the hotel's traffic, business is increasingly
merging with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Ritz-Carlton Club is extremely popular,'' said Oliva,
adding that club-level room rates, directed at the well-heeled
traveler, are $425 a night _ $60 above starting rates elsewhere in
the 336-room Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   For the extra money, guests get private elevator keys, afternoon
cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, access to a club lounge and express
checkout. In-room features include telephones with two lines,
computer hook-ups and Italian marble bathrooms with double sinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stay on through the weekend, they bring their families,''
Oliva said. ``San Francisco is such a desirable city. People want
that special occasion here.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick said business at his travel agency has never been
better for outbound travelers headed for romantic 10- to 14-day
Italian getaways. Weddings, anniversaries and other special
occasions in Italy are very much on the itinerary for affluent
clients, he said. Without citing dollar amounts, Frederick said
this is ``a particularly strong year.''
</P>
<P>
   High style has become so attractive that Las Vegas, where
high-rollers usually go more for ring-a-ding-ding flash than muted
good taste, is flirting with elegance.
</P>
<P>
   At the Resort at Summerlin, a posh property 25 minutes from the
Strip that is set to open July 12, world-class golf and holistic
health treatments are on offer in addition to keno and poker. The
nightly fee at the Swiss Casinos-owned resort: $345 September
through May, $195 in summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going for that upper end that favors golf and spas, not
entertainment,'' said Brian McMullan, the president and chief
executive of the Resort at Summerlin. ``Our clientele is not
sensitive to price. Price is not a factor, it's service.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the resort _ opening on the edge of the private Summerlin
community, a 36-square mile development built by the Howard Hughes
Corp. _ has a staff of 1,800 to pamper guests bedding down in its
541 rooms, split between two six-story Regent International Hotels
that flank a stand-alone casino.
</P>
<P>
   McMullan said the good times have given birth to the Resort at
Summerlin, but he added: ``We think our sort of resort could work
even in bad times. We have a select market. We're only aiming at
the top 2 percent.''

WHAT NEXT FOR THE PRESIDENT?

 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how loath he is to leave center stage, the national
curtain will soon start to inch closed on Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, The New Yorker magazine raised the inevitable
question: After having held the most powerful office in the world
for eight years, what will an ex-president of only 54 do once he
leaves the Oval Office? Run for the US Senate from Arkansas in
2002, the magazine suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said no way. ``That story is crazy and I don't know
where they got it from,'' Clinton reportedly told his spokesman,
Joe Lockhart. (Translation: Hillary will kill me if I start my
Senate campaign before she finishes hers.)
</P>
<P>
   Queried about his plans at a recent press conference, the
president said he plans to split his time between New York, where
Hillary is readying a US Senate run, and Arkansas, where he will
build his presidential library and public policy center.
</P>
<P>
   But all that seems more than a little dull and dignified from a
man who, as president, has been anything but. This, after all, is a
politician who plays the saxophone as well as he plays the field, a
president who has loved the office so much that he has savored even
the bad days.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should be thinking more creatively. If he doesn't,
others will do so for him. They already are, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, says David Kozak, program chairman for the Center for
the Study of the Presidency, is where Bill Clinton wants to be.
Clinton associates have denied that he will take a job with Steven
Spielberg at the DreamWorks studio, but those who expect that the
Clintons will part ways when their White House years end suspect
it's the stars that will draw him, eyes wide shut, to the other
intriguing possibilities of the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we hear that he is going to move with Mrs. Clinton to
New York, but among people who study the presidency, it is
axiomatic that he is going to settle in California and become part
of the entertainment industry or Silicon Valley,'' Kozak says. Why,
he could even appear on the big screen. Now that Tom Selleck has
done a May-December cameo on ``Friends,'' why couldn't Bill take a
six-show spin on that show as the new older man in Monica's life?
And that name . . .
</P>
<P>
   Kozak sees other reasons to go to California: Saddled with
staggering legal debts, Clinton needs to make serious money before
he even thinks about settling into a more dignified retirement
role. Second, during his presidency, the celebrity-crazed president
has cultivated both industries.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation increasingly asking, what do you do with a
sunken president, that's hardly the only speculative alternative.
Herein, some other suggestions, serious and otherwise, for the
Clinton post-presidency.
</P>
<P>
   From John Adams onward, presidents have taken up the quill to
tell their story, secure their place in history, or settle old
scores. And historically, some of the very best books have come
from some of the very worst presidents. Ulysses S. Grant, Herbert
Hoover, and Richard Nixon all spring to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's previous attempts at book-writing have been dull
indeed. ``Between Hope and History,'' his 1996 attempt at pensees,
was a snooze indeed. A book on race relations seems similarly
doomed for lack of a clear message.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every president has a good story to tell. In this case,
the real story is less of the times than of the man who made them
so tumultuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will probably do a book,'' said presidential
historian Paul Boller, professor emeritus at Texas Christian
University. ``He might feel a special need to justify or explain.''
(Ah, that academic understatement.)
</P>
<P>
   But for such a book to work, Clinton would have to tell the full
truth, something that has proved a challenge in the past. But that
same penchant for periphrasis could lead to another career
opportunity. . . .
</P>
<P>
   As a keen student of politics and policy, the man who solved the
electoral college puzzle and brought the Democrats back to power
would be a natural teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very experienced in the realm of politics and policy,
and I think he would make a good natural teacher, despite his
peccadilloes,'' said author and cultural critic Camille Paglia.
</P>
<P>
   Few presidents have been as skilled a communicator as William
Jefferson Clinton. Fewer still have had the president's supple
mastery of English nuance. And no one has been as skillfully
slippery in using that ability to cover his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   From his Arkansas insistence that he had never ``broken the laws
of my country'' to cover his English pot-puffing to his recent
insistence that he hadn't been aware of any espionage at America's
nuclear labs to gloss over the fact he had been briefed on security
breaches elsewhere, Clinton is a master at shaping words to suit
his needs. Meanwhile, his ground-breaking inquiry into the many
layers of meaning that attend words like ``sex,'' ``is,'' and
``alone'' has proved as significant in the annals of dissembling as
Noam Chomsky's analysis of syntactic structures was in the
epistemology of grammar.
</P>
<P>
   One Prediction: ``GOV 401: Denying Without Lying'' would be a
popular course in any public-affairs program.
</P>
<P>
   Could Clinton go to the high court? That seems unlikely. He has
no judicial experience, and after his own impeachment follies, it's
doubtful he'd want to give the US Senate a second chance to pass on
his character and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, of course, such an appointment would depend
on Vice President Al Gore winning in 2000 and his willingness to
wage a high-stakes battle to make his old boss a controlling legal
authority. Both seem problematic.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another sort of silk-robe role both more enticing
and more in keeping with the temper of the times. Despite the
disapproving frown of middle-aged America, the young have
rediscovered the Playboy Philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, at 72, publisher Hugh Hefner is no longer the best
spokesman for the libertine lifestyle he made famous. In fact, as
the silk-pajamaed septuagenarian wanders among guests 40 years his
junior, he looks a bit like an elderly houseguest awakened by the
party who has donned his slippers and wandered downstairs to seek
the source of the din.

 KULA SHAKER MAKES A `BIG' ALBUM FOR THE '90s  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years can be an eternity in the here-today, gone-tomorrow
world of pop music. Until the release of ``Peasants, Pigs and
Astronauts'' two weeks ago, it had been that long since Kula Shaker
had released a CD, that long since it was the hot new band of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Was the band worried? No. Was it aware of the clock ticking?
Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we made a conscious effort,'' says singer-guitarist
Crispian Mills, from London, ``even if it made things a little more
difficult for us by waiting a long time, because we had to make an
album that we really loved, and if we felt that we'd rushed it and
that we hadn't done as good as we could have at that time, that
wouldn't have really been productive. So the music was the top
priority and I was lucky that we had that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britain is a very, very fast turnover type of place,''
continues Mills, son of actress Hayley Mills, ``because it all
happens at once. It's one (small) country and there is one (main)
radio station and that's a bit insane. But I think that you need a
certain degree of faith and confidence to (make music) in the first
place and if you haven't got that, you're not going to last anyway.
I think that for us making this album was the most important thing
that we've done so far, even more important than (the first album)
`K,' because however well the album does, it will end up being all
about making music. The most important thing is, we still love the
album six months after we've recorded it. That's rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills and his mates _ bassist Alonza Bevan, drummer Paul
Winterhart, and organist Jay Darlington _ have reason to be
cheerful: ``Peasants, Pigs and Astronauts'' is a brilliant
mind-blower of a disc, an expansive sonic sojourn through
Eastern-tinged psychedelia and lush, full-blown space rock. It's
rich and multilayered. Its vision is optimistic, though not blindly
so. In ``SOS,'' Mills sings, ``This is the age of decay and
hypocrisy / Sometimes I feel like the world isn't ready for me.''
The album is, well, a journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cliched term, about an album being a journey,'' says
Mills, with a laugh, ``but it's a lot more difficult than anyone
thinks to create an album like that. It was something that we
wanted to try and achieve. On that journey, you visit lots of
different places and have lots of different people that you meet,
there are questions that you ask, so that by the time that you get
to the end you know you're somewhere else altogether from when you
started. It was ambitious and, at the same time, it felt kind of
natural. Sometimes, we'd throw a song in the middle of it all that
kind of broke up the flow of the concept a bit. `108 Battles (Of
the Mind)' is like that. It just comes out of nowhere and somebody
comes in with `I'm losing my mind!' and then we go off again. . . .
By the end of the album, we're singing in this Indian dialect,
Braj-Bhasi, and you don't know what planet you're on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills calls the music ``soundscapes.''
</P>
<P>
   The friendly ghost of Pink Floyd hovered over this project. Kula
Shaker recorded ``P, P and A'' on Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour's
Victorian houseboat/studio, docked in London. The album was
produced by Bob Ezrin, who did the same duty for Floyd's ``The
Wall.'' (``Sound of Drums,'' the single Kula Shaker recorded in
1997 with Rick Rubin and George Drakoulias, is also included.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like one of the first bands to make `big' albums,
`big' sounds, they started all of that,'' says Mills, of Pink
Floyd, ``with `The Piper at the Gates of Dawn' and `Dark Side of
the Moon.' Both are completely different albums, but both changed
the way people listen to music. `Piper' kind of took over where
(the Beatles') `Sgt. Pepper' left off, and `Dark Side of the Moon'
was a combination of all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Kula Shaker differs, certainly from the latter-day Pink
Floyd, is in its sense of affirmation, its embrace of uplift and
splendor. Mills doesn't want to get all Pollyanna-ish about it. ``I
mean, we write lots of different songs,'' he says, ``and this,
`Peasants, Pigs and Astronauts,' is what we ended up deciding was
the best set of songs, the right flow of ideas. We have definitely
written some depressing songs, there is no doubt about that. We
tend not to record them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although, he adds, ``there's tracks on the album like `S.O.S.'
and `I'm Still Here' that are really over the top. But I feel that
is only part of the picture. You have to balance it out with other
types of vibes.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Ezrin, who came out of a 10-year retirement, and Kula
Shaker both enjoy sound as effect, and Mills admits the
collaboration was something of a mutual indulgence society. ``The
most important thing is that we both had fun and we tried ideas
that would make us laugh,'' says Mills. ``That guy definitely has
lost his mind. There was one point in the studio where no one would
talk to each other unless they had a megaphone.''
</P>
<P>
   The mix of Indian music and English rock comes naturally to
Mills. ``I've been listening'' to Indian music ``a long, long
time,'' says Mills. They began integrating the sounds on ``K'' and
continue doing so here with Indian flutes, tablas, and the like.
(Outside musicians actually play those instruments on the album;
Mills says the band isn't proficient rnough on them to do it. In
concert, Kula Shaker triggers samples.) ``It's a great album to do
live,'' says Mills, of ``Peasants, Pigs and Astronauts.'' ``It's
difficult, but it tests you as a musician.''

SHOWING THE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Assuming the weatherpeople were right, your spirits may be
flagging this Fourth of July, even if the flag is flying high. (You
may even be resting in a flagged courtyard where flag-lilies grow,
but those flags are beyond our range today). Perhaps you'll be
lucky enough to flag down an ice cream vendor, if you must be on
the move.
</P>
<P>
   But what does your flagging energy have to do with the other
variety of flag, the verb that lets you flag a page with a Post-It
or flag in a race-car driver?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, as it turns out. For centuries, that flag was only a
noun _ the one you run up the pole, or carry into battle _ not a
transitive verb. Found in English around 1500, this flag has
obscure but definitely Germanic origins, though nobody's sure which
language invented it. `Whether the word originated in Eng., Du., or
Scandinavian,'' says the Oxford English Dictionary, ``it may
plausibly be supposed to be an onomatopoeic form expressing the
notion of something flapping in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 19th century, and railroads, and signalmen waving
flags at trains _ and English, with its usual adaptability, made
flag into a verb. Pretty soon, you didn't even need a flag to flag
a taxi: the verb could describe any kind of summons or alert,
whether by a hand wave or an urgent e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The other, intransitive flag _ to droop, fail, lose energy _ has
a different source entirely, in Old French flac, from the Latin
root that gives us flaccid. Thus you can flag a tow truck, a boat's
sails can flag for lack of a breeze, and your attention can flag _
thanks to the flexibility of English, which declared its
independence from tyrannical rule long before 1776.
</P>
<P>
   Mantras, American style
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Noonan of Wellesley is annoyed by the way mantra has been
co-opted, as we used to say, and spread about promiscuously in the
language of commerce. ``Slogans such as `Let's put the customer
first' aren't meant to inspire a vision in the mind of the
beholder,'' he notes. He would prefer that we use mantra only for
``a meaningless word or phrase designed to empty the word of
bothersome thoughts,'' not for company mottos designed to keep
workers on message.
</P>
<P>
   Mantra has, indeed, been a buzzword of the decade. Though it
arrived back in the '60s, along with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,
transcendental meditation, and the Summer of Love _ ``Got any
mantras?'' George Harrison is supposed to have asked on meeting the
Maharishi _ the word has achieved yogic flight only in the '90s. In
Globe stories, a decent if rough barometer of word acceptance,
mantra was used just 26 times in 1988. Four years later it topped
100 citations, and in 1998 it hit 200. As Noonan notes, that's
probably because businesses _ many now led by the Beatles
generation _ picked it up as a hip substitute for ``motto,'' and
journalists followed along.
</P>
<P>
   But are we doing violence to the word? Mantras are not, in fact,
meaningless words (at least, if you know Sanskrit); I don't know
what the Maharishi offered George, but generally mantras for
meditations are holy words or names on which one focuses the mind,
not mere nonsense meant to empty it.
</P>
<P>
   So when a business refers to its mantra, it's not necessarily
warping the meaning, says Jack Hawley, a professor of religion at
Barnard College whose specialty is Hinduism. ``Surely `the customer
is always right' is a mantra in all senses _ proper discipline for
new employees and old adepts,'' he says. We may disapprove on
cultural grounds _ the object of worship here is the almighty
dollar _ but the extension of meaning is natural.
</P>
<P>
   And our mantra's no more of a stretch than the treatment we've
given other Hindu borrowings: Our pundits are not learned scholars,
but people shouting at each other on TV; our gurus are not just
spiritual guides but garden advisers and personal trainers; and we
talk about who has good parking-space karma, bad pun intended.
</P>
<P>
   So far, I've heard no protests that these adopted words are
being soiled by Americans' casual treatment; in fact, a report in
The Ethnic NewsWatch a couple of years ago seemed to celebrate the
Hindu invasion of English, noting that US companies were calling
themselves Avatar and Shiva and a Web game connection was named
Kali. Perhaps the author felt the same smugness we do when the
French adopt terms like popcorn and weekend: Our word is the best!
</P>
<P>
   And after all these centuries, Sanskrit can probably hold its
own against American

WRONG RX FOR HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton had plenty to say last week about the crisis
at teaching hospitals that he and Congress have caused.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke about the red ink that is pouring out of hospitals,
nursing homes, and home health care providers as a result of
cutbacks that helped produce a balanced federal budget two years
ago, but have proved nearly twice as deep and service-threatening
since then.
</P>
<P>
   But he was anything but helpful, suggesting that it will take
Congress's initiative to right a wrong that is severely injuring a
sector that provides more than 10 percent of all the jobs in
Massachusetts, and is also a major player in California and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, given the context of the question he was asked, it may
take some vocal dissent from a certain Democratic candidate for the
Senate in New York named Clinton to jolt him out of his current
position in the end. In the meantime, it will certainly take hard
work by the Senate's leading health care champion, Edward Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The work is delicate, because it affects the fiscal viability of
the president's overall, commendable plan to modernize Medicare
with a useful prescription drug benefit; but it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   The background is not all that complicated. When the president
and Congress negotiated the last lap of the decade-long journey to
fiscal sanity two years ago, Medicare _ and specifically the
providers of care under the giant program _ was hit for roughly
three out of every four dollars of budget restraint in the package.
At the time, the official estimate came in at about $105 billion,
but in actual practice the hit is proving to be more like $200
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In simple English, that wasn't the deal. But in his latest
proposal, the president is asking that providers not only eat the
higher amount, but absorb even more.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Massachusetts Hospital Association, the hit on
all providers in the state from the 1997 budget deal was a
whoppping $1.7 billion. What Clinton proposed last week would add
nearly another billion to that, net, with $600 million coming out
of the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Before people start a ``who cares?'' chant, listen to some of
Jeffrey Otten's recitation of recent developments in the state. He
not only chairs the Massachusetts Hospital Associationcheck, but is
CEO at Brigham and Women's (which, with Massachusetts General,
makes up the giant Partners HealthCare System).
</P>
<P>
   What has been happening is that one out of every four hospital
beds in the state has gone out of service, including more than a
third of the beds in Boston. Roughly one of every five hospitals in
Massachusetts, moreover, has closed its doors for good.
</P>
<P>
   As Otten notes, there is every kind of pressure imaginable on
the demand side of care, and precious little action of the supply
side. Great, but expensive strides are occuring in technology and
drugs, but no one wants to pay; patients want access to the system
for all the right reasons, but it is less of a system in many
respects, facing a severe labor shortage that is genuinely alarming
in the case of nurses, and about to face the ticking time bomb of
aging baby boomers; and no prospects for increased revenue are in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Already, roughly half of the hospitals have negative operating
margins on their Medicare operations (as in losing money). The
cutbacks have had the effect of gradually eliminating many positive
margins on in-patient care, which in the past have been used to
offset large deficits in out-patient services. Simply put, Medicare
cannot be healthy _ as in there when we need it _ if its most
important providers bleed red ink to run it.
</P>
<P>
   And the president's plan would make a bad situation worse. The
1997 cutbacks will be allowed to expire on schedule in three years
for nursing homes and the burgeoning home health care providers _ a
case of squeaky wheels getting grease. But with one exception, his
proposal is to keep them on for hospitals, on top of the fact that
the '97 cutbacks have proved far more severe than envisaged by the
budget dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The only semi-serious concession in the package is a proposed
$7.5 billion fund to ``alleviate present problems'' (Clinton's
words) at Congress's discretion. And the president actually said
that concerned senators should first support him on his overall
plan and then come in and deal for the scraps to assist genuinely
hurting institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, it should be the other way around. There are plenty
of ways to finance a needed reform of Medicare that don't target
its most important institutional participant.

KUBRICK DVD DEMONSTRATES HIS GENIUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most directors make movies for a living. Stanley Kubrick lived
to make movies.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker, who died unexpectedly in March, was an enigma.
The Bronx-born resident of England has been described as aloof,
obsessed, calculating, cold, cutting, compassionate, funny,
humorless, sympathetic, tough, and understanding in books ranging
from Vincent LoBrutto's ``Stanley Kubrick: A Biography'' to Norman
Kagan's ``The Cinema of Stanley Kubrick.'' He never went to film
school but began as a freelance magazine photographer for Look in
1949. He was trained not by the studios but on the streets of New
York, hanging around animator Faith Hubley's studio at 1600
Broadway. ``He was a sponge,'' Hubley told biographer LoBrutto. He
spent days in movie theaters and at the Museum of Modern Art,
looking at all sorts of movies _ good, bad, and indifferent. He
was, as Hubley said, soaking it up. He was always an independent _
independent of mind and spirit and, perhaps most of all,
independent of market forces.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, historians, and fans argue the merits of Kubrick's
movies based on conventional theories that emphasize constancy of
theme and the consistency of visual expression. The reason no one
can reach a convenient, comfortable conclusion about Kubrick and
his films is that the filmmaker's life and art cannot be measured
using conventional methods. He must be appreciated as _ and here I
will use a word that I've never used to describe a director _ a
genius.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's artistry is formed and informed by curiosity. To use a
crude, but appropriate, analogy: Most cooks, when they need to
bake, go to the store for a sack of flour, bring it home, add the
other ingredients, and toss it into the oven. When it's done, they
take it out and eat it. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   That's also the way most directors make movies. Not Kubrick.
He'd buy the flour but ask the salesclerk where he got it. He'd go
to the distribution center where the flour was stored and ask them
the same question. He'd go to the miller who ground it and the
farmer who grew it. He'd want to know the acidity of the soil, the
quality of the fertilizer, the precise watering schedule, the
genesis of the seed, and dozens of other things involved with the
process. And that doesn't include his questions about yeast, eggs,
water, the chemical processes that convert a lump of dough into a
fluffy food, and the matter of digestion.
</P>
<P>
   That's why his bread would never look or taste like anyone
else's.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, , all of Kubrick's major movies were released on DVD.
Only ``Killer's Kiss,'' ``The Killing,'' ``Paths of Glory,''
``Spartacus,'' ``Dr. Strangelove,'' and ``2001: A Space Odyssey''
were made available in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The new technolgy gives Kubrick's imagery a crispness that's
better than anything since ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' opened in
Cinerama. But for those searching for insights into Kubrick's
methods, you won't get them here. There are not many special
features except for a BBC documentary made by Kubrick's daughter,
Viv, on the making of ``The Shining'' that's included on that
disc. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Desire for debate &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, Kubrick refused to talk much about the work because
he was afraid that his word would be taken as gospel, thus cutting
off further discussion. And if there was anything Kubrick wanted
his films to generate, it was discussion. He appreciated honest
opinions _ not particularly those of the critics, but the reaction
of fans and cinephiles. The more the interpretive envelope was
pushed, the more Kubrick liked it.
</P>
<P>
   The July release of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' the last film he made
before his death, has pushed interest in him to an all-time high,
and the DVDs bring out all the textural majesty of his work. Each
movie, in its own way, is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick was unique. His films looked different because he made
them differently. Even the early movies, such as ``The Killing,''
look like they were made yesterday because the director's vision
and execution were timeless. Never one to engage in passing
fancies, Kubrick chose themes that are classic. He made 13 films,
and he took his time. ``Eyes Wide Shut'' comes 12 years after
1987's ``Full Metal Jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons that he took so long. The facile answer
is because that's how long it takes. Jack Nicholson, in a telephone
interview, said that while they were working on ``The Shining,''
over 200 days in 1978-79, Kubrick was already discussing Arthur
Schnitzler's novel ``Traumnovelle,'' the book on which ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' is based. So the film starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman
took more than 20 years to make.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick moved from science fiction and horror and war to social
commentary and costume dramas and comedy with equal alacrity. Some
critics bemoan Kubrick's coolness, yet his best moments are
emotional, not intellectual. Kubrick defies what seems to be the
basic human need to stereotype and pigeonhole. While everyone else
seems to be looking for patterns, Kubrick, the scientist as artist,
kept looking to break them.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick gets full credit as a master of technical skill. In
``The Shining,'' he had lenses specially ground because the
available technology didn't match his way of seeing. He's lauded
for his use of sound, especially in ``Spartacus,'' where his
sophisticated sound mix set a new standard for the industry. In the
editing room, his encyclopedic memory _ sharpened by a lifetime as
a brilliant chess player _ helped him recall small details buried
under thousands of takes when he was editing ``Full Metal Jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Most directors see the filmmaking process as the fulfillment of
their preconceived notions. Whether it's Hitchcock, who
storyboarded every shot and had little to do with actors _ or the
brilliant Billy Wilder, who found his greatest pleasure in the
writing, there are few filmmakers who exhibited the spontaneous
control that Kubrick did. Although that sounds contradictory, it's
not. He motivated everyone who worked for him to work as hard as he
did and to bring their talents to the movie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seeing the unexpected &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's his underrated work with actors that put the final touches
on Kubrick's artistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always thinking,'' said Nicholson, who noted that
Kubrick worked everyone hard but ``it was worth it to get the
worked-on quality out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick cast Vince Edwards as a boy toy in ``The Killing''
because that's the way Kubrick saw him.
</P>
<P>
   He realized Peter Sellers could elevate both ``Dr. Strangelove:
Or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb'' and
``Lolita'' to another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting scenes (in `Lolita') were the ones with
Peter Sellers, which were total improvisations,'' recalled
``Lolita'' cinematographer Oswald Morris in the LoBrutto biography.
``They'd roughly block it out, go upstairs and leave me to light
it, then come down, for instance, with the table tennis scene.
There was nothing like that in the script, it was just off the
cuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When something went wrong, he wouldn't scream about it,'' said
Keir Dullea, star of ``2001.'' ``He'd take me to one side,
seemingly blaming himself more for the mistake than me. In reality,
of course, he was fingering my fault in an adult and sensible
way.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason he cast Nicholson in ``The Shining'' was because of
the star's complex feelings about marriage and family. He cast Ryan
O'Neal in the title role in his adaptation of William Makepeace
Thackeray's ``Barry Lyndon'' not because he thought the star of
``Love Story'' was the next Olivier. He saw O'Neal as a rather
dull, ambitious character, much like Lyndon, who could capture the
18th-century exterior qualities of the novel. When he needed a
woman emblematic of the languid aristocracy, he cast the well-bred
beauty Marisa Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   He cast the grunts in ``Full Metal Jacket'' because they were
anonymous performers, not stars. Lee Ermey, who played the
wacked-out drill instructor, was making his debut, and he treated
the other actors, his recruits, as he did the US Marines under his
care in real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate collaboration,'' said Matthew Modine, who
played Joker in ``Full Metal Jacket.'' ``Sure, Stanley makes you
work but that's why we're doing what we do. It was tough and
thrilling. He taught me how to do my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people think that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were cast in
``Eyes Wide Shut'' with an eye open for the box office. That may be
true. But the other eye, the artist's eye, wanted to see how a
husband and wife juggling their personal and professional lives _ a
couple whose sexual lives have always been open to speculation _
would play a husband and wife whose personal and professional lives
become intermingled and whose sex lives become entwined.
</P>
<P>
   Critics describe Kubrick's common use of multiple takes as a
kind of sadistic habit the director used to beat the actors into
submission. Again, nothing could be further from the truth.
``Stanley's always looking for something,'' said Nicholson. ``And
he invites the actor on his search. You have to prepare because it
isn't like most directors who already know what they want and just
want the actor to follow some predetermined path. Stanley invites
you on a journey. It's quite a trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson went on to say how much Kubrick respects actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not autocratic in the least,'' he said. ``He incorporates
suggestions from the actor. He's very open. You just have to be
ready to make the commitment to the work that he does. And that's
not always easy.'' Nicholson paused. ``But it's always
worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's oeuvre is settled _ and that's the tragedy. After
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' we can no longer look forward to a new Kubrick
film. It's reminiscent of a story Billy Wilder tells about him and
William Wyler leaving the funeral of the legendary Ernst Lubitsch.
``No more Lubitsch,'' Wilder said sadly to Wyler. ``Worse that
that,'' replied Wyler. ``No more Lubitsch pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse than that. No more Kubrick. No more Kubrick pictures.

 UNDATED: ... the din.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But think of the youthful glamour the ex-president could bring
to the role. Why, he could even write the advice column.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's television skills, his conversational charm, and his
sense of empathy make the modern television talk show one
possibility. Where better to discuss issues like family leave,
school uniforms, or sexual misbehavior?
</P>

Grand Jury They've Had an Improper Physical Relationship with a
Young Aide After Assuring Their Wives That Those Rumors Are Simply
the Work of a Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks Clinton would be well-cast for that
role. ``When you run a good talk show, you are always sort of
second banana to your guests,'' said Steven Stark, author of
``Glued to the Set,'' a book about groundbreaking TV shows. ``I
think he is too egocentric for that. It would be like Geraldo,
where Geraldo is always the central attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long eyed Jimmy Carter warily, but for a man
concerned with his post-presidency, the acclaim Carter has won with
his efforts to promote peace must seem enviable indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Could a man whom two-thirds of Americans consider a moral midget
on stilts (as a critic once quipped of Rousseau) ever hold such a
place in the public mind?
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly impossible, but experts say it will take both time
and work. Still, other ex-presidents have come further, from
greater disgrace or disapproval, to redeem themselves in the public
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Richard Nixon, for crying out loud,'' said Bruce
Buchanan, professor of government at the University of Texas at
Austin. ``He came from the political dead to where he was a
recognized elder statesman when he died.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's rehabilitation took years of careful effort. But years
are one thing Clinton will have to spare. Indeed, should he live
just a few weeks beyond his 86th birthday, he would surpass Herbert
Hoover's record for living the longest _ 31 years _ after leaving
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   And if Clinton spends that time as constructively as Hoover did,
he too could see his post-presidential good works outshine his
presidential misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CAREER CHANGERS IN HISTORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Past presidents have pursued any number of careers once they
have taken the long walk from power.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, Cincinnatus, the Roman general and statesman, seemed
the model, leaving power to return to his plow.
</P>
<P>
   Washington retired to Mount Vernon, his home in Virginia, and
though he returned briefly to command the provisional army when war
with France threatened, he was ever eager to disengage from public
life.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson repaired to Monticello to pursue the varied pleasures
of a gentleman farmer. Madison served as rector of the University
of Virginia, and never ventured outside the state for the 19 years
left to him after the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But other ex-chief executives returned to active public life.
Brushing aside concerns that it was beneath his post-presidential
dignity, John Quincy Adams ran for the US House of Representatives,
serving 17 distinguished years there, hoping all the while for a
presidential comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Boller, presidential historian and author of several books
about the presidents, cites the example of Andrew Johnson as one
that might particularly interest Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he was impeached and escaped conviction by just one
vote, he ran for the Senate and won,'' Boller says. ``It was a kind
of vindication for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams and Johnson weren't the only presidents to win important
post-presidential offices. William Howard Taft ended up chief
justice of the Supreme Court, a job he relished far more than that
of chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those men was as young as Clinton, who'll be 54 next
year. Teddy Roosevelt, who at 50 was younger on leaving office,
waged his Bull Moose comeback attempt, and when that failed, went
exploring in Brazil, and then tried for a battlefield command in
World War I. Even if the 22d Amendment didn't foreclose another
term for Clinton, public opinion surely would. And as for a
battlefield command? Hard to see that interesting him.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy, at 43 the youngest elected chief executive,
didn't get the chance to experience a post-presidency, but
according to Richard Reeves's splendid ``President Kennedy: Profile
of Power,'' JFK wanted to stay in public life.
</P>
<P>
   After his presidency, he'd run for the US Senate again, Kennedy
told his old friend Paul Fay, then perhaps serve as secretary of
state if brothers Bobby or Teddy followed him to the Oval Office.
Or, he said, maybe he and his old Navy buddy would just ``drift
through the Greek islands, with our wives administering to our
every wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to imagine Hillary Rodham Clinton agreeing to that. That's
assuming, of course, she hasn't abandoned the USS Clinton
altogether by then.

CLINTON SHOWS US THE OTHER AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Presidents are simply not known for doing what
President Clinton is setting out to do this week _ doggedly call
attention to the shortcomings in his signature accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   How else to describe a carefully-planned journey through some of
the poorest chunks of real estate in the country that have been
left out of the decade's astonishing economic resurgence?
</P>
<P>
   The president, however, is not simply raising consciousness by
dragging a group of corporate leaders and the press from the
Kentucky Highlands in Appalachia to a Native American reservation
within the poorest county in the country in the High Plains, from
the Mississippi Delta to the sprawling ghetto of Watts in Los
Angeles, from the under-capitalized Hispanic community of South
Phoenix to peristently poor East St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   He is also trying to dramatize a few important points about the
economic future: that the biggest difference between making and not
making a decent living is the level of one's education; that
poverty in rural and urban America is a function of isolation from
the economic mainstream; and that after having made a huge
difference in eliminating some of the worst manifestations of
poverty over the last generation (hunger, absence of sanitation,
presence of industrial poisons, destitution among the elderly), the
next challenge for government is to stimulate and leverage private
investment in struggling communities.
</P>
<P>
   More of it is happening than most people realize; and a lot more
can and should happen as the decade's economic expansion begins at
last to reach down the income scale. In time, the smart business
guys are going to figure out an obvious truth that an extra-smart
few are already grasping _ one of the next great opportunities for
growth in the mature US economy can come from the rising incomes
and even assets of people who are poor in places that have remained
far behind the rest of the country _ hence the administration's
moniker for a collection of worthwhile initiatives, New Markets.
According to White House officials, there is nearly a $100 billion
consumer market out there, grossly underdeveloped but very
inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example will be on display when Clinton's entourage
reaches the Pine Ridge Oglala Sioux Reservation in western South
Dakota, most of which is within the poorest county in the United
States, Shannon. Almost half the 12,000 residents are officially
poor (well over three times the national average), the jobless rate
of 12 percent is four times the national number, and social
conditions would break the hardest heart.
</P>
<P>
   It's also next to impossible to get a home mortgage on the
reservation, where the land is not owned privately. But Fannie Mae,
the secondary mortgage market behemoth, is about to help change
that with a program to underwrite mortgages only on dwellings. And
the company is already becoming famous for pioneering in the
development of mortgages that require little or no down payment,
and everybody knows how the economic ripple effects of housing
development work.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Kentucky, Illinois, Mississippi, and Arizona,
Clinton will highlight how local development companies have been
able to leverage public money to attract private investment _ to
expand businesses, start new ones, or help attract jobs-producing
investment from outside. And in Watts _ a classically isolated
urban community that has no useful public transportation and has
been abadoned by scores of employers _ efforts by companies to come
right into the high schools for training programs that lead to jobs
will be highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip is connected to a specific agenda that flows
easily from six years of multibillion-dollar results in getting 125
empowerment zones up and running, creating a vigorous
welfare-to-work operation, expanding new community development
financial institutions, and cleaning up toxic sites for productive
development.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton wants to leverage another $15 billion in investment
by proposing a new income tax credit for up to 25 percent of the
money put into these business-developing institutions. And he also
wants to authorize domestic investment companies to promote
projects in inner city and rural areas the same way the Overseas
Private Investment Corp. operates in emerging markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   This is no mere photo opportunity, and to the extent it is it
draws attention to what has not been accomplished this decade. But
with another presidential election looming, Clinton's mission
demonstrates that bringing prosperity to the places that have been
bypassed requires more than compassion; it demands new thinking and
hard work.

THE MAN WHO HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED IN `FAME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fame'' may live forever.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be fine with David De Silva, a.k.a. Father Fame.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the phone interview is over, it's not clear whether
the sobriquet is a paternal reference or a religious one. Because
when it comes to ``Fame: The Musical,'' De Silva's unbridled
enthusiasm takes on messianic qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's played in 16 countries and had more than 4,000
performances,'' says De Silva from his Manhattan apartment. It will
add another city to its hit list when ``Fame: The Musical'' opens
on Tuesday for a two-week run at the Wang Theatre. ``It's amazing .
. . and wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Fame: The Musical'' is directed and choreographed by
Lars Bethke with lyrics by Jacques Levy, music by Steve Margoshes,
and a book by Jose Fernandez, it's De Silva who's been with it
since the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   De Silva conceived the idea for a musical based on a high school
specializing in the performing arts in the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked the idea of magnet schools,'' he says.
``Schools that take kids out of their own neighborhoods are good
for expanding their perspectives. I also think that it gets
students together with similar interests, and through friendship
they achieve more. I thought it would be a good idea for a show.''
</P>
<P>
   It was.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most amazing aspects to the story is that it took so
long for ``Fame'' to make it to the stage. Traditionally, a musical
opens on Broadway. If it's successful, it's sold as a movie. If
that's successful, it might become a TV special.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Fame'' began as a 1980 Alan Parker movie, transmogrified
into an NBC series that ran from Jan. 7, 1982, until Aug. 4, 1983,
on the network and until 1987 in syndication. It wasn't until 1989
that the stage version emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted it onstage, and we were headed for Broadway,''
says De Silva, 60, whose enthusiastic voice makes him sound like
one of the bright, optimistic kids in his show. ``But it didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   De Silva sold the film rights to his idea about a bunch of
all-singing, all-dancing, all-races, all-classes students at New
York's performing arts high school to MGM in the late '70s. In
1980, Parker's musical (or, more accurately, film with music) hit
it big in the nation's movie theaters. The idea of fresh-faced,
talented teenagers all grasping for the elusive brass ring of fame
hit at just the right time. They wanted to live forever. They
wanted us to remember their names. It was multicultural,
multiracial, and multidimensional.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, choreographer-actress Debbie Allen led a gaggle of
newcomers into the TV version. During a visit to the set on a sound
stage at the Burbank Studios, it was clear that the teenagers who
were playing characters on the verge of stardom saw themselves as
on the verge of stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really play ourselves, but we play characters who
have the same goals,'' said Lori Singer, one of the stars, at the
time. And they still do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a theme that everyone understands,'' says De Silva. ``No
matter what you're interested in, it applies that you want to
achieve something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Although De Silva was listed as a consulting producer on the TV
show, he didn't have much to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have control over the screenplay and movie or the TV
show,'' says De Silva. ``But I did one smart thing. I retained the
stage rights. I always knew we would find a home for it in the
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would take a lot longer than De Silva thought.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, following a successful tryout in Miami and a smash run
at Philadelphia's Walnut Street Theatre, it looked as if ``Fame''
was destined to play just downtown from the Fiorello LaGuardia High
School of Music and Art and Performing Arts where the musical is
set _ on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   But there were problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost ready,'' says De Silva, without going into
detail. ``But none of the people involved could agree on how to put
on those final touches. And the timing was off. I realize now that
not going to Broadway was a blessing in disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because with the way everything has turned out, I couldn't be
happier,'' says the former history teacher turned theatrical agent
turned producer.
</P>
<P>
   De Silva, borrowing a page from his never-say-die musical,
refused to surrender. In 1990, the script for ``Fame: The Musical''
was published in Music Theater International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some producers read it in Stockholm,'' he says. ``And they
decided to put it on. It ran for two years _ in Swedish. It opened
in Britain, later. In the West End of London. It was so successful
in the United Kingdom that it generated more than 60 productions in
Great Britain _ in schools, community companies, and little
theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   De Silva is rolling. Enough about not making it to Broadway.
Let's accentuate the positive. ``Fame'' has apparently made it
everywhere else. He's just returned from Denmark, where a
production just opened. He went to Buenos Aires for a Spanish
production, and he's headed to Sydney next month for the Australian
version.
</P>
<P>
   And he's getting a little tired of talking about the business
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really like about the show is that it celebrates the
American musical. It gets young people involved in participating
and going to the theater. `Grease' can have the '50s and `Rent' the
'90s, we've got the '80s,'' says De Silva, in a tone suggesting the
decades concept didn't just occur to him. ``It brings together kids
of all races and classes. Black, white, Asian, rich, poor. And it's
organic. Everything that arises in the story comes from the
characters and their situation. We didn't cast stars. We cast
really talented performers who, like the characters they play, need
a shot at show business. But it's not meant to persuade students to
go into the musical theater. It's about getting young people to
appreciate the arts. To capture the kind of inspirational feelings
I had when I started going to the theater in the '50s. It's that
kind of show. The kind of show that invites them in and invites
them back.''
</P>
<P>
   But will ``Fame'' last forever?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will last forever in the theater as a blueprint for young
people who want to achieve something in life,'' says De Silva,
unapologetically. ``It's gone beyond my wildest dreams.''

FRUSTRATED CHRISTIAN RIGHT TESTS ITS FAITH IN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Bobbie Gobel, the irrepressible face of religious
conservatives in the grain belt, fought for the top position in the
Iowa Christian Coalition because she wanted a political pulpit to
work against abortion, to fight for prayer in public schools, and
to mobilize for next winter's Republican presidential caucuses
here.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't count on fighting a rear-guard action against some of
her former allies who, in influential books and articles, are
arguing that the place of religious conservatives is in the church
pew, not in the public square.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, as candidates crisscross Iowa and New Hampshire,
as the debate over values flares on Capitol Hill, and as efforts
nationwide to post the Ten Commandments in public places continue,
the religious-conservative movement is in upheaval and consumed by
self-doubt. As sure as they are that their arguments should carry
the day in public debate, religious conservatives are increasingly
unsure about taking part in the political debate at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the aftermath of Ronald Reagan's victory in 1980 and
the Republican congressional victory of 1994,'' says Ralph E. Reed
Jr., the onetime executive director of the Christian Coalition who
is now an independent political consultant. ``People are developing
a sense of frustration, even despair, that 20 or 25 years of
political engagement has not really reversed some of the things we
most wanted to put to an end, like abortion on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   And so this summer, as the political season heats up, religious
fundamentalists are taking part in a millennial debate on political
fundamentals that could shape the political world as deeply as the
influx of religious conservatives upended politics in the Reagan
years.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are Cal Thomas, a prominent commentator, and Paul
Weyrich, a prominent conservative theorist, both founding fathers
of the modern religious-conservative movement. They're now arguing
that religious goals and political goals are irreconcilable and
that political involvement compromises people of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the church takes up the ballot,'' says Thomas, a former
aide to the Rev. Jerry Falwell and his Moral Majority, ``it leaves
behind the greater power for the lesser power.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are activists such as Gobel who believe their
political battles are a mission from God, an echo of God's will,
not a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame on Cal Thomas,'' says Gobel, who is quick to add: ``But
I forgive him and I love him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, thus far, a quiet, civil struggle, but one that could
prove as consequential, as divisive, and as bitter as the struggles
with liberals on abortion, school prayer, and creationism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big strain in the evangelical movement to save one
soul at a time and reform society through individual conversion,''
says James Guth of Furman University, an expert on religious
conservatives. ``That is the classic evangelical theology, and it
has always been the core social approach of evangelical
Protestants. The idea of reforming institutions and changing laws _
the ideas of Falwell and Pat Robertson _ is the new idea.''
</P>
<P>
   This period of introspection among religious conservatives was
prompted in large measure by the school shootings in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Columbine hit, it really became very clear that it is the
heart of man that needs to be changed, and that's our work,'' says
the Rev. Richard L. Hardy, associate pastor of the First Assembly
of God Church in Des Moines. ``Political legislation can't change a
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Charles L. Austin, associate pastor of Southtown
Pentecostal Assembly in Des Moines, said the shootings made him
think ``we have to rekindle'' the political fire and make it ``even
hotter,'' adding: ``We have withdrawn into our own little cells too
many times. We have forgotten who the enemy is. The enemy is the
devil, Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   Some religious conservatives regard the views of Thomas and
Weyrich as the weariness of an old guard _ and proof that the first
generation of modern religious conservatives probably ought to move
to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Cal Thomas generation is tired, give me the baton,''
says Craig Bergman, 34, executive director of the Iowa Christian
Coalition. ``I'm not tired. I have not yet begun to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the power of the Christian right came from Americans who
hadn't voted, hadn't attended political caucuses, hadn't manned
phone booths, and hadn't canvassed their neighbors before. By
swarming into the political system, they pushed the Republican
Party to the right, made the antiabortion creed part of the GOP
platform, and even forced Democratic politicians to learn to talk
about their faith and relationship with God, as Vice President Al
Gore did just last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've won,'' says Jeffrey Hadden, a University of Virginia
political scientist who specializes in religious conservatives.
``They've changed the shape of America. And now they are saying
that they shouldn't do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the founder of the Family Research Council and a
Republican candidate for president, rejects the call for retreat.
``It's ludicrous _ and it's odd,'' he says. ``The whole country's
concerned about declining voter turnout and citizen involvement.
Why would we flail around trying to get people involved in politics
but say to religious conservatives, `We don't mean you'?''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's campaign is fueled in large measure by religious
conservatives. Just last week, for example, he gained the support
of the Rev. Olan Adams, who heads the Iowa Association of Christian
Schools; Ruth Beyer, president of Iowa Right to Life; Sandy DeLong,
treasurer of Iowa Right to Life; the Rev. Larry Johnson, who heads
the Iowa American Family Association; and Dave Karwoski, a former
board member of the Iowa Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Many newcomers from the religious right took to politics
immediately, won important seats on state party committees in
places like Iowa and Kansas, captured school boards and even, in
the case of Bauer, mounted presidential campaigns of their own. Now
they are as much a part of the political scene as the old-time
fiscal conservatives of Midwestern Republicanism, the old-time
social liberals of the Northeast, and the old-time populists of the
prairies.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them are just as unwilling to relinquish the place
they won at the political table. ``If people can meet at a bowling
alley and roll a black ball down a lane,'' says Gobel, the Iowa
Christian Coalition chairwoman, ``then I can gather once a week at
a church and tell people who should be sitting in the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   In public appearances and in the book ``Blinded by Might,''
written with the Rev. Edward Dobson, Thomas argues that ministers,
with eyes on a higher kingdom, demean themselves and their message
when they get down in the trenches of partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come into the political arena,'' Thomas says, ``truth
is never advanced. It becomes a power game of a temporal kingdom.
It's the ultimate seduction and the ultimate temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues, moreover, that the political arena is less persuasive
and less powerful than the spiritual world. ``The greater power is
the power of the church to transform men's hearts and minds. When
it overly relies on politics, it changes neither hearts nor
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Weyrich, meanwhile, is calling for what he described in an essay
in The Washington Post as ``a change in strategy,'' away from the
effort to elect conservatives to existing political institutions
and toward building ``new institutions for ourselves: schools,
universities, media, entertainment, everything _ a complete,
separate, parallel structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gobel, who speaks with passion about her commitment to the
country and to children, dismisses those notions. ``We've come so
far,'' she says. ``We should be in the political arena. God wants
us there because He trusts us, and we're there because we trust
Him.''
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledges that the Thomas and Weyrich theses have
shaken the confidence of religious conservatives, and she says
Thomas especially has made some of her allies unsure and uneasy
about their role, even as their convictions grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has scared some pastors with his books,'' she says.
``People see Cal as a godly man, and they think that if Cal can
back out of all this, maybe they should, too. They wonder if he has
some wisdom that they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a war of conscience among people of conscience, and the
first battle may come when the Christian Coalition distributes its
voter guides for next year's elections. Some pastors, including
Hardy, say they will not place the guides in church bulletins, but
will make them available on a counter top.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're making a good-faith effort to make them
available,'' he says, citing the uneasiness that Democrats and
independents in the First Assembly of God feel toward the guides.
``I'm concerned about the appearance of endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gobel says she will get the guides distributed among Hardy's
parishioners, even if it means putting roller blades on her seven
children and dispatching them to place a guide on every windshield
in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his doubts about the ability of legislation to change
the public's heart, Hardy doesn't endorse a full retreat from
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because this debate is going on doesn't mean we pull
out,'' he says. ``Our responsibility in Scriptures is to be salt
and light in a world that needs the influence of Judeo-Christian
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, says Reed, the former Christian Coalition leader,
politics is too alluring to abandon. ``Politics is the closest
thing to an aphrodisiac that you've ever seen,'' he says. ``People
love it, and they can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over how to make a difference, and how much
difference religious conservatives can make, isn't disappearing, in
part because it is one of the basic debates of American political
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that evangelicals found politics fascinating
because it was so new to them,'' Reed says. ``It can be painful to
find that you don't usher in the millennium by winning a political
election, but it is also helpful for realizing that politics is
only a part of a broader agenda that also includes a dose of racial
reconciliation, a dose of evangelism, a dose of charitable
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be truly effective at politics,'' Reed says, ``you have to
recognize its limits.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A power failure at a California center
interrupted wireless message service to about 2 million PageNet
customers in the West and Hawaii, the company said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Customers were unable to get messages Monday from 2 to 4 p.m.,
said Scott Baradell, a company spokesman. But usage was likely to
have been light because of the holiday weekend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   People trying to contact PageNet customers by either sending a
voice-mail message or punching in a phone number for a telephone
call back heard a fast busy signal, he said. Service was affected
in Hawaii as well as Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Customers with the toll-free 800 or 888 codes were not affected.
The outage occurred at the company's Commerce center in Los Angeles
County.
</P>
<P>
   PageNet is the nation's biggest wireless paging service, with 10
million subscribers worldwide, Baradell said.

FIRST LADY FACES UPSTATE CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton makes her first serious dive
into the race for Senate Wednesday, heading straight to the heart
of enemy territory, the center of upstate New York, where
Republicans rule, her ratings are low and slipping lower _ yet
where, ultimately, the race may be decided.
</P>
<P>
   She will start her trip with a friend, Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
the retiring Democratic senator whose seat she hopes to win.
Standing outside his farmhouse in Oneonta, an hour's drive west of
Albany, Clinton will announce that she has formed an ``exploratory
committee,'' which these days is tantamount to throwing her hat
into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it's on to a four-day road trip, to Cooperstown, Utica,
Rome, Syracuse, and maybe a few small towns along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, polls show the first lady running neck-and-neck with
her most likely Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But among the voters upstate _ that is, every place but New York
City and its suburbs of Long Island and Westchester County _
Clinton trails the mayor by 13 or 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   New York politics are like a triangle, its three points
representing New York City, the suburbs, and upstate. The first
lady is way ahead in the largely Democratic city. The mayor is way
ahead in the largely Republican suburbs. And so, most politicos
agree, the fight will be fought most fiercely upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has visited New York City many times in recent months,
to great acclaim and hearty welcome. But very rarely, and then only
briefly, has she ventured to other parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   She will find this stretch of land so different from New York
City, it might as well be another state.
</P>
<P>
   When most Americans think of New York, they think of the big
city, liberals, and a melting pot of blacks, Hispanics and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate New York, on the other hand, can be typified this way:
small towns, conservatives, and white Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, because a higher percentage of upstaters actually turn
out to vote, how they vote carries greater weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstate Catholics determine the outcome of statewide elections
in New York,'' says Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant who
supports but is not working for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of her journey, the first lady's numbers upstate are
falling. At the end of May, a survey by the Quinnipiac College
Polling Institute showed her in a virtual tie with Giuliani
upstate, 44-43. However, its latest poll, taken last week, shows
Giuliani ahead in that region, 51-38.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll by Zogby International, 36 percent of upstaters have a
``very unfavorable'' view of Clinton, while 13 percent have a
``somewhat unfavorable'' view. Quinnipiac shows similar findings,
with 38 percent of upstaters having an ``unfavorable'' view of her
and 22 percent having a ``mixed'' view.
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen in the two districts she will travel through
this week, Representatives Sherwood Boehlert and James T. Walsh,
are both Republicans. Boehlert voted for two of the four articles
of impeachment against President Clinton. Walsh voted for three.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton won both of the districts in the 1996
election, just as he won every district in the state. However, both
congressmen beat their Democratic challengers by wider margins than
Clinton beat Bob Dole, his Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the numbers indicate, and analysts agree, that Mrs.
Clinton has enormous room to move upward.
</P>
<P>
   One clue lies in the results of a question asked by the
Quinnipiac Poll: ``Would you say that Hillary Rodham Clinton cares
about the needs and problems of people like you, or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, New Yorkers think she does care about them, by a
60-35 margin. Even upstate, a decisive majority, 54-40, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   However Clinton did not fare as well in another Quinnipiac
query: ``Would you say that Hillary Rodham Clinton understands the
issues and problems facing New York State, or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, by 53-39 percent, most think she does not understand
New York's problems. Upstate respondents hold this view by a
devastating 60-33.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and other Republicans have been tapping mightily into
this sentiment, taking every opportunity to slam the first lady as
a ``carpetbagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on these two poll-findings, Clinton's road to higher
ratings, especially upstate, seems clearly paved. First, talk
sympathetically about people's needs _ something she has always
done well. Second, do more of what she's about to do this week _
travel the state and thus convince people that she is getting to
know the place better.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip is being officially billed as ``Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Listening Tour,'' the idea being that she wants to spend
most of the time listening to what the people need.
</P>
<P>
   One point Clinton must find reassuring is that Giuliani does not
seem to be an insurmountable opponent on this ground.
</P>
<P>
   The majority statewide, a 64-29 margin, thinks he understands
New York issues, and upstate, respondents agree 60-25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, when people living upstate are asked their opinion of
Giuliani _ favorable, unfavorable, or mixed _ a surprising 30
percent say they ``haven't heard enough about him'' to judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't think so,'' says Maurice Carroll, director of the
Quinnipiac polling firm, ``but _ outside the city in Giuliani's
case, and outside her capacity as first lady in Hillary's _ both of
these candidates are still largely unknown.''

'60S `HAWAIIAN EYE' NOW FOCUSES ON SKIN CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ ``Cricket'' has grown up and become a
cosmetics mogul. Who would have thought it possible?
</P>
<P>
   Connie Stevens, the adorably perky blonde whose sunny
disposition and kewpie-doll looks decorated the '60s TV series
``Hawaiian Eye,'' has been selling her Forever Spring skin-care and
makeup line on Home Shopping Network for the past 10 years. With
her sweet, girl-next-door directness and conversational, ``we're
all girls in this together'' on-air personality, she's moved $500
million worth of product, earning between $80 million and $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   When Stevens was a bouncy young singer from Brooklyn, who came
West at 15 to earn her fortune with the trio of hometown boys who
became The Lettermen (when she abandoned them to make movies), she
was the perfect type for teen and beach party films (remember
``Palm Springs Weekend'').
</P>
<P>
   Her first film was ``Young and Dangerous'' with Mark Damon, then
``Rock-a-Bye, Baby'' got her noticed by Jerry Lewis and signed to
Warners for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of her upward trajectory, she became the third Mrs.
Eddie Fisher (post Liz). Her daughters with Fisher are Joely, whose
own acting career is smokin' now (she stars with Matthew Broderick
in ``Inspector Gadget'') and Tricia Leigh (who has been seen around
Los Angeles in satirical revues where she just completed a run as
Monica Lewinsky in ``Star Struck'').
</P>
<P>
   When she was first starting out, Stevens had the makings of a
teen-queen idol: Her distinctive voice was like treacle over
sandpaper and the word ``cute'' was invented just to describe her.
She wore spikey lashes and her lush mouth was always polished to
glossy perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a beauty mogul whose age hovers somewhere in her
mid-to-late 50s, Stevens has refused to fall prey to the Beverly
Hills surgery shuffle: a little nip, a tiny tuck, a laser peel or a
lipo suck. And heaven knows how tough that Hawaiian sun can be on
your skin (``and I spent four years in it. Who knew back then?''
she moans).
</P>
<P>
   I met Stevens at her Robertson Boulevard spa/restaurant _ called
Connie Stevens' Garden Sanctuary _ a friendly, club-like mixture of
sensual general store, where she sells her own products and an
iconoclastic mix of whatever else has struck her fancy (fake fur
and velvet lap blankets; flavored lip balms; patio and beach wear;
decorative candles); a serviceable cafe with a spa menu and a small
but luxurious spa with marble treatment rooms.
</P>
<P>
   There is a massive faux tree in the center of the room and an
equally massive, 80-inch television screen hanging on the wall,
overlooking the restaurant tables, designed for her Monday ``guy
nights.'' (When she first opened Sanctuary, she invited all of her
male pals to celebrate the memory of Jim Murray, the acerbic Los
Angeles Times sports columnist who had recently passed away. ``She
has a lot of guy friends,'' one of her publicists said.)
</P>
<P>
   She greets me with a pinkly glowing face. Wearing geranium pink
tights, sweat socks, aerobic shoes and an over-sized loden green
jacket, Stevens daubs at her smeared mascara with a tissue, trying
to catch her breath. ``I'm just out of a yoga class,'' she says by
way of explanation. Her hair is a cloud of blonded dips and swoops,
a variation on the cut she's had for years. She is not rail-thin
like some of her contemporaries, and she is eminently comfortable
with herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she says in answer to a blunt question. ``I haven't had
any work done. So you stay a little plumper than you were at 20.
... I've come to a time in my life that I'm not threatened by my
life, my body or my time.''
</P>
<P>
   While Stevens says she started her cosmetics line as a way to
help put two daughters through college, she occasionally plays
Vegas and other venues and keeps her hand in as an entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   And her Forever Spring line is geared to women like her. Not
teen-agers or supermodels, but real women who have lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my women on TV, because I'm one of them _ raising two
children, living through the empty nest syndrome, juggling work and
personal life _ don't pay attention to the 14-year-olds on the
magazine covers. Don't buy into that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach to beauty is: You've got to claim your own power.
Yes, it could be by using my products, or going to yoga classes or
just reclaiming your dreams.'' (She also jokes that another of her
beauty secrets is ``younger men,'' but adds quickly, ``so is a
network of really supportive friends.'')
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the base of Stevens' extensive line _ nearly 100 products _
is what she calls The Time Machine, a hand-held facial toner used
in conjunction with several of her products. The Beauty System that
she sells on Home Shopping Network includes the machine, plus a
cleanser that also exfoliates and a moisturizer-quencher with
natural collagen, fluffy in texture, which softens the skin.
</P>
<P>
   The price is $125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of that basic system,'' she notes, ``came all my other
products.'' Such as a ginseng facial costing $29, which, says
Stevens, sold 1.2 million jars in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Stevens has taught herself about the science
of beauty products and certainly about marketing. ``I have kept my
distribution small,'' she says. ``If you ship to another country,
for instance, you have to increase the preservatives you put in
your product. My (products') shelf-life is two years. CNN did a
profile on the company and they said we come in No. 1 in the
cosmetic industry for the amount of real ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   Skin care, makeup and a fragrance called Kali, developed for
Stevens by International Fragrance and Flavors, have helped to
finance Stevens' homes in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Las Vegas, Beverly
Hills and an apartment in New York _ ``I really don't live anywhere
any more,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She has her own Web site and throws words like ``e-commerce''
and ``demographic'' around like a seasoned retailing pro. But she
has never lost what made her a star in the first place. Her ability
to communicate with a fan base that by now, is as old as she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I realize from being on Home Shopping is that so many of
the women who buy product from me never thought they deserved to
take care of themselves, never thought they should enjoy it or that
they were even supposed to. But I am honest with them. I tell them:
`Don't try this unless you really want to.'''

WELL, WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE AN UNFREE PRESS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's talk about the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard about it. It's the first item in the Bill of
Rights, which is the term we use to describe the first 10
amendments to the Constitution of the United States. These
amendments guarantee various fundamental rights and freedoms: the
right to bear arms, the right to a fair trial, freedom from
unreasonable search and seizure, freedom against
self-incrimination. ...
</P>
<P>
   The founders of this country went out of their way to make sure
there would be no confusion about the importance of such
constitutional rights in the new American republic.
</P>
<P>
   Most constitutional scholars agree that the numerical order of
the first 10 amendments was not intended to prioritize them or rank
their significance in any way. But there is no denying that the
First Amendment set the tone for the Bill of Rights and helped set
the direction that the new nation would take.
</P>
<P>
   The freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment are crucial to
the success of any democracy. To violate or abridge these rights is
to undermine the essence of a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who have never committed the First Amendment to
memory, here's what it says:
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress
of grievances.''
</P>
<P>
   It's short and to the point. Freedom of religion. Free speech.
Freedom of the press. The right to protest.
</P>
<P>
   Those guys had a way with words.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to ramble. But as the American people look toward a
new century, there is reason to fear for the future of those
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment, especially, is under attack as never
before. The results of a new poll reported in USA Today suggest
that freedom of the press, in particular, has fallen into disfavor
with the public. The poll was commissioned by the Freedom Forum, a
pro-First Amendment foundation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper, 53 percent of those who responded to
the poll said that the press in America has too much freedom _ an
increase of 15 percent from a similar poll conducted two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Mauro of USA Today reported that the poll indicated
``nearly two-thirds of the public thinks the press should not be
allowed to probe the private lives of public officials. And
shrinking numbers of respondents think the news media should be
allowed to endorse political candidates, report government secrets
or use hidden cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro quoted a media lawyer/author named Bruce Sanford: ``The
public is so angry at the media these days that we are beginning to
blind ourselves to the biggest threat, which is not the media but
government regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, is that the truth.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that the public gets disgusted with what
seems to be the media's overemphasis on scandal, on violence, on
``negative'' news of every description. Even the media folks who
serve up this stuff on a daily basis get disgusted with it.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, people are watching and reading all this news
that they claim to hate. If they weren't, the media wouldn't be
quite so eager to report it.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you happen to be one of those rare consumers who
only reads the good news, who scrupulously avoids the bad and the
ugly, you surely wouldn't want the government to decide what news
can be printed and broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Would you?
</P>
<P>
   The free press makes mistakes, just as any institution does, but
the alternative is an unfree press. The sort of press, for example,
that operates under the thumb of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. The sort of press that covers up Milosevic's crimes
against humanity and refuses to tell the people of Yugoslavia why
most of Western civilization has turned against their leaders and
waged war against their country.
</P>
<P>
   We can't have it both ways. There is no such thing as a partly
free press.
</P>
<P>
   We can accept the First Amendment and put up with occasional
abuses of the freedom it guarantees. Or we can surrender this right
that the founders considered so important that they placed it first
on their list of most important rights.
</P>
<P>
   It's a clear-cut choice. There is nothing in between.
</P>

COIN TOSS DETERMINED WHO DIED WITH HOLLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Who was the person who was supposed to be on the plane that
killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.H., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: When Buddy Holly chartered a plane on Feb. 3, 1959, he was
planning to travel with band members Waylon Jennings and Tommy
Allsup. During a grueling Midwest tour called the ``Winter Dance
Party of 1959,'' Holly wanted to avoid the drive from Mason City,
Iowa, to Fargo, N.D., on a bus without a working heater.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the plane took off at 1 a.m., Jennings gave up
his seat to Richardson, and Allsup lost a coin toss _ and the final
seat _ to Valens. The four-seat Beechcraft Bonanza crashed shortly
after takeoff, killing all three passengers and Roger Peterson, an
inexperienced 21-year-old pilot who was blamed for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Valens was afraid of small planes after two collided above his
junior high school and killed two students. ``I guess he was really
miserable on that bus,'' his aunt Ernestine Reyes told Reuters news
service.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings gave up his seat because Richardson was running a
fever. Holly, disappointed that his Crickets bandmate wasn't
coming, joked that ``I hope your bus freezes,'' Jennings told VH1's
``Behind the Music.'' He replied, ```I hope your plane crashes' ...
it took me a long time to get over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In February, Time had an article about farm prints created by
Buddy Ebsen. Where can I order these?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.A.S., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Six lithographs of Ebsen's ``Uncle Jed Country'' oil
paintings are being sold by Phantom Bookshop of Ventura, Calif.
Color prints sell for $100 and framed lithographs on canvas sell
for $595.
</P>
<P>
   To order, call (805) 641-3844 or visit the actor's official
World Wide Web site at www.buddyebsen.com.
</P>
<P>
   Ebsen, 91, also is selling an autobiography through the
bookstore. Signed copies of ``The Other Side of Oz'' sell for $35
plus $5 shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can write to Ebsen in care of Phantom Bookshop, 451 E. Main
St., Ventura, CA 93001.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to the singer Cher?
</P>
<P>
   _ W.J.B., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Cher in care of the William Morris Agency, 151 El
Camino Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Cher, 53, is currently on a 40-city concert tour of the United
States. Her single ``Believe'' has been a No. 1 hit in the United
States and 22 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   She's also appearing in the film ``Tea With Mussolini.'' For
additional information, visit her official World Wide Web site at

SNAPPY STORY DESERVES A `HIGH FIVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a reason why Janet Evanovich's latest mystery featuring
Trenton, N.J., bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has hit the Top 10 list
in fiction. The witty dialogue and crazy plot twists make you laugh
almost non-stop as you speed through ``High Five'' (Martin's Press,
$23.95. 292 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Times are tough for Stephanie. Uncle Fred has disappeared after
an argument with his garbage collectors. The only clue is a set of
pictures of a dismembered body in a garbage bag.
</P>
<P>
   The only bail jumper Stephanie can go after is a
height-disadvantaged computer programmer who carries a knife. If
she nabs him, she will only net about $70. Without enough income to
pay the rent, Stephanie decides to work for Ranger, a super bounty
hunter who always has expensive cars and plenty of money.
</P>
<P>
   Stalked by a homicidal, Bible-quoting maniac, Stephanie is also
being followed by a tough-looking bookie. Adding to her problems is
her strong attraction to her former lover, vice cop Joe Morelli,
who invites her to a Mob wedding. Now she has to find a dress.
</P>
<P>
   Evanovich is the master of snappy dialogue. Her offbeat
characters seem perfectly at home in Trenton. Her plot never lags,
just escalates as the hilarious shenanigans pull you along at
break-neck speed.

Mary Higgins Clark Mystery Magazine (Family Circle, 100 pages.
$5.95.).
</P>
<P>
   The sixth installment includes short stories by Elmore Leonard,
Edna Buchanan, Faye Kellerman, Julie Smith and, of course, Clark.
Kate Stine looks at historical mysteries, while booksellers from
around the country pick their favorite whodunits.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Hunted'' (Signet. $5.99, paperback. 312 pages.), Jerry
Kennealy once again serves up a first-rate crime thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Political terrorist Philip Bovard is buying up nuclear reactors
from the Russians and his money man is Patrick Lyman, a
well-respected San Francisco banker who has a taste for young
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-year-old Janna Drovana, a recent arrival to San
Francisco from Russia, has just lost her mother. Her uncle sells
her to Angela, a local madam whose clients include Lyman. Told she
has a virgin for him, Lyman goes to her house, is bitten by Janna,
and leaves behind his laptop computer, the one holding all the
information on the nuclear sale.
</P>
<P>
   When Angela tells Lyman she doesn't have the laptop, Bovard
hires an Irish assassin to kill Angela and her girls and retrieve
it. But Janna escapes the carnage with the laptop and thousands of
dollars from Angela's secret stash.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide detective Maureen Connah gets the case _ the case of
the whorehouse murders. Eventually, she will figure out that a
child lived through the carnage and is wanted by some very powerful
people.
</P>
<P>
   Connah's partner, Jack Kordic, has gone to London to receive an
award and nearly dies in a bombing that kills a high-ranking
Israeli intelligence officer. The British believe the bombing was
the work of the Irish Republican Army, but Mossad agent Anatoly
Weeks thinks not and heads for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Janna calls the police, but doesn't give her name or
location. Instead, she roams Golden Gate Park, eluding both the
police and her hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Kennealy uses San Francisco as one of his characters and gets it
right. But then he should _ he's a former policeman and private
investigator. The international intrigue works surprisingly well.
</P>
<P>
   And the characters are believable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fencing Master'' (translated by Margaret Full Costa.
Harcourt Brace &AMP; Co. $24. 256 pages), Arturo Perez-Reverte's fourth
intellectual thriller to be published in the United States, was his
debut novel in Spain. Not as complex as ``The Flanders Panel,''
``The Club Dumas'' and ``The Seville Communion,'' ``The Fencing
Master'' nevertheless is a richly woven tale of intrigue in Madrid
of 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Don Jaime is a middle-aged fencing master, a man of honor who
teaches Madrid's young elite the dying art of the sword. One day he
is approached by a beautiful young woman who wants Don Jaime to
teach her the ``unstoppable thrust.'' Don Jaime refuses, but
eventually Dona Adela de Otero proves that she is a skilled fencer
and Don Jaime becomes her teacher. Little does he know that she
will draw him into a world of political plots and cause the deaths
of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Perez-Reverte is an elegant writer whose attention to detail
makes his stories vastly different from other writers in the genre.
The reader will parry and lunge along with Don Jaime, feel a real
part of the duel. Perez-Reverte fans will relish finally getting a
look at where this truly gifted story teller began his career.

CLINTON SHOWS US THE OTHER AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Presidents are simply not known for doing what
President Clinton is setting out to do this week _ doggedly call
attention to the shortcomings in his signature accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   How else to describe a carefully-planned journey through some of
the poorest chunks of real estate in the country that have been
left out of the decade's astonishing economic resurgence?
</P>
<P>
   The president, however, is not simply raising consciousness by
dragging a group of corporate leaders and the press from the
Kentucky Highlands in Appalachia to a Native American reservation
within the poorest county in the country in the High Plains, from
the Mississippi Delta to the sprawling ghetto of Watts in Los
Angeles, from the under-capitalized Hispanic community of South
Phoenix to peristently poor East St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   He is also trying to dramatize a few important points about the
economic future: that the biggest difference between making and not
making a decent living is the level of one's education; that
poverty in rural and urban America is a function of isolation from
the economic mainstream; and that after having made a huge
difference in eliminating some of the worst manifestations of
poverty over the last generation (hunger, absence of sanitation,
presence of industrial poisons, destitution among the elderly), the
next challenge for government is to stimulate and leverage private
investment in struggling communities.
</P>
<P>
   More of it is happening than most people realize; and a lot more
can and should happen as the decade's economic expansion begins at
last to reach down the income scale. In time, the smart business
guys are going to figure out an obvious truth that an extra-smart
few are already grasping _ one of the next great opportunities for
growth in the mature US economy can come from the rising incomes
and even assets of people who are poor in places that have remained
far behind the rest of the country _ hence the administration's
moniker for a collection of worthwhile initiatives, New Markets.
According to White House officials, there is nearly a $100 billion
consumer market out there, grossly underdeveloped but very
inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example will be on display when Clinton's entourage
reaches the Pine Ridge Oglala Sioux Reservation in western South
Dakota, most of which is within the poorest county in the United
States, Shannon. Almost half the 12,000 residents are officially
poor (well over three times the national average), the jobless rate
of 12 percent is four times the national number, and social
conditions would break the hardest heart.
</P>
<P>
   It's also next to impossible to get a home mortgage on the
reservation, where the land is not owned privately. But Fannie Mae,
the secondary mortgage market behemoth, is about to help change
that with a program to underwrite mortgages only on dwellings. And
the company is already becoming famous for pioneering in the
development of mortgages that require little or no down payment,
and everybody knows how the economic ripple effects of housing
development work.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Kentucky, Illinois, Mississippi, and Arizona,
Clinton will highlight how local development companies have been
able to leverage public money to attract private investment _ to
expand businesses, start new ones, or help attract jobs-producing
investment from outside. And in Watts _ a classically isolated
urban community that has no useful public transportation and has
been abadoned by scores of employers _ efforts by companies to come
right into the high schools for training programs that lead to jobs
will be highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip is connected to a specific agenda that flows
easily from six years of multibillion-dollar results in getting 125
empowerment zones up and running, creating a vigorous
welfare-to-work operation, expanding new community development
financial institutions, and cleaning up toxic sites for productive
development.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton wants to leverage another $15 billion in investment
by proposing a new income tax credit for up to 25 percent of the
money put into these business-developing institutions. And he also
wants to authorize domestic investment companies to promote
projects in inner city and rural areas the same way the Overseas
Private Investment Corp. operates in emerging markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   This is no mere photo opportunity, and to the extent it is it
draws attention to what has not been accomplished this decade. But
with another presidential election looming, Clinton's mission
demonstrates that bringing prosperity to the places that have been
bypassed requires more than compassion; it demands new thinking and
hard work.

BEFORE MAKING CHANGE, DETERMINE LONG-TERM NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; moved 7/2 in advance for 7/4)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a state employee and have the opportunity to invest in a
deferred compensation plan. I contribute the maximum allowed, $150
a week, which is divided between Fidelity Growth and Income and
Fidelity Growth Company funds. My choices were random picks with no
rationale. I often wonder if I should have two funds with similar
names, or whether I should have chosen something else.
</P>
<P>
   The other options were an income fund, a short-term investment
fund, George Putnam Fund of Boston, Calvert Social Investment,
Vanguard Wellington, AIM Charter, Vanguard Institutional Index, AIM
Weingarten, AIM Constellation, and Templeton International funds,
or a life insurance investment.
</P>
<P>
   I have never had advice or talked with anybody about these
options. I am 53 and my home will be paid off in eight years. I
would like to retire by age 65.
</P>
<P>
   B.R., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your suspicion that your two holdings are too similar is well
founded.
</P>
<P>
   While Fidelity Growth and Income maintains a balanced portfolio
dominated by large-cap domestic stocks and Fidelity Growth
Company's portfolio is dominated by large domestic growth-oriented
stocks, there's not enough difference between the two to provide
you with very meaningful diversification.
</P>
<P>
   But before you begin making changes, we'll have to determine
when you're likely to call on this money. Let's consider two
possible intentions. One is that you'll let this money grow until
you retire and then put it to work to supply an income stream to
augment your retirement income. The second is that you'll be able
to get along on your retirement income in the early years of
retirement, and view this building fund as your buffer against
inflation when you're in your 70s and later.
</P>
<P>
   If it's the first case, your period of investment for growth in
principal will be shorter, and therefore you should be a little
more cautious. So I'd begin now by taking a tiny step toward the
kind of portfolio you'll eventually want, which is to have a
portfolio dominated by fixed-income issues 12 years from now. But
since 12 years is still a pretty long time, I'd start with a baby
step, putting perhaps a third of your ongoing contributions into
Vanguard Wellington, a fund that divides its portfolio between
stocks and bonds, with about a third of its assets on the
fixed-income side.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you don't expect to use this money to
produce income at the time of retirement and anticipate waiting
some years after retirement to draw upon it, I'd swap some of the
Growth Company shares for positions in AIM Constellation, a mid-cap
growth fund, and in Templeton International, so as to give you
better balance.
</P>
<P>
   I'd look for an overall portfolio that consisted of 50 percent
in Fidelity Growth and Income, with the balance evenly divided
among Fidelity Growth Company, AIM Constellation, and Templeton
International.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 38 and contribute $6,000 a year to a 401(k) plan with no
company match. Currently I have $15,000 in the plan, with the money
invested in Fidelity's Growth and Income, Contrafund, Magellan, and
Overseas funds. In addition I have a Roth IRA of $6,000 with
Vanguard, invested in the Index 500, Health Care, and Horizon
Aggressive Growth funds.
</P>
<P>
   I will continue the 401(k) contributions and add $2,000 a year
to the Roth IRA until I retire at age 60. Are my choices diverse
enough? What changes would you make? How much will I have saved
when I retire?
</P>
<P>
   J.A., Leominster, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. To start with the last question, if we assume the ongoing
contributions and 10 percent average annual growth, the grand total
would be $768,219. But I think you'd have a better chance of
getting there if you improved your portfolio diversification.
</P>
<P>
   You don't spell out the amounts in each fund, but four of the
seven funds hold similar portfolios _ Fidelity Growth and Income,
Contrafund, Magellan and Vanguard Index 500 all hold portfolios
that represent a blend of growth and value large-cap stocks. Since
three of these are in the 401(k) account where three quarters of
the contributions are going, it seems that what is already an
overreliance on this market sector will soon become a serious
overweighting.
</P>
<P>
   I would swap Fidelity Magellan for Fidelity OTC fund, and
Vanguard Index 500 for Vanguard Small-Cap Index.
</P>
<P>
   As for your fund selections, all seem solid with one exception _
Vanguard Aggressive Growth (as the Horizon fund was renamed late
last year). This fund seems to to have not lived up to its promise;
perhaps aggressive investing just doesn't match Vanguard's style.
Morningstar Mutual Funds now classifies its portfolio as mid-cap
value, which seems an unlikely focus for aggressive growth.
Although it has returned nearly 10 percent so far this year, I'd
look back to the scant 0.55 percent total return of 1998, its
two-star rating from Morningstar, and make a switch.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's Mid-Cap Index seems a better bet. If you make the
changes I suggest, the effect is that all the holdings in the Roth
IRA will serve as minor themes to the overall portfolio, with
large-cap dominance continuing in the IRA, plus the minor themes in
mid-cap stocks (the OTC fund) and international stocks through
Fidelity Overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In suggesting these changes, I'm presuming that the holdings in
the various accounts are more or less equal. If not, I'd move
things around so the diversification works out like this: 50
percent in the large-cap funds, which are now so dominant, 20
percent in mid-cap funds, and 10 percent each in small-cap,
international, and health care.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have noticed that you frequently advise people to put money
in Fidelity Select Health Care fund. I am considering putting some
money in this fund, but have three main concerns.
</P>
<P>
   First, the fund's managers are quite young and seem to have no
previous experience in the health care industry _ both were
previously in charge of totally unrelated funds. Second, the fund
seems to be heavily invested in pharmaceutical companies. Even
though they can be very profitable, wouldn't a fund invested in a
broader cross-section of the health care industry be better?
Lastly, there has been much talk about greater government
regulation of health care. Were the government to impose any price
controls, the profitability of the industry would be greatly
affected. I realize that such regulations may never come, but the
possibility cannot be ignored. What are your thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   R.M., Natick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Taking your points in order, I'll begin with the fund manager
issue. What you're seeing in the managers' career histories is
simply a reflection of the way Fidelity is organized. The fund
family makes it a practice to move managers through diverse
investment disciplines, changing their jobs frequently and giving
them experience in a lot of different kinds of markets. Do I think
it's ideal? No _ before it closed, my choice among the health care
funds was Vanguard Specialized Health Care, where the manager has
been at the job for more than 15 years. But on the other hand,
Fidelity's track record with its musical chairs approach to fund
management has been very good, and so has the record of this fund,
despite the relatively frequent change of fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, when I look at a health care fund, what I don't want is
a portfolio touching all the industry bases. Funds that devote
significant parts of their portfolio to health care delivery
companies _ hospitals, HMOs and the like _ and to biotechnology
issues offer more risk than I am willing to assume. Fidelity Select
Health Care, like Vanguard Health Care and a few others, gives
short shrift to these industries, and to me that is a plus. Besides
for pharmaceuticals, the Fidelity funds also focuses on companies
making health care equipment, which is another end of the industry
where growth prospects appear to be very good.
</P>
<P>
   The government regulation issue is, of course, troubling. And
anybody who has been following pharmaceutical stocks for the past
couple of months knows these issues are under a lot of pressure as
politicians debate the cost of prescription drugs. I guess my
summary would be this _ the government has tried before to control
the health care industry, with very small concrete results. My
guess is that the latest efforts will end up much as previous ones
did. But, reflecting this final and considerable element of risk,
please note that when I recommend health care funds, I suggest that
they represent only a small percentage of a long-term portfolio.

MORMONS URGE SUPPORT FOR ANTI-GAY MARRIAGE MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Mormon Church has quietly instructed its
California followers to offer financial and political support for a
ballot initiative that would ban gay marriages, a move that mirrors
the church's $1.1 million effort in Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Dear Brethren and Sisters'' letter sent several weeks ago
asks 740,000 California Mormons ``to do all you can by donating
your means and time to assure a successful vote'' on the March 2000
ballot measure, which is expected to be one of the most divisive of
the next election season.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was authorized by the highest reaches of the Mormon
Church and should be considered as ``inspired and coming from the
Lord,'' church spokesman Dan Rascon said from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   California family law already defines marriage as between ``a
man and a woman.'' But the ballot initiative takes the law further
by deeming heterosexual marriages as ``valid and recognized.'' The
supporters of the initiative fear the courts may soon validate gay
marriages, and they believe the ballot initiative would
short-circuit any such ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The church's letter is a portent of what could be a religious,
political and financial battle in California over marriage between
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   While the church says its support of the measure is based on
moral grounds, the existence of the letter also raises questions
about how far a church can go to support political causes and still
keep its tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was written by three church presidents who govern
California and who report to Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints President Gordon B. Hinkley, who is considered a prophet.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders were instructed to read the letter in services
May 23 or May 30 throughout California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, a statement from the first presidency we believe is
inspired and comes from the Lord,'' Rascon said. ``But it's up to
the members as to how to proceed. This is the direction that is
coming from the church, but they still have the option. Nobody is
going to be disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   For some gay Mormons and former Mormons, however, a letter from
high-level church leaders is akin to marshaling armies in support
of the initiative. Some found it significant that the letter
instructed ``a member of the stake presidency or high council'' to
read the letter instead of other lower-level church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is an attitude of the hierarchy as really being
able to direct your lives and telling you how to live,'' said Kathy
Worthington, a gay activist and former churchgoing Mormon who lives
in Salt Lake City. ``They'll see this as a serious request from the
man representing God.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights groups opposing the initiative believe the letter is
the first sign that the church will have considerable influence in
California, whether through members here or large contributions to
the campaign from the headquarters in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The church donated $500,000 to a successful ballot initiative
last year banning gay marriages in Alaska, and $600,000 to another
winning effort in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the California initiative have until the end of
July to report contributions. They declined to say if the Mormon
Church had yet contributed any money, although they welcomed the
support of the church in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with their part of the coalition,'' said
Defense of Marriage Act campaign manager Rob Stutzman. The
initiative is sponsored by state Sen. Pete Knight, a Republican
from Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   Stutzman said the campaign hopes to enlist other religious
groups, including Muslims and conservative Catholics and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But he said support for the initiative goes beyond religious
organizations. A recent San Francisco Examiner poll of 810
registered voters, for example, found 54 percent of those surveyed
supported the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling California campaign to oppose the ballot measure
hopes to raise at least $5 million and mobilize the state's gay and
lesbian voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foes also are counting on help from gay-friendly churches,''
said Mike Marshall, campaign manager for the opposition group,
Californians for Fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously in light of how much money the Mormon Church spent
in Alaska and Hawaii, we are very concerned,'' he said.

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-LUNCH (Undated) _ Once it was the three-martini lunch.
Now it's the no-martini lunch. It's just not the occasion for that
kind of boozing anymore. It's not a lot of other things, either.
It's not leisurely. It's not expensive. It's not heavy: No dessert
most of the time. As the business lunch has come under the
increasing pressures of time, budgets and health concerns, many
restaurants realized they had a choice: adapt with a lunch that
works for the times or deal with a lot of empty tables. They're
adapting, cleverly and often agressively. By Marian Burros. With
photos.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-CUISINE (Undated) _ There is a place, at the very
geographic center of Europe, that is home to one of the most
refined food and wine cultures anywhere. It is Friuli-Venezia
Giulia, the region on the far northeast fringe of Italy, where
Europe's three principal cultures _ Latin, Slavic, Germanic _
converge. By Fred Plotkin.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED-CHICKEN (Undated) _ The best chicken I ever tasted
wasn't the poulet de Bresse stuffed with truffles that I had in
France. It wasn't the chicken wrapped in lotus leaves and baked in
a mound of clay in Hong Kong. It wasn't even my Aunt Annette's
plump, golden gedempfted capon (although it comes close). No, the
best chicken I ever tasted came off a barbecue pit in Memphis,
where it had been smoked upright in a singularly undignified
position _ straddling an open can of beer. By Sgteven Raichlen.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPAGNE-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Amanda Hesser reviews
``Champagne Cocktails.''

the height of the season. By Florence Fabricant.

   MASTER-CHEF (Undated) _ The column: Pan-roasted duck breast with
sweet white corn. By Thomas Keller and Michael Ruhlmna.

Dilberito, a concoction being marketed as a vitamin pill in a
tortilla. By Marian Burros.

regions _ the Medoc, the Graves, St.-Emilion _ for good Bordeaux at
affordable prices. By Frank J. Prial.

   WINE-TASTINGS (Undated) _ A capsule wine review: Chateau

WHEN SPORTS COVERAGE GOES TOO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For women sportswriters, the ones who know the
rules of their business, the big story out of Wimbledon last week
was a disaster. Basketball Hall of Famer Julius Erving confirmed
that he had engaged in an extramarital affair with Samantha
Stevenson, a sportswriter who had covered his team, and that their
liaison had produced a child, rising tennis star Alexandra
Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   A tabloid TV show promptly ran a story on female sports
journalists and their relationships with their sources. One woman,
a television reporter, said that athletes and journalists are
co-workers and that co-workers often date each other. Imagine Dan
Rather hitting on Tipper Gore, and you'll have a rough idea of how
wrong that woman was.
</P>
<P>
   Is Samantha Stevenson's private life any of our business? Let me
repeat the PG-13 version of a legendary quote from a newspaper
editor: ``I don't care if my reporters sleep with elephants, but
they'd better not be covering the circus.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't know exactly how Stevenson went about her affair with
Dr. J, aside from his statement that he ended up paying child
support. We know that Erving was married, but journalists have no
right to ask how much Stevenson intruded on the marriage, or how
badly he betrayed his wife. More than anything, I'd like the
answers to these questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Did she write anything about him or his team after they had
begun a personal relationship?
</P>
<P>
   _ Has she been careful since not to cover anything that would
involve him, even remotely, in the 19 years since their daughter
was conceived, since they forged an intimate and financial bond?
</P>
<P>
   I tried to call Stevenson for answers and couldn't reach her.
All I know now is how this looks, and it's very ugly. The
appearance of impropriety hangs all over this story, in neon. Maybe
Stevenson has an explanation. If so, I hope it's better than the
one offered by that television reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Do reporters sometimes date their sources? Yes. Some do it
unscrupulously. Some remove themselves from a story or a beat as
soon as they recognize an irresistible attraction. This happens to
all reporters, male, female, straight, gay, television and print.
</P>
<P>
   But women sportswriters face the most suspicion. It's not fair,
but it's life. We go into locker rooms, among naked men _ famous,
rich, naked men. It's only natural for people to suspect that we
have motives other than good storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   When I covered the Philadelphia Eagles, several of the men on
the beat asked me which players I found most attractive. I found
the question laughable. My stock answer was: ``I'm always madly in
love with the last guy who gave me a great quote. Then I move on.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just as unethical for reporters to date the trainers,
equipment managers or the public-relations staff of teams they're
covering. The same rules apply. But if Alexandra Stevenson were the
daughter of a former NBA trainer, would I be as worried about the
fallout for the women in my business? Of course not. Dr. J's fame
is part of this story. Fairly or not, it raises the issue of
whether women sportswriters use press credentials to indulge in
groupie behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewing people, whether they're athletes or elected
officials, requires establishing a rapport without straying into
intimacy. Over the years, a couple of sources have asked me: ``Can
I tell you something just as a friend?'' I replied, in effect: ``I
like you and respect you, but as long as I'm in this job, we can't
be friends. If you did something wrong in your job, a friend would
never put it in the newspaper. I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times in my career, I've been asked on dates by people
I've interviewed. One was a professional athlete, and I said that
I'd have to give up my job, so thanks, but no. The other two were
not athletes. They were far out on the periphery of what I usually
covered. I asked my editors what they thought. In both cases, they
said it would be all right to go on the date.
</P>
<P>
   With one man, it was clear that I'd never need or want to write
about him again. He published a newsletter about a local sports
team. We went out.
</P>
<P>
   It thought about the other one for a while and decided that I
was uncomfortable giving up covering even the small part of the
sports world he inhabited. We didn't go out.
</P>
<P>
   Should I have to reveal this? I wish not. But the Stevenson
story makes me feel like disclosure is necessary. I never thought
it would be. One look at me on the job _ no makeup, bad clothes,
aging gracelessly, deadline by stressful deadline _ should tell
anyone that I'm not there to flirt.
</P>
<P>
   But I've also learned that some people aren't that picky.
Several years ago, I covered a double-header in Philadelphia that
lasted until 4:40 a.m. I went down into the bowels of Veterans
Stadium during one of the night's epic rain delays. I wanted to
interview the grounds crew. A San Diego Padre, relatively anonymous
and probably long gone from the game by now, was playing catch with
a coach in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you married?'' he asked as I walked by.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a boyfriend?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I have your phone number?''
</P>
<P>
   I shook my head, laughing to myself, and told him: ``There'll be
something younger and better-looking waiting for you back at the
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   And even at 4:40 a.m., I'm sure that was true.

<P>
   ``Fame'' may live forever.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be fine with David De Silva, a.k.a. Father Fame.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the phone interview is over, it's not clear whether
the sobriquet is a paternal reference or a religious one. Because
when it comes to ``Fame: The Musical,'' De Silva's unbridled
enthusiasm takes on messianic qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's played in 16 countries and had more than 4,000
performances,'' says De Silva from his Manhattan apartment. It will
add another city to its hit list when ``Fame: The Musical'' is at
the Colonial Theatre in Boston for a two-week run. ``It's amazing .
. . and wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Fame: The Musical'' is directed and choreographed by
Lars Bethke with lyrics by Jacques Levy, music by Steve Margoshes,
and a book by Jose Fernandez, it's De Silva who's been with it
since the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   De Silva conceived the idea for a musical based on a high school
specializing in the performing arts in the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked the idea of magnet schools,'' he says.
``Schools that take kids out of their own neighborhoods are good
for expanding their perspectives. I also think that it gets
students together with similar interests, and through friendship
they achieve more. I thought it would be a good idea for a show.''
</P>
<P>
   It was.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most amazing aspects to the story is that it took so
long for ``Fame'' to make it to the stage. Traditionally, a musical
opens on Broadway. If it's successful, it's sold as a movie. If
that's successful, it might become a TV special.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Fame'' began as a 1980 Alan Parker movie, transmogrified
into an NBC series that ran from Jan. 7, 1982, until Aug. 4, 1983,
on the network and until 1987 in syndication. It wasn't until 1989
that the stage version emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted it onstage, and we were headed for Broadway,''
says De Silva, 60, whose enthusiastic voice makes him sound like
one of the bright, optimistic kids in his show. ``But it didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   De Silva sold the film rights to his idea about a bunch of
all-singing, all-dancing, all-races, all-classes students at New
York's performing arts high school to MGM in the late '70s. In
1980, Parker's musical (or, more accurately, film with music) hit
it big in the nation's movie theaters. The idea of fresh-faced,
talented teenagers all grasping for the elusive brass ring of fame
hit at just the right time. They wanted to live forever. They
wanted us to remember their names. It was multicultural,
multiracial, and multidimensional.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, choreographer-actress Debbie Allen led a gaggle of
newcomers into the TV version. During a visit to the set on a sound
stage at the Burbank Studios, it was clear that the teenagers who
were playing characters on the verge of stardom saw themselves as
on the verge of stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really play ourselves, but we play characters who
have the same goals,'' said Lori Singer, one of the stars, at the
time. And they still do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a theme that everyone understands,'' says De Silva. ``No
matter what you're interested in, it applies that you want to
achieve something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Although De Silva was listed as a consulting producer on the TV
show, he didn't have much to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have control over the screenplay and movie or the TV
show,'' says De Silva. ``But I did one smart thing. I retained the
stage rights. I always knew we would find a home for it in the
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would take a lot longer than De Silva thought.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, following a successful tryout in Miami and a smash run
at Philadelphia's Walnut Street Theatre, it looked as if ``Fame''
was destined to play just downtown from the Fiorello LaGuardia High
School of Music and Art and Performing Arts where the musical is
set _ on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   But there were problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost ready,'' says De Silva, without going into
detail. ``But none of the people involved could agree on how to put
on those final touches. And the timing was off. I realize now that
not going to Broadway was a blessing in disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because with the way everything has turned out, I couldn't be
happier,'' says the former history teacher turned theatrical agent
turned producer.
</P>
<P>
   De Silva, borrowing a page from his never-say-die musical,
refused to surrender. In 1990, the script for ``Fame: The Musical''
was published in Music Theater International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some producers read it in Stockholm,'' he says. ``And they
decided to put it on. It ran for two years _ in Swedish. It opened
in Britain, later. In the West End of London. It was so successful
in the United Kingdom that it generated more than 60 productions in
Great Britain _ in schools, community companies, and little
theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   De Silva is rolling. Enough about not making it to Broadway.
Let's accentuate the positive. ``Fame'' has apparently made it
everywhere else. He's just returned from Denmark, where a
production just opened. He went to Buenos Aires for a Spanish
production, and he's headed to Sydney next month for the Australian
version.
</P>
<P>
   And he's getting a little tired of talking about the business
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really like about the show is that it celebrates the
American musical. It gets young people involved in participating
and going to the theater. `Grease' can have the '50s and `Rent' the
'90s, we've got the '80s,'' says De Silva, in a tone suggesting the
decades concept didn't just occur to him. ``It brings together kids
of all races and classes. Black, white, Asian, rich, poor. And it's
organic. Everything that arises in the story comes from the
characters and their situation. We didn't cast stars. We cast
really talented performers who, like the characters they play, need
a shot at show business. But it's not meant to persuade students to
go into the musical theater. It's about getting young people to
appreciate the arts. To capture the kind of inspirational feelings
I had when I started going to the theater in the '50s. It's that
kind of show. The kind of show that invites them in and invites
them back.''
</P>
<P>
   But will ``Fame'' last forever?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will last forever in the theater as a blueprint for young
people who want to achieve something in life,'' says De Silva,
unapologetically. ``It's gone beyond my wildest dreams.''

   &UR; Relax, Flan Watchers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I love to make flan, but the caramel is time-consuming and
must be watched constantly to prevent burning. Do you have a less
daunting method?
</P>
<P>
   A. The most reliable and easiest way is in a microwave oven. In
her book ``Microwave Gourmet'' (William Morrow, 1987), Barbara
Kafka says that when the sugar and water for the caramel are
tightly covered and cooked by microwave, the resulting steaminess
prevents the sugar from crystallizing and insures even cooking.
</P>
<P>
   To make caramel for a flan, combine the sugar and water called
for in the recipe (or use } cup sugar and 3 tablespoons water) in a
4- or 6-cup glass measuring cup. Cover tightly with microwave-safe
plastic wrap, and cook on high for 4 to 5 minutes, until the syrup
turns deep amber (the longer it's cooked, the darker the caramel).
Watch carefully, checking every 10 seconds as the caramel
approaches the desired shade. Remove from oven, pierce plastic with
a knife and uncover carefully. Pour the caramel into the flan mold
as the recipe specifies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To Sift Flour, or Not &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it really necessary to sift flour when baking?
</P>
<P>
   A. Even though most flour is now sifted before packaging, it
compacts as it stands. For an accurate measure, some air needs to
be incorporated back into it. Sifting does this, but so does
stirring and fluffing the flour with a fork before measuring.
</P>
<P>
   Flour still needs sifting for delicate cakes and sponges,
however. The aeration lets the particles mix more quickly and
uniformly with the liquid ingredients without overmixing, which
toughens the batter. In such cases, use a regular sifter or pass
the flour through a coarse strainer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Safety of Dried Fruit  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it true that you should boil dried fruit or dip it in
boiling water before eating it because it picks up bacteria in the
drying?
</P>
<P>
   A. Unless you want to reconstitute the fruit, there is no need
to douse it. Christine Bruhn, director of the Center for Consumer
Research at the University of California at Davis, says dried fruit
contains no more pesticides than fresh fruit, and may even harbor
less bacteria. During drying, the moisture drops so much that most
bacteria cannot survive. The Federal Food and Drug Administration
tests both dried and fresh fruit for pesticide residue and
bacteria.

IT'S A DOG'S LIFE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For doggies, San Francisco is paradise compared
to any other city in America. And measured against any other region
anywhere, Northern California is just about doggy heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The city has several doggy-friendly play, run and swim areas
where pooches of every type imaginable, from Newfoundlands to Heinz
57s, have been able to celebrate the summer weather. In the Bay
Area and beyond, there are additional parklands, open space and
forests where there are more things for doggies to sniff than in
their wildest foot-shaking, yipping dreams.
</P>
<P>
   I've never seen so many dogs as in the past week in San
Francisco, as thousands of people headed to the water to enjoy the
surprise temperature tantrum, and bring their best pals with them.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are allowed to run without a leash, but under instant
control, at Fort Funston near Ocean Beach, Baker Beach just west of
the Golden Gate Bridge, and along the Bay at Crissy Field and
Marina Green. This is where doggies can satisfy every fascination,
whether it be stick or tennis ball fixations or sniffing
obsessions. Another great off-leash dog run area in San Francisco
is at the Presidio, especially starting from the parking lot
adjacent to the Presidio Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   Racks installed by the National Park Service provide dog owners
with plastic bags for cleaning up refuse so it can be disposed of
properly.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other great destinations throughout the Bay Area
and beyond where you can take your dog. And there are a few others,
where questionable wisdom has been applied, where you cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best include the open space and trails operated by the
Marin Water District, and in the East Bay, the 55 parks in the East
Bay Regional Park District. Two of the best here are the Point
Isabel Shoreline near Berkeley and the Sunol Region Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Among the worst destinations with dogs are the state parks and
state beaches in the Bay Area, such as Big Basin Redwoods and Half
Moon Bay State Beach, where dogs are prohibited on the trails.
Among state parks, McNee Ranch at Montara is a rare exception.
Another agency on the doggy dirt list is the Midpeninsula Open
Space District, which prohibits dogs on trails at its 10 best
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountain country, dogs are welcome across 20 million
acres of national forests in California, featuring thousands of
miles of trails, no leash required. That includes high-country
wilderness, though many dogs are poorly suited for wilderness
travel, especially above tree line. In national parks, such as
Yosemite, Lassen Volcanic, Point Reyes National Seashore and
Sequoia-Kings Canyon, dogs are expressly prohibited on trails.

WINE OF THE WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Chateau Montrose, St.-Estephe, Bordeaux, 1995. About $70. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   T HERE is a lingering suspicion that where one tastes a wine can
affect one's judgment of it. I have always been partial to Montrose
for its power and its elegance, rating it along with Cos
d'Estournel as the finest of the St.-Estephes. But tasting through
half a dozen or so vintages at the chateau recently with the owner,
Jean-Louis Charmolue, I must confess to having been swayed by the
beauty of the place.
</P>
<P>
   Situated on a gentle rise overlooking the Garonne, with its
almost 200 acres of impeccable vines stretching to the river's
edge, Montrose is easily one of the most beautiful and lovingly
nurtured estates in the Medoc. So when I say this is a superb wine
of great depth and richness, well worth its price, you might want
to take my words with a grain of salt. So, too, my impression that
it combines the power of a great St.-Estephe with the roundness of
a fine Margaux or even a St.-Julien. Yes, my judgment may have been
swayed, so the only thing to do is try it for yourself. Or dash
over to Bordeaux, and try it with Charmolue.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, be patient; this is still a young wine, and it
really needs another five years in the bottle, by which time, I
hope, my critique will not seem flawed after all.

EXHIBIT GOES TO BAT FOR HOME TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Texas _ This Cooke County town of 15,000 has always
been an agricultural center. In the days of the cattle drives, it
was the last stop before Oklahoma Territory; it became a major
supply station for local ranches after the drives dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton became king; then oil surged from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball was what got people really excited. When
Gainesville prospered, it played baseball. And it prospered a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooke County Heritage Society is showing off the town's
diamond prowess now with a special exhibit at the Morton Museum,
just off the courthouse square.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, called, ``Play Ball,'' will run through mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was pretty normal for the times,'' Shana Powell
said of Gainesville's love of baseball. Powell, who is in charge of
the exhibit, said baseball was played as early at the late 1880s in
North Texas. ``It was just good entertainment and people enjoyed
going to the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Games were played against local towns, like Muenster and
Lindsay, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball exhibit is not on a grand scale. The Morton Museum
uses old photographs for the most part, scattered around in
different cases, each one representing an inning. There are balls
and bats and the occasional uniform. Each display is accompanied by
a description Powell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said her love of baseball spurred her to do the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we had a lot of the items here, particularly the
photographs,'' she said. ``And, I have a real passion for baseball.
I love the game. Since I'm the one who decides on what exhibits we
have, it was a natural decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teams played in Gainesville over the years _ the
Gainesville Cookies, Gainers, Tigers, Owls and Leopards. Most of
them were semipro teams. Often, the players got little more than $1
a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Gainers produced a Hall of Fame player. Paul ``Big Poison''
Waner began his baseball career with the semipro team. He was so
nicknamed because at 153 pounds, he outweighed his brother, Lloyd
``Little Poison,'' by 3 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Waners were teammates with the Pittsburgh Pirates and are
the only brothers in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The first game in Gainesville was played in 1889, according to
museum records. Home plate was on what is now Commerce Street, and
the local team beat one from Sherman, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   In 1896, the local paper announced, ``The Baseball Association
is making plans to entertain the Fort Worth Club here next week in
a series of games to be played in the local park.'' Funds were
solicited to pay for the Fort Worth team's visit.
</P>
<P>
   By 1911, there was a team in the Texas-Oklahoma League.
Gainesville had its first salaried team then, and it won the league
title against Denton in the last game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The game almost ended in a riot, though. The Gainesville players
were accused of inserting a ``rabbit ball'' into the game _ a ball
that is more lively than normal and one that exploded off the
rough-hewn bats.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Denton team couldn't prove its allegation, and
the victory stood. Gainesville prospered.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is open Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and on Saturday from noon to 5 p.m. For more information, call
(940) 668-8900.

   &UR; Fishing in Normandy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Two years ago in Normandy, in a restaurant in Ducey, I saw
pictures of salmon and was told they were caught in town. What can
you tell us about salmon fishing there? _ Paul P. Eggermann,
Milltown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ducey is a town of about 2,000 in the Manche Department,
about 12 miles east of Mont St.-Michel, on the Selune River. And
yes, salmon are caught there _ and in the See River, a few miles
north.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon season runs March 13 to Aug. 31, and according to
Michel Bouteloup of the Normandy Regional Tourism Board, the best
fishing is usually in May and June. There are annual limits of 142
salmon from the Selune and 261 for the See. By the end of June,
about 100 salmon were taken from the Selune and 130 from the See,
Bouteloup said.
</P>
<P>
   The individual limit is six salmon a year, and a license is
required. A carte vacance, a temporary license good for any 15-day
period, costs about $24, at 6.3 francs to the dollar. A yearly
license costs $63. Salmon fishers must also buy a minimum of two
rings to mark each fish caught. These rings, used to carry the fish
and to help the authorities monitor the overall catch, cost about
$16 each.
</P>
<P>
   In Ducey, fishing licenses and the rings are available from
Didier Guerin at Le Gain's Bar, 56 Grande Rue; phone (33-2)
33.58.46.40. He also offers a free fishing guide. The bar is open
daily, and there are usually fishermen there whom you can hire as
guides, Guering said.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to stay or dine at the Hotel Auberge de la Selune, 2
Rue de St.-Germain, 50220 Ducey, (33-2) 33.48.53.62, the chef,
Jean-Pierre Girres, will guide you to some of his favorite fishing
spots, according to his wife, Josette. She said they can help with
purchasing a license, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Normandy Regional Tourism Board is at 14 Rue Charles
Corbeau, 27000 Evreux, (33-2) 32.33.79.00, fax (33-2) 32.31.19.04,
and has a Web site at www.normandy-tourism.org.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An Alaska Drive &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A friend and I will be going to Anchorage in September, and
would like to drive to Nome or Kotzbue, near the Arctic Circle. Is
this possible, and if not, how can we make the best of a week
driving in Alaska? _ Ann Boyd, Plant City, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. In the words of John Beiler of the Alaska Division of
Tourism, driving to Nome or Kotzbue is ``impossible: there is no
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he suggested a route that includes three of the state's
four highways. What he calls ``the loop'' would take you from
Anchorage to Denali National Park and Preserve and to Fairbanks on
Highway 3 (the Parks Highway), then back on Highways 2 and 4 (the
Richardson and Glenn Highways). This drive of about 800 miles,
which includes two crossings of the Alaska Range, can be made
comfortably in five days or so, Beiler said. The fall colors could
be spectacular, he said, and you will probably see wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best place to see wildlife is in Denali. This park,
which includes 20,320-foot Mount McKinley, the spectacular top of
North America, has 37 species of mammals and 130 bird species _
including moose, caribou, grizzly bears and golden eagles. The
visitor center offers nature hikes and sled dog demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   It costs $5 a person or $10 a family for a seven-day pass to
enter the park. Private cars are not allowed beyond the first 15
miles of the 91-mile road through the park, but shuttle buses from
which you can get on and off ($12.50 to $31) and narrated tour
buses with lunch, but no getting off ($34 to $64), are available.
Shuttle bus places can be reserved at (800) 622-7275, and tour bus
spots at (800) 276-7234. For general information on Denali National
Park, call (907) 683-2294 or see www.nps.gov/dena.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Tranel, the park's spokeswoman, cautioned visitors to be
prepared for a variety of weather, especially in September. Snow
that can close the park road is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The only lodging in the park is at the Denali Park Hotel, (907)
683-2215, but there are many motels or lodges just outside Denali,
some of which can book wildlife tours; call (907) 683-4636, for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the city of Fairbanks, with its museums, the pioneer
theme park Alaskaland and, with luck, views of the aurora borealis,
other areas to stop overnight on the loop include Paxson and
Glenn-allen. The Tourism Division's Inquiry Section, at (907)
465-2010, can help you plan the trip. Or go on line at
www.commerce.state.ak.us/tourism/homenew.htm.

   &UR; Dining in Westminster &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have heard that there are restaurants in the Palace of
Westminster. Are any open to the public? _ Kenneth Utz, Uniontown,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are several restaurants in Westminster, where the
Houses of Parliament meet. But unless you somehow win election or
an invitation from a member of Parliament, you won't be able to
dine in them.
</P>
<P>
   The area around Westminster isn't highly regarded for its
restaurants, but there are a few places worth trying. Here are
three that are so regularly used by politicians that the division
bell that signals a return for a vote rings in all of them:
</P>
<P>
   The Atrium, 4 Millbank, (44-171) 233 0032, is probably the
nearest restaurant to the Houses of Parliament, about 5 minutes
walk. It is open Monday to Friday only, serving lunch from noon to
3 and dinner from 6 to 10 p.m. The food includes traditional dishes
like fish and chips and shepherd's pie in the winter as well as
more exotic offerings, like poached halibut on saute mange-tout,
baby corn and cherry tomatoes; asparagus, prawn and salmon risotto;
or stuffed saddle of rabbit on a potato rosti and peppercorn sauce.
A meal for two with house wine and tip costs about $160, at 63
pence to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Also nearby is Shepherd's, at Marsham Court, Marsham Street,
(44-171) 834 9552. It is also open only Monday to Friday, with
lunch from 12:30 to 2:45 P.M, and dinner 6 to 11 p.m. The menu
includes the traditional steak and kidney pie and roast rib of beef
and Yorkshire pudding as well as roasted monkfish and smoked bacon
with spinach and ratatouille. A three-course meal costs about $40,
including coffee but not wine.
</P>
<P>
   Simply Nico, 48A Rochester Row, (44-171) 630 8061, is another
popular haunt of politicians. It is open noon to 2 p.m. Monday to
Friday for lunch and 7 to 11 p.m. every day but Sunday for dinner.
Although the menu changes, typical dishes are fillet of brill with
artichokes and green beans, or roast saddle of lamb with lamb
sweetbreads, capers and tomato. Three courses cost about $37, not
including beverages.

PAN-ROASTED DUCK BREASTS
</HEADLINE>

collaborator is Michael Ruhlman.)  
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People forget about duck at home _ I don't know why. Duck is a
rich, delicious meat, there are so many different things you can do
with it, and it's easy to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are afraid of the fat in the skin; indeed, rendering
it out is the main difference between cooking duck and cooking
chicken. Cooked correctly, though, the skin is one of my favorite
things about duck. The key to perfect sauteed duck breasts _ ones
with nicely browned skin and a medium rare interior _ is cooking
them over low heat, so that the fat has time to render before the
breast is finished.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce for the duck is simply corn juice heated with some
corn. Corn is a logical match for duck _ it's , and it's one of the
primary foods ducks eat. I add morel mushrooms to the corn because
I love their woody, earthy qualities with the corn's sweetness. If
you can't find fresh morels, dried are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   If you must buy a whole duck for this recipe instead of just the
breast, consider yourself lucky. You'll have six legs left over and
bones for stock. One of my favorite things to do with duck legs is
to braise them: sear them in an ovenproof pan, add stock or water,
carrots and onions, bring it to a simmer, then cover and cook in a
325-degree oven for an hour and a half. I mix the
falling-off-the-bone meat with some cooked peppers, onions and
diced potato to make duck hash. Top it with a poached egg (a duck
egg if you can find one), and it's a superb and luxurious brunch
dish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PAN-ROASTED DUCK BREASTS WITH CREAMED WHITE CORN AND MORELS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   7 large ears of sweet white corn, shucked
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces morels
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely minced chives
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   3 whole boneless duck breasts (Liberty Valley or Long Island),
halved and trimmed of sinew and excess fat
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon heavy cream.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut the kernels from 4 ears of corn. Place them in a blender
and puree, adding just enough water (1 to 2 tablespoons) to allow
them to puree. Transfer the puree to a chinois or fine mesh
strainer set over a bowl. Press lightly on the corn to extract the
juice, but do not force the puree through the strainer. There
should be about one-third cup of corn juice; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Fill a medium saucepan half-full of water, and bring to a
boil. Make an ice bath by filling a bowl with a mixture of ice and
water. Cut kernels from remaining 3 ears of corn; there should be
about 2 cups kernels. Add kernels to boiling water, and blanch 1
minute. Transfer kernels to ice bath, then dry on paper towels; set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Trim stems from morels. Soak them in warm water, changing the
water several times until it is clear. If some of the mushrooms are
larger than the others, cut them in half for a uniform size. Place
a skillet over medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon butter. Shake
excess water from the mushrooms, and add to the hot butter. Saute
until the liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms are tender. If
necessary, add a tablespoon of water to the pan. Add shallots,
chives and parsley, and saute 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove the small tender from each half of duck breast, to
permit the breast to cook evenly. Score the skin in a cross-hatch
pattern, deep enough for the excess fat to drain as the duck cooks,
but not so deep as to cut the meat. Season with salt and pepper to
taste. Place a large skillet over low heat. Place the breasts in
the pan skin-side down, and saute 7 to 8 minutes, allowing most of
the fat to drain and the skin to brown. Spoon excess fat from the
pan, and turn duck breasts over. Saute 3 to 4 minutes to complete
the cooking. Transfer breasts to a platter lined with paper towels,
and let rest 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. While the breasts are resting, transfer the corn juice to a
small, heavy saucepan. Place the pan over medium heat, and whisk
until it thickens. (The starch present in the corn will cause it to
thicken quickly.) Do not allow it to boil, or it may curdle. When
the liquid has thickened, reduce the heat to low. Whisk in the
remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the cream. Stir in the blanched
kernels and the morel mixture. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, place an equal amount of creamed corn and morels on
each of six plates. Top each portion with a duck breast, and serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

PATTING OURSELVES ON THE BACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Did you have a good Self-Congratulation Day?
<P>
   That was the unofficial title of Monday by the bay. We had it
coming. In a little over a week, we:
</P>
<P>
   -- Hosted the X Games, which were so wildly popular that Willie
Brown is considering granting full humanhood status to
skateboarders, even though Willie's cops are still telling kids
that skateboards are illegal in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the X fans not tear down the town, they freshened
it up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   If the X Games events seem silly to sports traditionalists,
imagine what baseball (the ZZZ Games?) must look like to the
uninitiated. ``I say, Harvey, that man holding the wooden stick _
what is he searching for in his pants?''
</P>
<P>
   -- Hosted the GayBiUnameit Parade, the world's most exuberant
out-of-closet experience, and who needs a closet anyway when your
summer wardrobe fits in your handbag?
</P>
<P>
   -- Hosted and dominated the greatest women's soccer match in
history, the USA's 2-0 win over the Bullies de Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I shouldn't have used the qualifier ``women's.''
</P>
<P>
   And would it be un-P.C. to call our women the Soccer Mamas?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday the women will catch up to the men in staging
big-time sports events, and then the World Cup women's soccer will
be as tedious, self-important and flat as the recent NBA Finals.
Until then, we'll all just have to endure the kind of pure joy,
unspoiled athleticism and lack of whining that beamed out of
Stanford Stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   -- Put on the nation's grandest fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   And lived _ most of us _ to tell about it.
</P>
<P>
   I WAS OUTTA town for a few days, and the first thing I did upon
returning was check the week's obit pages. I wasn't in 'em and
neither was The Chronicle, so I came to work.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mind The Chronicle being for sale, but I hope we don't
have to put up with a bunch of Lookie Lous poking around the
building, tsk-ing at our cluttered desks and unconventional decor.
</P>
<P>
   You should have seen the place before we tidied up.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, if I draw creative inspiration from my photo montage
of Sharon Stone's greatest movie roles, that's my business.
</P>
<P>
   In The Chronicle newsroom's snack corner, there is a posted
price list for the coffee, tea and doughnuts. Somebody added to the
list: ``KRON _ $5,000,000.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, that includes Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE 31ST consecutive year, Laura Watson reminds me, I missed
the Worm Races at Clear Lake, Calif. I don't have the name of the
winning worm, but all the other competitors, as a consolation
prize, were taken on a fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking of entering a worm next year. Or if I'm feeling
low, I might sign on as a jockey.
</P>
<P>
   A prime spot for viewing Sunday night's S.F. Bay fireworks was
McCormick &AMP; Kuleto's restaurant, which was booked solid two months
in advance. Turned away at the door were two 49ers players and one
consul general, and all were miffed.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised to hear this. Not surprised that they were
turned away, but that there are still 49ers around. With the
DeBartolo family feud still raging, I assumed the franchise had
been disbanded or relocated to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T SPREAD this around, because we don't want to scare away
the tourists, but nobody was surfing at Stinson Beach on Sunday.
Sharks were sighted in the water (where else?) the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The sharks might have been scared off by Sunday's fireworks,
though. Stinson is where the nouveau riche now gather on the Fourth
to blow their cash and explosives stash. From sunset to well past
midnight, the Stinson sky was afire with illegal and private
fireworks, and not your puny lawn-display stuff, but the
industrial-strength God-bless-America boom-booms.
</P>
<P>
   I REGRET to report, after a quick trip to Santa Monica last
week, that NorCal still lags far behind SoCal, culturally.
</P>
<P>
   Up here, we sail through red lights, sure, but not with the
consistency and consummate arrogance of our southern neighbors, who
have come to look upon signal lights as festive, year-round
Christmas decorations.
</P>
<P>
   And cell phones? Unlike the overly timid Bay Area cell-phoner,
the Santa Monican is not afraid to put his or her body into the
conversation, gesturing grandly at curbside or poolside and having
the courtesy to speak loudly so the rest of us need not strain to
eavesdrop.
</P>
<P>
   I dined at a coffee shop where the menu listed two numbers under
each item _ the calories and the grams of fat in that dish. Made me
feel so guilty that I ordered water and ate the menu. Fiber, baby.

CHILDREN LEAD THE WAY FOR GOLF GREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Juli Inkster has insisted on sharing the
spotlight on her great year in golf with husband Brian and
daughters Hayley and Cori, partly because she credits them for her
resurgence at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I had kids, golf was my life,'' Inkster said in a
recent telephone interview. ``I lived and breathed golf, and every
day I couldn't wait to get back out there to get it back or hold
onto it. But when I had kids my perspective changed, and it wasn't
the most important thing to me anymore. ... I enjoy it more, and I
think that's why I'm playing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   When Payne Stewart won the U.S. Open, though, not a word was
written about his children, and that double standard is not lost on
Inkster, who completed the Grand Slam with her LPGA Championship
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little different with men having kids,'' said
Inkster, who lives in Los Altos, Calif. ``The maternal gene is I
guess the guilty gene, and I think it's different for a man. Even
though they love their kids and would do anything for their kids,
the bonding isn't there. I couldn't imagine being away from my kids
for two weeks. The men will go for four weeks and it's not a big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster points out that she's privileged to be able to afford to
take her family on the road with her, something a struggling pro
probably couldn't do. Yet she embraces the opportunity to be a role
model for girls who want to have it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the kids out there to know you can do both, you can win
a tournament and have your husband there and your children there to
share it,'' she said, expressing the hope that girls who excel at
sports won't reach the point that they think feminity requires them
to be ``a cheerleader or a Barbie girl.''

BANNER YEAR FOR FROG HOLLOW PEACHES  
   
 AT THE SOURCE  
  
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON  
EDITORS NOTE: This column profiles Northern California growers,
anglers and artisans who make the region such a culinary
wonderland. Over the next few months, we'll take you from field to
forest to factory to look at the wealth of ingredients stocking our
larders.  By Janet Fletcher 
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The chilly winter and cool spring may have had
most Northern Californians complaining, but not the peach farmers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What was bad for citrus was good for stone fruit,'' confirms
Al Courchesne, who cultivates 53 acres of certified organic peaches
and other stone fruits at his Frog Hollow Farm in Brentwood. ``I
think it's going to be a banner year for peaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Courchesne's early varieties, such as Queencrest, have been
higher in sugar and larger than normal, and his overall crop size
looks larger, too. He credits the weather _ the exceptionally cold
December and January followed by a cool, dry spring.
</P>
<P>
   Winter chill apparently hardens the tree's buds so they flower
simultaneously, which improves fruit set. A cool spring promotes
slow and steady fruit development. Early hot spells _ which we
didn't have _ hamper cell division, cause pits to harden and
generally throw the growth process off track. Rain during the
growing season _ which we haven't had _ encourages fungus, mold and
brown rot.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, says Courchesne, it was a perfect spring.
</P>
<P>
   Sought after by shoppers at Bay Area produce and farmers'
markets, Frog Hollow fruit excels in part because Courchesne picks
it ripe. Supermarket peaches are typically nine to 12 degrees brix,
he says, referring to a measure of sugar content at harvest. In
contrast, his early varieties range from 14 to 17 degrees brix; his
later peaches, from 18 to 23 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken us 24 years to select the varieties we're happy
with,'' says Courchesne, who names the Cal Red, a late-August
peach, as his favorite. He has phased out white peaches because
they don't have the acid level he seeks, but he has found 25 other
varieties that allow him to harvest high-quality fruit from mid-May
to mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Late varieties such as Cal Red and O'Henry are always superior,
he says, with denser flesh and more sugar, but early peaches
satisfy consumers who just can't wait. Mid-July should bring the
Sun Crest, the older variety that Mas Masumoto wrote about in his
acclaimed ``Epitaph for a Peach.'' ``It's the first peach of summer
that gives you that true peachy quality,'' says Courchesne, who has
several acres of them.
</P>
<P>
   At the market, look at background color, suggests the grower.
The best peaches have a red blush against a deep gold background.
Check the area around the stem, the last part to ripen. If it's
green, leave those peaches behind.
</P>
<P>
   At home, keep firm peaches on the counter so you can monitor
them as they soften. ``It's a myth that the best peach is the one
you picked yourself and ate under the tree,'' Courchesne says. ``In
my experience, the best peach is the one you pick and age for three
to four days at room temperature. It will get better and better.''
In any case, avoid refrigerating peaches, which halts their
development and mutes their flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Frog Hollow Farm fans will welcome the news that Courchesne and
his partner Rebecca Smith are nearing completion of a commercial
kitchen. Smith, a former pastry chef at Oakland's Oliveto, will
make peach marmalade and peach conserve to sell at the stores and
farmers' markets that carry the farm's fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Frog Hollow's exceptional peaches fetch a
premium _ about $3 a pound at Bay Area farmers' and retail markets
(see related list for places where the peaches are sold). But the
fruit's handling is exceptional, too. Typically, the peaches are
picked in the morning and delivered in the afternoon, often by
Courchesne himself. On Saturday mornings, dressed in overalls, the
tanned farmer is at the Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market, handing out
samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the farmers' market,'' says Courchesne. ``You spend a
year growing the fruit and you get to be in on the final sale.
You're talking to the person who bought your fruit last week and
they're back this week to tell you how much they loved it. It's the
ultimate fulfillment.''

FOOD IN THE NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON  
EDITORS NOTE: Food, nutrition and health studies bombard us, but
the seemingly endless information is often as confusing as it is
enlightening. With Food in the News, The Chronicle's Food staff
aims to change that. This regular round-up column will make
practical sense of the latest nutrition-related studies _ as well
as offering offbeat but tantalizing snippets of other food news to
put on your plate.   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle.  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Everyone knows a good marinade can do wonders for
the flavor and texture of grilled meat. Now it appears marinating
meat might help prevent cancer, too.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Studies by the American Institute for Cancer Research, a
nonprofit organization that focuses on the link between diet and
cancer, show even a 40-minute bath in an acidic marinade stops the
formation of carcinogenic compounds called heterocyclic amines. The
compounds form when meat is cooked at high temperatures and
particularly when it is charred.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists aren't exactly sure why marinades prevent
the carcinogens from forming, a number of clinical trials with
different marinades shows acidity is key. So if you use a marinade
for cancer-fighting purposes, make sure it contains citrus juice or
vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the cancer institute has been urging people to take
steps to reduce the possible cancer risk posed by  &LR; grilled &LR;  food.
Precooking meat in the microwave, removing fat that causes grill
flare-ups, using tongs to turn meat and being careful not to
puncture the flesh are among the organization's other
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL; 
Break an Egg
</P>
<P>
   Egg cartons might soon bear labels warning consumers about the
dangers of salmonella if a proposal by the Food and Drug
Administration becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   The new label is among a package of egg safety changes the FDA
and the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If the label makes it through a round of public hearings later
this year, it will read, ``Eggs may contain harmful bacteria known
to cause serious illness, especially in children, the elderly, and
persons with weakened immune systems. For your protection: Keep
eggs refrigerated; cook eggs until yolks are firm; and cook foods
containing eggs thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the package of industry reforms is a new federal
directive requiring that all eggs and egg products packed for
consumers be refrigerated at 45 degrees or below at every stage of
transportation and storage. That will go into effect Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 to 1998, there has been a 44 percent decrease in the
number of illnesses caused by salmonella, according to the
Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, known as FoodNet, a
collaborative effort of several federal agencies including the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The measures announced last week may prevent up to 66,000
illnesses and 40 deaths per year, according to FoodNet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
While We're on the Subject
</P>
<P>
   An astute reader from the University of California at Berkeley
noted an error in a previous Food in the News item about eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In April, we brought you the news that a study of more than
100,000 healthy individuals showed an egg a day doesn't appear to
increase chances for heart disease or stroke. In explaining that
eggs contain nutrients that might reduce harmful serum cholesterol,
called low-density lipoproteins, the column item misidentified the
sort of cholesterol contained in eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The human body produces both beneficial and detrimental serum
cholesterol. Eggs contain dietary cholesterol, which affects the
type of serum cholesterol the body produces.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the study was that eggs contain antioxidants,
folates, B vitamins and other nutrients that might help the body
produce fewer low-density lipoproteins and could raise the level of
the more beneficial cholesterol called high-density lipoproteins.
That means that eggs might not be as bad for overall serum
cholesterol levels as previously thought.

 SAN FRANCISCO _  Even those of us who love strawberry shortcake
have to admit that it's not always perfect; usually there's one
element that is disappointing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   However, that's not the case with Rivoli's Buttermilk Shortcake
with Strawberries and Meyer Lemon Syrup. All the components are
right on target.
</P>
<P>
   Chef-owner Wendy Brucker has created a shortcake with a tangy
sweetness and a crumbly sconelike texture. She cooks and purees
some of the berries into a sauce, and embellishes the whipping
cream with creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, she drizzles the whole wonderful dessert with a
Meyer lemon syrup. It's perfect.
</P>
<P>
   That's only one of the exceptional dishes crafted by Brucker at
Rivoli in Berkeley, which she owns with her husband, Roscoe
Skipper. I'd put the appetizers up against anyone, especially the
signature slices of portobello _ battered, deep-fried and served
with a topping of shaved Parmesan, capers and a crock of lemon
aioli. And for a main course, you can hope the pot roast with
buttery mashed potatoes is on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   The recently-remodeled dining room has an open, casual feel. The
manicured garden out back is a lovely focal point for the
interior's green and burnt umber color scheme.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Rivoli, 1539 Solano Ave. (near Peralta), Berkeley; (510) &LR; 
 &LR; 526-2542. Open for dinner nightly. &LR;

   Ingredients: &QL; 
The Shortcakes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1/4-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   Sugar for sprinkling top
</P>
<P>
   Powdered sugar for dusting
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry Filling
</P>
<P>
   4 cups sliced strawberries
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze of lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   The Cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   The Syrup
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons grated Meyer lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the shortcakes:  &LR; Sift together the dry ingredients into
a bowl. Add the butter and mix with your fingers until it is broken
up and the mixture has the texture of wet sand. Add the buttermilk
and gently mix it in.
</P>
<P>
   Shape the dough into 6 shortcakes on the baking sheet. Use a
4-inch ring mold to shape the cakes, easing the dough into the ring
with the aid of a soup spoon dipped into hot water. Space the
shortcakes 4 inches apart on the baking sheet. Place the baking
sheet on another baking sheet. This keeps the bottom of the
shortcakes from burning. Sprinkle the tops of the shortcakes with
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 10 minutes. Let cool, then slice the shortcakes in
half. If made ahead, store in a covered container.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the filling:  &LR; Combine 1 cup of the strawberries, the
sugar, salt and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Cook over medium
heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Puree and strain. Let
cool to room temperature, then toss with the remaining
strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the cream:  &LR; Combine the whipping cream, creme fraiche,
vanilla and sugar; beat until medium peaks form.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the syrup:  &LR; Combine the sugar, water and zest in a
small saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook for 5
minutes. Cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble the shortcakes:  &LR; For each serving, place the bottom
half of a shortcake on a dessert plate, cut-side-up. Top with a
generous spoonful of the strawberries, then a large dollop of
whipped cream, and finally more strawberries. Crown with the top
half of the shortcake and drizzle with a portion of lemon syrup.
Dust with powdered sugar.
</P>

ONE GUSHES, ONE BORES _ BUT SONG'S THE SAME
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The 2000 presidential campaign has hardly begun, and already
they're calling it the Gush-Bore race.
<P>
   The media pack seems to have anointed Republican George W. Bush
as the gush _ spontaneous and fun-loving _ while tagging Democrat
Al Gore as the bore.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor came to California last week for his first
big show, and he was treated like Latin pop sensation Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was here the previous week, his 57th
California trip, and got all the attention of a Vanilla Ice.
</P>
<P>
   But from backstage, the reality is that the two front-runners
are singing the same songs _ tuned to the ear of that mainstream,
moderate, middle-of-the-road voter who will make or break their
election bids.
</P>
<P>
   Both trekked across California with a presidential air,
proclaiming that theirs is the fresh vision for the 21st century.
From fund-raiser to fund-raiser, in polo shirts and in suits, they
staged carefully crafted photo ops while corraling the press behind
velvet ropes that allow little opportunity for substantive
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, stressed
bedrock issues: family, faith, continued prosperity and education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and a roster of
other cities, stressed family, faith, prosperity and education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the 21st century goal of prosperity must be ``to reach
out to every member of our society, to make sure no one is left
behind.'' Bush said ``the purpose of prosperity is to leave no one
out ... to leave no one behind.''
</P>
<P>
   They both rubbed elbows with the Hollywood crowd, and talked up
the Latino vote, displaying their best Spanish _ yes, Hispanics in
2000 are ``muy importantes,'' they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore talked of ``revolutionary changes'' in education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was praised by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan as a
candidate who supported ``a revolution in education.''
</P>
<P>
   And they were big on families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a coalition of common sense that focuses on the best
interest of working families,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a plan ... that helps struggling families on the
outskirts of poverty,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed on gay marriage (no) and on a ban on offshore oil
drilling (yes).
</P>
<P>
   And they were positively overflowing with hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to create a brighter, more humane, optimistic future''
for all Americans,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are waiting for new hopes, new energy, new
idealism,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this conformity, a few significant differences did
manage to emerge: Gore talked guns (``We need to be shielding the
children against gun violence ... not the gun manufacturers''),
while Bush admitted signing a law permitting Texans to carry
concealed weapons and acknowledged that lawsuits against gun
manufacturers have not fared well in his state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore talked about protecting a woman's right to choose; Bush
stuck to his anti-abortion roots, and said he hopes for an America
in which every unborn child will be protected by law.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of them dwelled on the tough stuff. Or spent any
time detailing policy.
</P>
<P>
   With 17 months to go before the 2000 election, the moderate
middle isn't really listening, anyway. And Gush/Bore promise many
more trips to California.

AT MEAL'S END, A BERRY GOES A LONG WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blueberries are in the markets, velvety red and gold raspberries
beckon jewel-like from tiny baskets, and soon big, shiny
blackberries will be available to pick in the countryside or to buy
at farm stands. What a trove!
</P>
<P>
   And you can find other berries, like the good strawberries that
are still available, and less common varieties like boysenberries,
bushberries, loganberries, currants, gooseberries and fraises des
bois. As any berry picker equipped with a sun hat and a bucket
knows, ripe berries plucked from the bush need no adornment. But
the magic of berries is that even the ones you buy in summer have
enough rich, tart-sweet satisfaction to carry the day with minimal
support.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, a berry tartar that I was served for dessert
last year at Chateaubriand, a French steakhouse in midtown. It was
a deep-scarlet cylinder of a finely chopped assortment of berries
on a plate drizzled with a thick berry coulis and dotted with a few
ovals of mascarpone. With liqueur as an ingredient, it had an
intensely winy flavor, making for as satisfying a fruit dessert as
you could want.
</P>
<P>
   I obtained the recipe and decided to save it for berry season,
which was a good thing since the restaurant is temporarily closed
for renovations. But other equally fine mixed berry desserts _
intensely flavored, refreshing and kind to those who care about
looking trim at the beach _ are ripening on menus now.
</P>
<P>
   Cooling fruit soups are studded with berries and crowned with
icy sorbet. Some examples are Erik Blauberg's mixed berry and
honeydew soup with passion-fruit sorbet and Luc Dendievel's mixed
berry soup in a red wine base. Laurent Tourondel's marinated
raspberry and green-tea infusion spiked with blood-orange juice at
Cello adapts summer's iced tea for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Blauberg also makes a terrine of black and red currants,
raspberries and wild strawberries, bound with nonfat yogurt and
gelatin and garnished with mint. Similar sophisticated updates of
the old-fashioned Jell-O mold include Mary Brannigan's mixed
berries in a Sauternes gelatin at 27 Standard, and Stephane Motir's
shimmering terrine made with muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise at the
Tonic. These desserts are beautiful, delicious, easy to prepare and
as summery as a garden party.

RECIPES FOR AN ICY GLASS OF SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Recipes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say it is good to sip hot soup in the summer. Good for your
health perhaps. But what feels good is anything icy cold. If it's
bubbly, all the better.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why ``Champagne Cocktails'' (Regan Books, $12) by
Anistatia Miller, Jared Brown and Don Gatterdam, is appealing. At
New Year's, you can take the bubbly stuff straight, but this time
of year a cool cocktail seems a better approach.
</P>
<P>
   This entertaining guide begins with a brief history of Champagne
and moves swiftly to the recipes, from classics like the Bellini to
new concoctions like the imperial duo, made with Champagne and
Cognac. There are plenty of tips for the novice and trivia. For
instance, lemon peel may look pretty in a Champagne cocktail, but
it has a flattening effect on the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding which drinks to try was difficult. James Beard's
Champagne punch caught my eye. What could that man have found
acceptable to mix with Champagne?
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, just about everything: Cognac, Cointreau,
orange juice, lemon juice and zest. The punch was a deep amber, the
surface covered with strands of zest and slices of cucumber. The
first few sips were citrusy and refreshing, the next few cloying.
Which could be a good thing. More than one of these would put a
quick end to a day.
</P>
<P>
   Individual cocktails were more elegant. An Americana, made with
bourbon, a dash of bitters, Champagne and a slice of peach, had
guts. The bitters held the fruit and caramel flavors in balance and
kept the drink refreshing. Pink Champagne cocktail _ a swirl of
rose Champagne, Grand Marnier, brandy, bitters and sugar _ was the
color of a rose petal and tasted a little sweeter as the sugar
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   I tried some recipes simply because of their names. The
Colonel's Big Opu (opu is belly in Hawaiian) is a mix of lime
juice, cracked ice, gin, Cointreau and Champagne. The drink is
mostly about gin and lime, but the Champagne had a lovely
lightening effect. Nelson's Blood turned out to be a beauty, the
rim of the flute coated in grenadine and sugar so that it looked
like a ruby necklace and mirrored the port and Champagne in the
glass. Perfect after a meal.
</P>
<P>
   A Champagne julep had a few problems along the way. The recipe
calls for using a muddler to mash a sugar cube with a sprig of mint
in the flute. Most flutes are too narrow for this, and it is hard
to crush a sugar cube without some liquid to loosen the crystals.
But the drink was superb, subtly minty, subtly sweet and
deliciously bubbly. All that a Champagne cocktail should be. &QL; 
 &QL;

IT'S SHOWTIME FOR HERBS IN A PLATE OF PASTA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a time I dream about all winter: there are so many fresh
herbs that it seems imperative to use them at almost every meal.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite ways to take advantage of this abundance is
to mix large quantities of herbs with hot pasta and a simple base
of olive oil and garlic. In winter, this dish would not only seem
exotic but would also cost a small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The most reliable backbone of the herb mixture is usually
parsley or basil because they can be used in large quantities
without overwhelming the flavor of the dish; also, they are widely
available. Chervil, a delicious and underrated herb that tends to
be expensive and even difficult to find because it is so fragile,
is great as a supporting character here, as are dill, marjoram,
mint and oregano. More powerful herbs, like thyme, sage, tarragon
and rosemary, should be used more sparingly; a teaspoon, or at most
a tablespoon, is plenty. Otherwise they can steal the show.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, you might combine one-half cup each of parsley
and basil, a quarter cup of dill, and a teaspoon of thyme and
tarragon. Or one-third cup each of parsley, chervil and marjoram,
with some rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   Measurements need not be exact, either for individual herbs or
for the total amount. This is not brain surgery, but simply
combining a few good, fresh, strong-flavored ingredients that are
found at their peak only for the next few months. When herbs are
truly fresh and grown outdoors, there's a kind of mysterious
process in which their distinctive personalities are somehow
sublimated to create a wonderfully perfumed synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   I like to add a little butter to the mix, mostly for creaminess,
but you can also finish the dish with a bit of olive oil or with
some of the water in which the pasta cooked.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A business lunch today is positively Spartan compared
with those fabled three-martini events a quarter-century ago. The
martinis have been replaced by iced tea, mineral water, possibly a
single glass of wine. The hearty dishes that lingered until dinner,
like pot-au-feu, have become grilled chicken or a salad. The
leisurely two-hour interlude has slipped back to an hour or less,
and, for many, into carryout at the desk or sandwiches in the
conference room.
</P>
<P>
   As lunch has come under the increasing pressures of time,
budgets and health concerns, many restaurants have realized that
they must either adapt or deal with empty tables. They have chosen
to give customers what they want, like three courses in less than
30 minutes, or ready to go in a plastic container. And they are
having some success.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to fill its tables at noon, Lespinasse, one of New
York City's temples of gastronomy, recently sent a promotion to its
customers: ``In the '70s, you had lunch. In the '80s, you did
lunch. In the '90s, you skipped lunch. Perhaps it's time you
redefined lunch.'' The restaurant has done just that: three light
courses for $36 in one hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to eat fast and furiously,'' said Eberhard
Mueller, the chef and owner of Lutece. ``Years ago, you could serve
the French classics, but you can't sell them anymore. Now it's
salads, grilled fish, grilled meats, less starch, more protein and
healthier than ever and
please-make-it-fast-I-have-to-be-back-at-the-office-in-one-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for prix-fixe meals, most people eat no more than two
courses, often just an entree. Lunch has become a time to abstain,
dinner a time to splurge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an image thing,'' said Chris Cannon, a partner at Judson
Grill. ``It makes them look serious and healthy in front of
customers.'' It's a far cry from the days when a boozy haze was the
desired effect and not much work was done in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's tons of water, iced tea and cranberry spritzers and
$22,000 coffee machines that make six kinds of coffee: cappuccino,
espresso, double cappuccino, double this, double that,'' said Alan
Stillman, who owns Smith &AMP; Wollensky, Maloney &AMP; Porcelli and
Manhattan Ocean Club. But wine by the glass is selling, and to
protect that single-glass toehold, some restaurants have enlarged
and upgraded the choices.
</P>
<P>
   When Union Square Cafe opened in 1985, it offered two wines by
the glass; today there are 10. Eleven Madison Park, one of its
sister restaurants, offers 36. ``People are drinking only one glass
of wine, but they are willing to pay,'' said Charles Palmer, owner
of Aureole on the Upper East Side. His list includes a $26 glass of
1996 Chateauneuf-du-Pape.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants that want to stay in business cater to the changing
demands of their clientele, even if they don't approve. If a good
customer wants a meal boxed up to eat at the desk, even the
fanciest places will oblige. In the old days, Mueller said, when a
guest asked for sauce on the side, chefs would refuse. Today the
customer is always right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a three-course prix-fixe lunch for $38,''
Mueller said, ``but now if someone wants two courses we won't
refuse. If someone wants a bowl of soup and a salad, be my guest.
My lunch business, based on these subtle changes, is much better
than three years ago, by being in tune with what people want to eat
and their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in steakhouses, only about a third of the lunch entrees are
steak; at dinner they account for 85 percent of the meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give the appearance on the menu of healthful
dishes,'' said Cannon of Judson Grill. ``But people don't want a
spa menu, because they don't want to feel like they are going to
some spa.'' Which is exactly what the Four Seasons, considered by
many to be the power center of the midday meal, learned several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The spa menu was a great idea for a year or so,'' said Julian
Niccolini, a managing partner. ``People are interested in eating
healthy food, in very fresh, freshly prepared organic food. They
are interested in flavors. Great food doesn't have to be with
sauces.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Rocco DiSpirito, the chef at Union Pacific, simple
is better. ``People may not be able to enjoy interesting or
complicated food at lunch,'' he said, because they don't have the
time. ``We've simplified our lunch menu so you're not needing the
waiter to explain everything to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Markson, a Manhattan literary agent, appreciates efforts
at simplicity. ``When I first started, lunch was incredibly
exciting,'' Ms. Markson said. ``Now I try to make it as healthy as
I can. No drinking. Water, water, water, unless I have a foreign
guest. If I'm trying to be good, it's two appetizers and coffee.
Now I'm not looking at the breadbasket. Desserts are out, out, out,
unless you are with someone who is very thin and wants you to share
a dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and health are not the only influences on the changing
lunch business. There are hundreds of new options to fill the
gaping culinary and price differential between the Four Seasons and
the corner deli. Not the least of these is the corporate dining
room, an increasingly standard feature at large companies. Conde
Nast, which moved to its new headquarters at Broadway and 43d
Street last month, will soon be operating an elaborate Frank
Gehry-designed dining room for its staff and for in-house
entertaining. Investment bankers like Credit Suisse First Boston
are providing employees with in-house dining as well as a health
club, a hair salon and a dry cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   These amenities save companies time and money. ``It's the most
efficient utilization of time from our standpoint,'' said Luther
Terry, a managing director of Credit Suisse. The executive dining
rooms are also used to entertain clients, providing privacy that a
public restaurant cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate dining rooms were considered ostentatious once,''
said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant. ``No longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The booming economy has also created hundreds of new
restaurants, and, Wolf said, the number of seats exceeds the
demand. In some neighborhoods the competition among top restaurants
is particularly fierce. Over the last six months, 700 seats have
been added in the Madison Park area: Union Pacific, Patria and
Gramercy Tavern have been joined by Veritas, Tabla and 11 Madison
Park. Cena, a highly regarded restaurant in the neighborhood,
closed last week for lack of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to get people in the door,'' said
DiSpirito of Union Pacific. ``We used to average 70 to 80 for
lunch; now the average is 50. We were counting on the Credit Suisse
to be a big source of revenue, but I don't think they leave their
desks.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't need to leave their building, anyway, the same one
that houses 11 Madison Park and Tabla, Danny Meyer's two new
restaurants. He, too, was counting on the 2,000 employees of Credit
Suisse. Meyer, a shrewd businessman, decided that if if they
wouldn't come to him, he would go to them. This summer he will be
delivering $12 box lunches (sandwich, dessert and beverage) to
those people and selling to anyone who wants to pick one up.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a time when tables must be booked weeks in advance for
dinner, restaurants are finding that they need incentives to get
people in the door for lunch. The annual restaurant week promotion
when dozens of the city's top restaurants offer a prix-fixe lunch _
$19.99 this year _ is frequently extended for the entire year. At
the Gotham Bar and Grill, the $19.99 lunch accounts for about half
the lunch business, said the owner, Jerome Kretchmer, whose other
restaurants include Park Avenue Cafe, Judson Grill and Mesa Grill.
``It gets lots of people to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McLaughlin, a managing partner of Oceana and Molyvos,
called last year's $19.98 lunch at Molyvos a ``win-win situation,
with 250 people a week out of 800 or 900 buying that lunch, which
will probably be a permanent feature.''
</P>
<P>
   Other restaurants offer limited, less expensive menus at the
bar. A three-course lunch in the lounge at Le Cirque 2000 is $25.
Le Bernardin began the Timely Lunch Menu 18 months ago, and Eric
Ripert, the chef, insists that it can be served in less than 30
minutes. The $32 three-course prix fixe has increased business from
about 80 or 90 noontime customers to more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in the throngs of rushed and hungry New Yorkers,
there are holdouts _ most often in publishing and advertising,
where people still ``do lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gottlieb, the publisher and president of Harry Abrams,
remembers the old-style lunch with fondness. ``Lunch was always a
moment of relaxation, a time to catch up,'' he said. ``It still is
for me, a moment out of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Markson, the literary agent, has been eating lunch out five
days a week for 27 years. ``Lunch is absolutely the lifeline,'' she
said. ``It's the leisure of lunch that makes the deal happen. I
don't know what I'd do without it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are still some restaurants that don't need to offer
incentives to fill up. Judson Grill, Union Square Cafe, Michael's
and the Four Seasons _ which all cater to those who  &UR; do &LR;  lunch _
are almost always booked. Regulars think of those places as their
private clubs, where they are known and feel comfortable. The Four
Seasons is the ultimate lunch club, but even it is relatively quiet
on a getaway day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only day we have a problem is on Friday,'' Niccolini said.
``People want to get out of town as quickly as possible, and in the
summer they don't want to come to work at all on Friday. People are
making so much money, many don't have to, and because of the
Internet they can work at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed: just when lunch patterns seem to have settled in,
something comes along to unsettle them. Corporate dining rooms are
one thing, but the Internet may take an even greater toll on
restaurant lunch. Who needs to dicker over poached salmon when the
deal can be done in a flash on line?
</P>
<P>
   And despite evidence to the contrary, at this very moment,
martinis are making a comeback at the Four Seasons.

AT LAST, A VITAMIN PILL WRAPPED IN A TORTILLA

<TEXT>
<P>
   At last we know what Dilbert's nameless corporation produces:
burritos. But not just ordinary burritos.
</P>
<P>
   Dilberitos can lay claim to the title of the first fast-food
nutraceutical. Nutraceuticals, foods that have been fortified with
healthful ingredients, are among the hottest marketing segments of
the food and drug industries.
</P>
<P>
   Dilberitos, vegetarian burritos that will be showing up in
stores in the next few weeks, have been sprayed with 23 vitamins
and minerals, the same ones listed on the back of bottles of
vitamins. Each Dilberito carries the government's entire
Recommended Daily Allowance. That makes it a vitamin pill wrapped
in a tortilla _ or the Total of the burrito bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Named after Scott Adams' cartoon character, a put-upon engineer
with an upturned red and black striped tie, Dilberitos are, in the
words of the manufacturer, Scott Adams Foods of Newton, N.J.,
``cubicle cuisine,'' or ``dashboard dining.'' They can be put in a
microwave oven for three minutes, then eaten with one hand while
sitting in front of a computer _ though the sauce that accompanies
each of the four varieties (barbecue, Mexican, Indian and garlic
and herb) might dribble on the keyboard or on Dilbert's tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't remember in the morning to take a multivitamin, by
eating one of these I've gotten all the vitamins and minerals I
need for the day,'' said Jack Parker, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   But is this the best way to eat? Do you need 100 percent of the
RDA in one sitting? And, by the way, does it taste good?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to those questions are: it depends on what you would
otherwise eat for lunch, it depends on what else you eat during the
rest of the day, and it depends on the level of your culinary
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Nestle, chairwoman of the nutrition and food studies
department at New York University, pondered the larger question of
whether enhancing foods with additional nutrients is always a good
a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how we got to the point where everyone thinks we have
to get 100 percent of the Recommended Daily Allowance in every food
we eat,'' she said. ``I don't know any evidence that having
multiples of the Recommended Daily Allowance is better for you than
having your RDA once. At some point, you have to start worrying
about how many foods are being supplemented. I think we'll see a
lot more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest worries, she added, is that people might eat
too much iron, which can lead to a host of problems, including
heart disease. If, for example, you were to eat two Dilberitos for
lunch, or one Dilberito for lunch and one ounce of Total for
breakfast (and almost everyone eats more than one ounce), you would
immediately have at least 200 percent of your daily iron needs.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of how many Dilberitos you might want for lunch,
perhaps it is a plus that each has only 300 to 350 calories, making
it better than a lunch of a burger and fries. One seven-ounce
Dilberito contains only five grams of fat, no cholesterol and three
to seven grams of fiber. But it has large amounts of sodium and, in
fact, the ratio of sodium to potassium is the reverse of what the
body needs for a healthful diet. There should be a lot more
potassium than sodium, or at least equal amounts. Dilberitos do
have vegetables and beans, but not enough to raise potassium
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't figured out a pill that replaces everything
that's good for you,'' Dr. Nestle said. ``There are components in
fruits and vegetables that do not appear in vitamin pills:
phytochemicals like sulforaphane in broccoli, lycopene in tomatoes,
compounds in garlic and onions. It's the consumption of fruits and
vegetables that is best associated with the protection against
heart disease and cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Taste? Texture? Dilberitos, which are $2.29 to $2.69 each, could
have been designed only by a food technologist or by someone who
eats lunch without much thought to taste. But that makes them
pretty much like every other microwaved frozen burrito.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what's the alternative? Burger and fries?

SOAP TRIES TO LURE YOUNG VIEWERS WITH GOTHIC STORY LINE,
MULTI-ETHNIC CAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a stretch to say that NBC's cancellation of ``Another
World'' amounted to a cultural crime, as one caller described the
show's death between racked sobs the other day. She received no
sympathy here. In fact, my suggested punishment for the network
programmers who wielded the ax is to force them to actually sit
still and watch the daytime soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another World'' had its core fans, but tales of serial killers
and switched babies doomed it and its loopy plot twists after 35
years. You could say it was put out of its misery.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hardly surprising that ``Another World'' faithful have
vowed bitter hatred toward its replacement, the younger and
therefore advertiser-friendlier ``Passions,'' which got its first
airing Monday on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any consolation, ``Passions'' is the brainchild of
James E. Reilly, known to harbor Stephen King-ish instincts when it
comes to creating daytime drama (it's even set in Maine). And one
of its stars is Liza Huber, a ready-made marketing device,
considering that her mother is daytime superstar Susan Lucci.
</P>
<P>
   A reading of Reilly's descriptions of ``Passions'' leads one to
expect it to borrow from ``The X-Files,'' ``Melrose Place'' and
``Peyton Place''_ although press materials also mention as an
influence ``Dark Shadows,'' the late-'60s soap that featured
vampires, ghosts, haunted houses, werewolves and other assorted
Gothic demons. All of which might help explain this reported story
line about a lusty voodoo doll coming to life.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a town called Harmony, ``Passions'' will otherwise take
on more traditional, contemporary shadings _ the core family is
wealthy and powerful, and a number of ineffably attractive
protagonists in their 20s roam about in apartments and homes they
couldn't possibly afford. The difference might be ethnicity. Each
family is multigenerational, and there's a prominent Hispanic
family and an African-American one in the loop; what a concept,
considering the absence of minorities on the upcoming prime-time
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passions,'' with a cast numbering 23, decided to forgo name
power, although you might recognize Dalton James (he played Robert
Urich's son on the series ``Crossroads'') and Tracey Ross, the
``Star Search'' winner who had recurring roles on ``Ryan's Hope''
and ``All My Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Dallas/Fort Worth residents might recall Fort Worth native
and Texas Christian University theater grad Travis Schuldt, who has
landed a plum role as Ethan Crane, a member of the town's most
powerful family.
</P>
<P>
   Schuldt will get to smooch Lucci's daughter, who portrays Gwen
Hotchkiss, a wealthy socialite and Ethan's main squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Huber, who grew up on Long Island, N.Y., jumps to ``Passions''
after having studied at four of the city's most prestigious acting
schools. But her bio lists service on the Junior Committee to
support Little Flowers Children's Services of New York, a
child-care agency, and that she's an avid skier and golfer.
</P>
<P>
   The show's pedigree alone makes it worth a sampling. As head
writer for ``Days of Our Lives'' in the early '90s, Reilly was
credited with some of the most-discussed story lines in daytime,
including devil possession, a character being buried alive, another
barely escaping a gas chamber, even a beheading. Gross in the name
of love and lust? Perhaps. But during the 1993-94 season, ``Days''
climbed from No. 8 in the Nielsen ratings to No. 1 among 18- to
49-year-old women, the most coveted demographic for daytime
producers. It's still a ratings winner.
</P>
<P>
   Demographics are mentioned here because business decisions now
more than ever drive an industry shaking with bottom-line fear.
It's part of the reason ``Another World'' became just another
cancellation in the first place. Some soaps continue to draw a
large chunk of viewers and big money (''General Hospital'' alone
earned an estimated $1 million a week ``in profit'' for ABC) but
overall there has been an exodus of its core female viewership,
about 28 percent over the past five years. Audience (read:
advertising base) of ``Another World'' ``had become stagnant,''
says Annamarie Kostura, vice president of NBC Daytime.
</P>
<P>
   If NBC's in-house audience researchers are to be believed,
daytime's core viewers, stay-at-home mothers mostly, are heading
off to work in larger numbers each year, thereby robbing the
networks of a once loyal, somewhat captive audience. That's only
part of the problem, though.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, the networks refuse to 'fess up to cable's power,
having us believe that the ratings penetrations of HBO, USA,
Showtime and other cable channels mean little. Those how-to shows
on channels like HGTV and the Food Network have got to be driving
network executives nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do I believe the theory that soap operas were hammered by
O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial, and that many fans never returned
to their daytime viewing habits at its conclusion. My theory is
that, sure, O.J. coverage forced daytime watchers to notice signs
of life elsewhere. Truth is, soaps got desperate and made mistakes.
``Another World'' was one of the daytimers to turn to outlandish
story lines, figuring that it would bring viewers back to the
table.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember, all the networks were running daytime soap
teasers in prime time _ which only added to their silliness,
particularly if you were jolted by one of these absurd emotional
exchanges while in the middle of some morally ambiguous plot line
on, say, ``Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism was that soaps were getting too dark and too bizarre,
which is ironic, as ``Passions'' head honcho Reilly is NBC's new
go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   Kostura says they are banking on Reilly because ``he's created
people you like and care about and get invested in. That's the
challenge of soap operas. Once you get character investment, you
start caring about what happens to these people. Then (Reilly)
takes it to another degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostura also says reports on the genre's demise are all wrong,
that Nielsen doesn't keep track of high school and college watchers
who tune in to shows like the low-rated ``Sunset Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   She agrees that viewing habits have changed, but ``there's this
wonderful invention called the VCR. People do tape shows.''
</P>
<P>
   And remember, ``Dark Shadows'' was wildly popular with
teen-agers and young adults. In this era of demographics and
bottom-line madness, count ``Passions'' and those to follow it as
the next vultures to gorge on Young Hollywood.

AN EXHIBIT OF HOW FRENCH ARTISANS SHOWED BRITAIN HOW TO SHINE

   NEW YORK _ When looking at good English silver from the 17th and
18th centuries, one should remember that it was meant to be seen by
the flicker of candlelight. In such light, silver shimmers with the
fluidity of water. Seen under lighting that suggests candlelight,
the 112 pieces of silver in ``The Huguenot Legacy: English Silver
1680-1760,'' an exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design
Museum in Manhattan, is like a glittering ocean with more than a
few lobsters, dolphins and water monsters surfacing in the decor of
the objects.
</P>
<P>
   This collection belongs to Alan and Simone Hartman, a New York
couple who made frequent trips during the last decade to view
silver at the best British museums and amassed fine examples from
this period when Huguenot silversmiths migrated to England from
France. The Hartmans were advised by Christopher Hartop, executive
vice president of Christie's, who organized the show and wrote the
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many silver exhibitions, this one is less concerned with
who made the objects and how valuable they are. Instead, it
documents the development of the English obsession with French
taste and how the infusion of artisans trained for the French court
made it possible for British nobility to realize their ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Sampson Shinn, an assistant curator at Cooper-Hewitt,
has divided the articles into categories that relate to everyday
use _ dining, drinking, dressing. Arranging the pieces in this
manner points up the effects on the English of that other French
revolution, the one in menus and table settings. Also, each piece
is treated as intricate sculpture and displayed in the round, the
better to appreciate the elaborate trimmings with classical
references that were not lost on the original owners.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shinn opens the show with an etching based on Juste-Aurele
Meissonier's rendering of a 1735 centerpiece with a tureen on
either side. The centerpiece and the tureens, decorated with
shells, waves and leaves, became models for silver pieces made for
the Duke of Kingston, illustrating the degree to which such fantasy
landscapes made it to the table.
</P>
<P>
   As Protestants, the Huguenots were persecuted in France under
the Roman Catholic kings. In 1685, when Louis XIV revoked the Edict
of Nantes, which had affored the Hugenots limited privileges, they
emigrated en masse, many to England. Skilled and industrious, they
posed a threat to English silversmiths, who at first thwarted the
professional advancement of their French counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, as Hartop writes, England at this time was
emerging from medieval life and the dining habits of its people
were undergoing change. The new customs required new forms: soup
tureens for soups and stews and sauceboats for rich sauces. The
styles evolved from the classic al Baroque to the curvaceous Rococo
that merged so well with Chinese influences. Large quantities of
silver also arrived from South America, particularly from Peru,
where a whole mountain of silver had been discovered. Similarly
churches and convents were deaccessioning their silver.
</P>
<P>
   To broadcast the country's new sophistication, British
ambassadors were permitted to order plate from the Royal Jewel
House to use and display in foreign embassies. For his gilt dessert
service at the Hague, the fourth Earl of Chesterfield ordered a
pair of octagonal casters, with pierced and engraved domed tops,
for sugar and spice that were designed by Paul Crespin. Silver
candlesticks Crespin also made for Chesterfield are decorated with
shells and foliage like those in Daniel Marot's print, circa 1712,
of silver designs. Marot was the Huguenot designer who brought
Baroque interiors to Hampton Court for William and Mary via the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of caffeine-laced hot drinks in the 17th
century _ tea from China, coffee from Arabia and chocolate from
Mexico _ new vessels were devised to serve them. The chocolate pot
was the most complicated, requiring a high spout and a muddler or
stirrer to keep the heavy liquid from settling. Some containers
were adorned with natural forms related to a beverage: coffee
leaves enclose the spout of a coffee pot designed by Phillips
Garden, and a depiction of women picking tea leaves adorns a set of
tea caddies in the Chinoiserie style.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere were decorations more exuberant than on dining
services. The table setting in the show, laid out with symmetrical
precision, is a veritable feast for the eyes of mythical and
realistic creatures. One pair of sauceboats by Paul de Lamerie is
cast in the shape of shells with raised spirals, an engraved coat
of arms and dolphin handles. He also designed a silver bread basket
with the head of Ceres, goddess of grain.
</P>
<P>
   Even the boudoir, where a woman would receive guests in the
morning, featured grand silver toilet services with ewers for
water, repousse basins and glove trays. Throughout the house
candlesticks illuminated such luxuries at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shinn theorizes that as candlepower gave way to more modern
means of illumination, silver was replaced by porcelain as the
material of choice for the well to do. ``Gaslight and later
electric light visually flattened out the silver, and it never
seemed as wonderful as before,'' she said.

   WASHINGTON _ Here's a commercial certain to grab attention
during a break in ``Futurama'' or ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age Bobby shows up at the door to pick up date Jennifer and
for the first time meets Dad, who politely asks where the kids are
heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd go to party at a friend's house, have some
beers,'' answers Bobby. ``Then on the way home there's a good
chance I'll date rape your daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The jaw-dropping spot closes with this kicker: ``Face the brutal
truth about underage drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly the message that some lawmakers and others
concerned with underage drinking and its link to drug use and
similar social problems would like to see transmitted as part of
the national anti-drug campaign. At present, the almost $1 billion,
five-year effort _ best known for its famous ``your brain on
drugs'' ad _ is silent on the subject of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about an illegal, illicit drug that affects our
young people at a rate six times greater than all the other
illegal, illicit drugs combined,'' said Karolyn Nunnallee,
president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which produced the
public service announcement featuring Bobby and Jennifer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the nation's drug czar and leading members of Congress are
opposed to including alcohol in the drug ads, saying it would water
down the effort to steer youngsters away from hard drugs such as
cocaine and heroin. They presently hold the upper hand in the wake
of last Thursday's Senate vote prohibiting spending any drug
campaign funds on an anti-alcohol push.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding underage drinking to the drug czar's portfolio will
only stretch his resources even further and force him to take on
another tough fight,'' said Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., as the Senate
decided 58-40 against including alcohol in the anti-drug
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A key House committee faces a similar choice when lawmakers
return next week from the Fourth of July recess to wade into the
second major liquor fight to break out in Congress this year.
Members of Congress are also wrangling over Internet sales of
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Beer Wholesalers Association, which
has led the fight against including alcohol in the drug ads,
believe they can bottle up the idea for now. Leaders of the group
say it is not a question of underage drinking, which they oppose,
but of unfairly labeling beer, wine and spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about tying beer with heroin,'' said David Rehr, senior
vice president of the group. He called the proposal the work of
``neo-Prohibitionists'' determined to turn American culture against
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one of the ways to do that is to send messages to people
through taxpayer-paid ads that there is not a lot of difference
between crack cocaine and wine,'' Rehr said.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of the powerful Washington liquor lobby, not
wanting to appear to favor underage drinking, are content to let
the beer wholesalers be out in front on this issue. But the
industry doesn't like the idea of a joint drug/alcohol campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confuses a legal product that causes beneficial health
effects with illegal street drugs,'' said John DeLuca, president of
the Wine Institute. ``They should not be commingled and not be
confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., a chief proponent of the
alcohol ads, said their purpose is not to disparage drinking by
adults, but simply to force both parents and children to focus on
underage drinking as a ``gateway'' to other drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to have an effective drug campaign, we really need
to get at the root of the problem,'' she said. ``You can't address
the problem of illicit drug use by turning your back on one of the
major ways that young people get involved with drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Roybal-Allard said she introduced her measure after retired Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, head of the White House Office of National Drug
Control Policy, testified he didn't have the authority to add
alcohol to the drug ads. She said she was ``flabbergasted'' when
McCaffrey then opposed her giving him that power.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said in a statement that an alcohol message would be a
``serious mistake'' and could ``dilute the focus of the successful
media campaign advertising effort to change attitudes of youth and
parents toward illegal drug abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   His position is shared by the Partnership for a Drug-Free
America, the coalition of advertising agencies that participates in
the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration is not united. Surgeon General
David Satcher urged McCaffrey to reconsider, writing him on June 11
that ``no comprehensive drug control strategy for youth can be
complete without the full inclusion of underage alcohol use and
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, television stations get a string of public service
announcements on underage drinking and issues such as literacy
along with the drug ads and they are encouraged to contribute air
time for those spots. But those ads do not reach the prime-time
audiences that see the anti-drug commercials the government pays to
air.
</P>
<P>
   Roybal-Allard and MADD leaders are now concentrating on keeping
their proposal alive in the House. They intend to keep fighting
even if the Appropriations Committee rejects it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't allow groups like the National Beer Wholesalers
Association to dictate our country's alcohol policies,'' said
Nunnallee, the Fort Meade, Fla., woman who heads MADD. ``Underage
drinking should have been a big part of this campaign from the
outset.''

TRAVELING LIGHT HAS NEW MEANING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Lady, your lights are on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms., excuse me, but I noticed that your lights were on when
you came through the drive-through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, turn your lights off. They'll drain your battery.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, kind people. Thank you so much. I know that my
headlights are on at high noon, but there seems to be nothing I can
do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, I want them off. I do want to control what's on and
what's off in my vehicle. But it's getting to the point that the
car simply doesn't need me anymore. It's got a mind of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, it's a rental car. It's a nice car with a V6 engine,
which means that I don't have to wave a white flag out of the
window and bat my eyelashes adoringly to get onto the freeway.
However, it's just a little too independent for me.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I've seen cars with the OnStar system, the vehicle
communications service that provides you with stolen-vehicle
tracking and emergency roadside service. It's very useful. I don't
have it, but I wouldn't mind if I did.
</P>
<P>
   My mother has these seat belts from the dark side that
clothesline you every time you sit in her car. They might save you,
if they don't strangle you first. And, of course, the remote entry
and seats that adjust automatically are worthwhile features.
</P>
<P>
   I'm really not against new technology at all, especially if it
makes my life easier. Nevertheless, I do not want my headlights on
all the time! I have no good reason. I just don't.
</P>
<P>
   I called the rental place to ask about this phenomenon, and they
said that I have ``daytime running lights.'' All late-model General
Motors cars have this safety feature. Some other manufacturers are
doing this as well.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, until I got this vehicle, I had not noticed
the large number of cars driving around in broad daylight with
their lights on. That makes me question the assertion that cars
with their lights on are more visible in traffic. Then again, maybe
I'm just not that observant. Hopefully, we don't have to rethink
this issue five years from now like we did with the air bags.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I thought since this car is so smart, I'd get it to do
something really useful. I put $2 in the driver's seat and told it
to go get me a loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. The car didn't move.
</P>
<P>
   The lights didn't even come on.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. I guess there are still a few things to look forward
to in the new millennium after all.

WINE TALK: SEARCHING FOR GOOD, AFFORDABLE BORDEAUX 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ One day in June, I was sitting at the bar of
the Hotel Mercure Pont d'Aquitaine here, having a cold Kronenbourg
with an old friend from California, Bob Thompson. We were both in
town for Vinexpo, the trade fair held in Bordeaux every two years.
He buys wine for an airline.
</P>
<P>
   We compared notes; he had been spending time in the Cotes de
Castillon region, and I was heading out the next day to Fronsac. It
said a lot, we both agreed, on the present state of affairs in
Bordeaux. People are looking beyond the classic regions _ the
Medoc, the Graves, St.-Emilion _ for good Bordeaux wine at
affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Fronsac and the adjoining appellation, Canon-Fronsac, are about
15 miles east of the city of Bordeaux. They are two of the wine
communities radiating out of Libourne, a bustling little city grown
prosperous on the success of its neighbors, the best-known of which
are St.-Emilion and Pomerol.
</P>
<P>
   Others include the so-called hyphenated St.-Emilions _ Lussac,
Montagne, Puisseguin and St.-Georges, all of which have St.-Emilion
after their names _ Lalande de Pomerol, the two Fronsacs, the Cotes
de Castillon and the Cotes de Francs.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these and a few other towns to the north are called
the East Bank, meaning the wine communes east of the Gironde River.
St.-Emilion is home to illustrious chateaus like Cheval Blanc,
Ausone and Figeac, while tiny Pomerol can boast of Petrus, Le Pin
and Trotanoy. Few of the satellite communes have properties whose
names come readily to mind. Which is why bordeaux enthusiasts
increasingly are heading east to search out bargains.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change, if some of the wines I tasted are an
indication of what's happening. The 1980s and the 1990s have been
prosperous years in the Bordeaux region, enabling winemakers in
these once-forgotten towns to buy new equipment, plant better
grapes and, most important, reduce crop yields. The result: richer,
more supple wines.
</P>
<P>
   In Fronsac, excellent wines are being made at chateaus like
Fontenil, which is owned by the enologist Michel Rolland; at La
Vieille-Cure, owned by an American group, and at La Dauphine, owned
by the firm of Jean-Pierre Moueix.
</P>
<P>
   But prices, while still well below those in the Medoc, are
rising even in these appellations. So buyers are moving farther
east, to the Cotes de Castillon and Cotes de Francs. The Cotes de
Castillon appellation covers eight communes, the most famous of
which is Castillon-la-Bataille, where, in 1453, the English lost
the Battle of Castillon, effectively ending the Hundred Years' War.
</P>
<P>
   The Cotes de Castillon is a big appellation, with almost 300
properties producing some two million cases of wine a year. There
are no dazzlers among the Castillon wines, but some, like those of
Jouanin, Pitray and La Terrasse, are worth sampling. Chateau Vieux
Champ de Mars _ literally Chateau Old Battlefield _ also
commemorates the end of English rule in Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Romans made wine in what is now the Cotes de
Francs, the appellation wasn't created until 1967, reflecting how
tough it is for a region to convince the authorities that it has
upgraded the quality of its wines.
</P>
<P>
   Chateaux de Francs and Marsau make good wines here, but the
best, and easily the best known, property in the Cotes de Francs is
Chateau Puygueraud, a handsome estate owned by the Thienpont
family, which also owns the famed Vieux-Chateau-Certan in Pomerol.
Puygueraud (pronounced pwee-gair-OH) produces some 15,000 cases a
year, a modest proportion of which comes to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, most of these East Bank wines were made with a
large amount of malbec grapes in the blend. As one travels east
from Bordeaux, malbec becomes more and more important until, in
Cahors, under the name auxerrois, it is the predominant variety. On
its own, malbec can produce a tough, astringent wine. In Cahors,
it's smoothed out with merlot and some cabernet sauvignon. In the
vineyards farther west, it's used less and less.
</P>
<P>
   At Puygueraud, the blend is generally 55 percent cabernet
sauvignon, 25 percent cabernet franc, 15 percent merlot and 5
percent malbec. Chateau de Francs uses no malbec. In Fronsac and
Canon-Fronsac, malbec has all but disappeared, and merlot is king.
At Chateau Canon, it makes up 95 percent of the blend; at La
Vieille-Cure, it's 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With all that merlot, no wonder these wines are growing in
popularity in the United States. As for price, rarely do any of
them reach $20, and many, particularly from the Cotes de Castillon
and the Cotes de Francs, are still under $10.
</P>
<P>
   Great bordeaux? No, but definitely very good bordeaux and often
far better values than some wines from towns whose names are more
familiar.

AFI LIST HAS WEAKNESSES, BUT HEPBURN'S LEGENDARY STATUS IS
INDISPUTABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Film Institute has squared accounts with Katharine
Hepburn at last.
</P>
<P>
   She's the foremost ``legend'' among movie actresses, ranked just
above Bette Davis in balloting by the AFI membership. Her ``African
Queen'' co-star, Humphrey Bogart, tops the roster of legendary men.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's results were revealed in a splashy telecast last
month hosted by Shirley Temple, one of the anointed top 25. And for
Kate of the illustrious Hepburns _ Audrey (no relation) placed
third _ the recognition is rich with irony.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, the American Film Institute has annually bestowed
its Life Achievement Award upon variably fabled performers and
other creative artists, beginning with director John Ford. This
honor is such a big deal in Hollywood that the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences plays copycat, now awarding a special
Oscar for career achievement. (This year, controversially, it went
to Elia Kazan.)
</P>
<P>
   The AFI award has illuminated most of the great stars of the
movies' Golden Age. But Katharine Hepburn's name is conspicuously
absent from the roll call of past winners.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   The AFI's Life Achievement Award is solemnized by a national
telecast in which the honoree is present, along with friends and
colleagues who testify for his or her stature. Because Katharine
Hepburn has refused to be a party to such proceedings, the AFI has
said, in effect, ``Then you can't have our award.''
</P>
<P>
   Greta Garbo was denied the award for the same reason. She still
wanted to be alone. The award is restricted to persons still
living, and Garbo was very much alive in years when stars of less
distinction than she and Hepburn were gushed over in the televised
ceremonies. Because of such obvious grievous omissions, the AFI
award certainly has been tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Today Katharine Hepburn is 92. She, Marlon Brando and Elizabeth
Taylor are the only AFI top 10 legends who are still living. She
is, therefore, still eligible for the institute's lifetime
recognition, and the AFI could do itself proud by finally honoring
Hepburn with a televised tribute minus her presence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the results of the poll have sparked lively
second-guessing in Hollywood and elsewhere. There is much squawking
because great artists of the silent screen were all but ignored.
Only Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton among the men, and Lillian
Gish and Mary Pickford among the women, made it into the top 25 in
their gender divisions. Chaplin placed 10th, which seems low for
one of his fame, stature and unargued importance in the development
of screen art.
</P>
<P>
   But the results are understandable for logical reasons. The
purpose was not to signify the greatest actors and actresses or
even the greatest stars, but those most exemplifying the meaning of
``legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Each generation creates its own legends. Sure, many stars of the
silent era were throbbing legends in their time, especially among
the men _ Rudolph Valentino, John Gilbert, Richard Barthelmess,
Harold Lloyd, Wallace Reid. But today only film scholars are
familiar with their work, and AFI membership requires no scholarly
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet movies from the rhapsodized Golden Age are perennially
available on the home screen. We still watch classic and
not-so-classic movies from the '30s, '40s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Stars certainly were more magnified in the years of the refined
studio system, but the greatest stars of that period do not
translate into the premier legends. Cary Grant, James Stewart,
Spencer Tracy and Gary Cooper all had more substantial starring
careers than Humphrey Bogart; yet Bogie, who died 42 years ago, is
a bigger star today than he was during his lifetime, definitely an
icon for younger generations.
</P>
<P>
   If the AFI had played this guessing game say, 30 years ago,
Bogart might not have been first, and Garbo surely would have
placed higher than fifth woman.
</P>
<P>
   Who's the finest actor the Golden Age produced? If it isn't
Spencer Tracy, surely it is Fredric March, but no legend attaches
to him simply because he was never categorized. March didn't make
the list, nor did Irene Dunne or Norma Shearer or Jean Arthur or
Olivia de Havilland, all of whom had measures of artistic
achievement that surpassed Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, who
are legends indeed and expectedly high on the list.
</P>
<P>
   A sure way to become a legend is to die young. Jean Harlow died
62 years ago at age 26; Carole Lombard was 33 when killed in a
plane crash 57 years ago; and James Dean, after three starring
roles, was only 24 when he died in a car crash 44 years ago. All
were prominently ranked as legends. Montgomery Clift wasn't; but if
the auto accident that almost killed him at age 34 had done so, he
would today be a legend equal to or even surpassing Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Bette Davis was the pre-eminent female star during the long
heyday of the studios and would be a less sullied legend today if
she had simply quit on top, as Garbo and Shearer did. Instead Davis
_ Joan Crawford, too _ descended into ghoulish claptrap.
</P>
<P>
   Not Katharine Hepburn. She rolled with the punches, acted her
age, remained discriminating in choosing her spots, eventually
bagged an unprecedented four Oscars, and apparently has ended her
career with distinction uncompromised.
</P>
<P>
   Kate may or may not be the greatest actress the screen has
produced; she's a prime contender for such recognition, and for
``greatest star'' label as well. But the foremost legend? No doubt
about it.

JURASSIC CRIME: RESEARCHERS FEAR OPEN MARKET ON DINOSAUR FOSSILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sixty-eight million years ago, Cinderella
stomped around the humid swamps and forests of Montana, her
10-foot-high shoulders knocking off tree branches as she pursued
small mammals and other four-legged snacks.
</P>
<P>
   She was a 35-foot-long Tyrannosaurus rex, the king of the
dinosaurs well known to ``Jurassic Park'' fans. In her day she was
Earth's leanest, meanest and hungriest fighting machine.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays her scant remains, and those of her fellow dinosaurs,
are so enormously prized that they attract high prices, at
potential risk to the low-budget science of dinosaur research.
Complete dinosaur skeletons command prices in the millions, a
temptation that encourages thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, someone sneaked into an office at the Museum of
Paleontology at the University of California at Berkeley,
surreptitiously opened a file drawer and swiped the sole proof that
Cinderella _ as Berkeley scientists have dubbed her _ had ever
lived: a 2-foot chunk of her jawbone.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it appears, the thief sold Cinderella's jawbone and
plaster copies of it.
</P>
<P>
   The recent recovery of the fossil in Europe by the FBI renewed
scientific fear that a federal proposal to open public lands to
fossil bounty hunters could create a price war, blocking
scientists' access to quality bones.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is studying possible impacts
of letting fossil hunters sell bones found on federal lands, as
advocated by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. These
fossils now must be turned over to approved repositories such as
museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us in the field of paleontology have been oblivious to
this (threat) because to us, these fossils are research items, or
are used in teaching or public education,'' said David Lindberg,
director of the Berkeley museum. ``And all of a sudden, we've
realized we're sitting on a small Fort Knox.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Sotheby's auctioned off a near-complete T. rex
skeleton for $8 million. The scientific community breathed a sigh
of relief when the investors turned it over to the Field Museum in
Chicago, but fear that future fossil-robber barons may not show
such public spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists ``were repulsed by the fact that there would be
an effort to take (away) what basically belongs to the kids of the
country,'' said Louis Jacobs, past president of the Society of
Vertebrate Paleontology, who is a professor at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to paleontology is so great that one Berkeley
paleontologist, Mark Goodwin, issued a plea to the nation's
schoolchildren _ traditional dinosaur buffs _ to mass-mail letters
to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management by a July 15 federal deadline
to protest proposed commercialization of fossil collection on
public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed commercialization pits Daschle against Max Baucus,
D-Mont., who opposes it. They both represent states that are meccas
for fossil hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look to the schoolchildren of our country, who often are
introduced to science through paleontology ...'' Goodwin said.
``Their fossil heritage is at risk if public lands are opened up to
the commercial collecting and sale of their fossil heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology launched a grass-roots
save-the-fossils campaign four years ago. The ``Save America's
Fossils for Everyone,'' or SAFE, campaign warns on its Web site
that the ``most significant threat to our vertebrate fossil
resources is the illegal collecting of specimens from federal
lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is increasing pressure from commercial interests and
fossil dealers to `open up' public lands to commercial collecting
and selling of vertebrate fossils,'' says a posting on SAFE's Web
site (www.museum.state.il.us/svp/ safe/mission.htm.)
</P>
<P>
   The society is a leading U.S. organization for bone-hunters and
researchers. Like the paleontologists portrayed by Sam Neill and
Laura Dern in the 1993 film ``Jurassic Park,'' they spend long, hot
summers slowly, carefully unearthing the bones of the creatures
that dominated the planet eons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Three million years after Cinderella's heyday, and thousands of
miles away from her Montana homeland, a mountainous asteroid fell
from space and punched a massive hole in the ground in Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a massive cloud filled the atmosphere that cooled
the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Although not all scientists agree, some researchers believe the
climate change wiped out the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever iced the dinosaurs, their fossils are the sole
surviving clues to their lifestyles.

IF I WERE THE EDITOR . . . 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `I'm not the editor,'' I was explaining to the questioner in the
audience, ``so . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you were the editor,'' he persisted, ``what would you
do?''
</P>
<P>
   If I were the editor . . .
</P>
<P>
   Well. If by some wholly unforseeable concatenation of
circumstances I became the editor of a newspaper _ not necessarily
(itals)this(unitals) paper, you understand _ the first thing I
would do is make corrections much more conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing errors should be a matter of pride, not embarrassment,
for people in the news business. They deal in a perishable
commodity and have to turn it around on very tight deadlines; of
course they make mistakes. If I were an editor, the paper would
highlight its commitment to accuracy every day by giving
corrections the same prominence as the errors they are meant to
repair. And whenever possible, corrections would appear where the
error appeared: Sports mistakes would be fixed in the sports
section, business mistakes in the business section _ and mistakes
in op-ed columns would be corrected on the op-ed page.
</P>
<P>
   If I were running the paper, reporters would report the news.
Period. They wouldn't provide ``news analysis'' or commentary _
that would be done by analysts and commentators, who would not hold
themselves out as reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The lines would not be blurred: It would be the job of reporters
to tell readers what happened, not what the news means or what
their personal opinion of it might be. News analysts would be
chosen for their expertise _ military developments might be
analyzed by a retired general, for example, or Wall Street's
gyrations by a stock-market scholar. The venting of opinions would
be restricted to editorial writers and columnists, and not just in
the paper, either. There would be a standing rule in my newsroom:
Reporters would not be permitted to jeopardize their reputation for
objectivity by going on TV to pontificate.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of TV: I would cut way back on the amount of newsprint
devoted to reviewing television shows. TV is the enemy of
newspapers, and I feel no obligation to provide publicity for my
enemy. Once upon a time in America, everybody read the paper; in
some cities, readers could choose from four or five dailies, most
of which put out new editions every few hours. Then came
television, and newspapers began their long decline. No TV show
urges couch spuds to turn off the tube and go read a paper. Yet
newspapers are forever coaxing readers to check out the latest
sitcom or HBO special. Here's one editor who won't play that game.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what burning need do TV critics fill? A review can be
indispensable in helping to judge whether a play or movie is worth
the price of admission. But the price of admission to ``Friends''
or ``Mystery!'' is nil. Viewers have no trouble deciding for
themselves which shows they like and which they are happy to miss.
A few hundred harsh words from a theater critic can close a play.
But what impact has a newspaper review ever had on the fate of a TV
series?
</P>
<P>
   If I were the editor, word abuse would be a felony. The use of
impact as a verb would be banned on grounds of ugliness. The
alleged word proactive would be replaced in all circumstances with
active, which is what it means. Diverse would no longer be used as
a synonym for multiracial. And great caution would be taken with
the loaded word reform _ a bill's proponents may hail it as
``education reform'' or ``campaign finance reform;'' reporters and
headline writers may not.
</P>
<P>
   In the right hands, an obituary can be great journalism _
stylish, informative, memorable, compelling. It is a great pity
that American journalists tend to disdain obituary-writing as grunt
work. Our British brethren know better. Here is how the Times of
London began last Friday's sendoff of Viscount Whitelaw:
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Whitelaw was one of the most influential British
politicians of his day. He was also a quintessential Conservative.
Large, ebullient, amiably noisy, and sometimes marvellously
confused in his use of the English language (he once warned against
the dangers of prejudging `the past'), he made friends and disarmed
enemies with remarkable ease. His highly idiosyncratic comments on
life and politics . . . were widely savoured _ none more so than
his celebrated complaint in 1974 that the Labour Party was `going
around the country stirring up apathy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Marvelous! Give me a paper to run and I'll make the obit desk
one of the newsroom's prestige posts.
</P>
<P>
   Something else I'll do: Require stories about opinion polls to
quote the relevant questions. How a poll query is framed can make a
huge difference in the results. A question about ``affirmative
action'' will generate one set of numbers; a question about
``racial preferences'' will generate a very different set. Readers
should be able to glance at a sidebar and learn exactly what was
asked.
</P>
<P>
   I could go on, but this column can't. So one last answer for the
fellow in the audience: If I were editor, job applications from
aspiring reporters with journalism degrees would go to the bottom
of the pile. Journalism isn't a body of knowledge to be learned
from textbooks and lectures. I'd want reporters who made use of
their college years to study something substantial _ history,
anthropology, art, physics. What sets good journalists apart is not
courses in ``Feature Writing'' and ``Enterprise Reporting.'' It is
curiosity, energy, and mental discipline. Got those on your resume?
When I become editor, let's talk.

 &HT;    IRS DROPS 1987 TAX CLAIM AGAINST COX FAMILY MEMBERS
 &HT;    330&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By WILLIAM RINGLE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internal Revenue Service has dropped claims
that Anne Cox Chambers, Barbara Cox Anthony and Garner Anthony owe
additional income taxes for 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chambers, of Atlanta, is chairman of Atlanta Newspapers.
Her sister, Mrs. Anthony, who lives in Honolulu, is chairman of
Dayton Newspapers. Both are members of the board of directors of
Cox Enterprises Inc. (CEI), one of the nation's largest media
companies. Garner Anthony, Mrs. Anthony's husband, is the retired
chairman of CEI.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS conclusion was ratified June 18 in decisions by U.S. Tax
Court Chief Judge Mary Ann Cohen. She acted after lawyers for the
IRS and the taxpayers stipulated that no deficiencies existed.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, the Tax Court was asked in a petition to find the
IRS wrong in claiming that Mrs. Chambers and the Anthonys each owed
$4 million, besides $2.4 million that each already had paid.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS had said that Mrs. Chambers and the Anthonys each had
received $10,407,290 that it construed as taxable distributions
from trusts known as Atlanta Trust I and Atlanta Trust II. The
trusts had been created by the sisters' father, James M. Cox, who
died in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The trusts received the payments from CEI for the purchase of
CEI stock, and each trust distributed the proceeds among secondary
beneficiaries of a type known as ``remainder beneficiaries.'' Each
remainder beneficiary got 3.06 percent of his or her interest in
the trust.
</P>
<P>
   Each remainder beneficiary reported a capital gain from the sale
of that portion, the sisters had said. And each remainder
beneficiary ``incurred substantial income tax liability as a result
of his or her sale,'' they added.
</P>
<P>
   As for themselves, both Mrs. Chambers and Mrs. Anthony had
insisted they weren't entitled to, and didn't receive, ``directly
or indirectly'' any part of the CEI payment ``or any other economic
benefits as a result of these transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the IRS settled, Bernard J. Long, Jr., of Dow, Lohnes
&AMP; Albertson of Washington, who represented the taxpayers, said the
IRS simply realized it had been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the agency would have made erroneous demands of such
size, Long replied, ``I can't speculate on what goes through a
revenue agent's mind. But when it got to a higher level, to the
attorney who had to try it, they realized they didn't have a
case.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome appears to support that. However, neither Judge
Cohen's one-sentence decisions, nor the two-sentence stipulations
by the lawyers, spelled out the IRS's reasons for dropping the
cases. The agency rarely describes publicly why it backs off a
case.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bona fide business reasons'' for the sale, the sisters had
said in their petitions, were ``for CEI to repurchase shares of its
stock at a favorable price'' and ``for the remainder beneficiaries
to turn a valuable property right into cash for their present
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the stock was not traded on the open market, its fair
market value had been determined by ``independent appraisers,'' the
petitions said.

STAYING WIRED AWAY FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, July 11.)  
 (HLW)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an instant, global messaging and information service, the
Internet is particularly beguiling to travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Send a postcard home from abroad, and the card will probably
arrive back in the States a week or two after the sender does. Snap
a picture with a digital camera, attach it to an electronic mail
message, and send it home as a digital postcard in a matter of
seconds. By tapping into the World Wide Web, the traveler can get
detailed weather information, airplane and train timetables, news
and sports scores from back home, and even language translation
services.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, how does one get access to the Internet away
from home?
</P>
<P>
   There are many alternatives, depending on one's budget,
willingness to carry electronic gear, and tolerance for messing
with wires and software. Foreign travel presents special challenges
to Internet users, because of the wide variations in telephone
services they are likely to encounter.
</P>
<P>
   In general, telecommunications infrastructures outside the
United States are not always as easy, cheap and reliable as they
are here. Phone systems in Europe and Asian rim countries are
generally more reliable than less developed areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some veteran travelers who absolutely must have access to e-mail
from abroad often carry an assortment of exotic telephone adapters,
Mickey Mouse-eared acoustic coupler modems that fit over a
telephone handset, alligator clips, extra cords and wires, and
software manuals. They also contact their Internet service
providers to obtain technical assistance telephone numbers that can
be used in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to test connections before leaving home. There
are few things more frustrating than spending vacation time trying
to troubleshoot balky software or go searching for needed equipment
in a strange place.
</P>
<P>
   Wise travelers start testing their strategies a week or more
before departure, tracking down local access or toll-free
connection numbers, setting up special e-mail accounts, contacting
hotels to find out about their Internet and phone connections,
applying for telephone calling cards, configuring connection
software, and in some cases dialing in to foreign access numbers to
make sure there are no incompatibilities.
</P>
<P>
   CHOOSING A SERVICE PROVIDER
</P>
<P>
   People who travel frequently must choose their Internet service
provider (ISP) carefully, looking for a service that either has
lots of local access numbers (known as points of presence, or
POP's) or a toll-free 800-number service for connections without
long-distance fees. For those who already have access to the
Internet but are shopping for a new ISP, the best place to start is
www.thelist.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are several thousand Internet service providers in the
United States and Canada, ranging from giant services with hundreds
of local dial-in numbers around the world (most of them in the
United States, of course), to small, local providers with a single
dial-in number.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is the world's biggest ISP. Most of its 16
million subscribers have their systems set up to dial a local
access number in their hometowns. But AOL makes it particularly
easy to find local access numbers when traveling, thus avoiding
long-distance charges, either by typing the keyword Access, or by
clicking on Access Numbers on the sign-up screen.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the bigger the ISP, the more POP's it has, and the
more POP's, the easier it is to bypass long-distance charges by
finding a local access number. Caution is warranted even if there
are nearby local access numbers, however. Tales abound of travelers
dialing into a local access number that may be just a few miles
away, but incurring withering long-distance phone charges.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink (www.earthlink.net) has more than 2,700 local access
numbers in North America, for example, and a few dozen overseas.
Compuserve (www.compuserve.com), now a division of America Online,
has the most extensive network of international POP's, with access
numbers in such exotic places as Ouagadougou and Pointe-a-Pitre
(sadly, the access number in Uzbekistan no longer works). But
surcharges are usually added.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not want to bother looking up a local access
number in each new town, or whose nearest local number is still a
toll call away, several of the major service providers offer 800
access. If the traveler is going to spend time away from major
cities, it often makes sense to pay an extra $6 an hour to AT&AMP;T
Worldnet (10 cents a minute) for 800-number access to the network.
Earthlink charges $24.95 a month for five hours of toll-free access
from anywhere in the United States, plus $4.95 for additional
hours.
</P>
<P>
   AOL offers access to its system via a toll-free number, (800)
716-0023, for callers anywhere in the United States, Puerto Rico or
the United States Virgin Islands. The surcharge is 10 cents a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL OPTIONS ON THE ROAD
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to keep in e-mail contact while traveling is
through Net mail, also called Web mail, which is Internet e-mail
that can be sent and received through virtually any computer
connected to the Internet and equipped with Web-browsing software
(Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator are the two
most popular browsing programs). Browser-based Net mail is not as
fancy as specialized e-mail software, but it is vastly more
convenient, especially for travelers. It is also popular among
people who do not own their own computers, because they can gain
access to their personal mail from computers at work, from
cybercafes or libraries, or from a friend's computer.

   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the IRS settled, Bernard J. Long, Jr., of Dow, Lohnes
&AMP; Albertson of Washington, who represented the taxpayers, said the
IRS simply realized it had been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the agency would have made erroneous demands of such
size, Long replied, ``I can't speculate on what goes through a
revenue agent's mind. But when it got to a higher level, to the
attorney who had to try it, they realized they didn't have a
case.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome appears to support that. However, neither Judge
Cohen's one-sentence decisions, nor the two-sentence stipulations
by the lawyers, spelled out the IRS's reasons for dropping the
cases. The agency rarely describes publicly why it backs off a
case.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bona fide business reasons'' for the sale, the sisters had
said in their petitions, were ``for CEI to repurchase shares of its
stock at a favorable price'' and ``for the remainder beneficiaries
to turn a valuable property right into cash for their present
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the stock was not traded on the open market, its fair
market value had been determined by ``independent appraisers,'' the
petitions said.

UNDATED: friend's computer. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the larger service providers allow their customers to
send and receive e-mail from any computer in the world that has Web
access. An AT&AMP;T Worldnet subscriber who is traveling without a
computer, for example, can check his or her AT&AMP;T e-mail from a
cybercafe or a friend's Net-connected computer anywhere in the
world by logging on to http://netmail.att.net. America Online
offers Net mail access. Check with your ISP before leaving home,
because some services require you to register for Web mail in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   An even more intriguing option is one of the free Web-based
e-mail services, like Hotmail, Yahoo or Rocketmail. The largest
free Web-based e-mail provider is the Microsoft Corporation's
Hotmail (www.hotmail.com), which places advertising banners on the
screen. If the user already has a standard Internet mail account,
most of the free e-mail services can be configured to receive and
send mail through that primary account, but some corporate e-mail
systems do not allow it. Be sure to check in advance. Otherwise,
one can simply set up a separate e-mail address and notify friends
and family of the new temporary address.
</P>
<P>
   The lightest full-featured laptop computers today weigh at least
three pounds, and by the time the traveler packs in a power
adapter, diskette drive, CD-ROM drive and other accessories, the
idea of traveling light and visiting a cybercafe sounds more
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Cybercafes, or Internet cafes, as they are often known, are
coffee houses that sell Internet access along with cappuccino.
There are more than 1,500 of them in dozens of countries around the
world, and the most extensive lists of them I've found are on the
Web at www.cybercaptive.com and www.netcafes.com. (Cybercafes tend
to pop up and go out of business without notice, so it's a good
idea to verify that they are operating just before heading off on a
trip.)
</P>
<P>
   A cybercafe typically has a high-speed connection to the
Internet and charges the equivalent of $5 or so per half hour of
Net access. In Paris, the typical fee is one franc per minute; in
Barcelona, 500 pesetas per half hour, and so on. Compared with the
hassle of connecting one's own computer to the Net through a hotel
switchboard, not to mention the hotel's long-distance phone
surcharges and the slower connection speeds, cybercafes are a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Similar public-access Internet kiosks are beginning to
proliferate in airports, hotels and other places frequented by
travelers. It is pay-as-you-go Internet and World Wide Web access,
and for those who do not mind checking mail only periodically, it
eliminates the need to carry a portable PC.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some hotels are making life easier for
computer-toting guests, including, in better hotels, the
installation of high-speed Net hookups in guest rooms. Call or fax
ahead to find out what Internet-related options there are. One
hazard is that some hotels have digital phone systems, which
operate at a higher current and can fry a standard PC modem. Be
sure to ask ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Another tip: The folks at the hotel's front desk are not always
Internet wizards. If you have a question about network access, ask
to speak with the hotel's telephone operator or, better yet, to the
person who manages the hotel's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   GOING THE WIRELESS ROUTE
</P>
<P>
   Wireless radio and cellular modems are increasingly popular for
people who want to connect a portable PC to the Internet from a car
or other location where hooking up to a phone line is impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who have a cellular phone can, depending on the phone
model, equip it with a cellular modem that attaches to a PC,
enabling access to the Internet wherever a cell phone works.
American cell phones are generally not compatible with the GSM cell
phone standard used in Europe and the rest of the world, however.
As with any cell phone call, connections to the Web via cell phone
can be erratic, and the cost of adding a cellular modem and
adapters can easily reach several hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Radio-based modems have some advantages over cellular modem
connections, but they also typically cost several hundred dollars
and require monthly access fees of $30 to $50 or more depending on
services. The radio modems are about the size of a paperback book,
weigh about a pound and attach to a portable computer much like a
traditional external modem.
</P>
<P>
   Connection speeds are usually very slow, but adequate for e-mail
and simple Web browsing. Newer wireless modems now being tested
offer higher speeds. One of the &QC; leading wireless modem companies,
Metricom (www.metricom.com) recently began offering service &QC; in
parts of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Computing division of the 3Com Corp. recently
introduced the Palm VII wireless hand-held computer, a $600
shirt-pocket device that not only keeps an address book, calendar
and helpful traveler's software but also allows the user to send
and receive e-mail and receive news headlines and stock quotes from
the Web. The Palm VII is currently sold only in the New York City
area, but it works in most major American cities already. 3Com said
it will sell Palm VII nationwide in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly use fees are based on the amount of data transferred.
The basic service fee is $9.95 a month for 50 kilobytes of data (a
very brief message is usually a kilobyte or less). Each kilobyte
over the monthly limit costs 30 cents, which can add up quickly for
even moderate e-mail or Web users.
</P>
<P>
   HELP FROM SATELLITE DEVICES
</P>
<P>
   For those who roam to the most remote parts of Earth, or who
spend a lot of time on boats too far from shore for a cell phone
call, an effective but much more expensive solution is a
satellite-based communicator. We are still many years away from
easy, cheap global satellite data services, but some of the richest
investors in the computer and telecommunications industries are
spending billions of dollars to capture and develop the market.
</P>
<P>
   Some cruise ships are already making satellite-based e-mail
available to guests, but at a fairly steep cost (dollars per
message sent or received).
</P>
<P>
   The Magellan Corp. of Sunnyvale, Calif., has a $999 hand-held
device called the GSC 100 that combines simple two-way messaging
with a Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation system. The user
can send an e-mail message: ``Help! Bear has me in tree in Glacier
Park!'' and, thanks to GPS, the message will include the sender's
precise physical coordinates.
</P>
<P>
   The message is beamed to a low-earth-orbit satellite, which
relays it back down to a ground station, which in turn sends it via
the Internet. But at an annual service fee of $360, plus Magellan's
transmission fee of one cent per alphanumeric character sent or
received, this is not a practical choice for casual travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, the futurists assure us, the Internet will be
ubiquitous and universal, available from public terminals and
small, personal communicators that we carry in our pockets. Until
then, staying wired on a vacation requires some planning and
determination. Confronted with all the choices and potential
technical complexity, some travelers may decide the wisest plan is
simply to take a vacation from technology.

NEWSROOM SCANDALS MAKE LOUSY TV 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new TV show is in the works that will reveal, more or less,
what really goes on in America's newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The show, tentatively titled ``Resume Real,'' is the brainchild,
if that is the word, of a former ``Hard Copy'' producer and will
feature a panel of ``experts'' who critique and make fun of the
media's coverage of major news stories.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Steve Langford says ``Resume Real,'' scheduled to debut
next year, will ``blow the lid'' off the so-called ``respectable''
media and prove that tabloid outlets like the National Enquirer and
``Hard Copy'' are more accurate than CNN or ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though I would never presume to second-guess a former ``Hard
Copy'' producer, I'm wondering if viewers accustomed to daily
updates on the status of Pamela Anderson's breasts will be
sufficiently entertained by stories of what goes on behind the
scenes in a typical newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   I have been in, or perilously close to, newsrooms for 25 years
and I can't think of a single incident that would ``blow the lid''
off ``respectable'' journalism unless you count the time a swarm of
love bugs shorted out the Herald-Tribune's air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   You might (or might not) question the credibility of a paper
that would be so irresponsible as to allow thousands of
slow-moving, nonbiting flies to gum up its air-conditioning system,
flies that are not only too stupid to stay out of the paths of
speeding cars but also lack the bare rudiments of family values to
the point that they wantonly engage in midair sex instead of doing
it behind closed doors in a sales-taxed motel room as God, the
Chamber of Commerce and most respectable editorial writers would
recommend.
</P>
<P>
   But I think the reaction of most people to this story,
particularly if they had tuned to get an update on Pamela
Anderson's breasts, would be one of indifference, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   While it's possible that love bugs can be sensational in some
contexts (riding a motorcycle without dental floss, for example),
for the most part they are dull, uninteresting things that live out
their brief lives anonymously and without benefit of cosmetic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``You've seen one, you've seen 'em all'' was coined
with love bugs in mind.
</P>
<P>
   So when a news show lures in viewers expecting a breast update
and gives them love bugs instead, you've got to think there's going
to be mass disappointment bordering on outrage.
</P>
<P>
   And it will only get worse once viewers realize that
love-bugs-in-the-air-conditioner is the top story of the week and
succeeding stories will be progressively less scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking stories with titles like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspaper Drops `Marvin' From Comics Page; Local Infants Howl
With Indifference''
</P>
<P>
   ``Managing Editor Leaves Leftover Turkey Tetrazzini in Newsroom
Refrigerator for Six Months; EPA Calls It `Another Chernobyl'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Publisher Comes Clean: `I've Been Buying My Newspaper At
Half-Price for Years!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-Sought Liberal Agenda Found Buried Under Columnist's Desk
Clutter a Hoax: `It Was Just a Take-Out Menu From The House of
Wong,' Grimes Admits. `They Look a Lot Alike, You Know.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to imply that ``legitimate'' newspapers don't make
plenty of bonehead mistakes and errors in judgment and write about
events in ways that are not suitable for wrapping dead fish let
alone advancing the cause of good journalism.
</P>
<P>
   And I wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from poking fun at this
goofy business because we definitely have a tendency to take
ourselves too seriously and dismiss anyone or anything that doesn't
adhere to our so-called ``standards.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether this will result in the kind of riveting television
that viewers will want to tune into week after week remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if ``Resume Real'' found a love bug that had had a
boob job, that would be a different story.

`THE PARIS PILGRIMS': FLESHING OUT HEMINGWAY   WITH LITERARY
LICENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One shudders to imagine what the literary scholars will make of
``The Paris Pilgrims,'' Clancy Carlile's novel about Hemingway and
other famous American exiles in France in the 1920s. Here we learn
at last what Hemingway and Joyce did during a long evening they
spent together, and how Hemingway, the neophyte American writer,
ended up trundling home Joyce, the passed-out author of
``Ulysses,'' in a wheelbarrow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here we learn how the sexually experimental Joyce encouraged his
partner, Nora Barnacle, to take a lover, in imitation of Molly
Bloom and Blazes Boylan in ``Ulysses.'' We learn that the
prospective lover Nora chose was none other than Hemingway,
although the latter, in the throes of one of his impotent phases,
ended up turning her down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How does the creator of ``The Paris Pilgrims'' know these
titillating things? He doesn't, of course. The author of ``Children
of the Dust'' (which became a CBS mini-series) and ``Honky-Tonk
Man'' (which was made into a movie with Clint Eastwood), among
other books, Carlile has simply drawn on material from memoirs,
biographies and fiction focused on Paris in the 1920s and mixed it
with his own teeming, sometimes nasty imagination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this way we learn what Gertrude Stein thought of the
bumptious young Hemingway, and how Alice B. Toklas, Stein's
partner, was jealous of him for being so attractive to her
mistress. We are shown how drawn Hemingway was to lesbians in
general, which is apparently why Carlile has him cutting short the
hair of Hadley Richardson, his young, worshipful wife at that
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The portrait painted of Hemingway here is not pleasant.
Dominating Carlile's story, Hemingway appears a boastful liar, a
sadistic bully, a sore loser who would go to cheating lengths to
win the many contests he baited his friends into joining, an
unreliable lover given to fits of what ``Hadley's Bryn Mawr sex
education books called `insufficient tumescence,''' a moody, weepy
self-pitying drunk and a bigot and anti-Semite and hater of male
homosexuals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True, no one else comes off as much more appealing in the
novel's huge cast of characters, which includes everyone from Ezra
Pound to Sylvia Beach to Lincoln Steffens to Picasso, Braque, Gide
and Cole Porter. Nor are these negative qualities of Hemingway's
particularly new or surprising. Yet experiencing them so vividly
makes you dislike Hemingway intensely by the novel's end, despite
Carlile's repeated assurances that Hemingway appealed to everyone
who met him in those days because of his infectious enthusiasm
about whatever happened to catch his fancy, whether it was boxing,
tennis, skiing, hiking, bullfighting, fishing, drinking or going to
war. You positively wish for the satisfying comeuppance the story
eventually slaps him with. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that we see little of his development as one of
the century's great modernists, beyond Stein's telling him to cut
back on the description in his writing (``Too much of the
newspaper's telling gets into the fiction's showing,'' she says);
or Hadley's famous loss of his manuscripts at the Gare de Lyons,
which forced him to begin over again, or his enunciation to Hadley
of what he called his ``iceberg theory'' of fiction writing, ``in
which,'' as the fictional Hadley recalls it, ``only about 10
percent of the mass of the story would be above the surface.''
Mostly Hemingway comes off as a blowhard and a creep.
</P>
<P>
   So, multiple grounds exist for objecting to ``The Paris
Pilgrims'' as a literary project. First, it invents things,
inviting ignorant or naive readers to confuse what is known with
what Carlile has made up. Second, it disparages or makes light of a
group of artists whom many regard as among the most important of
the century. Finally it overemphasizes their search for sexual
freedom to the detriment of their quest for artistic freedom. In
short, it's snotty about things that should be looked on with a
measure of awe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's fun to read about these people in the flesh, so to
speak; to see them in the framework of their everyday lives. As a
historical novel, it's really not that much different in principle
from a story made up about the Emperor Hadrian or Julius Caesar or
Queen Elizabeth I; only the relative proximity of the events to the
present day makes it seem different. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also the novel touches on a deeper if somewhat crude form of
truth. Carlile is at pains to reconcile the many actual sexual
anomalies in Hemingway's life, among them his mother's having tried
to ``pass him off as a girl'' for the first four years of his life,
as Carlile puts it, ``keeping him in dresses and long curly hair
and bonnets;'' his penchant for switching sexual roles with his
wives, and the double standard he held in his acceptance of
lesbians and his hatred of male homosexuals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Responding to some of Hemingway's more extreme behavior near the
end of ``The Paris Pilgrims,'' Robert McAlmon, his friend and
publisher, speculates that ``Hemingway might someday realize that
the qualities he found so despicable, so unacceptable and hateful
in other men, might be the very qualities he was trying to deny in
himself.'' The character McAlmon continues, ``But if Hemingway was
to escape insanity or suicide, those repressed qualities would
someday have to come out. . . .''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Carlile has imagined Hemingway's Paris years, what happened
to the rest of his life makes a brutal kind of sense. &QL;

GARDEN OF SCULPTURE AS AN UP-TO-DATE EDEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISTOIA, Italy _ Sculpture gardens bloom in many a cultured
field today. Museums consider them prestigious adjuncts, cities
invest in them as tourist attractions, philanthropists see them as
proof that art is long, life short and bronze a kind of
immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape-as-sculpture gallery was not always meant primarily
for pleasure. In its most ancient form the sculpture park was a
sacred grove or holy place with statues of gods and votive
offerings. In Japan today, sculpture gardens are still included in
temples as places for meditation, and in Europe and America old
cemeteries, sometimes attached to churches, might be called
sculpture parks, with their stone Virgins and guardian angels and
marble promises of the afterlife. The mid-19th-century rural
cemetery movement in America declared that cemeteries should be
sites of restful pleasure with inviting landscapes and uplifting
monuments.
</P>
<P>
   The Romans decided that, at least in gardens, esthetics were as
important as religion. They proceeded to collect antique sculpture,
both Egyptian and Greek; Hadrian's villa might be called the
classic example. The Renaissance took up this idea again. In the
early 16th century, Pope Julius II installed a sculpture garden in
the Vatican to display newly uncovered antiquities. But wealthy
aristocrats and merchants soon began dotting the landscapes of
their villas with contemporary sculpture; even Michelangelo carved
a garden statue early on.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy today, however, the past takes precedence, and Italians
show almost no interest in gardens planted with the work of living
artists. One rare exception is the home of Giuliano Gori, an
industrialist who has created a lovely and uncommon blend of
19th-century Romantic garden and art of the last 20 years at the
Fattoria di Celle, his villa and farm near Pistoia, in Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
   Celle is a 17th-century villa with a park laid out in the 1840s
in the English style. The English Romantic garden, which spurned
the adroitly embroidered orderliness of the typical Italian garden
as much too controlled and artificial, went to great lengths to
rearrange nature so that it still looked natural. The landscape at
Celle was turned into a stage set that masqueraded, delightfully,
as itself.
</P>
<P>
   Lakes and cliffs appeared where none had been before. Paths were
laid out that seemed to meander through woods and arrive by mere
chance at the best views. Bridges disguised as grottoes spanned
spunky little waterfalls. Charming ``follies'' sprang up in
fortuitous spots _ an aviary that once housed peacocks but now
shelters nothing but trees; a neo-Gothic teahouse with ceilings
painted bright blue and studded with stars.
</P>
<P>
   Today these are way-stations on the path to modern and
post-modern works of art. The teahouse raises its spiky pinnacles
not far from a Dennis Oppenheim ``machine'' that sprawls down a
hillside looking like the exploded diagram of a demented
scientist's mind. This enormous piece follows the contours of an
existing slope and endows it with a metallic climax; originally,
Oppenheim hoped to use its armature as a setting for fireworks. Now
it only implies celebration with its cockeyed energy, being a
machine too ambitious, erratic and complicated to work, perhaps a
wry comment on the park as an artifice for restoring the joys of
nature even as the industrial revolution began to smother them.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morris' splendid and surprising maze of
green-and-white-striped marble sits calmly in a tree-ringed
clearing, presenting what appears to be the side of a small, square
building. Its stripes refer to Gothic churches of the region; its
intellectual puzzles spring from modern life.
</P>
<P>
   The maze is open to the sky and its walls just high enough to
allow a view of the trees round about but not of the next part of
the maze, leaving the gaze free to revel in the landscape but still
restricted, the body moving and yet confined. The walls and floor
both slant precariously, and the corridors are so narrow they
repeatedly seem to be reaching a dead end, only to turn a corner to
the next narrow passageway. There are no right and wrong choices to
make, for the direction is prescribed _ until it stops, a true dead
end at last.
</P>
<P>
   This maze has neither solution nor exit, only a way in. Once
having left by that same way, the visitor climbs a wooden platform
at the side of the clearing to look down into the maze and discover
that it is not a square at all but a triangle with sharp angles.
Both perception and expectation have been controlled and fooled.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano Gori was one of the first people in the world to found
a sculpture park almost exclusively on commissioned, site-specific
works; Celle is still the only such park in Italy. Gori, who is now
in his late 60s, began collecting contemporary art while quite
young, and by the end of the 1950s the collection was so vast that
he built a space to house it in Prato, a town near Florence, where
he lived and worked.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, when the family and art moved to Celle, Gori
admired art made specifically for exhibition sites at the Venice
Biennale and Documenta in Kassel, Germany. This work was
site-specific in every way: designed for a particular space, it was
almost always made of impermanent materials and therefore could be
seen in no other place and at no other time. It occurred to Gori
that his new home, with its extensive farm buildings and over 58
acres of park and farm land, would be an ideal setting for
permanent installations.
</P>
<P>
   The villa, situated high on a hill in the little town of
Santomato outside Pistoia, might be an ideal setting for dreams. It
sits in one of the loveliest spots in Tuscany, which seldom lacks
for loveliness. The land looks out over Leonardo's hometown of
Vinci and across a valley of golden fields, clusters of tile roofs
and trees that flare up silver in the wind, a vista of that
undulating, domesticated order and shimmering charm that central
and northern Italy seems to specialize in.
</P>
<P>
   Gori convened an international advisory committee and invited
artists to make work that would embrace the land or speak to the
building spaces at Celle and then stay there forever, or whatever
part of forever is allotted to works of art. No changes to the
19th-century garden were allowed; any new artwork would have to
cohabit gracefully with what was essentially an artwork of a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen artists, including Morris and Oppenheim, inaugurated the
project in 1982. Since then the collection has grown to 36 outdoor
and 24 indoor installations, including works by Magdalena
Abakanowicz, Richard Serra, and Fabrizio Corneli. There are also
hundreds of paintings and sculptures that are not site specific.
Celle is open by appointment to people specializing in contemporary
art. Arrangements must be made by written request for appointments
from April through September. All visits are guided.
</P>
<P>
   The artists have taken ingenious measures to acknowledge and
reinforce the contours of the land. Mauro Staccioli sends a thin
concrete wall racing abruptly up a hill through trees to point at
the sky like an irresistible force materializing in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sculpture calls up the history of the region as
well. In a clearing, Alice Aycock unfolds a five-part, metallic
history of science and philosophy called ``The Nets of Solomon'' in
homage to Leonardo and Galileo: symbolic representations of an
astrolabe, a philosopher's stone, neutrino ramps, the charted
movement of a hurricane and a schematic sketch of the universe.

   Beverly Pepper carved from a hill an updated Greek amphitheater
that is at once stately and serene, with cast iron reliefs,
embedded in the sides of grass-covered berms, serving as backdrops
for the stage; music and dance are occasionally performed here. In
a pond below a series of waterfalls, Anne and Patrick Poirier, long
involved with classical art, scatter what look like fragments of a
huge, ancient statue of one of the giants who died fighting the
Greek gods _ a staring eye with an arrow in it, bronze thunderbolts
in rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Artists who want to change the landscape may alter the farmlands
that lie outside the park. Bukishi Inoue's ``My Sky Hole'' unrolls
in time and space as a visitor walks down a long pathway between
rough stone walls into a low tunnel illuminated by a couple of
tubular holes that let in the light of the sky. At the end, the
tunnel leads around two curves to a circular stair that comes up at
ground level in a glass box among olive trees.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Sonfist proposes a history of the region in a lovely piece
composed of concentric circles of local flora: a large central
planting that he calls ``the primordial forest;'' around that, a
circle of bare branches of endangered trees cast in greenish
bronze; next, a ring of indigenous thyme and laurel, brought to
Italy by the Greeks; and around that, a ring of galestro, the local
stone that retains the sun's warmth and will in time disintegrate
to become earth. In the summer, a circle of wheat is planted
beyond, and all of it is loosely ringed about by olive trees.
Inside and outside the park, the art does not simply sit
beautifully or advantageously in the landscape but also rearranges
and comments on the viewer's experience of place.
</P>
<P>
   More site-specific art is housed in the farm's old
administrative and storage buildings, where artists have been given
small rooms for individual installations and Luigi Mainolfi has
trapped a terra-cotta ``worm'' that rears up several stories
through the grain elevator, its pebbly, pale orange body glimpsed
in segments through small windows going up the stairs. In what was
once the granary two handsome wall drawings by Sol LeWitt flank a
large circle of stones by Richard Long. Long also cut a circle in
the grass outside, a correspondence that can be seen only in
memory, as if the artist wanted to develop a history lasting no
more than the length of a visit to Celle, rather than the century
and a half between the park's design and the art that animates it
today, the long years between antiquity and Renaissance and now.
</P>
<P>
   Celle is a trip into the present with frequent pauses for
conversation with the past. A mere 10 minutes by car from its metal
abstractions, stony conundrums and smiling vistas, the
green-and-white striped facade of the cathedral of Pisa reminds a
traveler that art and history in Italy have living faces and very
deep pockets. &QL;

KOSOVO MUSLIM DAMNED IF SHE WAS OR WASN'T RAPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, July 13)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the many horror stories coming out of Kosovo this one about
an alleged rape of an Albanian woman by Serb forces was even more
dismaying than the usual.
</P>
<P>
   The young wife had been taken from her village home by Serb men
to be interrogated at the police station. She was beaten, but she
wasn't raped, she told her husband. He said he didn't believe her
and has since scorned her. ``I feel very cold toward her,'' he told
a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   This is a couple whose home was looted and who lost everything
in this crazy, awful war. In another place they might be holding
onto each other and sobbing with gratitude to be alive. But his
fear and suspicion left each of them with nothing but more misery.
</P>
<P>
   The shame of rape is so potent in their Muslim village that even
her denial taints her. The reporter pointed out that the man had
limited education and was not typical of all Albanian men. But in
the small villages, traditional attitudes toward women go as
untested as ethnic prejudice. The man believes his wife didn't dare
tell him what happened because he would have to divorce her if she
was raped. She's damned if she lied or told the truth.
</P>
<P>
   You read a story like that and you want to do something for that
poor woman. Even though American women still think twice about
reporting a rape, the injustice against this Albanian woman seems
incredibly heartless. She is punished for a crime that didn't occur
and which, even if it did, was not her crime. You may even start to
imagine, as a group of us did one night, how to save this woman.
</P>
<P>
   Could we adopt her in some way? Bring her, somehow, to
California and have her live with one of us. Help her to heal.
Teach her what we know about rape. Tell her that her husband is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just her husband. It's his father and brother and
likely his mother and the wife's family, too. Virginity and
fidelity in women are sacrosanct in Albania. There are unbending
rules for women even in a war which breaks all rules.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers are equally frustrated. They say the social
stigma of rape is the biggest problem they have in trying to help
investigators prove what seems obvious now, that rape is a war
crime, premeditated and carried out systematically to destroy a
people by savaging its women. Those who have broken the silence
tell of vicious attacks, torture, repeated assaults, soldiers
gleefully singling out virgins, men forcing families to watch their
wives, mothers and daughters being raped.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you will discover a smidgen of hope. Included in the
horrible accounts will be a small observation that one man in the
group held back, one soldier cried when he saw what the others were
doing to the women because, he said, he had sisters.
</P>
<P>
   But now revenge rapes are happening. A Serb mother tells how
armed Albanian men raped her mentally ill daughter and then stabbed
her to death. The attackers made the mother watch. This way they
could kill the mother too.
</P>
<P>
   What do we do with these stories? What will happen to these
women? Who will comfort them? Do they matter against the immediate
need to rebuild towns, put roads and bridges back together, find
food?
</P>
<P>
   We can send them courage and caring in our prayers. But what
else?
</P>
<P>
   Is there a place to send money to take away a woman's shame,
educate her husband, make a community see that shunning an injured
woman makes them as merciless as their enemy?
</P>
<P>
   Do we get to butt in? Where is the petition that says that we,
the undersigned, protest the further punishing of war victims by
their loved ones?
</P>
<P>
   How is it that a bullet wound or a missing limb suffered in
battle is a badge of honor but rape is a reproach? What would
happen if soldiers limped home and wives and mothers looked with
contempt at their shattered bodies and said they felt cold toward
them?

PIANISTS IN HIGH-WIRE ACTS: PRESSURE TO PLAY FROM MEMORY, BUT
WHY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you want to know utter fear? Just ask a pianist what it is
like to have a memory lapse.
</P>
<P>
   There you are, onstage, on the spot, in the middle of piece you
have practiced for months or even played for years. All seems to be
going well. Then something happens to distract you momentarily.
Maybe your new concert shoes feel slippery on the brass pedals. Or
you can't shake the annoyance you feel for bungling a tricky
lefthand passage that you can play perfectly well.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly you are a phrase or so ahead of where you think you are
in the piece. Your fingers feel like little automatons with minds
of their own. You tell yourself: ``Think, think!'' You lean in
closer, stare into the keys, but see only the black hole in your
head that is sucking up the notes. You stumble, you try to skip
forward or backward, but it's no use. Total meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Most experienced concert pianists learn to get out of such jams
before catastrophe strikes, sometimes so deftly that the audience
doesn't even notice. Still, there have been some great pianists,
like William Masselos and Leonard Shure, who never achieved their
full potential on the concert stage because they found memorization
onerous yet could not buck the protocol dictating that piano
recitals be played from memory. For students who have difficulty
with memorization, the pressure can be paralyzing.
</P>
<P>
   So why does the protocol continue? It is enforced by
convention-bound teachers, a public enthralled with the
high-wire-act aspect of concerts, and critics who falsely assume
that a piece not memorized is a piece not thoroughly learned. And
it is time to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many musicians, especially pianists, have no trouble
with memorization and clearly find it freeing, and many honorable
teachers believe that the valuable discipline of memorizing can be
learned. But even musicians who find memorization intimidating feel
compelled to follow the protocol, which can seem terribly
arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   All solo piano recitals are expected to be performed from
memory, though exceptions are made for contemporary works. Chamber
music is never to be played from memory (presumably because
ensemble musicians need their individual parts to know where they
fit into the whole, though if the musicians have not figured this
out during rehearsals, then the piece is not ready). An
instrumentalist in a recital with a pianist is encouraged to play
from memory but can get away with playing from the music because a
duo is technically considered chamber music. But an instrumentalist
who plays a concerto with an orchestra is expected to shun the
comfort of a score to enhance the David-and-Goliath drama of the
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   None of these confusing rules take into account the essential
point: there are different kinds of talents. Some musicians have an
instinctive ability to communicate; others have a gift for total
recall. These are not mutually exclusive talents. But shouldn't
musicians who struggle with memory be encouraged to do whatever
enables them to be their best?
</P>
<P>
   The protocol is deeply entrenched, as was clear in June when the
Van Cliburn Foundation sponsored its first International
Competition for Outstanding Amateur Pianists. Sevan Melikyan, a
spokesman, said recently that the decision to allow contestants to
play from scores, a seemingly reasonable concession to amateurs,
provoked intense internal debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the same piece was performed at the same level by two
pianists, one not using the music,'' Melikyan explained, ``wouldn't
the jury naturally give preference to the one playing from memory?
The issue was discussed but never completely resolved.'' In the
high-profile professional Cliburn Competition the contestants are
required to play from memory, Melikyan added, ``in accord with the
practice in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this practice flies in the face of history. Until
well into the 19th century, music was either written out or
improvised. Written-out music was always played from scores;
improvised music, obviously, was not. To Mozart and Beethoven, the
idea that anyone would even think of playing one of their piano
works from memory would have been preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Clara Schumann was apparently the first pianist to do so
prominently. In 1837, at 18, she performed Beethoven's
``Appassionata'' in Berlin ``by heart,'' as affronted critics put
it. For this she was labeled ``insufferable.'' Bettina von Arnim,
who had been Beethoven's close friend, commented, ``With what
pretension she seats herself as the piano and plays without the
notes!''
</P>
<P>
   Then the charismatic Franz Liszt came along and changed the
public's perception. During a 10-week period in 1841-42, Liszt gave
21 solo recitals in Berlin, performing more than 80 different
works, 50 of them from memory. What was deemed uppity when done by
a woman was now found stunning and superhuman.
</P>
<P>
   The mystique took hold, and pianists since have tried to sustain
it. Not quite all. Some brave souls bucked convention, including
the distinguished Dame Myra Hess and Sviatoslav Richter, who played
mostly from music during the last 20 or so years of his life with
no diminution of his genius.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Peter Serkin has been challenging the protocol
with encouraging success. No one can say that Serkin has a problem
with memorization. On a concert tour in the early 1970's he played
Messiaen's monumental solo work ``Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant
Jesus,'' two-plus hours of staggeringly difficult music, from
memory. Today he still often memorizes complex contemporary pieces
as well as the formidable sonatas and concertos of the standard
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   But when he chooses to, he will play a work from the score, and
his choices can be surprising: a Bach partita, a Chopin nocturne.
As a prelude to a concert during the recent Stravinsky Festival of
the San Francisco Symphony, Serkin offered three solo works
(Stravinsky's Serenade, Sonata and ``Piano-Rag Music''), then
played the composer's Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra during the
main concert. For each work he played with a page turner at his
side. His performances were insightful and brilliant, and no review
I read even mentioned his use of the scores.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just enjoyable to have the entire score to the Stravinsky
Capriccio to follow as I play it,'' he said recently. ``I try to
de-emphasize the whole performance aspect of a musical
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Memory is a strange thing,'' he added. ``It can happen by
itself; it does not have to be the result of an arduous process of
study. But many people do it to make a big point, or out of some
kind of vanity. It's become orthodoxy, which is unhealthy and
restrictive.''
</P>
<P>
   The pianist Gilbert Kalish has long played everything, including
solo repertory, from scores. Early into his career he was drawn
heavily into chamber music and contemporary music, which, by
custom, is always performed this way. So he got into the habit with
solo repertory as well. He feels that he would not be able to learn
and perform the range and amount of music, especially new music,
that he plays each season if he had not given up trying to
memorize.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kalish strongly encouraged those students who
memorize music comfortably to do so. Playing from scores is clearly
more cumbersome. But in an interview with me some years ago, Kalish
spoke eloquently about the unnecessary pressure young musicians
endure in forcing themselves to memorize:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we practice for? The idea of practicing over and over
to nail a passage with such security that there's no possibility of
its escaping from you just doesn't make sense. Many students
practice so much like this that they just switch on the machine
when they play. They are not more absorbed in the music; they are
more removed from it. It's a frighteningly negative and lonely
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s Kalish was able to turn his conviction into policy
at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where he is a
professor. He persuaded the piano faculty to allow students to play
in their recitals using the scores for any works they chose to.
</P>
<P>
   At most other conservatories and colleges, playing from memory
in recitals is either a specific requirement, as it is at the
Eastman School of Music in Rochester (though exceptions are made
for ``avant-garde'' works), or an unspoken necessity. Sometimes the
rules are amusingly specific. At Juilliard, for example, violinists
must play all recital pieces from memory except for contemporary
works composed after 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the protocol was challenged from the opposite
direction when the Jacques Thibaud String Trio, three young
musicians who met at the Berlin School of Art, gave an impressive
concert at the Frick Collection in New York, playing demanding
trios of Beethoven, Dohnanyi and Schoenberg from memory. There is
some precedent for chamber groups' playing from memory: the famous
Kolish String Quartet, which gave premieres of works by Schoenberg
and Bartok, played all standard repertory from memory. The Thibaud
String Trio did not appear to be showing off. The performances were
spontaneous and commanding.
</P>
<P>
   That said, if these enthusiastic young musicians become known
for playing from memory, will they feel trapped into always doing
so? In any case, their decision to forswear scores still helps to
undermine the existing protocols. Force is the issue: pianists are
compelled to play from memory, and chamber music ensembles are
compelled not to.
</P>
<P>
   Singers in recital have a double challenge when it comes to
memory: notes plus words. Still, most singers wisely try to sing
from memory. A song recital is, in effect, a dramatic recitation,
and it is hard for an audience to get involved in a drama when a
singer's eyes are buried in a score. That said, as a critic I would
be reluctant to fault a singer simply for using music if the
performance seemed otherwise communicative.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Kalish's question is paramount: What do musicians
practice for? Think of all the pianists, especially students, who
resist playing something challenging out of fear of memorizing it.
Think of how much time a young pianist must devote to memorizing an
easily playable slow movement of a Mozart sonata. With those hours
that same pianist could be rehearsing chamber music, working with a
composer on a new piece, playing through the piano-vocal score of a
Mozart opera or engaging in any number of enriching activities that
would inform the pianist's performance of the sonata, which was
never intended to be played from memory in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   A pianist alone onstage, taking on the Bach ``Goldberg''
Variations or the Copland Piano Fantasy. It's an alluring mystique.
But maybe it's a mystique we can finally afford to lose.

NEW YORK CITY BALLET'S 50TH YEAR DRAWS TO A CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, July 11)  
 (HLW)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since it ain't over till it's over, it may be
premature to declare the New York City Ballet's 50th anniversary
year at an end. The celebration continues through July 24 at the
company's summer home, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in
upstate New York. Nonetheless, the sum went beyond the parts in the
recent City Ballet season at the New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   New contexts were provided, fresh connections among familiar
works were made, artistic lineage received its due and creativity
busted out not all over, but in the right places. Taking the long
view since a mammoth alumni party inaugurated the festivities in
November, one can easily say that the highlights were reserved for
the spring season.
</P>
<P>
   The novelties included the company's first full-length ``Swan
Lake,'' a blockbuster staging by Peter Martins, whose formal style
was guaranteed to stir debate, and the premieres, all
crowd-pleasers: Christopher Wheeldon's ``Scenes de Ballet,''
Martins' ``Them Twos',' to Wynton Marsalis' commissioned score, and
``Duke!'' an Ellington tribute choreographed by Robert La Fosse,
Garth Fagan and Susan Stroman.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it was how the repertory (100 ballets, including
revivals, since the fall) was redistributed in theme segments that
said something about where the company is and was. As artistic
director, Martins had a stroke of genius when he offered a
comparative showcase of four very different ballets to Charles
Ives' music in connection with a stunning revival of George
Balanchine's 1954 ``Ivesiana.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a mini-American Music Festival, following up on the
winter season's tributes to composers from one country or as
tributes to single composers. The second semester, so to speak,
placed the emphasis on Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky, the two
composers closest to Balanchine. It was no surprise that most of
the works in these two mini-festivals were Balanchine's. It was
also clear how directly Balanchine pushed his disciples to use
these composers.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine's ``Scherzo a la Russe'' still looked like a trifle
in a revival, but it distilled the approach that Martins has
followed in his own Stravinsky ballets: choreography as a parallel
dimension that reflects and expands upon the composer's structure
and rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Robbins saw dance as being about relationships.
This was true even in the revival of ``Andantino,'' from the
company's 1981 Tchaikovsky festival, a modest duet that did not
need to look so modest.
</P>
<P>
   The other duet that was revived after a long absence, Lew
Christensen's ``Four Norwegian Moods,'' was so superbly danced by
Janie Taylor and Benjamin Millepied that it deserves special
mention. Christensen was the star of the American Ballet, the first
Balanchine-Lincoln Kirstein troupe founded in 1934. ``Four
Norwegian Moods'' is named after the orchestral score Stravinsky
wrote in 1942 in tribute to Nazi-occupied Norway. Christensen
originally created the duet in 1976 for the San Francisco Ballet,
where he was the artistic director. When it was transferred to City
Ballet's 1982 Stravinsky Festival, it was made little impression.
</P>
<P>
   It is still a minor exercise in neo-classicism, but Ms. Taylor
and Millepied give its young-love aura a freshness that goes beyond
charm. Stravinsky's martial beginning evokes the Nazi invasion of
Norway; the stage is bare at this point until the dancers enter,
their skips and leaps subsiding into a gentle passage with Ms.
Taylor rolling her head on her partner's extended arm. Each dancer
has a solo that uses conventional steps, and Ms. Taylor flexes her
feet. The joyful image of two young people holding hands in a jete
is dispelled by their exit in opposite directions, a parting that
evokes the uncertainty of the music's wartime pretext.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor's brand of innocence has a sharp edge and the energy
that both dancers channeled into their purity gave ``Four Norwegian
Moods'' a Balanchinian backbone that made it look better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky aside, the American Music segment
(three weeks) emphasized the shift toward more American composers
that has occurred under Martins' leadership since Balanchine died
in 1983. It was also clear how often Robbins and Balanchine used
American music.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine familiarized the American public with Ives and Louis
Moreau Gottschalk (``Tarantella''). But as three of his most
ingenious ballets showed again, the esoteric was balanced by his
pull toward a popular culture that he transformed into high art.
Thanks to Hershy Kay's brilliant arrangement of cowpoke tunes in
``Western Symphony'' and of Sousa marches in ``Stars and Stripes,''
folk images were absorbed into the academic idiom of Balanchine's
neo-classical style. The same process could be seen in ``Who
Cares?'' with Balanchine turning to Gershwin's Broadway songs.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who had used Gershwin's symphonic pieces, was
represented by major American composers in their jazz-tinctured
mood (Leonard Bernstein and Morton Gould) as well as Philip Glass
and Ives. Martins' choices have been very different. He has
concentrated new work from leading composers like John Adams,
Charles Wuorinen and Marsalis, whose music for ``Them Twos,'' not
strictly a jazz score, is his first publicly performed orchestral
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Martins chose Ives, an experimental composer, for
his first and astringent ballet ``Calcium Light Night.'' Ten years
later, Feld used some of the same short pieces and the mysterious
``Unanswered Question'' for the Ives ballet he created as a guest
choreographer for the company's 1988 American Music Festival.
Revived with Damian Woetzel dynamically recreating his role as an
everyman seeking a muse who exits head first into a trap door (the
incomparable Maria Kowroski), the circus imagery came back with new
pungency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ives, Songs'' which Robbins also created in 1988 takes Ives'
irony toward an American past that was shattered by World War I and
translates it into high theatrical art. There is a whiff of Charles
Prendergast's paintings in the images that the current cast dances
out so strongly. La Fosse stunningly reinvents the cameo role of
the man who recalls the memories on stage. Stoop-shouldered and
dazed, he is, emotionally, at the bottom of the scale to which the
music descends metaphorically.
</P>
<P>
   The way toward these ballets was pointed in ``Ivesiana.''
Balanchine did not need to invite a modern-dance choreographer into
a ballet company. In 1954 he saw fit to have dancers go barefoot or
walk on their knees if the music called him in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully rehearsed, the ballet redefined the dissonance and
hazy texture of four Ives pieces as chilling enigmas. Everything in
the revival was haunting: James Fayette's inexorable pursuit of a
``blind'' Kathleen Tracey, Ms. Taylor as an ambiguous siren-ideal
virtually out of Tom Gold's desperate reach, Ms. Kowroski and
Charles Askegard in a no-strings urban encounter and, finally, the
corps plowing forward on seemingly amputated limbs.
</P>
<P>
   This was Ms. Kowroski's season. Tall, bold, idiosyncratic and
the epitome of where classical dancing should go in the
21st-century, she contributed the emotional dimension that Martins'
``Swan Lake'' did not have with every cast. Taking a cue from
Balanchine, who had rechoreographed a full version for the Zurich
Ballet in the 1970s, he stressed the formal over the lyrical. For
the best standard ``Lake,'' one might prefer the Boston Ballet
production, derived from a Kirov version. The Martins' staging,
with all the set pieces intact or slightly changed, is nonetheless
excellent as a gloss on the original. It clears the mind and gets
to essentials, just as Per Kirkeby's sets do the same by using
color and abstract design.
</P>
<P>
   For fun there was Wheeldon's ``Scenes de Ballet, a highly
imaginative mirror dance for students and the three-part ``Duke!''
Here, La Fosse incorporated a tap duet into a stylized swing
number, Ms. Stroman put some flappers on toe so that Ms. Kowroski,
as the outsider in a tutu, could join in and Fagan treated
Ellington as something more than a show-business composer; his
segment had mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them Twos'' may tell us little new about various stages of
love, but the way in which Martins choreographs his way through
five duets is what matters. From the first off-center shapes for
Ms. Taylor and Sebastien Marcovici to an image of loss, as Darci
Kistler fades away from Jock Soto, invention fills the eye.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Swan Lake,'' Martins turned to Kirkeby, a Danish painter
with an international reputation, just he has turned to leading
contemporary composers. This is the level of distinctive
collaboration that Balanchine and Kirstein promulgated and that is
found in no other company.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is how Rozanne Seelen describes her marriage:
``The wife says to the husband: `I want a vanilla ice cream cone.
Not chocolate, not strawberry, vanilla. The husband goes out and
brings back a tuna fish sandwich. And she says, `Thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   While that's certainly a fair description of how marriage can
work, in Mrs. Seelen's case it's a dynamic that encompasses even
more. She and her husband, Arthur, own the Drama Book Shop _ at 723
Seventh Ave., at 48th Street _ the oldest performing arts bookstore
in the country. And along with the Howard Johnson's on Broadway at
46th Street, it is one of the few remnants of the old Times Square.
The store is celebrating its 75th anniversary. (Before going crazy
trying to find it, be advised: It's in an office building, on the
second floor.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides being married to each other, the Seelens are married to
the publishing business; they are part of the dwindling species of
independent booksellers in the country. They are also married to
the theater; they and their staff of 24 spend hours each day with
actors, helping them choose monologues for their auditions, often
without making a sale. So they both have ample opportunity to
request vanilla and end up with tuna fish.
</P>
<P>
   With 40,000 titles, including volumes on Czech, Russian,
Scandinavian and Spanish theater, the Drama Book Shop remains the
city's most comprehensive collection of performing arts books,
stocking up to 15 translations of ``The Cherry Orchard'' alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto,'' Seelen says, ``is, `If we don't have something
here, we want to know why.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Seelens (he is 75, she gives clues she's 65) spend at least
10 hours a day at the store. The shelves of their office are
crammed with books and items like shaving cream, vitamins and
Miracle-Gro. The only vacation they have taken in the last 10 years
was one three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to change that,'' the store's general manager,
Domenic Silipo, 31, said fondly. The couple regard him as a godsend
who helps shepherd the business through the advent of technology,
and through more basic considerations like security. An unfortunate
side effect of trying to sell books to starving artists is that
sometimes they're starving enough to take them without paying.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of harsh realism is best left to others; the
Seelens are not good at at it. They are from a gentler time, when
the promise of New York City and the Rialto had a romance and
majesty that did not include the Disney Store.
</P>
<P>
   Seelen is a former actor with a dry sense of humor who bears a
striking resemblance to Walter Matthau. Mrs. Seelen is a former
dancer who speaks in a fluttery voice and always seems to be
encouraging people onward, including the staff, most of whom are
struggling actors, directors or filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all on their way somewhere,'' she says, her eyes
getting misty. ``It's nice to have people pursuing careers be with
the customers who are in the same boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Seelen nods. ``It's not a job job we have here. There's some
emotion to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple engenders much loyalty from people in the theater.
When the store suffered a fire in 1979, Mrs. Seelen says, its
collection of signed first editions was ruined. ``The playwright
Robert Anderson came in,'' she recalled, ``and I showed him the
black, wet pile. He came back the next day with a signed first
edition of `I Never Sang For My Father.'''
</P>
<P>
   Seelen sighs. ``It brings tears to my eyes when I talk about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Seelen nods. ``He's a great gentleman of the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was what Seelen had also aspired to be. Born in Flatbush,
Brooklyn, and raised in the Bronx, he graduated from De Witt
Clinton High School and CCNY, which, he says, ``we called Catholic
College Now Yiddish.'' He worked as a chemical engineer at the
Battell Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, where he acted in
plays on the side. He moved back to New York to act full time,
working off Broadway, in summer stock and on radio. His one
Broadway show was John Hersey's adaptation of ``The Wall,'' but he
spent a lot of time performing in children's theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about children's theater,'' he says, ``is it's like
hitting your head against the wall. It feels so good when you
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   It was through Kay Rockefeller, a children's theater producer,
that Seelen met Marjorie Seligman, who founded the Drama Book Shop
in 1923. ``Kay called and asked if I wanted to buy a share of the
bookshop, and I said yes,'' he says. ``It was one of those
life-changing decision made in 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1958. Did he regret giving up his acting career?
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs. ``A friend of mine once went up to Moss Hart in
Sardi's,'' he says, ``and asked, `What's the secret to success?'
Moss Hart said, `Don't get tired.' I think with the theater I got
tired. It was always back to square one. I was always struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It would be another 11 years before the Seelens met.
</P>
<P>
   Rozanne Ritch was born and raised in San Antonio and says she
graduated from high school at 15. Given to drama early, she recalls
standing at the top of the staircase in her house declaring, ``I'm
going to New York and never coming back.'' She certainly tried. She
attended Vassar College for a year, but her parents decided she was
too young and brought her back. She graduated from the University
of Texas at Austin, then moved to New York to pursue a career as a
ballet dancer. During an audition for the Washington Ballet she
fell and was injured severely enough to end her career.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Texas she recovered enough physically to dance in summer
stock. She returned to New York, earned a master's degree in
theater at Columbia University and worked as a play reader for
Joseph Papp. She was assisting a professor at Barnard College in
1969 when she had another fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here then to work for six months,'' she says. ``I
always say I fell into this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Seelen hired her, and though they ``kept company for a while,''
as Mrs. Seelen says, they did not marry until 1980. The store,
which was originally on West 47th Street, then on 52d Street,
where, Seelen says, it ``moved from brownstone to brownstone,'' has
been in its present location since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The Seelens remain adamant about keeping the Drama Book Shop a
place where individual service is prized. Like most independent
booksellers, they have little use for the chains. They refer to
Barnes &AMP; Noble as Barnes &AMP; Ignoble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to incorporate the technology of the book business now
while keeping personal relationships,'' Mrs. Seelen says. ``But
it's terribly hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Seelen shakes his head. ``We could be out of business in 20
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Silipo's view is less dark. ``There's not a lot of competition
in what we specialize in,'' he says. ``And we're making the growing
film community in New York knowledgeable about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Seelen says the shop will ``probably go along'' with
joining a Web site for independent booksellers, though she adds:
``If a young actor needs a scene or a monologue, that can't be done
over the Web. They come in and ask, `What is a monologue that might
be appropriate for me?' They stay for hours, reading book after
book.''
</P>
<P>
   They do?
</P>
<P>
   Seelen sighs. ``The sale is not as important as the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Seelen smiles gently. ``Arthur's real name was
Seelenfreund, which means `friend of the soul,''' she says. Does
that mean she tends to forgive him his tuna fish? She laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' she says. ``I don't remember what I ordered.
That's the whole point. We've been through so much together. We're
bookends. Absolute bookends.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the office the store is emptying. ``The Drama Book Shop
is closing in less than 15 minutes,'' a clerk announces in sonorous
tones. ``Please bring your purchases to the front.'' The customers
break into applause. ``That was marvelous,'' one calls. The clerk
bows.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Seelen looks tenderly at the remaining group, mostly
handsome young men who seem to be actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when they're being difficult,'' she says, ``I tell the
staff: `Always be nice to them. Let them be stars.'''

BEER-CAN CHICKEN: A MODERN BARBECUE CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: optional sidebar and recipe at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN RAICHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best chicken I ever tasted wasn't the poulet de Bresse
stuffed with truffles that I had in France. It wasn't the chicken
wrapped in lotus leaves and baked in a mound of clay in Hong Kong.
It wasn't even my Aunt Annette's plump, golden braised capon,
although it comes close.
</P>
<P>
   No, the best chicken I ever tasted came off a barbecue pit in
Memphis, where it had been smoked upright in a singularly
undignified position _ straddling an open can of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Beer-can chicken, also known as drunken chicken or chicken on a
throne, is a modern classic on the American competition barbecue
circuit. I first tasted it in 1996, on the banks of the Mississippi
River at the Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking
Contest. Memphis in May is the World Series, Mardi Gras and Summer
Olympics of barbecue all rolled into one: a cutthroat competition
and orgy of smoked meat and beer that brings 300 teams from around
the world to compete in the uniquely American art of barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   My introduction to beer-can chicken came from one such team, the
Bryce Boar Blazers from Memphis. I happened on their site one
afternoon, just as the team captain, Jim Birdsong, was lifting the
lid of a giant smoker.
</P>
<P>
   Inside were a half-dozen chickens, their skins bronzed with
smoke and gritty with spice rub, perched upright on cans of
Budweiser. The chickens were destined to feed the crew after a week
of the smoke, sweat and toil of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had injected their chickens with Cajun seasoning
(using the culinary version of a hypodermic syringe) and rubbed
brown sugar, onion and garlic under and over the skin. Open cans of
beer seasoned with more spice rub had been inserted in the cavities
of the upright birds, protruding like pedestals. The legs were
brought forward to form a sort of tripod. Thus positioned, the
birds had been placed in a smoker and slow-roasted for four hours
over mesquite.
</P>
<P>
   The meat was unbelievably moist and tender, the bite of the
spice mix accenting the perfume of wood smoke. The use of the beer
can turned out to be a brilliant, if crude, tactic: the bird is
steamed and infused with aromatics from the inside on what amounts
to a vertical roaster. (Although beer-can chicken is commonly
slow-cooked, it doesn't have to be: hotter, faster grilling methods
are excellent, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Birdsong said he learned the technique from one of his company's
customers in Texas and became a devotee. Another ardent fan is
Elizabeth Lumpkin, the owner of Boss Hawg's Barbecue and Catering
Company in Topeka, Kan., who began making beer-can chicken in 1995.
Ms. Lumpkin places quartered apples and onions in the cavity and
smokes the bird over apple and cherry. ``Sometimes my husband will
be all crabby because I've used all the beer in the house for
chicken,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beer-can chicken exists even outside the quirky world of
competition barbecue. My cousin Rob Raichlen, who works in
communications for the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team and
knows his way around a kettle grill, practically lived on beer-can
chicken at cookouts at the University of Southern California. He
learned how to make it from a college roommate from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I was able to confirm a Louisiana connection. I
was discussing barbecue on a New Orleans radio talk show, and
several listeners called in to volunteer their recipes for beer-can
chicken. One said he adds garlic and onion juice to the beer can.
For another, the secret was a generous shot of crab boil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birth of beer-can chicken is sort of like the
domestication of animals,'' Ardie Davis, a barbecue expert, said.
About five years ago, ``it just happened everywhere at once.''
Davis, who goes by the nom de guerre of Remus Powers, is one of the
most respected judges on the barbecue circuit, recognizable by his
signature bowler hat and tuxedo studs fashioned from pork ribs. He
barbecues his chickens on ``tall boys,'' 16-ounce cans of beer.
</P>
<P>
   When outdoor cooks learn about beer-can chicken, they find it
irresistible. First, there's the novelty factor.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important are the unique flavor and texture. The
technique is so effective because ``the heat makes the alcohol in
the beer volatilize,'' Birdsong said, adding that the fumes ``add a
delicate beer flavor'' that joins other flavorings and at the same
time keeps the bird moist and tender. And because the steaming
takes place inside the chicken, it accomplishes all this without
making the skin soggy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's the heady tang of wood smoke: beer-can
chicken is always cooked with wood or wood chips. To reinforce the
beer flavor, many pit masters will actually soak their wood chips
in beer.
</P>
<P>
   There's a final benefit: the fact that the chicken is roasted
upright. This vertical position allows the fat to drain off and the
skin to roast quickly, crisply and evenly. Indeed, cookware shops
sell special vertical chicken roasting stands for this purpose. But
these devices lack the allure of steaming beer.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, I've cooked a lot of beer-can chickens,
and I've tried varying the methods just about every way I can think
of. Competition barbecuers cook the birds at a relatively low
temperature (190 to 225 degrees) for a long time (4 to 5 hours).
This is fine, if you happen to have a smoker. Smokers produce the
best smoke flavor, but they never really quite make the skin crisp.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer a conventional charcoal or gas grill at a higher
temperature (350 degrees). By using the indirect grilling method
and adding wood chips to the coals or smoker box, you still get an
intense smoke flavor. The chicken cooks in about 90 minutes. And
the skin always comes out crackling crisp.
</P>
<P>
   I've also experimented with other birds and seasonings, like
game hens cooked on miniature beer cans. I've invented a root beer
bird, and for an Asian touch, I rub a chicken with five-spice
powder and add Chinese seasonings to the beer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The fact is you can put any seasoning on the bird and other
flavorful liquids _ not just beer _ in the can. For that matter,
you can use a can of Coke or Sprite. Soda is more interesting than
you might imagine. Just be sure you open the can first.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the Embers at Bay
</P>
<P>
   To cook beer-can chicken on a backyard grill, you need to use
the indirect method. This means that you configure your fire so
that it is hottest away from the food.
</P>
<P>
   On a charcoal kettle grill, light the charcoal or Charwood in a
chimney starter. When it glows red, dump it in two piles at
opposite sides of the grill. (Some grills come with side baskets
for this purpose.) Place a foil drip pan in the center of the
grill, between the mounds of embers. Place the grate on the grill,
and cook the chicken in the center over the drip pan. Toss soaked
wood chips on the coals to generate smoke. Keep the grill covered,
adjusting the vents to keep the temperature at 350 degrees. After
cooking the chicken for an hour, add 10 fresh briquettes or an
equal amount of Charwood. Leave the grill uncovered for a few
minutes until the coals ignite.
</P>
<P>
   On a gas grill, if it has two burners, light one side on high,
and cook the chicken on the other. On a three-burner grill, light
the front and rear or outside burners, and cook the chicken in the
center. On a four-burner grill, light the outside burners, and cook
in the center. Many gas grills come with smoker boxes, in which you
can put the wood chips. If you don't have a smoker box, loosely
wrap the chips in heavy-duty foil, make a few holes on top, and
place the foil package under the grate over one of the burners.

   BEER-CAN CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1} hours
</P>
<P>
   2 cups hickory or oak chips, soaked in beer or water to cover
for 1 hour and then drained
</P>
<P>
   2 12-ounce cans beer
</P>
<P>
   { cup of your favorite barbecue rub
</P>
<P>
   2 3{- to 4-pound chickens, fat removed, washed and blotted dry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place wood chips in bowl. Pop tab of each beer can, and make
2 additional holes in each top, using a church-key opener. Pour
half the beer from each can over the chips. Add additional beer or
water to cover chips, soak them for 1 hour, and drain.
</P>
<P>
   2. Set up grill for indirect grilling.
</P>
<P>
   3. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon barbecue rub in neck cavity and 2
teaspoons in main cavity of each chicken. Add 1 tablespoon rub to
each open, half-full can of beer. (Don't worry if it foams up.)
Season outside of each bird with 2 tablespoons rub.
</P>
<P>
   4. Stand beer cans on work surface. Holding each chicken
upright, lower it over can so that can goes into main cavity. Pull
chicken legs forward to form a sort of tripod: the chicken should
sit upright over can. Carefully transfer chickens to grill in this
position, placing them in center over drip pan, away from heat.
</P>
<P>
   5. If using charcoal, toss half the wood chips on each mound of
coals. If using gas, place chips in smoker box. Barbecue chickens
until nicely browned and cooked through, about 1{ hours, keeping
temperature about 350 degrees. (If using charcoal, replenish coals
as needed.) The internal temperature of the birds (taken in
thickest part of thigh) should be at least 165 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   6. Carefully transfer birds to platter in same position. To
carve, lift bird off can, and discard can.
</P>

   &UR; Defibrillators Installed at Chicago Airports &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has installed portable heart defibrillators at Midway
and O'Hare Airports. Monique Bond of the City of Chicago Department
of Aviation said that 33 of the devices have been put into corridor
walls at O'Hare and 7 at Midway. The battery-powered devices,
Hewlett-Packard Heartstream Forerunners, are no more than a minute
apart at walking speed, she said, and can be removed and used
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand airport workers in Chicago have been trained in the
use of the defibrillators, and 50,000 airline employees are also
estimated to be familiar with them since the majority of United
States airlines are buying them. But the machines come with
relatively simple instructions, and a recorded voice tells the
operator what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Port Authority is installing defibrillators at its
airports and training its staff in their use. At the end of June,
it reported saving the life of a passenger in Terminal 2 at Kennedy
International Airport with the nearest defibrillator, which was
borrowed from a Delta airplane waiting at the gate. Airport
security officers at Anchorage and the Dallas-Fort Worth airport
police have defibrillators on hand.

visitors can learn about the people who have inhabited Alaska for
thousands of years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The center is on 26 acres of wooded land about 10 minutes
northeast of downtown Anchorage. A 26,000-square-foot main building
accommodates exhibition and demonstration areas, a 100-seat
theater, a multimedia cultural resource center and a gift shop
selling native arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductions of traditional villages represent five indigenous
cultural groups. In these villages, connected by a series of
handicapped-accessible trails, demonstrators show ancient
techniques for constructing buildings, making kayaks, hunting and
fishing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska Native Heritage Center, at the corner of Muldoon Road

   &UR; A Classic Toronto Haunt Stands Smartly Again &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Torontonians liked what the Windsor Arms said about them. A
reserved, rather clubby hotel with British airs when it opened in
1927, it evolved _ as did Toronto _ into something surprisingly
smart while staying itself.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, it was where Katharine Hepburn, Richard Burton and
Elizabeth Taylor stayed when they came to town. Its restaurants
redefined eating out in Toronto. Afternoon tea (before it was
fashionable) in the Windsor Arms' shabby-chic ambiance of leaded
windows and oak furniture was an institution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closed since 1991 and owned by a developer, George Friedmann,
since 1995, the Windsor Arms was demolished, then reborn. The hotel
that reopened in mid-May is still on a tranquil side street off
Bloor Street's luxury shops. Visitors enter through the familiar
stone Tudor Revival archway and the original doors, which are just
about the only remaining pieces of the original building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behind the brown-brick facade that replicates the original, the
four-story 28-room hotel (a condominium rises above it) has
essentially has been rethought as ``a restaurant with rooms,'' said
Christopher Ashby, the sales director. Actully three restaurants:
the Tea Room, an echo of the homey original, mutates into a
champagne-and-caviar lounge in the evening; Club 22, a bar, has a
dance floor and an already-redolent cigar room; and the Courtyard
Cafe has been given a new cream-colored classical look punctuated
by gigantic Doric columns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's 21 suites and 7 rooms have a cool, spare style
inspired by French furniture of the 1920s, with amenities that
include whirlpool tubs in every bathroom. Guests also have use of
an indoor pool, a sauna, a spa and a fitness center.
</P>
<P>
   Rates range from $256 to $1,024 (at $1.47 Canadian to the
dollar); at the top end, even the limestone-floored bathroom has a
fireplace. The Windsor Arms is at 18 St. Thomas Street, Toronto,
Ontario M5S 3E7; (877) 999-2767, fax (416) 921-9121.

THE CARIBBEAN WONDERS: WHERE ARE THE TOURISTS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a slow winter and spring, tourism officials in the
Caribbean were hoping for better things for the rest of 1999. The
NATO bombing in the Balkans heightened those expectations, on the
assumption that many travelers would shun that part of the world
and head for the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   But Caribbean tourism continues to lag. With the number of
tourists to some islands down about 20 percent, hotel occupancy
levels are well below those of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advance bookings for the Caribbean look reasonably good,''
said Michael Youngman, the executive director of the Caribbean
Tourism Organization in New York City, but many tourism officials
are somewhat puzzled by the no-shows, especially in view of a
strong United States economy and predictions by the Travel Industry
Association of America of another record summer travel season.
</P>
<P>
   Some tourism officials in the United States blame rising crime
in the region, a series of recent strikes, destruction from
Hurricane Georges last fall and increasing competition from resorts
in the United States, Mexico and Cuba. Cuba, for example, recently
began selling packages combining a vacation on its beaches with a
flight to Guatemala to visit Mayan sites and colonial cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean hotel industry has long blamed the cruise industry
for exacerbating the islands' woes, contending that by bringing
visitors who stay only a few hours in port, the cruise ships have
discouraged longer visits. And during the Caribbean Hotel
Association meeting in Nassau, the Bahamas, last month, Ed Malone,
the association president, returned to the attack, decrying what he
called the islands' aid to the cruise industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing but admiration for an industry that has
succeeded in getting its ships built with subsidies from foreign
governments,'' he said, ``sail under flags of convenience and
recruit staff from the cheapest, non-unionized labor pools in the
world, and then sail the Caribbean in a cruise operator's tax-free
heaven. While our governments help keep foreign ship lines afloat,
we are sinking on our own shores.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, cruise officials have countered that many cruise
passengers later return to the Caribbean on land-based vacations,
but this time they mostly ignored the criticism _ perhaps because
they have troubles of their own. Cruise fares to the region have
been relatively flat this year, averaging less than $100 a day per
person including port charges but not air fare. Airlines to the
region also cite a slump in passengers and fares.
</P>
<P>
   Financial woes of cruise lines and airlines have long-term
implications for tourists. A Carnival Cruise Lines spokesman at the
hotel-association conference said that while cruise passengers to
the Caribbean have doubled in the last decade, the region's share
of the overall cruise business has fallen from about 67 percent in
1989 to slightly more than 50 percent, and so the line will reduce
or not add capacity in the region.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for American Airlines, the dominant carrier in the
Caribbean, said that in part because of lower fares from
competitors, its Caribbean profits fell in the first quarter of
this year from the comparable period in 1998 and would likely
decline further in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those lower fares are still higher, on average, than
fares to Cancun, Mexico, or to Europe. In fact, the week of the
hotel conference, British Airways and American offered a free round
trip to London with each round-trip economy ticket purchased before
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tourism to Barbados fell 2.5 percent the first
quarter of this year, after growing 9.3 percent during the same
period last year. Dominican Republic tourism has been battered by
lingering effects of Hurricane Georges and a drop in European
tourists. And Bermuda, although not in the Caribbean except for
purposes of keeping tourism statistics, has also been struggling
with sub-par hotel occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse that, Bermuda is advertising extensively in the
United States and Canada. But it got off to a shaky start when a
supposed tongue-in-cheek newspaper advertisement suggesting that
four days in Bermuda are better than in the Hamptons drew the wrath
of Long Island tourism officials. They retaliated with an
advertisement saying: ``With 1,400 square miles, Long Island's
attractions are endless. With 20 square miles, Bermuda's
attractions soon end.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some islands appear to have more visitors than last year.
Hotel occupancy in Puerto Rico increased 4 percent over the first
four months of 1999, compared with the same period in 1998. The
Bahamas also seem to be doing better than expected, in large part
because of the expansion of the 2,000-room Atlantis Resort and
Casino on Paradise Island.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons suggested for the Caribbean's slump is that
familiarity has bred boredom. And after protests over a gasoline
tax led to three days of riots, looting and violence in Jamaica in
April, cruise ships and airlines canceled scheduled visits and
flights to the island; Jamaican hotels subsequently reported
wholesale cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean officials acknowledge that some fear remains after a
recent series of violent crimes throughout the Caribbean. Although
few of the crimes involved tourists (most were drug related), it is
hard to dispel the perception of danger, especially when tourists
have many other options.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While temperatures soared toward 100 degrees or more at 2 p.m.
Tuesday from New York City to interior central New England,
readings at Boston receded to 74 degrees as cool winds blew off the
Atlantic. Readings rebounded a bit later in the afternoon in
Boston, but the city was spared extreme heat. Wednesday,
temperature trends at Boston will again be somewhat opposite to
other major cities in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The record heat that stifled most of the Northeast Seaboard
Sunday and Monday will ebb a bit Wednesday in the wake of a weak
cool front. But winds from the west-northwest, which will import
noticeably less humid air, will warm on descent from the
Appalachians, boosting temperatures into the upper 80's to low
90's. Though these readings will qualify as a easing of the heat in
most places, they will constitute a return to hot weather in
Boston. Winds along the New England Coast will average 12 to 25 mph
with higher gusts.
</P>
<P>
   Widely separated thunderstorms will erupt from the southern
Rockies to the Great Basin as moist air invading from the tropics
rises in response to the uneven heating of mountain peaks. Heavy
rain is possible in some areas, particularly in south Arizona,
where the most humid air will reside.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms, some with heavy rain and a
few spawning severe weather, will erupt from the Middle Atlantic to
the Southeast and central Gulf States in response to a stalling
front, disturbances from the tropical Atlantic and the instability
from hot, humid air near the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Monsoon
</P>
<P>
   A few weathercasters refer to the ``monsoon season'' in the
Southwest states, but they employ redundancy. The word ``monsoon''
is derived from an Arabic word meaning ``a season,'' so such an
utterance translates into ``a season season.'' Semantics aside, the
summer monsoon begins around the end of June or the beginning of
July when prevailing winds shift and blow from the humid tropics.
Such a seasonal wind shift can be too subtle to detect in the
Southwest, so the operative definition of the start of the summer
monsoon in Phoenix is three consecutive days with moderate to high
humidity.

RAFTING ON IDAHO'S WHITE WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 11)  
(jt) 
 By TOM REDBURN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Screams rise above the roar of white water just ahead. But as
the big rubber raft plunges out of sight below, I'm not worried. My
14-year-old daughter, Emily, is in the boat with three other girls
and an expert guide. They aren't yelling out of fear. They are
screaming as loud as they can for the sheer fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   After two days on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in central
Idaho, I know this is not going to be any ``River Wild'' ordeal. We
are at the heart of the nation's longest free-flowing river system,
but it's August; the raging waters of early June, when the snow is
melting, are long gone. Our group of adventurers has already had
plenty of thrills and a couple of spills, but any macho pretensions
are far from my mind.
</P>
<P>
   This is a family trip, one my wife, Lisa, and I dreamed about
for years. Jeremy, our 18-year-old son, has just graduated from
high school. Emily will be starting high school in the fall. We're
celebrating by rafting more than 100 miles down the main artery of
the biggest wilderness area in the lower 48 states. Six days on the
river, five nights of camping, an escape from the clutter of our
lives back home.
</P>
<P>
   But we aren't exactly roughing it. Our trip was organized by one
of the 26 outfitters licensed to run the Middle Fork. Our flotilla
consists of 24 guests and 6 guides, 1 for each raft. We picked
Rocky Mountain River Tours mostly because of its reputation for
terrific food and friendly guides. We have not been disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the most luxurious of the outfitters (in contrast to a
few other groups, we are expected to set up our own tents, help
load and unload the rafts, wash our own dishes). And sure, we sleep
on the ground _ in tents or under the stars _ but on thick pads
that are more comfortable than most pull-out sofas. Sumptuous meals
are prepared by the guides, who double as chefs. Wine flows freely
at dinner. Each day, we have our choice of paddling in a six-person
raft or simply going along for the ride on one of the three big oar
boats that carry all the gear and two to four passengers. Later on,
there will be chances to run the rapids in one-person inflatable
kayaks.
</P>
<P>
   This vacation began with a three-hour drive from Boise to
Stanley, a tiny crossroads town on the northern edge of the
Sawtooth Mountains. Joining us on this Western adventure was Lisa's
74-year-old mother, Mary Lou. Although she has traveled all over
the world, she still had a little trepidation about the risks. I
reassured her everything would be fine, but the truth was I didn't
know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The Sawtooth Mountains were stunning and looked exactly like
what their name suggests. That first evening, we gathered, under
threatening skies, in the parking lot outside our motel with the
rest of our group. We eavesdropped on quiet conversations, looking
over strangers we were to live with for almost a week.
</P>
<P>
   There were several different groups: families with younger
children; some retired couples; a recently married twosome in their
mid-20s; a woman with her teen-age nephew. We introduced ourselves
_ first names only. A few of the participants were clearly veterans
of similar trips; most of us were newcomers to anything more than a
day of white water paddling. One of the adults had never slept
outdoors before.
</P>
<P>
   As we tried on our matching bright yellow, orange or green
waterproof overalls and rain jackets for size, we all looked
faintly ridiculous, like giant plastic neon-colored fishing worms.
There was an underlying current of excitement, but also some basic
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we go to the bathroom?'' asked one. The waterproof
bags designed to hold all our personal gear looked awfully small.
``Can we really fit all our stuff in those little rubber bags?''
Mary Lou asks: ``How will we get back in the raft if we fall out?''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a car drove by. The driver yelled: ``You're all
going to die!'' We laughed uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mills, a native Idahoan with an aw-shucks manner who owns
Rocky Mountain River Tours with his wife, Sheila, tried to be
reassuring. ``We've never lost anybody yet,'' he says. ``But
there's always a first time.'' Easy for him to joke. He was not
going on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   On the bus ride to the put-in the next morning, we became better
acquainted with some of our companions. But where were the guides?
When we finally reached the end of the gravel road at Boundary
Creek, we saw a host of rafts for several groups, some still on
trailers, most of them already laid out on the river below. Pete,
the leader of the trip, sported a shaved head and a goatee. He gave
a short lecture about respect for the wilderness and how we would
take out everything we took in, including our human waste. ``I want
you to feel guilty about leaving a footprint,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven groups are permitted to enter the Middle Fork each
day. Four are private groups, average size about 10 people,
allocated by lottery; three slots go to commercial outfitters,
which can take up to 24 guests each. As many as 10,000 people run
the river every summer, but we would see only fleeting glimpses of
others the entire week. Assigned campsites were far enough apart to
preserve the illusion of solitude.
</P>
<P>
   The sky was still a little threatening, but the rain gear was to
protect us from the spray of cold river water. We put on life
preservers and helmets. Our guides had spent the morning loading
the three big oar rafts with just about everything we'd need for
the next six days. I chose a paddle boat with Lisa and four other
guests. Allison, the sole female guide, was in charge. The first
day was a run of just seven miles, but because the water was
relatively low, the rapids were tricky, she said. We would have to
negotiate the rocks; not simply ride over them on big waves. We
wouldn't have much time to rehearse.
</P>
<P>
   Allison read the cues of the river carefully, as if enjoying a
dance with an old friend. Our jerky nervousness quickly evaporated,
replaced by the exhilaration of leaning and pulling our paddles
hard against the force of the water as Allison yelled: ``All
forward, all forward. Really pull now.''
</P>
<P>
   We surged forward. ``OK, forward right, back on the left,''
commanding my side to back paddle hard enough to turn us to the
left around a rock. ``Back on the left,'' she says. ``Lean into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great work!'' we hear as we slide down the tongue of smooth
water between boulders. Our raft bounced off another rock and we
spun around gently into the waiting pool.
</P>
<P>
   The days quickly fell into an active routine.
</P>
<P>
   I was usually up shortly after sunrise. The smell of
fresh-brewed coffee wafted through the campground at 7. Breakfast,
around 8, was hot and filling, prepared in Dutch ovens over a wood
fire contained in a metal pan laden with charcoal. One morning it
was a goat cheese and egg strata, with coffee cake for the less
adventurous eaters. I indulged in both. Another morning it was
blueberry oatmeal pancakes. Fresh fruit and cold cereal were always
available.
</P>
<P>
   There was time for fly-fishing (catch-and-release only),
exploring the area around the campsite, or just chatting in the
circle of folding chairs. We packed our tents, sleeping bags and
personal gear, took a last look around. We were usually on the
river by 10, at first paddling leisurely with the current, then
enjoying flurries of activity as we maneuvered through the moderate
Class II and Class III rapids.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, it was hot. We stopped for lunch, which included
sandwiches, fruit, a salad, cookies. Time for fishing, a brief nap
or, for those willing to brave the chilly water, swimming. Back on
the river by 2 or so. Maybe switching to an oar boat. The
afternoons consisted of a longer run through the twisting funnel of
forest that sloped down to the water's edge. Some days we stopped
to examine Indian pictographs on the rock walls. Another time we
hiked up for 30 minutes to enjoy a misty waterfall.

 UNDATED: misty waterfall.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And there are always more rapids, a few particularly
challenging. In the paddle boats, we got wet often but dried off
quickly in the sun. There were eagles, otters, glimpses of a few
mountain goats on the cliffs above.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 5 p.m. or so we had usually found our campsite for
the night. Everyone got in the ``bag line'' to hand the gear, like
a bucket brigade, from person to person so that it moved quickly
from boats to campground. I usually took a dip to cool off.
Appetizers were served before dinner, which was an amazing feast
considering how far we were from anything resembling a store. One
night margaritas were prepared in a 10-gallon cooler, followed by
fresh salad with edible flowers. The main course: a chicken and
tortilla casserole. Dessert was freshly baked (those Dutch ovens
again) chocolate cake. Night fell just before 10.
</P>
<P>
   We're not completely cut off. On the second day, we stopped at a
sand bar below an airstrip, where Dave Mills had flown in with more
fresh food and the inflatable kayaks. There were no roads near the
river, but signs of human enterprise remained from the time before
this area was set aside as a 2.3-million-acre preserve, known as
the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. We passed a stretch
of a dozen or so vacation homes reachable by private plane. A few
ranches, also accessible by landing strip or horseback, dotted the
landscape. We saw some leftover cabins and rusting equipment from
miners who never struck it rich here.
</P>
<P>
   This has always been rugged, remote territory. When Lewis and
Clark reached this point, it seemed so forbidding they had to
detour 150 miles north. The Indians called the Salmon the River of
No Return. The truth is, though, that traveling by river is by far
the easiest way to experience this still largely untouched
wilderness. There are dangers _ serious injuries or deaths for
rafters are extremely rare _ generally confined to the three or
four weeks of torrential flow in the early season.
</P>
<P>
   When we reached Haystack Rapids, the guides pointed out the
place where an experienced river runner drowned several years
earlier, his body trapped under a churning backwash for weeks while
dozens of groups unknowingly floated right over him. On our trip, a
few paddlers were tossed out but they were quickly recovered. The
worst that happens are a couple of mildly twisted ankles and
scraped knees.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we were so well taken care of that Jeremy, who had been
on several more arduous backpacking and canoeing trips, remarked
dismissively during a campfire discussion: ``This isn't really a
wilderness trip.''
</P>
<P>
   But I was glad we could enjoy it so readily. The Forest Service
is considering a proposal to severely restrict access to the Middle
Fork during the high season from mid-June to mid-August. The
outfitters are up in arms, seeing their livelihood at stake. It's
clear that it does a remarkable job keeping the river and
surrounding area as pristine as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Until the final night, the weather had been just about perfect.
But during our steak dinner, a whirlwind swept up the canyon,
spilling food, scattering sparks from the campfire and tossing
around any tent not weighted down. As the rain poured down briefly,
we all scrambled for shelter. ``Now  &UR; this &LR;  is wilderness,'' Jeremy
exclaimed happily.
</P>
<P>
   The last day was bittersweet. We were deep in Impassable Canyon
now. The rapids were bigger, the ride more rollicking. Once through
the last major white water, we all relaxed, leaned back, and
congratulated ourselves on ``surviving'' our few days away from
civilization. I took a swig from the water bottle. For a moment no
one spoke and I looked around. The sky was blue. The sun was hot.
The river was cold. Nothing else mattered.
</P>
<P>
   But all too soon, we reached the confluence of the Middle Fork
and the Main Salmon. The take-out loomed ahead on the right. The
Salmon River flowed for another 60 miles before the next exit. I
wished we could have just kept on going.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; White-water outfitters, seasons and costs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the outfitters that offer trips on the Middle Fork of
the Salmon, generally considered the premier high mountain
white-water river in the United States, are small family-owned
companies that concentrate on the area. Others are larger outfits
that operate white-water trips throughout the West. They all supply
just about everything that you will need, including tents, sleeping
bags, rain gear, meals and bus transportation to the river and back
to your car.
</P>
<P>
   Trip dates are available at least a year ahead but some
schedules could change as early as the summer of 2000 if the Forest
Service approves a more restrictive wilderness permit system. The
season generally runs from early June to late September.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rocky Mountain River Tours,  &LR; owned by Dave and Sheila Mills,
has been running the Middle Fork exclusively since 1978. It offers
four- to six-day trips, depending on the season. Costs for 1999
vary from $970 a person for a four-day high water adventure to
$1,685 for six days in the peak season during July and the first
week of August. Call (208) 756-4808 during the rafting season;
(208) 345-2400 at other times. On the Internet: www.rafttrips.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hughes River Expeditions &LR;  offers trips on the Salmon River
Canyon and a few smaller rivers in Idaho. Its prices for a five- or
six-day Middle Fork trip range from $1,100 to $1,480 a person. Call
(800) 262-1882 or visit www.hughesriver.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bigger, more wide-ranging outfitters are  &UR; Echo: The
Wilderness Company,  &LR; which also runs trips in Oregon and
California;  &UR; Western River Expeditions &LR; , which runs the Grand
Canyon as well, and  &UR; O.A.R.S. &LR; , which covers much of the West.
</P>
<P>
   To contact Echo, call (800) 652-3246 or visit www.echotrips.com.
Western River can be reached at (800) 453-7450 and at
www.westernriver.com. O.A.R.S. can be reached at (800) 346-6277 and
at www.oars.com. The prices are similar to those of local
outfitters.
</P>
<P>
   A complete list of outfitters is available from the  &UR; Idaho
Outfitters and Guides Association, &LR;  (800) 494-3246 or www.ioga.org.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When to Go &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In late May and early June, experienced white-water rafters can
run the Middle Fork at its wildest on the full rush of the snow
melt. Trips are shorter and more dangerous, and the weather is
unpredictable. Starting in late June and generally running through
mid-August, sunny weather is common and the river becomes far more
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Families generally take six-day trips from mid-July through
mid-August. In drier years, the water flow diminishes enough by
early to mid-August that guests may have to fly into an airstrip
farther downriver from the normal put-in, cutting a day off the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Trout fishing improves dramatically by late August.

 &HT;    Green's links to his father never forgotten
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Some athletes invest in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Green, a 33-year-old receiver who signed with the Miami
Dolphins after being released by Denver in February, chose to put
his money in other commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda grass and sand.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, after attempts to buy existing courses fell
through, Green and nine other investors began building a golf
course on 180 acres in Shelby, N.C., the small town about 35 miles
south of Charlotte that he calls home during the NFL off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the 6,911-yard, par-72 course, with an 8,000-square-foot
clubhouse, opened.
</P>
<P>
   Most call it Deer Brook Golf Club. Green calls it a dream come
true _ one that produces a thrill right up there with winning
back-to-back Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   You see, for Green the golf-is-life philosophy isn't just
something from the back of a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   For him, golf is much more than a game. It's a way to figure out
who you can trust on the football field, a way to teach discipline
and ethics and, perhaps most of all, a way to spend a few more
hours with a father who died 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If Green were to tell his life story, it would begin with the
words he used shortly after he finished a recent practice, slipped
on a John Elway Golf Tournament shirt and headed to a course with
some new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to live my life like my father did,'' he said. ``He
never drank alcohol. He never did drugs. He raised nine kids. The
only thing he did his whole life was work and play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf is often thought of as a game for people who are rich and
white.
</P>
<P>
   Green's father was neither.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Green Sr. worked as a janitor at a movie theater in
Athens, Ga. He made $85 a week. He took the bus to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked every day,'' Green said. ``Holidays, Christmas,
every day. And in all those years, he missed three days.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a second job. He caddied. After caddying, he would
play. He tried to get his first six children interested. He tried
to get his wife to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried,'' Corene Green, Willie's mother, said. ``But when I
got pregnant with little Willie, I stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she knew that her seventh child, the baby boy of the
family, would be the one who took to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Little Willie spent most weekends with Big Willie. He would walk
or drive to work with him. He would go to the golf course and ride
in a cart. He would learn about golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he taught me about the game, he taught me the rules and
the etiquette,'' Green said. ``I remember those days like they were
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   He still plays by those rules. No cutting corners. Just ask his
new teammates. Several weeks ago he and cornerback Terrell Buckley
were competing against receivers coach Robert Ford and offensive
coordinator Kippy Brown. They were up by two holes on the 15th when
Buckley, preparing to hit a shot off the fringe of the green,
stomped on some of the grass behind the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-stroke penalty,'' Buckley said. ``He's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Green learned that from his dad, a man who could have found it
easy to revolt against the rules that were in place at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of courses my father couldn't play back then
because of the color of his skin,'' Green said. ``From what I saw _
the way people talked to him when he went to play golf at some
places _ that gave me the inspiration. I said to myself, `When I
get old enough I want to own my own golf course so my father will
be able to play there.'''
</P>
<P>
   So when Deer Brook opened, it was a dream fulfilled. With a
bittersweet twist.
</P>
<P>
   His father died in 1986. He was 66 years old. He had lived a
full life. The day before his death, on a fall Saturday afternoon
in Athens, he had sat in the stands at Sanford Stadium and watched
his son, then a freshman at the University of Mississippi, play in
a football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seemed like it was my father's proudest moment,'' Green
said. ``I was the first one in my family to go to college and he
was so proud. I thank God for allowing him to stay alive to see
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as he wishes his father could have seen all that he's
accomplished on the field _ 10 NFL seasons and two Super Bowl
titles _ you get the sense Green wishes he could have done other
things with him.
</P>
<P>
   He could have taken him to Augusta to watch the Masters. He
could have told him about playing a round with Greg Norman, about
shaking hands with Tiger Woods, about getting his handicap down to
8, about teaching another generation, a grandson named Willie,
about the rules of golf.
</P>
<P>
   He could have taken him to places where he once was forbidden
and, Green insists, now would be welcomed without prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed,'' Green says. ``I told my mom that if my
dad were still alive today, he and I would have hit every golf
course in this world. Not just in the United States. Any golf
course he wanted to play in the world, we would have played.''
</P>
<P>
   And somehow you get the feeling their favorite might have been
one in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   One with an owner named Green.

   CASINOS _ Kentucky, primarly through its incumbent Democratic

the state _ pushing the limits of gambling in the very way that the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission recommended against. What
are horse-track-loving Kentuckians saying about this? And what
effect would this have on the gambling in the South, particularly
neighbors Virginia and Tennessee? For one thing, it would be
another squeeze on Tennessee, which allows no gambling. (Manuel,

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The world might as well defer to Cher's miraculous
powers, because, as she sang in one of her hits at Jones Beach on
Monday night, she really can turn back time. Cher can find her way
back into relevance again and again, and it's not exactly because
she changes with the trends. Instead she waits, like the sentinel
of an enchanted world, and judges when it's safe to open up a trade
route. Her judgment has not always proven correct, but right now it
is impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   The title track of Cher's current album, ``Believe'' (Warner
Brothers), is one of those unavoidable singles that seem to
characterize something about their moment. But at Jones Beach, the
song exemplified Cher's transcendence of such temporal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Two acrobats swung from trapezes as Cher and her dancers, clad
in silver and white, turned the number into a high-energy circus.
Cher's costume may have been futuristic, but it also echoed the one
she wore earlier in the evening during her performance of ``Take Me
Home,'' her late 1970s ode to disco-driven one-night stands.
</P>
<P>
   Cher was connecting the dots for her audience, showing that when
you're a star of her magnitude, fashion will always return to you,
hanging its head. As if to throw off accusations of her recent
capitulations to time and taste, she began the evening in her most
bizarre outfit, a giant red wig and vaguely primitive trapper wear,
which she called ``Braveheart, Mel Gibson with breasts.'' Belting
out a splashy version of ``I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking
for,'' she established herself as a mythical heroine, questing but
always true to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her casual banter played up that integrity, not a word one might
normally associate with a woman who has tried every corner of show
biz, from Oscar-winning Hollywood to Atlantic City to pop metal and
infomercials. But Cher manages to project candor and warmth within
the vortex of glamour. She isn't afraid to tell her audience when
her wig feels weird.
</P>
<P>
   She made fun of her ``new, cool album'' several times and swore
that she would always dress outrageously, even when age confined
her to a wheelchair. ``But I have lots of time before that
happens,'' she quickly added. Indeed, this 53-year-old singer
emanated youthfulness, not only in her notoriously well-preserved
looks but in her vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Cher has taken flak over the years for her husky tone and
limited dynamic range, but as she moved through a medley of early
hits like ``Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves,'' through '80s ballads
like ``After All,'' and into her current neo-disco material, that
voice asserted its outstanding qualities. It is a quintessential
rock voice: impure, quirky, a fine vehicle for projecting
personality. Even the computer manipulations it endures in
``Believe'' can't make it sound like anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   The codification of personality is the essence of modern-day
celebrity, as stars increasingly define the life styles average
people emulate. The effect of stars' sharing their tastes in home
furnishings (Cher has her own line of home accessories), diet, hair
products, even boyfriends, is paradoxical: it makes stars seem like
intimate players in our daily lives, but it also threatens their
singularity, making them into model consumers instead of uncommon
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Cher avoids this dilemma by being a traditional entertainer as
well as a modern personality. Even at her most spectacularly
styled, she keeps a rough-and-tumble, vaudevillian edge. It is in
her music, in the film performances briefly shown on screen during
her concert and in her persona. By maintaining an old-fashioned
ethic of showmanship, she seems exceptionally real. That is why the
fans who attended these Jones Beach shows, and the ones who see her
at Madison Square Garden next week, stick with her.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cyndi Lauper, who played a brief opening set Monday, would like
to make the same transition Cher has; she even performed ``Disco
Inferno'' in a big red cowboy hat to entice those who like
``Believe.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite a voice that remains strong and distinctive, and her
newer songs that showed potential, Ms. Lauper has not figured out
how to go beyond the moment that made her a star. She still had to
drag out ``Girls Just Want to Have Fun'' to close her set, and its
emotional high point was the ballad ``Time After Time,'' also from
her 1984 solo debut.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Orchid, a pop trio that opened Monday's show, hit no high
points, emotional or otherwise.

 &HT;    Dyess: Arkansas Depression colony has a reunion
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DYESS, Ark. _ Imagine a town where everything is brand new.
</P>
<P>
   The paint is barely dry on the houses. No one has slept on the
hospital sheets. No child has written on the school chalkboard. The
cafe hasn't cooked its first hamburger. And for miles around, wild,
flat, fertile land is waiting to be tamed and tilled.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the pioneer days, but that was Dyess in 1934.
Carved from 16,000 acres of snake-infested swamp in northeast
Arkansas, it was built on a mission of mercy. It was a New Deal
dream town for about 500 farming families from all over Arkansas
who were ruined by the Depression. It was the second chance many
thought never would come.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first house I lived in with paint on it,'' says
Everett Henson, who moved to Dyess in 1934 with his large family
when he was 9. Henson, who is 72 and a retired welder, is the
town's unofficial historian. His Memphis home is crammed with boxes
of documents and piles of photographs from Dyess. With the blessing
of his wife, Johnnie, who also lived in Dyess, he has sprawled the
material all over the house. He's trying to decide what to bring to
this Saturday's reunion of the Dyess Colony, as the town was
called. Henson hasn't missed a reunion since they began in 1981.
His collection is so complete that the University of Arkansas wants
it. He has given it to the school in his will.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always took pictures and saved stuff,'' he says by
way of explaining his collection. ``And I always loved Dyess,
because for us, it was a step up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a step up for another, better-known Arkansan. A little
boy named J.R. Cash also moved to Dyess with his family in 1934. He
remembers singing his first song _ ``I am bound for the promised
land'' _ as he bounced along in the back of the flatbed truck sent
by the government to take them to Dyess.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Cash grew up and became the legendary country singer Johnny
Cash, otherwise known as the ``Man in Black.'' Cash hasn't been to
a reunion at Dyess, but every year he is invited, and every year,
there's a communal hope that he might just walk in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he never does,'' says Frances Wallace, 68, who moved to
Dyess in 1945. She's organizing the reunion, a potluck to be held
in the school cafeteria. Usually, at least 300 people come from all
over the country, she says. ``He thinks it would spoil our reunion
because people would come who never lived in Dyess, just to see
him.''
</P>
<P>
   For Henson, Dyess occupies a spot in American history, with or
without Cash.
</P>
<P>
   Dyess was one of 102 towns created by President Franklin
Roosevelt for people left destitute by the Depression. About 45
were farming communities. In Dyess, each farmer could buy between
20 and 40 acres of land and a five-room clapboard house for no
money down at a very low interest rate. He also received a mule, a
cow and groceries and supplies through the first year. The town
worked as a cooperative; the cotton was sold communally, and the
families received a share of any profits made off the crops and
other Dyess industries, such as the general store and the cannery.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 families moved here in the 1930s. The federal
government chose them from thousands of applicants for the color of
their skin (white), their poverty level (the bottom) and their
physical ability to clear land and farm. The town remained a
government-operated community until the late '40s; in 1964, Dyess
became a regular municipality with a mayor and a board of aldermen.
</P>
<P>
   To Henson, Dyess was paradise. It had a new school, a barber, a
beauty shop, a cafe, and a hospital so new and fancy that people
from surrounding towns checked in to have babies or get their
tonsils yanked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might have lived better than we did, but everyone
was proud to be there,'' Henson says. ``You had just about
everything you'd ever need there. It was something, it really
was.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was starving and everyone lived in a solid home _ that
was saying a lot in those days _ but Dyess was still a community of
poor people. O.B. Gladden, owner of the only remaining store in
town, remembers feeling inferior as a teen-ager here in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looked down on big-time hard,'' he says. ``The
basketball team went to the state finals, and they were the only
team in jackets and ties. Why? Because they didn't want to be
looked down on so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to see in modern-day Dyess, a village of 466
people, the promised land that sparkles in the memories of those
who came here more than 60 years ago. Most of the original houses,
including Henson's, are gone. Cash's house, on a quiet gravel road,
remains occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Neat, red brick ranch houses have popped up here and there amid
the vast stretches of soybean and rice fields. There are some
abandoned, fallen-in houses, a sorry sight to Henson who remembers
when everything here was new.
</P>
<P>
   Around the grassy circle that is the town center, there is no
barber shop, beauty parlor, cafe, hospital or even a school that
goes past the fourth grade. Only the administration building, a
two-story, white brick structure with stately columns, has survived
the years since the New Deal days. Although it is on the National
Register of Historic Places, it sits forlorn and neglected, a
sagging sofa on its porch.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the circle is a monument to W.R. Dyess, the
town's namesake, who was state administrator for the Federal
Emergency Relief Administration. It is a white concrete monument
with a small well at its base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I was here, it was full of beer cans,'' Henson says.
</P>
<P>
   Government aid is an unpopular concept these days, but anyone
who grew up in Dyess sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in it, but I don't think it should come in your
mailbox,'' Henson says. ``When I was growing up, if you waited for
it to come to you, it wouldn't come. We had a little boost and and
little help, and I think it made us better.

McCAIN, ALWAYS THE MAVERICK, RUNS AGAINST THE WAYS OF WASHINGTON  
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sometime this month, John McCain, the senior
senator from Arizona, plans to do just the kind of thing that
drives fellow Republicans crazy.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when others in the Senate have dropped their guard,
he will try to force his campaign finance bill to the floor for the
debate his party's leaders do not want. Whenever he strikes, he is
sure to get publicity, as the maverick once again tilting at the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   And that in turn will amplify the theme of his long-shot
presidential bid as he uses his perch in the Senate to fight
against the ways of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is satisfied with the status quo should vote for
someone else,'' McCain told a recent noontime crowd of 200 people
packed into the town hall of Bedford, N.H. ``But anyone who
believes that America is greater than the sum of its special
interests should stand with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a larger-than-life banner of a handsome young man in
uniform stirred in the breeze. It is what John McCain, the Navy
aviator, looked like before he was shot down over Vietnam in 1967
and held as a prisoner of war for five and a half years. The
black-and-white picture is a gripping reminder of his personal
story, a history that his campaign is using to press the point that
he is not a run-of-the mill politician.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, in the sweltering hall, the real man seemed smaller, at
62 more battered, and not quite comfortable in this role as
presidential contender. He read his speech fast without the polish
of President Clinton or the catch-in-the-throat laugh of Elizabeth
Dole. He forgot to pause for applause lines.
</P>
<P>
   But in an odd way, his delivery almost gave him more
authenticity to an audience, sprinkled with men in veterans caps,
that seemed to be yearning for an antidote to the political
slickness of the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes across as a fine person,'' said Donald Rogers, a
maintenance supervisor and registered independent. ``You know what
I mean? Not a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem difficult for a 17-year denizen of Congress, a
senator who is a fixture on the Sunday television circuit, to seek
the presidency as a Washington outsider, particularly when the
leading Republican candidate is based in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is what McCain is trying to do, playing off Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's close embrace by the Republican establishment and
the governor's extraordinary $36.3 million war chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been an outsider in the Senate,'' McCain said in
an interview, fidgeting in a wing chair in his office, which was
humming with staff at 9 in the morning. As if to prove McCain's
point, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from Mississippi,
quickly took a potshot at him after his New Hampshire speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think, when you're out there raising money right and
left, and then you're talking about how you need to reform the
system, it rings a little hollow,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded that his campaign ``adheres to the letter and
the spirit'' of the bill he has sponsored. The legislation would
ban the unlimited and unregulated donations to the political
parties known as soft money, but would not affect how presidential
candidates raise money.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has raised $6.1 million for his presidential race, coming
in a very distant second to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's record is complex _ raising at once the question of
whether he is too moderate for the conservatives he would need to
win the Republican nomination and too conservative for the
moderates and independents he would need in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways he is well in sync with his party. As chairman of
the Senate Commerce Committee, he just shepherded through the
chamber a measure on lawsuits addressing the year 2000 computer
problem, which was important to Republicans as a way of luring the
high-tech industry into the party fold and illustrating the
Democrats' ties to trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He voted to convict President Clinton on two impeachment counts.
He is a social conservative who voted against the procedure its
opponents call partial birth abortion. In fact, in 1998, he voted
with his party 81 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But on a number of high-profile issues, he has alienated many
powerful Republican constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly takes to the Senate floor to expose the pork-barrel
provisions inserted in various spending bills. He has opposed
subsidies for ethanol, a corn-based fuel that is the
special-interest elixir of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's failed attempt last year to pass an anti-tobacco bill
drew criticism from both the tobacco lobby and from anti-tax
Republican purists. His effort this spring to grant Clinton the
ability to use ground troops in Kosovo was tabled by both parties.
And his campaign finance bill puts him at odds with both the
Republican leadership and conservative constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A consensus has developed that Mr. Bush is the most electable
contender,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. ``And John
McCain is seen as the candidate who will ultimately run into
problems by the key constituencies he's antagonized.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has taken all his maverick stands and sewn them into
a campaign banner of reform that his advisers insist will appeal to
conservatives angry at a Republican Congress that cannot seem to
bring about change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to reform government,'' McCain said. ``We need
to reform politics. We need to reform the military, the education
system. We need to reform the tax code which would lead to greater
freedom for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   And in very personal terms last week he called his effort to
limit money in politics the most important plank of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who I serve believe that the means by which I came
to office corrupt me,'' he said in his New Hampshire speech. ``And
that shames me. Their contempt is a stain upon my honor and I
cannot live with it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, McCain supported another veteran, Bob Dole,
accompanying him often along the campaign trail. In some ways the
two campaigns are similar. Dole, too, stressed his war story, to
show that he was a man of character. But the theme also emphasized
his age. His war was World War II. McCain's was Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   And now, despite the long odds, McCain considers it his moment.
``I just feel I'm at a time in my life when I'm most qualified,''
he said. ``And by the way, I will not be at this point again.''
</P>
<P>
   He traces his reformers' zeal back to his abiding interest in
the military and his anger at wasteful military spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some if it had to do with when I'm really sometimes genuinely
offended, when we spend billions of dollars in pork barrel spending
in the appropriations bill as we have 11,000 enlisted families on
food stamps,'' he said. ``that really genuinely offends me.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians put themselves forward as agents of change. But
McCain's advisers hope their candidate will be viewed differently
because of the compelling story of his endurance as a prisoner of
war in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   McCain still wryly tries to downplay his valor, saying, ``It
doesn't take a hero to get shot down'' or instructing a reporter
not to watch the campaign video of his life and career. (``I'm a
bit embarrassed by that tape,'' he says.)
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign is relentlessly marketing his life story. The
video tape, titled ``America's Devoted Son,'' has been mailed all
over New Hampshire and is sometimes shown before he is introduced
at campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   It tells of the day in 1967 that his bomber was struck by a
missile over Vietnam. Of the broken legs and arm he suffered when
he ejected and plunged into a lake. The bayonet wounds and broken
shoulder he suffered at the hands of an angry Vietnamese mob who
fished him out.
</P>
<P>
   It speaks of the pilot's refusal to accept early release,
offered to him for propaganda purposes when his captors realized
his father was the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific. And of
the beatings and two years of solitary confinement that marked his
five and a half years as a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The video winds through subsequent pictures of McCain in
Congress, at the side of Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater, before
it gets to its finale, drawing an implicit comparison with Clinton.
``At a time when some leaders let us down,'' intones the narrator,
``John McCain's a man we can believe. And believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison is not without risks. McCain acknowledges a life
``full of imperfections and flaws.'' His first marriage fell apart
after his admitted womanizing. He was named in the Keating Five
scandal, as one of the senators who met with regulators on behalf
of Charles H. Keating Jr., a savings and loan operator. He was the
least involved and in the end received only a mild rebuke from the
Senate Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But strategists believe his war story will make up for any
shortcoming. And by September, McCain will be promoting his book
``Faith of My Fathers,'' a family history tracing three generations
of the McCain family _ his father and grandfather were both
admirals.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy is unorthodox. His campaign has decided that
it can afford no more than a token effort in Iowa, the first caucus
state, where the ethanol subsidies he denounces as corporate
welfare are popular.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he is relying on the fact that voters in New Hampshire,
the first primary state, sometimes take a cranky pride in being
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also investing time and resources in South Carolina,
which is emerging as crucial because its primary quickly follows
New Hampshire's.
</P>
<P>
   In both states, he is making a special appeal to veterans. And
in New Hampshire, where independents can vote in either party
primary, the campaign has begun organizing an ``independents for
McCain'' movement.
</P>
<P>
   While some say that the compressed primary schedule makes it
impossible for an underdog to take advantage of a come-from-behind
win in an early primary, McCain argues just the opposite. He says
that if a front-runner stumbles badly he will not have time to
recover as the race moves quickly on to bigger states.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If McCain is a student of campaign strategy, it is also clear
that he has been thinking about how he would conduct his
presidency. At Harvard's Kennedy Center to accept an award recently
for his efforts to change the campaign finance system, he wandered
the Kennedy library, watching old clips of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you,'' he said, quickly adding, ``This is
really premature. But if I were president of the United States, I'd
go back to what Jack Kennedy did.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would hold a news conference every week to defuse the
strained relationship with the press. ``You can't go back to the
days where FDR used to invite everybody into the Oval Office for a
chat. But you certainly could go back to the Kennedy thing, once a
week and say, `What's on your mind, guys? No major announcement,
what's on your mind?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He talked a little more about watching Kennedy's speeches. ``I'd
forgotten how good he was at inspiring people to be involved in
causes greater than your self-interest'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, perhaps concerned at being too rhapsodic over a Democrat,
he quickly added, ``By the way, I want to emphasize it doesn't mean
I share his political philosophy.''

ITALY'S SECRET GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRED PLOTKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a place, at the very geographic center of Europe, that
is home to one of the most refined food and wine cultures in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway, Joyce, D'Annunzio, Rilke and Pasolini all lived in
this place, and yet it is nearly unknown in the United States, and
even in much of Europe. It has been occupied by Julius Caesar (for
whom it was named), the Celts, Attila the Hun, the Ottomans,
Napoleon (who brought French grapes), the Hapsburgs, Yugoslavia
and, ultimately, by Italy. It suffered some of the heaviest damage
in Europe during two world wars. Much of it was leveled in 1976 by
earthquakes. Yet, its people rise again and again, roll up their
sleeves, plant food and vines, and plan for a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Friuli-Venezia Giulia is the tiny region on the far northeast
fringe of Italy where Europe's three principal cultures _ Latin,
Slavic and Germanic _ converge. It is the home of a subtle cuisine
that combines local products with influences that are, literally,
all over the map. The land provides an outstanding array of fruit
and vegetables that are eaten only in season. And the Alps offer
exquisite herbs that women gather to use in soups, pastas, omelets,
poultry dishes and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   The region is also the birthplace of grappa, and the source of
an astounding variety of wines, despite its diminutive size. The
town of San Daniele has produced a sweet, delicious prosciutto for
centuries that rivals Parma's.
</P>
<P>
   Friulian rivers are full of trout, the forests full of mushrooms
and game, the plains planted tall with wheat, rye, hops, barley,
and corn for white and yellow polenta.
</P>
<P>
   Underappreciated culinary regions of Europe don't stay that way
for long (just think of Provence or Emilia-Romagna), and then come
the tour buses. But here, in this utterly distinct and yet diverse
place, the people are careful guardians of their land and
traditions. It feels as if it will stay that way for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   I first went to Friuli-Venezia Giulia in May 1976 to help clean
up after a series of earthquakes and found the people so warm,
despite the terrible hardship they had endured, that I vowed to
return. I've done so often _ I spent much of the last four years
there.
</P>
<P>
   Italians tend to see the region as Germanic or Slavic and not
really part of their own nation, though much blood was spilled to
claim it. Germans, Austrians, Slovenians, Croats and Serbs see it
as some middle ground between themselves and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   I quickly learned that Friuli-Venezia Giulia is deeper, more
subtle and infinitely more interesting than its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The area called Friuli (from Forum Julii, or Julius' Forum)
makes up about 70 percent of the region, mostly in the south, west
and north. The main city is Udine, a handsome, hard-working city of
200,000, distinctly Venetian in aspect. There are more than 100
special little towns in Friuli, like Cividale, which has superb art
treasures, excellent local cooking and wonderful wine produced
nearby. It is also home to gubana, a yeasty cake filled with nuts
and spices and soaked with grappa or plum eau de vie.
</P>
<P>
   The Friulani are fanatically industrious, and have what they
call ``brick sickness'' _ an insatiable desire to build. After the
1976 earthquakes, they rebuilt whole cities.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining part of the region is Venezia Giulia (Julian
Venice), also named for Julius Caesar. Its citizens, known as
Giuliani, resent the fact that most people call the whole region
Friuli. When Friuli was a backwater, Venezia Giulia was a jewel of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Venezia Giulia's largest city,
Trieste, ranked just after Vienna and Budapest in importance and
was the empire's chief port. Cormons is renowned within the region
for fantastic food and wine.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the region speak Italian, and many speak Furlan
(the native tongue that incorporates Latin, Slavic and Germanic
influences), while Trieste has its own singsong dialect.
</P>
<P>
   Trieste is certainly the most cosmopolitan city in Italy. Rome,
Florence, Venice and Naples, for all their charms, are quite
provincial. In the end, Milan is trendy and Euroglitzy. In Trieste,
people with many religions and languages all live side by side and
interact much in the way New Yorkers of every origin do. There is a
vibrant cafe society rivaling Paris' and Vienna's, where literature
is read, art displayed, and the issues of the day debated. This has
always been a city of ideas, and was the first in what is now Italy
to embrace Freud and psychoanalysis. In the 12 years Joyce lived in
Trieste, he wrote ``Dubliners,'' ``Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man'' and part of ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   Trieste is the leading coffee importing and roasting city in
Europe, the home to Illy Caffe and Cremcaffe, among others. It is
also a major spice port: Cinnamon, nutmeg, poppy seeds, pepper and
other flavors entered local cooking as they were transported to
Vienna and Budapest. Paprika came from Hungary. Phyllo arrived from
Greece and Turkey (and also Vienna).
</P>
<P>
   Just south of Trieste is Istria, a large peninsula on the
Adriatic that many Giuliani regard as an amputated limb. In 1954,
most of Istria was handed over to Yugoslavia. This led to a mass
migration of 350,000 Istrians (in a scene that resembled the recent
exodus from Kosovo), many of whom settled in Queens and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous of them is Lidia Bastianich, who moved to
New York as a child and grew up to become one of the city's leading
chefs, restaurateurs and cooking teachers. The dishes at her
restaurant, Felidia, are mostly from Istria and Venezia Giulia,
while Friulian food can be found at Frico, which Ms. Bastianich
owns with her son, Joseph. (A frico is a crisp made of Friulian
Montasio cheese, and is the calling card of most restaurants around
Udine.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The people of this region, a product of so many foreign
influences, are above all a product of their own land _ from the
high Alps to the gorgeous hills of the wine country, from the
incredibly fertile plains to a mostly pristine and fish-rich part
of the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   It is land that gives these people their identities. Not long
ago, I met a 70-year-old Friulian _ a former mayor, a businessman
and quite worldly, yet in love with his region. He told me, with
misting eyes, ``When I go for a walk on the land and then come
home, I almost feel guilty when I scrape the soles of my shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   For its variety, delicacy, sophistication and sheer
pleasure-giving, the cuisine of Friuli-Venezia Giulia is on the
level of the cuisines in Emilia-Romagna and Liguria, Italy's finest
food regions.
</P>
<P>
   If one were to construct a seasonal Friulian menu, it would
begin with a springtime of fresh herbs _ like mint, verbena,
valerian and tarragon _ cooked in omelets, with seafood and pounded
as sauces for meat. The star dish is cjarsons, an Alpine filled
pasta served as a first course that contains about 40 ingredients,
including a dozen herbs, cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate, lemon and
ricotta. In the plains, white asparagus is served with chopped
boiled egg that has been softened with wine vinegar. Orzotto, or
barley risotto, is made with fresh-picked hops. Soft pork sausage
is shaped in patties and sauteed in delicate wine vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Summer means seafood, so fish stew from Grado might be featured,
along with polipo alla dalmata (octopus with potatoes), cozze alla
triestina (mussels in a broth made with thyme, onion, garlic, white
wine, bread crumbs and parsley) and sea scallops broiled in their
shells with local olive oil and thyme. Omelets will contain
zucchini flowers and smoked ricotta. Gnocchi are filled with the
fruit of the moment (apricots, then cherries, then plums) and are
served with cinnamon, sugar and melted butter.
</P>
<P>
   In autumn, delicate prosciutto di San Daniele will be served
with September figs (with grated fresh horseradish at other times).
After the harvest, grape skins will be used to make grappa or to
ferment beets to make a dish called brovada. Vegetable soups are
typical first courses, followed by venison cooked with spices or
berries.
</P>
<P>
   Although polenta is eaten year-round, it is the central dish of
winter. Large copper pots yield slow-moving rivers of this meal,
which is poured onto round wooden boards, where it hardens and is
cut into sections with thread. Stews, including goulash made of
equal parts beef and onion, are supporting players. When polenta
cools, it can be grilled, pan-fried or served to children with
cinnamon and sugar. Hearty soups, grilled pork, stewed fruit and
frico all come to the table, with warming snifters of grappa.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the region's wine. With sheltering hills,
generous sun, cooling sea breezes and skilled growers and
winemakers, Friuli-Venezia Giulia is one of the world's great
zones, although its production is quite small compared with other
regions'. The Collio zone (in Venezia Giulia) and the Colli
Orientali (in Friuli) are the most outstanding. Native white grapes
like tocai, ribolla gialla, malvasia istriana and verduzzo make
wines of distinct character. Pinot bianco, pinot grigio,
chardonnay, riesling, traminer aromatico, mueller thurgau and,
especially, sauvignon blanc have found congenial terrain there.
Often, winemakers will blend different grapes to produce wines of
extraordinary structure, depth, character and finish, like Collio
bianco, a blend of tocai, ribolla gialla and sauvignon blanc.
</P>
<P>
   Friulian red wine is not as well known, in part because most
people associate fine Italian red wine with the Tuscany's Chianti
and brunello or the Piedmontese Barbaresco and Barolo. A native
Friulian red grape, pignolo, is only now being discovered abroad,
and at its finest (by Walter Filiputti and Abbazia di Rosazzo, and
some older Dorigo vintages) it makes a miraculous wine, with
flavors of sun, earth and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Lighter native reds like refosco, schiopettino, terrano and
tazzelenghe are distinctive on their own or in blends. Pinot nero,
cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and, especially, merlot make
outstanding wines.
</P>
<P>
   All of these grapes are used to make grappa. In the early 1970s,
the Nonino family were the first to realize that each grape had its
own properties, and rather than blend them into harsh firewater,
they distilled each grape individually for a range of postprandial
libations of great delicacy. With its splendid fruit, Friuli also
produces some of the finest distillates of plums, peaches, pears,
cherries and apricots.
</P>
<P>
   Friulian winemakers have also invented another blend, fitting
for a place so close to the Kosovo war, yet where Catholics,
Protestants, Jews, Muslims and Orthodox followers of the Greek,
Serbian and Russian churches live in harmony. It is called Vino
della Pace, Wine of Peace. A blend of international grapes, it is
sent to world leaders as a metaphor for coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   As planes return to their hangars in NATO's Aviano air base in
Friuli, the people of this region, who have known too much war and
have chosen peace, will be making the last Vino della Pace of the
century, and will toast to the moment when enjoying the pleasures
of the table and companionship will be more important than finding
yet another way to cause suffering.

<P>
   TAGLIOLINI WITH SAN DANIELE PROSCIUTTO
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   1 pound tagliolini, fresh or dried
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sweet butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound San Daniele prosciutto (half in 2 thick slices,
minced; half in paper-thin slices)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup light cream
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon poppy seeds, if desired, plus more for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
</P>
<P>
   1. Set a large pot (at least 6 quarts) of water to boil. Add
salt, and let boil again. Cook tagliolini until slightly firm.
</P>
<P>
   2. While pasta cooks, prepare sauce. Melt butter over medium
heat in a saucepan or skillet big enough to hold the pasta. Add the
minced prosciutto. Saute just until the ham gives off some
fragrance. Add cream and poppy seeds, if you are using them. Stir
well, then add cheese and stir well. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   3. When pasta is cooked, drain thoroughly (do not rinse) and
then add to saucepan. Return pan to heat, and quickly toss noodles
and sauce until well combined.
</P>
<P>
   4. Serve on warm plates. Using tongs or a pasta fork, fill a
teacup or bowl (6-ounce size) with pasta and then carefully turn it
onto the middle of each plate so that a nest of pasta is formed.
Cover each nest with a layer of prosciutto slices and then toss a
few poppy seeds around the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   FIGS COOKED IN MERLOT
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   12 fresh figs (green or black), peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups Friulian merlot
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh raspberries, if desired, washed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place figs in saucepan wide enough so each has room to cook
without touching. Add wine, sugar and raspberries if using. Cook,
covered, over medium heat for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Using a slotted spoon, remove figs and place three on each of
4 dessert plates. Cut them in half vertically and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   3. Continue heating sauce until it boils and begins to thicken.
When it forms a light syrup, pour over figs and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling the Real Friuli
</P>
<P>
   The food and wine of Friuli-Venezia Giulia are not easily found
outside its borders, but there are places in New York City where
it's possible to sample the cuisine. Its leading exponents are the
restaurants owned by the Bastianich family: Felidia (243 E. 58th
St., 212-758-1479) makes careful preparations of Istrian and
Giulian dishes, including herb omelettes and krafi (potato-filled
pasta with a light citrus sauce), while the calling card at Frico
Bar (402 W. 43rd St., 212-564-7272) is, of course, its frico.
</P>
<P>
   The wine lists at San Domenico (240 Central Park South,
212-265-5959), I Trulli (122 E. 27th St., 212-481-7372) and Babbo
(110 Waverly Place, 212-777-0303) have real depth and quality in
wines from the region, especially whites.
</P>
<P>
   There is a private social club in College Point, Queens, called
Famee Furlane (20-10 127th St., 718-445-4163) where regional
customs are kept, the Friulian language is spoken and Friulian food
is served. It is often possible to dine there (call first). The
Istria Sport Club (28-09 Astoria Boulevard, Astoria, Queens,
718-728-3181), open to the public, serves Istrian specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Cremcaffe (65 Second Av., near Third Street, 212-674-5255) is a
small bar and restaurant where one can sample Cremcaffe, a coffee
that is a local favorite in Trieste. The chef there, Romano
Michelus, usually features Triestine dishes as specials. The
restaurant has begun to feature wines from Trieste's hinterland,
including varieties like malvasia istriana and moscato istriano.
</P>
<P>
   Cremcaffe also serves cappuccino triestino, which you must ask
for specifically. (In Trieste it is called ``un cappo.'') This is
coffee in an espresso cup with a small amount of steamed milk. You
are served a dollop of whipped cream on the side, which is then
stirred in gradually as you drink from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers should remember, when ordering espresso, to ask that
it be ristretto (short), so that the proportion of water to coffee
is what one would find in Italy. If lemon rind finds its way onto
the saucer, throw it away, and complain to the person who put it
there.

HILLARY CLINTON CREATES FUND-RAISING PANEL FOR N.Y. SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a four-day ``listening tour'' of
upstate New York, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton took the
initial step Tuesday toward an unusual campaign to join the U.S.
Senate, which barely five months ago weighed ousting her husband
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Watched by a horde of news photographers, Mrs. Clinton's
advisers submitted a single page formally notifying the Federal
Election Commission that she has created a committee to fund her
exploration of a Senate campaign from the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the committee allows her to raise and spend money for
political travel, polling and ads. Among the committee's first
expenses will be the upstate tour on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say the 51-year-old first lady will reach a formal
decision later this year on whether to seek the seat of retiring
New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a maverick Democrat who has
represented the state of 18.2 million since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have yet to settle on a candidate for the open
Senate seat. The Senate is currently controlled by Republicans, 55
to 45.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, an independent-minded
Republican at odds with New York's Republican Gov. George Pataki
and former GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, has also formed a Senate
exploratory committee and raised almost $3 million. Giuliani called
Mrs. Clinton's move ``a good thing,'' adding: ``Who could have
anything against exploring? Or listening.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also got in a jab at her carpet-bagger status and touted
his own familiarity with the heavily Republican areas of upstate
New York that she will visit this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very significant knowledge of the whole state,'' he
said. ``Every time I've gone up there I've gotten the feeling
people like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., a four-term member of Congress and
Pataki ally, vows to announce his own Senate bid later this year,
and another Long Island Republican, Rep. Peter T. King, is said to
be interested in running. That raises the prospect of a punishing
year-long GOP rivalry that could harm the victor's campaign against
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The latest public opinion surveys offered conflicting outcomes
to a hypothetical Clinton-Giuliani race 16 months before Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International Poll of 705 likely voters completed June
28 showed Giuliani defeating Mrs. Clinton 50 percent to 40 percent
in a survey with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College Poll of 1,131 registered voters, also
completed June 28, showed a virtual dead heat with Mrs. Clinton
beating Giuliani 46 percent to 44 percent. The margin of error was
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a campaign spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said she
will travel across the state in coming weeks to meet with New
Yorkers in small groups and listen to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Her bid to connect with grass-roots voters in her first
independent campaign of her 24-year marriage to Bill Clinton
recalls a strategy she adopted in 1983 when she led a
county-by-county listening tour across Arkansas to build public
support for education reforms. The measures were later enacted by
her husband, the governor of Arkansas, and the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   During her tour this week Mrs. Clinton plans to highlight her
latest political concerns with six ``Listening to New Yorkers''
forums. As she planned the venture, the president will not take
part. He left Monday on a four-day cross-country tour of poor
communities left behind by America's booming prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's popularity soared as she stood by her husband
throughout the year-long impeachment struggle that arose from his
sexual dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and
subsequent allegations of an attempted cover-up. On Feb. 12 the
GOP-led Senate acquitted him of two House-passed impeachment
charges.
</P>
<P>
   GOP strategist Frank Luntz, who is urging Giuliani to seek the
Senate seat, says Mrs. Clinton's loyalty to her husband has
bolstered her political appeal so strongly that it would be a
mistake for a Republican opponent to raise the impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Republicans think that they will recapture the Senate seat
in New York by attacking Bill Clinton, they are mistaken _ it will
backfire,'' Luntz warned.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Mrs. Clinton will stop first at Moynihan's farm in
Oneonta, N.Y. Then she will make talk-show style appearances at the
State University of New York there, a health-care facility in
Cooperstown, a senior citizens' home in Utica, a technology park in
Rome, N.Y., and a union-related event at a four-wheel-drive vehicle
parts plant in Syracuse, N.Y.

<P>
   Appearing before the National Education Association convention
in Orlando, Fla. on Monday, Mrs. Clinton took an indirect swipe at
Giuliani, who supports a voluntary school voucher system that would
let parents use taxpayer funds to send their children to private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who say that vouchers are the way to improve
our local schools,'' Mrs. Clinton told the NEA, a powerful
teachers' union that has long supported Democratic candidates. ``I
say they are dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans have raised questions about her use
of taxpayer-provided Air Force executive jets and about her
commitment to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson led a day-long trip in
New York state by executive jet last week to underscore GOP claims
that Mrs. Clinton had used $220,000 in taxpayer funds to stage 12
trips to New York since January.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's allies are using a site on the World Wide Web to
challenge Mrs. Clinton, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Born in Illinois and carried to power in Arkansas, with no
connection of any kind to New York, Hillary has set her sights on
the New York Senate seat and maybe _ probably _ set her sights even
higher,'' Giuliani supporters proclaim. ``The U.S. Senate is a
place for proven leaders, not a proving ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's campaign Web site, www.hillary2000.org, was set
to debut Wednesday morning to coincide with the start of her New
York swing. The site will feature Mrs. Clinton's columns and
speeches as well as information on how to volunteer or contribute
to her campaign.

HILLARY CLINTON CREATES FUND-RAISING PANEL FOR N.Y. SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a four-day ``listening tour'' of
upstate New York, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton took the
initial step Tuesday toward an unusual campaign to join the U.S.
Senate, which barely five months ago weighed ousting her husband
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Watched by a horde of news photographers, Mrs. Clinton's
advisers submitted a single page formally notifying the Federal
Election Commission that she has created a committee to fund her
exploration of a Senate campaign from the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the committee allows her to raise and spend money for
political travel, polling and ads. Among the committee's first
expenses will be the upstate tour on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say the 51-year-old first lady will reach a formal
decision later this year on whether to seek the seat of retiring
New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a maverick Democrat who has
represented the state of 18.2 million since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have yet to settle on a candidate for the open
Senate seat. The Senate is currently controlled by Republicans, 55
to 45.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, an independent-minded
Republican at odds with New York's Republican Gov. George Pataki
and former GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, has also formed a Senate
exploratory committee and raised almost $3 million. Giuliani called
Mrs. Clinton's move ``a good thing,'' adding: ``Who could have
anything against exploring? Or listening.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also got in a jab at her carpet-bagger status and touted
his own familiarity with the heavily Republican areas of upstate
New York that she will visit this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very significant knowledge of the whole state,'' he
said. ``Every time I've gone up there I've gotten the feeling
people like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., a four-term member of Congress and
Pataki ally, vows to announce his own Senate bid later this year,
and another Long Island Republican, Rep. Peter T. King, is said to
be interested in running. That raises the prospect of a punishing
year-long GOP rivalry that could harm the victor's campaign against
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The latest public opinion surveys offered conflicting outcomes
to a hypothetical Clinton-Giuliani race 16 months before Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International Poll of 705 likely voters completed June
28 showed Giuliani defeating Mrs. Clinton 50 percent to 40 percent
in a survey with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College Poll of 1,131 registered voters, also
completed June 28, showed a virtual dead heat with Mrs. Clinton
beating Giuliani 46 percent to 44 percent. The margin of error was
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a campaign spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said she
will travel across the state in coming weeks to meet with New
Yorkers in small groups and listen to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Her bid to connect with grass-roots voters in her first
independent campaign of her 24-year marriage to Bill Clinton
recalls a strategy she adopted in 1983 when she led a
county-by-county listening tour across Arkansas to build public
support for education reforms. The measures were later enacted by
her husband, the governor of Arkansas, and the state legislature.

MARKET PLACE: BRITISH GOLD SALE ANGERS AND WORRIES SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ ``Gold Hits New 20-Year Low'' has
become an almost numbingly familiar headline here in the last few
months, but sometimes there are concatenations of events that cause
the country to break out in a fresh cold sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England on Tuesday sold the first 25 tons of a
planned 415-ton sale, the latest in a series of central banks to
unload some of the bullion they have amassed over the years. The
sudden influx of gold on the market pushed prices to yet another
20-year low and led to widespread criticism of Britain in South
Africa, the world's leading gold producer. The National Union of
Mineworkers said it would picket the British Embassy in Pretoria on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The depressed price of gold also claimed its first South African
gold mine victim Tuesday. Trading was suspended in the shares of
East Rand Proprietary Mines, which sought bankruptcy protection and
will lay off 5,000 workers, possibly with no severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   And this past Sunday, the new president, Thabo Mbeki, reversed
himself and came out firmly against the International Monetary
Fund's plans to sell gold to help forgive the debt of desperately
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many South Africans, from the president and gold barons to union
leaders and laid-off miners, are furious at the world's new disdain
for the metal. As the black majority tries to claw its way out of
poverty, the falling gold price is severely undermining that
effort. Since 1997, as the price fell from $325 an ounce to the low
of $255.75 reached Tuesday in Europe, the country has lost 103,000
gold mining jobs, according to the Chamber of Mines.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is at 40 percent and 68 percent of black South
Africans live ``below the bread line'' defined by the University of
South Africa _ $170 a month for a family of four. Sampie
Terreblanche, a political economist from the University of
Stellenbosch, said that unemployment had been closer to 10 percent
in the 1970s and the chief culprits are jobs lost in gold mining
and corn farming.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, even a country like desperately poor Mozambique right
next door _ which is regarded by the IMF as a prime candidate for
debt-forgiveness _ is afraid of the fund's gold-sale plan. The
thousands of Mozambican miners here send $50 million home each
year. Every miner has more than 5 dependents, and in rural
villages, his salary may feed 20 people, so the prospect of more
layoffs in South Africa is terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   By the Chamber of Mines' count, eight of South Africa's 16 gold
mines are rated ``marginal'' at $260 an ounce and two are running
at losses, said Roger Baxter, the chamber's chief economist. Mines
here have aggressively cut production costs. The average cost of
mining an ounce of gold has fallen from $342 in 1997 to nearly $250
now; South Africa went from the world's highest-cost producer to
par with the United States, Canada and Australia, but the gold
price has fallen faster than South Africa can retool.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox, gold analysts say, is that world demand for gold
outstrips supply, so if it weren't for central bank selling and
bearish speculators, the price would probably be going up. As
Brenton Saunders, a gold analyst at the Fleming Martin investment
house here pointed out, jewelers, dentists, electronics-makers and
personal hoarders absorb about 4,000 tons of gold each year. The
world's mines produce only about 2,500 tons a year. The 1,500-ton
shortfall is made up by recycled gold, forward sales by mines and
sales by central banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's ability to digest 25 tons is big, so
theoretically, the Bank of England selling shouldn't create a
problem,'' he said. But central banks have 35,000 tons of gold in
their vaults _ enough to keep jewelers and dentists happy for nine
years. If the market believes governments will sell that gold, the
price can plummet well before any sale is even announced.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the trading in gold futures is by
speculators, not users, Saunders said. ``They're driven by
sentiment, and for the last three years, they've been taking
positions on the down side.''
</P>
<P>
   Baxter agreed. ``A 25-year-old in front of a computer in London
who's never been down a gold mine has no idea of the impact of what
he's doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's sale by the Bank of England, which netted about $210
million, was part of a plan announced two months ago by the British
government to sell more than half its gold reserves and to put the
proceeds into United States, European and Japanese bonds. The plan
was widely viewed as a move by Britain to sell gold before the IMF
and other big central banks do the same, in order to get the best
price.
</P>
<P>
   The damage South Africa will suffer from that angers Professor
Terreblanche, who has an acute sense of history. ``In the 19th
century, Britain profited enormously from South Africa's gold and
diamond mines. The Anglo-Boer war was a gold war _ Britain was
losing to Germany in the gold competition and saw our gold mines as
the solution. Now it's the old colonial power that's giving South
Africa another blow.''
</P>
<P>
   James Motlatsi, head of the mineworkers union, expressed a
thoroughly modern disappointment. ``It's very disappointing from
Tony Blair, since his country colonized most of these countries
that are being hurt,'' he said, referring to African gold producers
that will be hurt by a drop in price. ``If he continues, I will
have no choice but to organize the wives of those who will be laid
off and march on British embassies.''
</P>
<P>
   While the governor of the South African Reserve Bank has lobbied
European banks to drop their sales plans, Bobby Godsell, chief
executive of Anglogold, the world's biggest gold-mining company,
and Motlatsi of the mineworkers union jointly lobbied the U.S.
Congress in June to oppose the IMF gold sale. President Clinton
endorsed an IMF sale in May, so they got some sympathy from
Republicans, Saunders said _ not because Republicans care about
impoverished Africans but because they want the IMF to give any
assets it sells back to member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the World Economic Forum's southern Africa meeting
on Sunday, President Mbeki said he favors debt forgiveness but
opposes using gold sales to fund it. ``It can't be right to address
one problem by creating another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 41 nations on the IMF's list of highly indebted poor
countries, Baxter said, 30 have some sort of gold industry,
including producers like Ghana, Mali, the Ivory Coast and Sierra
Leone. The London-based World Gold Council, which represents the
industry, calculates that while the IMF would raise $108 million a
year by selling gold and buying interest-bearing instruments, those
same poor countries have already lost $224 million from the $30
drop in the gold price of the last three months.

 &HT;    Former ProLaunch gets $10 million, new board members
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last year Roger Barnette was just another struggling
Atlanta entrepreneur trying to get his Web site, ProLaunch, off the
ground. Today, he'll announce that his company is the recipient of
a $10 million infusion of venture capital with a strong local
technology pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   ProLaunch asked users to check off areas of interest and if they
selected ProLaunch as their Web start page, they got a new Web page
geared to their specific interests each time they logged on. It's a
neat idea, and for people who want to surf the Web but don't really
have the time, this seemed like an ideal solution.
</P>
<P>
   In June the company came up with a more marketable name, eTour
(www.etour.com), but still directs registered users to Web sites
matched to their interests. Media Metrix, the New York and
Atlanta-based Web measurement firm that has a category for almost
everyone, ranks eTour No. 1 in the category of ``Web stickiness.''
That category also includes high rollers Hot Mail, The Drudge
Report and BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web stickiness'' means that Barnette has developed a site
people like to visit on a fairly regular basis. Once you've
accomplished that, advertising dollars and venture capital funding
usually aren't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Today, almost one year later to the day, the company has a new
name, a new focus and plans to announce the completion of a $10
million round of funding along with some impressive new board
members. At 29, Barnett is poised to be Atlanta's next big Web
player and possible heir apparent in an impressive line of local
success stories that include MindSpring, iXL and WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, WebMD's Jeff Arnold and iXL's Bert Ellis are part of
the Atlanta all-private investing group. Rounding out the group is
Taylor Glover, senior vice president of the Atlanta branch of
Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &AMP; Smith. Arnold and Glover will become
directors on eTour's board. Jeff Levy of Media Metrix also serves
on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Barnette says he and Arnold were brought together by a mutual
friend _ a way of combining companies that is a hallmark of Silicon
Valley's so-called ``parking lot deals'' such as the one that
united search engine Excite with the high-speed AtHome network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had breakfast a couple of times,'' Barnette says, ``and
Jeff was impressed with the business model and how much we've done
with so little resources. I was glad to get the best of all
possible worlds with local money and great connections. It's a
great combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnette says the name change to eTour is part of a new branding
strategy that he hopes to develop. ``ProLaunch didn't really tell
you anything about the company,'' he says. ``eTour tells you more,
it gives you a tour of the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's immediate focus will be on making eTour a
household name. Barnette says he wants to use the $10 million to
establish the brand and improve his product offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been underneath the radar screen,'' he says, ``but to
have these incredible resources that we can leverage is what we
really want to do now.''

WILL CONGRESS FAST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the House narrowly rejected a call for days of
prayer and fasting last month, conservatives who hide behind God in
order to duck serious legislative decisions suffered a defeat at
the hands of moderates who are alarmed about mixing religion and
public policy.
</P>
<P>
   This was good news, countering the political shock of recent
House approval of a Bible-thumping measure permitting states to
allow posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms and other
state-run facilities. That act was supposedly passed to ``return
God to the schools,'' in the pretentious words of House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the prayer resolution may not be dead after all. It fell
only two votes short of the two-thirds majority required under the
speeded-up process used by its sponsor, Rep. Helen Chenoweth,
R-Idaho, to push it through without normal committee hearings.
Eleven ambivalent cowards voted ``present'' and eight members
didn't vote.
</P>
<P>
   That means a clear majority of 275 members, most of them
Republicans, favored trashing the Constitution with a religious
stunt that would do nothing to achieve the stated goal of the
resolution: stopping school violence.
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth, a militant opponent of gun control, insists that she
will try again, one way or another. Keeping the congressional focus
on our presumed spiritual shortcomings in the wake of the Littleton
school shootings is a transparent way to distract us from the
urgent need to pass what Chenoweth calls ``restrictive laws'' that
might inconvenience gun lovers.
</P>
<P>
   The House resolution would have instructed ``leaders'' in
national, state, and local governments as well as in business and
the clergy to call on Americans to observe an unspecified day or
days of ``solemn prayer, fasting and humiliation before God.'' It
described prayer as everyone's ``necessary duty'' and declared it
to be ``incumbent on all public bodies, as well as private persons,
to revere and rely on God Almighty...''
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth predicted that after refusing food for a day and
praying, ``perhaps then love and compassion will replace hate and
indifference.'' She actually uttered this moralizing claptrap on
the floor of a mean-spirited Congress so polarized that members
barely speak to each other or bother to conceal their intense
partisan loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad she is not seeking re-election next year. If the measure
passes and the predicted miracle does occur on Capitol Hill, it
would be the wonder of the world and worth hanging around to
observe. On the other hand, there is likely to be a wait. A very
long wait.
</P>
<P>
   Every member who objected to the resolution first endorsed his
or her own faith in God, acceptance of religious guidance and
belief in the power of prayer. They may have meant it, but no sane
politician is going to risk offending church-going constituents by
sounding irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   But most Democrats shared the skepticism expressed by Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., that Congress shouldn't seek ``the role of
religious director of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional constitutional separation of church and state
kept getting in the way. That separation is not always easy to
define but it is fundamental to our democratic principles and to
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents felt the resolution was too zealous in describing
prayer as a ``necessary duty.'' Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas,
observed, ``Prayer should not be a government-imposed duty... What
right under our Constitution does this Congress have to tell any
citizen that it is his duty to pray? The answer is we have no right
to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., agreed. He argued it is not the
role of Congress to ``initiate, mandate, or manipulate personal
religious expression.'' He also pointed out that the resolution
called for verbal penitence but did not ask for any individual or
organizational good deeds to translate inspired thoughts into
legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, also protested the failure to back
up prayers with a call for renewed efforts to help others. ``Talk
is cheap, and often in this chamber, rhetoric is empty,'' he said.
``Faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, noted that several Republicans
backing the resolution had stressed that the words ``in God We
Trust'' are engraved overhead on the House chamber wall. She called
attention to additional carvings with the words ``justice and
tolerance,'' meaning we should understand our constitutional
underpinnings and respect our diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., added, ``The way for us to urge
prayer and humility before God is by our example as individuals,''
he said, ``not by our political rhetoric as members of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy quoted Matthew 6, verses 4-6: ``When you pray, go into
your room and shut the door and pray to your father who is in
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   But presidential candidate Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, spoke for
the prevailing GOP majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``A prayer,'' he said, ``is consistent with our Founders, our
Constitution and it is unbelievable that we are even having this
debate today.'' Period. End of subject.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, no common ground there.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; More professionals _ many of them parents _ are cutting back
to part time, but at what cost? &QL; 
(at)6 Seated in a booth at J. P. Licks, Katy Abel is trying hard to
ignore the fact that her 4-year-old son has a death grip on her
neck. Six months ago, faced with a hectic workload that kept her
from spending enough time at home, Abel left her part-time job as
features reporter for Channel 7.
</P>
<P>
   But as Abel tries to keep cool with Rubin heading for a meltdown
in the Boston ice cream parlor, she has no regrets. Abel, 40, has
discovered what a growing number of parents are realizing: Working
part time is no panacea for people struggling to juggle the demands
of career and family.
</P>
<P>
   For many, working part time actually increases the stress of
balancing job and family demands, and also exacts a toll on career
aspirations. Even those who have successfully adjusted to a reduced
schedule often pay a price for the privilege _ in one way or
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks that working less is the ideal solution to all
the stress in today's world, but it may in fact cause you more
distress,'' says Rosalind Barnett, a senior scientist in the
women's studies program at Brandeis University who has studied the
issue. ``You have to give up a lot in career advancement, in pay,
in benefits, and a lot of people don't realize that going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett is not talking about people who work part time in
low-paying jobs and would gladly give up free afternoons for
permanent full-time jobs. While the percentage of these
second-class part-time jobs has not substantially increased since
the 1960s, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics, neither has the
number of better-paying part-time positions for professionals such
as Abel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a lot of choice out there,'' Abel says. ``You can
work part time at a full-time pace, resulting in such stress and
anxiety that your children suffer, which did happen to me to some
extent. Or you can work full time and try to carve out a more
leisurely pace that allows you to be less burnt-out with your
children. I'm not sure either option is ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lip service paid to the need for more
family-friendly work arrangements, habits long ingrained in
corporate life make it hard for most professionals to work reduced
hours, even though surveys show that the vast majority wants to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that those who succeed at this kind of part-time
arrangement, usually professional women, do so against substantial
odds. Here are some of their stories, beginning with Abel's tale in
TV land.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Katy Abel
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even before she had children, Katy Abel was the type of reporter
who had no burning ambition to top the 6 o'clock news. Bright,
hard-working, and blessed with the kind of sculpted looks and big
blue eyes that are ready-made for television, Abel came to Channel
7 (WHDH-TV) from WBCN-FM (104.1) as a freelance producer 10 years
ago, to work on children's programming. In 1991, she was promoted
to education reporter, and three years later began covering
parenting issues. Channel 7 offered Abel a three-year full-time
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, Abel and her husband, a benefits consultant, who
works with unions, were raising two young sons _ and Abel didn't
want to work more. ``I said no. I liked things the way they were,''
Abel recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Although working reduced hours was unusual in the frenetic world
of television news, she made the arrangement work by filing stories
in advance, coming in after her children's bedtime to edit them,
and choosing to remain a relatively low-paid talent in a field
where the big money goes to those with contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people I worked with were very accommodating. They
were willing to roll with the punches of my family life,'' Abel
says. ``There were times when I would get a call at 1:30 p.m. from
my son's school: `Sam is in the nurse's office with a fever. Can
you come get him?' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Abel's husband couldn't get away from his work, it was up to
her to tell the producers of the 5:30 news that her story had just
evaporated. ``They would either rearrange the show or they would
look at me desperately and say, `Is there anything you can do
quickly?' ''
</P>
<P>
   And Abel would try to pull a rabbit out of a hat, as it were.
``The parenting issues I covered were often seen as the Fluff of
the sandwich. There were the murders, the accidents . . . and then
what Katy is going to do today.''
</P>
<P>
   There were times, Abel admits, when she felt as if she were
``throwing garbage on the air because I didn't have time to do
great work.'' But that was the trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last fall, things changed. An incoming news director,
recognizing the value of stories aimed at viewers struggling to
balance child-rearing and dual careers, pressed Abel to do more on
her beat, on a tighter schedule. ``At first blush, I was very
excited about this,'' she says. ``But the demands on my time
increased and got to the point where I no longer had control over
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Abel says she was coming home at night ``very tired and stressed
out,'' and her children reacted predictably: They grew ever more
needy of her attention.
</P>
<P>
   One night, when her younger son pulled her down on the floor to
do a puzzle, Abel burst into tears. ``Rubin asked, `Are you mad at
me?' That's when I realized enough was enough,'' recalls Abel,
blinking away tears.
</P>
<P>
   She asked Channel 7 for more money so she could hire a baby
sitter to pick up the children and provide after-school care so
that neither parent would need to leave work early. And when
management declined, Abel left a secure on-air job for the
uncertainty of freelance work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all happened within a week of my 40th birthday,'' Abel says
ruefully. ``But I don't want this to be Katy Abel bashing Channel
7; it just wasn't a good fit for me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Since December, Abel says she has been enjoying extra time with
her children and has kept busy working on a book proposal and
shooting a story for ``CBS This Morning,'' which will air at the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   But, as is common with parents who make similar choices, she
also has to worry about the financial cost of her decision. The
family lives in an unpretentious two-bedroom apartment in Boston
overlooking a parking lot, and her two sons, 8 and 4, share a room
with bunk beds.
</P>
<P>
   Her freelance status means that she and her husband have to
defer their dream of buying a house with a yard. ``Putting things
on hold is hard,'' she says, gently removing Rubin's arms from
around her neck. ``But I'm happier and we're happier as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lise Johnson
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a beautiful June morning, and Dr. Lise Johnson has the day
off, as she does every Thursday, to spend time with her three young
children. But Johnson, 37, a pediatrician in a group practice at
Newton-Wellesley Hospital, doesn't look particularly grateful.
Kjartan, 5, is drawing pictures on the kitchen table, Abraham,
almost 3, is running around without pants, and Lilly, the
1-year-old, is crying in Johnson's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crisis central,'' says Johnson wearily. ``We have two
sick kids, one with strep throat and another with an ear infection.
I was just about to take this one's temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson works 3 1/2 days a week and has a supportive husband.
She says she is pleased with the balance she struck between career
and family demands. But she remains acutely aware of the
trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Educated at Harvard Medical School and trained at Massachusetts
General Hospital, she could have had a flourishing career in
academic medicine. But she chose to work reduced hours after she
had her first child, five years ago. And like many doctors who try
to lead a balanced life, she dropped right off the academic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss teaching, but I don't think about it anymore,'' says
Johnson, as Lilly nestles in her lap drinking from her juice cup.
``I kind of have this attitude _ there's a time for everything, and
right now I want to spend time with my children while they're
young.''
</P>
<P>
   What bothers Johnson more than a lost opportunity to groom the
next generation of medical students is the high-wire act she
performs as a part-time doctor, between meeting the needs of her
patients and reserving time for her children, her husband, and
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a certain amount of guilt in not always being the
person who sees my patients,'' Johnson says. ``If there is an
acutely ill child I'm seeing one day, it's difficult to know you're
not going to be there the next day to follow up on him.''

   On the days when she is home, there are the inevitable phone
calls about work. ``My office tries not to bother me, but there are
times when I feel compelled to check on a patient,'' Johnson says.
``I had a kid who was having severe headaches'' and needed an MRI
to look for a possible brain tumor, and ``I wasn't going to be
there that day. I felt it was important to track down the results
of the MRI and communicate them to the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I had to make at least four or five calls (the MRI proved
negative), and I was needing to do that in the middle of being at
home with a toddler and an infant. At times like that you feel
really torn and resentful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Johnson is luckier than most, in that her colleagues
and her patients understand and support her arrangement. ``I find
that my patients really value my role as mother, and they want me
to be able to have that role,'' says Johnson, as Lilly finally
falls asleep in her lap. ``To be a mother as a primary care
pediatrician is actually thought of as an asset.''
</P>
<P>
   (at)5John Day
</P>
<P>
   (at)7 The same, unfortunately, is not true of most other
professions, or even most other medical disciplines, according to
studies by Barnett and others. While a smattering of companies,
particularly high-tech ones, accommodate employees who work part
time, a 1997 survey of 2,000 professionals found that supervisors
and colleagues do not typically take part-time employees as
seriously as full-time ones.
</P>
<P>
   And that is true for professionals who work less than their
peers but more than what many people would think of as part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think you're a dilettante,'' says Dr. John Day, a
pulmonary critical care specialist who job-shares with his wife,
also a pulmonary specialist, in a private practice in Worcester.
Together they work 80 hours a week. ``Of course that's not
something people will ever tell you to your face.''
</P>
<P>
   But Day has seen the incredulous looks on other physicians'
faces when he tells them that he is leaving early to pick up his
children (he has three, ages 14, 12, and 5) and that his wife will
be seeing the patient for a consult. Their practice has felt the
pinch of not getting referrals from physicians who can't get used
to the idea that the same specialist won't be seeing their patient
every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have dreams of being penniless and standing naked in the
street,'' says Day, half-jokingly. ``But on the other hand, I know
my children very well. I have not missed a single ballet
performance of my daughter's and I have not missed more than one or
two of my son's soccer games.''
</P>
<P>
   Day adds, ``You don't get a lot of `attaboys' doing this. But
that's OK. It's the way I want to lead my life.''

CLINTON IMPOSES SANCTIONS ON AFGHANISTAN'S TALIBAN FOR SUPPORTING
BIN LADEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN C. HENRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has imposed economic sanctions
against the Taliban, Afghanistan's Islamic fundamentalist rulers,
for allegedly supporting Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused
of being the mastermind of the 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The move to block Taliban assets in the United States and to
halt trade with Afghanistan is designed to ``deepen the
international isolation of the Taliban'' and end its protection of
bin Laden, the president said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions were announced amid reports of direct Taliban
support for bin Laden and Saudi Arabian efforts to disrupt a
network of Saudi and Persian Gulf businessmen who have funneled an
estimated $50 million to bin Laden and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who has been exiled by the Saudi government and
renounced by his family, is accused of plotting the Aug. 7, 1998,
bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. More than 200
people _ including 12 Americans _ died in the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who nurture terrorism must understand that we will not
stand by while those whom they protect target Americans,'' Clinton
said, noting that the sanctions will not block aid for health and
education programs or for projects related to the clearing of
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Hakim Mujahid, a senior member of the Taliban faction,
dismissed claims that leaders of the religious militia were
allowing part of Afghanistan to be used as a terrorist base.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any clear evidence provided to us that Osama bin
Laden is using Afghanistan's soil against any other country, we
will do action upon that,'' Mujahid told reporters as he arrived in
Washington from New York for a meeting at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledge that the sanctions will have little
economic impact on Afghanistan, 85 percent of which the Taliban
controls. In 1998, trade between the two countries totaled $24
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the concrete impact, this sends an unambiguous
message of the commitment of the United States to take action
against those who shelter international terrorists like bin
Laden,'' said James Foley, spokesman for the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanctions will ensure that U.S. trade with
Taliban-controlled areas dries up until the Taliban takes steps to
halt bin Laden's activities,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's move against the Taliban was formally outlined
in an executive order issued on Monday, a day after published
reports that bin Laden in October paid Taliban authorities for a
farm near Jalalabad, a mountain city near the Afghanistan-Pakistan
border.
</P>
<P>
   An Afghan journalist reported to the London Observer that he
recently got past bin Laden's security network and found that he
has converted the farm, a former Soviet collective, into a key base
of operations. The farm is a short distance from another bin Laden
facility, a former military base used by the mujahedeen during
their resistance to Russian occupation in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Citing numerous sources, including military and intelligence
operatives, the Observer reported that the Taliban has deployed
fighters to help protect bin Laden in the wake of three
assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the Taliban regime has claimed no knowledge of
bin Laden's whereabouts. U.S. officials _ who put bin Laden on the
FBI's ``10 Most Wanted'' list one month ago and offered a $5
million reward for his capture _ remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without getting into the specifics of our intelligence
capabilities, we believe the Taliban has at least acquiesced with
the presence of Osama bin Laden and his associates in Afghanistan
and has not taken action to expel him or, preferably, to turn him
over to U.S. authorities,'' said Mike Hammer, spokesman for the
White House National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, the State Department ordered six embassies in
Africa to close, saying that ``suspicious individuals'' had the
facilities under surveillance. Five of the embassies have reopened,
but the mission in Madagascar remains closed.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has been implicated in several other attacks. Clinton
administration officials say he played a role in the 1993 bombing
of New York's World Trade Center and the 1996 attack on a U.S.
military installation in Saudi Arabia. Swiss police claim bin Laden
financed the massacre at Luxor, Egypt, which killed 58 tourists in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, bin Laden and his network continue to plan new
attacks against Americans, without regard for the innocence of
their intended victims or for those non-Americans who might get in
the way of his attack,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unnamed sources, the Associated Press reported Tuesday
that bin Laden's campaign against the United States was being
fueled by Saudi and Persian Gulf businessmen before Saudi
authorities uncovered the donations and stopped the transfers.
</P>
<P>
   The money, mostly from devoted Muslims, may have totaled $50
million, the AP reported. The donations began shortly after the
United States put a $5 million price on bin Laden's head early this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, the son of an oil tycoon, reportedly is suffering
from cash-flow problems in the wake of an international effort by
the Clinton administration to freeze his assets abroad.

 &HT;    Health care information varies on Web
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seemingly endless oceans of information _ it is the
Internet's greatness and its most frustrating flaw. Type in a topic
and watch your powerful search engine come back with tens of
thousands of possible links. And it is true that sometimes people
who sail the Net arrive with a surplus of time and curiosity,
hoping for selections reaching to the horizon. But if a user just
wants a pressing question answered, then that sea can seem like an
infinite swamp. Then, he or she can be overwhelmed by an overeager
search engine. One reason to seek out a specialized site _ for
health care or whatever your interest _ is to narrow the view, to
have experts screen out enough of the flotsam so you can find what
you really need. We went to a number of the health care sites on
the Internet, wondering what kind of information would be offered
to an interested, but not expert, consumer. All the sites offer
links to other sources of information. All have lists of suggested
topics and while some had arthritis listed as a subject we could
click on, not all did. To compare, we found their search function,
typed in ``arthritis treatment'' and clicked. Here's some of what
we found.
</P>
<P>
   Adam.com (www.adam.com)
</P>
<P>
   Adam now aims to provide a wide-ranging site for many kinds of
users. However, the company made its name with graphics and data
for the health care professional, so it should be no surprise that
the 10 matches found were pretty specific. All 10 were links to
articles about treatments for types of arthritis: Psoriatic, viral,
rheumatoid, juvenile rheumatoid and so on.
</P>
<P>
   CareData.com (www.caredata.com)
</P>
<P>
   CareData does most of its work with institutions that want
access to its huge databases. But CareData has branched out to
consumers with its Citeline engine, coming up with 52,427 responses
to our query. Some links (like Colorado HealthNet) are pitched at a
narrow audience. Some sound intimidating (Arava Leflunomide
Recommended For Approval By FDA Advisory Committee). And some are
aimed at a broad swath of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Health (www.discoveryhealth.com)
</P>
<P>
   About 25 links came up. Some were technical, but most seemed
pitched at a general audience, including a number of
question-and-answer pieces, fact sheets and some news stories.
First up on the list was a cautionary article aimed at patients
that set the tone: ``In general, if you suffer from arthritis, it
is prudent to approach health claims made by most products with
healthy skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   DrKoop.com (www.drkoop.com)
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to its namesake, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop,
this site is one of the best-known. Eleven links were offered for
our inquiry, leading with a story about federal approval of a
dialysislike treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Koop also proposed
several general articles about the condition, a suggestion that
education is key in controlling pain and several pieces about
particular versions of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Intelihealth (www.intelihealth.com)
</P>
<P>
   Intelihealth is attached to another of the brand names in health
care: Johns Hopkins. The search for arthritis treatment produced a
list of dozens of documents. The first was a to-the-point, consumer
friendly introduction to basic treatments like medicine, diet and
exercise. Others provided lists of specialists, medications and
looks at some new and somewhat controversial approaches like
glocosamine. Intelihealth also offered some articles that seemed
completely unrelated. (For instance, why the stories about breast
cancer?)
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, Inc. (www.webmd.com)
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,100 links came up, starting with a series of
definitions and summaries of articles about drugs. Near the top of
the list were anti-inflammatory medicines like fenoprofen and
fluriprofen, as well as, something called galvanotherapy.
References were fairly specific, some of them pretty technical for
the average layperson.

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ With a ``woof'' and a wiggle of its tail, AIBO
stretches and walks slowly forward, kicking a pink ball in front of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Man's best friend? No.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's most amazing robot? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   AIBO _ or the ERS-110 to the code-name oriented _ is the
Japanese conglomerate's latest attempt to create a new kind of
electronic diversion, in this case home entertainment robots.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the most striking new kinds of tech toys available
as toymakers and computer companies merge their skills to create
new kinds of devices used to entertain us.
</P>
<P>
   Given the prices of many of these high-tech gizmos (the AIBO
sells for $2,500 and is only available through Sony's Web site at
www.world.sony.com/robot), they're at least as likely to attract
adult hobbyists as owners.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no doubt there's a market out there for this stuff.
The AIBO sold out its entire initial production run just 20 minutes
after it went on sale June 1 on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And some companies are anticipating _ even encouraging _ some of
the demand from grown-ups. Last winter, when Lego rolled out its
programmable robot building block system, Lego Mindstorms, the
company created a Web site (www.legomindstorms.com) where adults
can swap computer codes and machine designs.
</P>
<P>
   The basic Mindstorms Robotics Invention System sold out during
the holidays, with nearly half the purchasers adult hobbyists,
according to Lego. The basic system was designed in collaboration
with the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Mindstorms, despite a steep price tag (about $200 for a
778-piece starter set), have mostly inspired only one complaint:
There weren't enough varieties of machines that could be made with
the basic set.
</P>
<P>
   So the company also has been busily spinning off expansion sets
of various themes and machine types to inspire further creativity.
</P>
<P>
   One new add-on set is designed to teach children as young as 9
about robotics and doesn't require a PC for the programming.
Another expansion set allows makers to create a variety of ``Star
Wars'' 'droids. The company is also adding a ``RoboCam'' and
remote-control accessory packs.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, existing smart toys _ and their inventors _ are
merely getting smarter. Last Christmas' biggest hit, the Furby, is
a good example.
</P>
<P>
   The pint-sized digital furballs are stuffed with sensors and an
infrared light source that allow them to notice when a person or
another Furby are in the room, and to ``communicate'' with them,
initially in a nonsense language called Furbish. Over time, Furbies
``learn'' English from their owners and develop a substantial
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   But the racket the Furbies put up talking to each other and to
their owners got to be too much for many parents, and even some
children. It was particularly annoying when the Furbies were put to
``sleep'' for the night, because they would easily awaken and being
chattering again.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Furbies in many households were just switched
off, along with the interactivity that made them different.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Furby Babies being released in August should deal
with some of that annoyance by adding a ``deep sleep'' mode, said
Tiger Electronics' spokesman Paul Christou.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it falls asleep, it stays asleep, unless you turn it all
the way upside down,'' Christou said. The Furby Babies also will
have a higher-pitched voice and will learn English faster than
their larger, noisier, first-generation forebears.
</P>
<P>
   And though there will be no separate technology that makes it
obvious the babies are more developed than the originals, if you
put a regular Furby across from a Furby Baby, the adult will learn
English more quickly as well, Christou said.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has begun selling regular Furbies with new
kinds of fur. The Furby Babies should hit store shelves Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are using relatively straightforward technology
in interesting ways.
</P>
<P>
   Neurosmith's Music Blocks use memory cartridges and five special
colored blocks inserted into a large box to key in chunks of music
and instrumentation, allowing even a very young child to
``compose'' and manipulate sounds in delightful ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyber Cartridges will in turn contain a variety of musical
styles that can be purchased and downloaded through the Internet to
give a child a broader array of compositional choices.
</P>
<P>
   And eventually the company plans to use the Cyber Cartridges as
the basis for a wide array of programmable, modifiable toys that
Neurosmith expects to debut in coming months, including a
foreign-language teacher, company officials said. And the Long
Beach company is beginning to distribute additional memory
cartridges through the Web, a boon for busy parents.
</P>
<P>
   Zowie Intertainment has created two play sets that use
look-no-hands technology embedded in small plastic figurines and
related toys to trigger a graphic adventure on the computer screen,
all without a mouse or keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Move the pirate across the toy ship, and a character on screen
does the same, sword-fighting the whole way. They weren't
explaining how they managed to do this, and it wasn't obvious to
even my questing eye. Suffice it to say, however, that kids won't
care while they're playing with these sets.
</P>
<P>
   The world's biggest toy and computer chip makers _ Mattel and
Intel _ have combined recently to make the QX3 computer microscope,
which lets children create slides for the microscope, then send the
picture to their computer screen for viewing and analysis,
report-making and more.
</P>
<P>
   Given that it's Intel in this partnership, don't expect to see a
Mac version anytime soon of this product, which is a shame, given
the many schools with large numbers of Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel also has partnered with cable network Nickelodeon to
create the Nick Click, a cheap digital camera similar to one of my
favorite toys of last year _ the Barbie Photo Designer Digital
Camera.
</P>
<P>
   The award-winning Barbie camera was combined with a CD-ROM of
Barbie-themed computer material, including ``frames'' for photos,
creative resources and more.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbie camera can take six shots while unconnected to the
computer, and an unlimited amount while hooked up. The girls I
tested the Barbie camera with loved it. The Nick Click should be
another hit, precisely because it gives kids a simple, cheap tool
with which to be very creative in their own ways.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of making computer life easy, KB Gear Interactive is
coming out with a variety of computer toys/peripherals that make
the adventure of learning to use a computer much simpler for small
children, including a couple of durable digital cameras,
kid-friendly colorful keyboards and digital drawing tablets.
</P>
<P>
   KB Gear's SketchBoard Studio is a nifty 7-by-5-inch digitizing
tablet in a sturdy case designed to help kids learn drawing and
animation on the computer. It will come packaged with Disney
Interactive's Magic Artist 2 software to help.
</P>
<P>
   KB also is beginning to sell the JamCam, a digital camera in a
rugged yellow-and-black rubber exterior. Two special
child-friendly, colorful keyboards are also coming from the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Even more interesting, however are the products from Comfy
Interactive Movies, an Israeli company whose Comfy Keyboard
products fit over a regular computer keyboard and allow very young
children to perform a wide array of computer tasks without totally
trashing your machine.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboards work with software to give a child an interactive
experience while presenting a more manageable keyboard, complete
with a ``phone,'' color and time keys and a few other choices.

THIS BATCH OF SUMMER FILMS HAS A SURPLUS OF REMAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer, scanning the movie listings is like thumbing
through an issue of TV Guide. Or rather, like an evening of Nick at
Nite without the shiny, happy irony. And that depressing funk of
dressing up the same old thing in new costumes is slowly settling
in.
</P>
<P>
   The feature film ``Wild Wild West,'' with the tantalizing
exception of making a black man _ Will Smith _ an empowered figure
in post-Civil War America, plays just like an episode of the old TV
show, but with a lot more money. ``Inspector Gadget,'' set to open
in a few weeks, looks halfhearted, as if once mired in making the
film, those responsible realized it wasn't a very good idea after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the point of a remake is to bring back the old
audience while finding a new one, probably those who've only heard
their parents reminisce fondly about the original. Let's conjure a
worst-of-all-possible-worlds scenario: a film version of ``The Many
Loves of Dobie Gillis,'' with Ryan Phillippe as Dobie and Vince
Vaughn as Maynard G. Krebs, directed by original ``Dobie'' cast
member Warren Beatty. (Be afraid, as the ad campaign for one remake
went, be very afraid. There actually is a ``My Three Sons'' feature
film coming, and it stars Oscar winner Michael Douglas.)
</P>
<P>
   And it's true that the summer is generally the time that the
market is flooded with tried-and-true remake stuff. What better
time to pick up the lucrative 12-to-19-year-old market prowling the
malls in lieu of school, as well as their parents, who are now the
formerly-most-highly-sought-after movie audience, the baby boomers?
</P>
<P>
   Remakes of TV shows, comic books or cocktail napkins are a way
to combine these two revenue streams. When it works, as it did with
``Batman'' a few summers back and is now with ``Phantom Menace''
(basically a ``Star Wars'' remake), the profit margin is doubled.
</P>
<P>
   This season works for this kind of film partly because it has
become the period when moviegoing peaks. And summer's also looked
upon as a time when expectations are lowered, or rather, when the
studios hope that expectations are lowered and do their best to
make sure that those lower expectations are met.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, when there's a time way too many movies based on old
TV shows are on the screen _ like ``Car 54, Where Are You?,'' ``The
Brady Bunch,'' ``The Flintstones,'' ``George of the Jungle'' _
there's a stale air of decomposition that can't be hidden, no
matter the number of trailers attempting to generate that new movie
smell.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: last summer's ``The Avengers.'' But because we
can only assume that the cast and director are erasing that movie
from each copy of their resumes by hand, there's no point in
holding that against them. Besides, that TV show-into-movies branch
of movie making _ the Lunchbox School of Film _ never really goes
away, as evidenced by ``Lost in Space'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the remakes sweepstakes also included ``Godzilla''
and ``The Mask of Zorro,'' maybe the first time one studio _
Columbia _ was shoving two such pictures at the same time. But this
year, the genre has returned in a big way, heralded by the movie
version of ``The Mod Squad'' this spring, a movie whose sole
purpose was apparently to restore luster to Levi's sagging hipness
by giving it a fashion show. And appropriately, that was the only
front on which it was a success.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion front is not rational enough for a movie based on
``The Wild, Wild West'' that stars Will Smith, Kevin Kline and,
most ridiculously yet successfully, Kenneth Branagh as Dr.
Loveless. For those who fear that the big-screen adventures of
James West and Artemus Gordon are entirely too close to a
Merchant/Ivory art film, there are also features based on the
animated heroes ``Inspector Gadget'' and ``Dudley Do-Right,'' the
latter being, of course, the latest realization of Brendan Fraser's
ambition to star in a film derived from every square-jawed lunkhead
cartoon character created by Jay Ward.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to constituting a career, as they apparently are
doing for Fraser, remakes can also be used to save a career. Eddie
Murphy used a pair of them _ ``The Nutty Professor,'' which
included a triumphal return performance, the best in his career,
and ``Dr. Doolittle'' _ to reclaim his star status.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, remakes aren't retooled the way ``Professor'' and
``Doolittle'' were retrofitted for Murphy. Rather, they're employed
as a way to avoid working up a plot and as a method to grab onto an
audience's attention through sheer name recognition, like with
``Mission: Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Such movies are about nothing, except marketing. ``The
Untouchables'' was a rare situation in which only a title and a
real-life catalyst, Eliot Ness, were used. Screenwriter David Mamet
used those elements as a taking-off point to deal with the biblical
theme of Good and Evil in the new world of 1920s Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, to paraphrase what Clint Eastwood said in ``In
the Line of Fire'' a few summers ago, that's not gonna happen this
year. These audience-ready titles are merely being used to pacify
an audience into laying out money at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   In the paint-by-numbers remakes, in which not a single move is
made to scare off a potential audience, a certain kind of actor is
required; it's a test of movie-star charisma. Fraser's good humor,
for instance, serves him well in these cartoonish movies. Smith,
too, has the boundless I'm-down-for-whatever cheerfulness that
makes him impervious to the special-effects nonsense going on
around him.
</P>
<P>
   And Antonio Banderas was finally launched as a movie star in one
of those brain-free zones, ``Zorro,'' because he finally got a
chance to show he could make fun of himself. (It made him sexy for
the first time, because he was so unself-conscious.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's sad to see poor Matthew Broderick, who
looks slightly embarrassed in them. In ``Godzilla,'' he seemed to
be trying to sneak out of the frame. He's playing Inspector Gadget,
and his sneaky, calm performances are out of place in these
big-budget noisefests. Watching him, you're not even sure Broderick
would admit to having heard of the originals in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best kind of actor for the retread movie is a
literal puppet or cartoon figure, which is why ``Muppets From
Space'' makes sense. As does ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP;
Uncut.'' And in a rare show of courage for a movie using popularity
gleaned from another venue to get it to theaters, ``South Park'' is
teeing off on the very idea of safeness _ ``Uncut'' attacks the
concept of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Remakes aren't about bravery, though; the closest thing to it is
when filmmakers choose a title or concept that's not particularly
well-known in the first place. That's a special sub-basement in the
remake genre, the movie based on a cult comic almost no one but the
creators have heard of. (Past versions of this include ``Howard the
Duck,'' ``Men in Black, Blade'' and ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles,'' which started as a self-published parody of the X-Men.)
</P>
<P>
   That category's representative this summer is ``Mystery Men,''
scheduled for late July, which revolves around the secondary
characters in a cult comic. The Mystery Men are a collection of
costumed geeks and losers from Bob Burden's ``Flaming Carrot
Comics.'' Even the Carrot, a pouting paranoiac whose mask is, yep,
a big, flaming carrot, used to ridicule them. ``Mystery Men'' is
promising because, like with ``Men in Black,'' there's nothing at
stake in terms of betraying people's concepts of the character. The
cast _ which includes Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Paul Reubens,
Hank Azaria and Kel Mitchell _ is said to have rewritten their
characters, deepening their neuroses, and ``Men's'' first-time
director was smart to enough to stay out of their way.
</P>
<P>
   Not that TV shows, cartoons and comic books are the only source
materials for attempts at finding sure-fire summer fare this year.
There are also a few remakes of old movies in store. ``The
Haunting,'' due out July 23, is a loud, big-budget rejiggering of a
small, subtle minor classic, based on the Shirley Jackson novel
``The Haunting of Hill House,'' which used the tension of being
trapped in a small, terrifying space to its advantage. It could be
presumptuous to assume that the new version will be brash and
deafening. But considering that the update is directed by Jan de
Bont _ the man responsible for ``Speed'' and ``Twister'' _ it's a
bet I'm willing to make.
</P>
<P>
   Most bewildering is Pierce Brosnan starring in the remake of
``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' due out in August. Placing the
plasticene Brosnan in ``Crown,'' in which Steve McQueen showed off
his low-key all-American cool, is like putting Whoopi Goldberg in a
``Godfather'' remake. It's definitely a rethinking. Just not one
I'm sure I want to see. But if a summer remake could give Banderas
a career in American movies, then anything can happen.

 &HT;    Public profanity a national curse
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From ballparks to movie theaters, in cars and in
class, in sickness and in health, we curse. And lately we've been
swearing up a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Cussing made the newspapers at least three times in June: On the
same day last week that a mother's letter in ``Dear Abby''
complained about men swearing in front of her child, the
profanity-filled movie ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut''
opened. And before that a Michigan jury convicted Timothy Boomer of
violating a century-old state law against cursing in front of women
and children. Boomer, who cut loose after falling out of his canoe,
could be jailed for 90 days and ordered to pay a $100 fine.
</P>
<P>
   What the, er, heck is going on?
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, we're getting cruder.
</P>
<P>
   People have always cursed _ witness the 1897 law that Boomer
fell afoul of. What's changed is where we're doing it and how
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't live in this country without knowing how to swear.
It's like the horn in your car. It's built into us,'' says Dr.
Timothy Jay, author of ``Cursing in America'' (John Benjamins,
$14.95).
</P>
<P>
   Jay, a psychologist who has spent his career studying America's
predilection for profanity, attributes the increase in cursing to
more relaxed social rules and greater exposure to offensive
language in music, television and movies. Young children might pick
up some swear words at home, he says, but by the time they reach
school age, it's their peers who expand their off-color vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing are technology, societal mobility and dense
populations, says Dr. Stephen Steinberg, executive director of the
Penn National Commission on Society, Culture and Community at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that breeds a lot of frustration and anonymity,''
Steinberg says.
</P>
<P>
   As well as some of the most cutting-edge comedy around.
</P>
<P>
   Raw language has gotten laughs since long before Lenny Bruce
stood trial for obscenity. Comedians like Richard Pryor, Eddie
Murphy and Chris Rock have kept up that tradition by upping the
ante. On TV, in-your-face animated series like ``The Simpsons'' and
``Ren &AMP; Stimpy'' paved the way for the more intense off-color humor
of shows like ``South Park'' and ``Family Guy.'' And when ``South
Park'' made the leap to the big screen, the profanity count jumped
to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Its plot revolves around elementary schoolchildren sneaking into
an R-rated film, then trying out their new vocabulary on shocked
adults. The movie uses profanities to spearhead a satire about
freedom of speech and parental responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent screening, the heartiest laughter erupted during a
song with fewer than five nouns or verbs that would be printable in
this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' says Mike Kretz, 39. ``It's a little over the
top, but it didn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking societal taboos to get laughs is a long-standing comedy
tradition _ think Archie Bunker's rants in ``All in the Family.''
Depending on your point of view, the ``South Park'' movie could
fall into that category _ or be a 90-minute excuse to pack in as
many four-letter words as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ```South Park' makes a joke of how crude and violent it is, the
same way `Beavis &AMP; Butt-head' does. They take speech to the next
level, to parody,'' says Dr. Joe Austin, an assistant professor of
popular culture at Bowling Green State University.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, who studies teen culture, says the way some words are
repeated in the movie is typical of how teens adapt language, add
new meanings to it and use certain terms repeatedly, with varying
meanings. A 12-letter word that most adults would find offensive
might just mean ``hello, people'' to teens, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Children and women are swearing more in public than they have in
the past, says Jay, who has conducted field studies to survey
language use. A poll of 2,000 teens bears that out: Cursing is in,
said 52 percent of those surveyed by Teenage Research Unlimited in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Chinik, a teacher at Druid Hills High School in DeKalb
County, would agree.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent screening of ``South Park,'' she said the cursing
done by the child characters in the film was fairly typical of what
she hears from high school students. She lets them know it's not
appropriate in the classroom _ but she knows it's hard for them to
avoid hearing such language almost anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were kids, we knew we weren't supposed to curse in
front of teachers,'' says Chinik, 28. ``Nowadays they let language
they use with friends run over in other areas of their life.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that she didn't think the R-rated movie was
funny, albeit crude.
</P>
<P>
   Her companion, 28-year-old Brian Hinsen, hears a lot of
four-letter words as a bartender. But when he first watched the TV
show ``South Park,'' he was so shocked he choked on the sandwich he
was eating.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says: ``I'm much more concerned about violence than I
am about sex and language.

A DARK THEME DANCES IN WITH PILOBOLUS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pilobolus Dance Theater proved as ingenious as ever
when it opened its season on Monday night at the Joyce Theater. In
the past the company has often used its acrobatic choreography in a
playful, whimsical or bizarre manner. But Pilobolus has also been
drawn to darkly dramatic subject matter, and this evening of four
works, one of them a premiere, emphasized themes of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Many pieces by Pilobolus are joint ventures devised by several
choreographers, and their program notes often generously credit the
members of the original casts for their collaborative assistance.
Typically, the program for ``A Selection,'' the premiere, listed
its dancers as collaborators. But the work was essentially created
by three choreographers, Robby Barnett, Michael Tracy and Jonathan
Wolken; the children's book author Arthur Yorinks, and the
writer-artist Maurice Sendak, who also designed the set and
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sendak is celebrated for his grotesque children's
fantasies, ``A Selection'' was not child's play. The backdrop
depicted a quaint town, presumably somewhere in Central Europe. But
it was shrouded in smoke, and the characters were dressed in
clothes that could have come from the 1930s or early '40s.
</P>
<P>
   One soon suspected that this was a dance inspired by the
Holocaust, an impression strengthened by the recorded
accompaniment: emotionally intense music by Hans Krasa and Pavel
Haas, two composers interned at Theresienstadt before being shipped
to Auschwitz and death, and by Mahler, who would probably have met
the same fate if he had been alive at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Selection'' began with the sound of a train. Then five
people (Rebecca Anderson, Josie Coyoc, Matt Kent, Gaspard Louis and
Benjamin Pring) rushed onto a station platform, only to find it was
too late to catch the departing train. Their appearance suggested
they were members of an itinerant theatrical company led by Kent,
and possibly also members of a family. Another person (Otis Cook)
came onto that platform: a mysterious stranger in a black cloak.
When he removed it, he revealed that he was wearing a baggy outfit.
It could have been only a baggy outfit, but it looked a bit like a
uniform: an escaped prisoner's uniform, perhaps, or a prison
guard's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, whose character remained enigmatic, darted busily about,
then collapsed, only to be restored to life by Kent. Far from being
grateful, he appeared to harass the actors, and he literally
stripped Kent bare. Then he did a bit of goose-stepping, but left
it unclear whether this was in earnest or in mockery.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after removing most of his own clothes, he moved
sometimes like a diabolically capering imp and sometimes as if he
were suffering. The members of the theatrical troupe separated,
some (or perhaps all) presumably going to their doom.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Selection'' was admirably ambitious and held the attention
with its unrelieved eeriness. Yet it was ultimately more mystifying
than horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   The characterizations, in particular that of Cook, remained
vague. One was never sure what people's motivations were. Perhaps
the work's creators sought to make ``A Selection'' rich in
ambiguity. Instead, it occasionally seemed dramatically confused.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, Tracy and Wolken also choreographed ``Apoplexy,'' to a
percussive score by Paul Sullivan that made the dancers constantly
fall down, rise up and fall again, as if attacked by bursts of
sonic bullets. The opening images were visually stronger than the
concluding ones. Yet the piece as a whole was startling.
</P>
<P>
   That could also be said of Alison Chase's ``Solo,'' to guitar
music composed and played by David Mills. This commentary on
confinement found Ms. Coyoc trapped behind what looked like a paper
wall. After trying to tear it with her hands, she summoned the
strength to burst through it with her entire body.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chase's ``Orangotango'' brought a bit of humor to the
evening as Kent put on an ape's mask, only to feel embarrassed to
have done so.
</P>
<P>
   He attempted to hide his face behind a pulled-down sombrero when
he encountered Ms. Anderson. But she discovered what he really
looked like and decided she quite enjoyed dancing with this big ape
to tangos by Astor Piazzolla.
</P>
<P>
   The company's season continues through July 31.

BARAK TAKES OVER WITH PLEDGE TO END STRIFE WITH ARABS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Ehud Barak took office as prime minister Tuesday,
promising that he was committed to making peace with Israel's Arab
neighbors and intent on ending religious and social strife at home.
</P>
<P>
   In a marked change from the often fiery speeches heard during
the three-year tenure of Benjamin Netanyahu, the new leader used
words of reconciliation and respect as he laid out his vision for
solving Israel's most pressing problems. To all sides, that vision
seems clear: surrendering Israeli-held land for peace, both in the
West Bank and in the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Barak took the oath of office, members of his
own coalition government criticized him, raising questions as to
how long his unwieldy alliance of religious, secular, nationalist
and leftist parties could hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this day will be recorded in the annals of history as a
turning point in the direction of reconciliation, unity and
peace,'' Barak said in a speech in parliament before presenting his
coalition government for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's speech was as wide-ranging as the problems Israel faces.
From renewing long-stalled negotiations with Syria to signing a
final peace accord with the Palestinians, Barak insisted he was
ready to end decades of hatred and bloodshed between the Jewish
state and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call all the Arab leaders to stretch their hands to our
outstretched hand and bring a peace of the brave,'' said Barak,
using the very phrase often invoked by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our historical duty to strengthen the state of Israel by
putting an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while he called on Syrian President Hafez Assad to put aside
memories of war and work for peace, he had a softer, more personal
message for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The general-turned-statesman, who once dressed in a woman's wig
and clothing to infiltrate Lebanon and help assassinate a
Palestinian guerrilla leader, said he would work ``hand in hand''
with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know not only the suffering of my nation, but also the
suffering of the Palestinian nation,'' said the 57-year-old former
military chief of staff, the country's most decorated soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's coalition government collapsed last year largely on
the issue of the Wye peace accord, which Netanyahu signed
reluctantly and then suspended after making the first of three
agreed-upon withdrawals from occupied West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my will and aspiration to work hand-in-hand with the
elected Palestinian leadership and Yasser Arafat in the spirit of
partnership and honor,'' said Barak, who entered politics during
the tenure of Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated in 1995 by a religious
Jew opposed to the peace accords with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also assured the citizens of Israel, who gave him a
resounding 56 percent of the vote in the May elections, that he
would treat domestic problems with same fervor with which he would
pursue peace.
</P>
<P>
   Under Netanyahu's Likud-led government, social strife increased,
especially between secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews who fought over
state money, the issue of drafting ultra-religious Jewish men and
the the nature of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's campaign stressed his desire to be the prime minister of
everybody and his speech touched on the need to boost employment
opportunities, make education a priority and ensure equality among
the country's 6 million citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is a better or worse person but there are those who are
weak and we have to help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even before 120-seat parliament had approved Barak's
75-member coalition government, Palestinian officials and Israeli
commentators were already warning of possible gaps between words
and deeds.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Barak's broad coalition government of seven
parties could prove too broad. There are two ultra-Orthodox parties
who in the past have clashed with former Soviet dissident Natan
Sharansky's party over how to treat Russian immigrants of
questionable Jewish heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Another coalition partner, the National Religious Party, gets
its support from those Jewish settlers that the Meretz party would
like to see uprooted from the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   And just under half the members of the coalition served in
Netanyahu's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements do reflect Barak's policies and approach, but
it's going to be difficult for him given the nature of Israeli
politics,'' said political analyst Gerald Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's newly appointed health minister, ultra-Orthodox Shas
party member Shlomo Benizri, immediately announced the government
was unlikely to last more than three years because of the
composition of the coalition. The government's elected period is
four years.
</P>
<P>
   A member of Sharansky's Yisrael B'Aliyah party went one step
further. He voted against the coalition government when it was
presented to the parliament, saying he opposed a coalition with
ultra-Orthodox parties.
</P>
<P>
   One Arab member of parliament, already in the opposition, went
to the podium to point out that Barak said he wanted to be the
prime minister of everyone but he did not ask any of the three Arab
parties to join the coalition. Arabs makes up nearly 20 percent of
Israel's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I foresee serious crises on diplomatic issues and on issues of
religion and state,'' Labor party member David Libai, who led
coalition negotiations for Barak, told the Ha'aretz daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as befits their status as the group that lost the most
hope during Netanyahu's term in office, Palestinians reacted with a
great deal of caution to Barak's sweeping statements on the
importance of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words are not bad _ now I think it's necessary to start
implementation,'' said Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian negotiator who
helped draw up the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Barak will learn from the fate of Netanyahu and realize
it is better to be a man who makes history than a man who is
history, like Netanyahu,'' he said.

FLOCKHART'S OFF-BROADWAY TURN IS FAR CRY FROM HER SHORT-SKIRTED TV
PERSONA
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by STAGE-OTHER ACTORS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first of three one-acts that make up ``bash,''
currently running off-Broadway, Calista Flockhart's character tries
to remember a classical Greek word she once learned: ``adakia.'' It
doesn't have a literal translation but has something to do with the
fact that humans aren't able to set our off-balance world straight
``on account we're mortal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the word is only mentioned in the opening play, it's
the underlying theme throughout filmmaker Neil LaBute's ``bash,''
(subtitled ``latter-day plays'' because of the author's Mormon
influence in his upbringing). And it seems even more appropriate
when uttered by Flockhart, who, thanks to ``Ally McBeal,'' has
become a celebrity whom people either adore or loathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortal,'' indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The production also stars Paul Rudd (''Clueless,'' ``The Object
of My Affection'') and Ron Eldard (whose credits list his extensive
stage work and his one season on ``ER,'' but not the widely
lampooned series ``Men Behaving Badly''), but what's going to keep
this show selling tickets is Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   People are curious to see if she can de-''Ally'' herself.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting notice for her short skirts on David E. Kelley's
hit courtroom dramedy, she was an award-winning stage actress
(Broadway's ``The Three Sisters,'' ``The Glass Menagerie'') who
eventually made her way into film (''Telling Lies in America, The
Birdcage'').
</P>
<P>
   But then came ``Ally,'' the dancing baby and the Al Green
daydreams. Subsequently, Flockhart seemed to always carry around
this alter-ego. Even in interviews, such as on ``The Late Show With
David Letterman,'' she pulled and twisted her stringy hair and
protruded her pouty lips. As Helena in the recent ``William
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' the billing might as
well have read ``Ally McBeal,'' what with the way she stomped about
as if she were having an argument with ``Ally's'' Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities are a huge draw on Broadway, although it's usually
movie stars (see recent entries Nicole Kidman, Kevin Spacey).
Television stars have had less success. George Wendt did well with
``Art,'' but Helen Hunt received less-than-glowing reviews for
``Twelfth Night'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Kelley likes to pull his actors from the
stage. In addition to Flockhart, ``Ally's'' Greg Germann was a New
York stage regular, as was ``The Practice's'' Lisa Gay Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times interview, LaBute said that he chose
Flockhart because ``she comes in with a great deal of good will. A
lot of people put a certain kind of trust in her. I want to see how
that works when you lead them into a place they may not want to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   The play ``bash'' is what one might expect from LaBute, a
playwright whose first two films, ``In the Company of Men'' and
``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' showcased his knack for creating
unapologetically cruel characters.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Medea Redux,'' Flockhart offers a solid performance in
recounting, underneath an interrogation lamp and into a police
recorder, how she fell in love with a teacher at age 13. He
eventually lost interest and disappeared. When she finds him years
later, she shows him how she feels by murdering their son.
</P>
<P>
   With a Midwestern accent, Flockhart successfully transforms into
this character and never once channels the spirit of Ally.
</P>
<P>
   The meatiest portion of the play, in terms of script and
performance, is ``Iphegenia in Orem,'' in which Eldard plays a
businessman who finds that he might be fired and has to explain how
his newborn died. This section is most LaBute, as this nasty deed
is a result of a practical joking co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   The final segment, ``A Gaggle of Saints,'' stars Flockhart and
Rudd as a lovey couple on a magical night out that turns sour.
Rudd's character, an all-American type, sees two men making out in
Central Park, and he and his buddies eventually bash one of them.
As he retells the story, it's very reminiscent of the sauna scene
with Jason Patric and Aaron Eckhart in ``Your Friends and
Neighbors'' in which Patric's character remembers the time he and
some jock friends raped an effeminate boy in high school.
</P>
<P>
   As the girlfriend, Flockhart again gives a fine performance even
though the role is not nearly as juicy as in ``Medea Redux.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``bash'' proves that you can take the Ally out of the
Flockhart.

   LOS ANGELES _ Martin Wuttke got a bellyful of Adolf Hitler, as

   That's partly why the first time Wuttke read Bertolt Brecht's
play ``The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui'' _ a thinly disguised
parable about the making of a fascist _ he found it ``too simple.''
As a boy, Wuttke also got a bellyful of Brecht's other plays, which
he found to be ``mostly boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Which gives you an idea of the circuitous route Wuttke has
traveled to star in the renowned Berliner Ensemble's production of
``Arturo Ui.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded half a century ago by Brecht and his wife, Helene
Weigel, the legendary Berlin theater company is making its U.S.
debut in Berkeley and Los Angeles this summer, prior to disbanding
and reconstituting itself under new artistic director Claus
Peymann. The company will retain its historic name when it reopens
in Berlin in December, but will switch its focus toward more
contemporary work.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a run of just four performances tonight at UCLA's Freud
Playhouse, ``Arturo Ui'' will be performed in German, with
projected English supertitles.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Chicago in the 1920s, the play uses the allegory of Al
Capone's mobster rule to demonstrate the thuggish mentality and
criminal deportment of National Socialism. Wuttke, the Berliner
Ensemble's artistic director from 1995 to 1996 and now a guest
artist, has won praise throughout Europe and in Latin America for
his performance as the brutish title character.
</P>
<P>
   Wuttke says he began to change his mind about Brecht when he
read the author's early plays such as ``Drums in the Night'' (1922)
and ``In the Cities' Jungle'' (1923). In contrast to later, more
broadly humanistic epics like ``Mother Courage'' and ``The Life of
Galileo,'' these early works embodied a more ``anarchic'' spirit.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Arturo Ui,'' Wuttke says, ``of course, it's not a play
about the whole Nazi time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a play about the phenomenon (of) how a little man
like Arturo Ui becomes a powerful person in a capitalistic world,
supported by the industry, supported by the bourgeoisie. And by
doing the work on `Arturo Ui,' it became more and more fascinating,
first of all because it's very well-written; it's a wonderful,
German writer, very direct. It's very clever. And so it's become
more and more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Los Angeles is an ironic venue for Brecht's old
company. After fleeing the Nazis near the start of World War II,
Brecht (1898-1956) came to the United States and lived in Santa
Monica from 1941 to 1947. The socialist playwright quickly grew to
loathe U.S. culture. During his L.A. sojourn, he wrote screenplay
treatments with caustic titles like ``Boy Meets Girl, So What.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally considered the single greatest influence on Western
drama in the century's second half, Brecht had only one produced
Hollywood screenplay, ``Hangmen Also Die'' for director Fritz Lang.
Although Brecht's contributions were largely excised from the final
product, the House Un-American Activities Committee, then busy
sniffing out Hollywood Communists, called Brecht in to testify in
1947.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Brecht flew to Switzerland. Two years later, after
settling in the new East German state, he founded the company that
would further his legacy, both as playwright and as developer of
theatrical techniques designed to expose the artifices of theater
and acting.
</P>
<P>
   Brecht wrote ``Arturo Ui'' while in exile in Finland in 1941, en
route to the United States, hoping to score a Broadway hit.
Instead, the play wasn't produced until two years after the
author's death, in Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Berliner Ensemble's production, originally helmed by former
artistic director and playwright Heiner Muller (``Hamletmachine''),
who died in 1995, was praised by German critics as some of the best
work ever from a company whose artistic fortunes have wavered
throughout its history.
</P>
<P>
   Located in the former East Berlin during the Cold War period of
Communist rule, the company had become ``a museum,'' dedicated to
preserving a sanctified image of Brecht and his plays, says Stephan
Suschke, the company's current co-director. &UR;  &LR; Wuttke's own
resignation as artistic director, in 1996, was prompted by his
mounting frustration in dealing with Brecht's daughter, Barbara
Brecht-Schall, who controls the rights to her father's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Brecht's heirs) want to see the plays made as Brecht
made the plays,'' Wuttke says. ``And I think it would be very, very
important to take the Brecht plays as material, and to show that
these plays are not only classics, (but) that this is contemporary
theater.'' &QL;

<P>
   Television stars need something to keep them busy during the
doldrums of summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson's Creek's'' Michelle Williams just ended a run in
off-Broadway's ``Killer Joe,'' and ``The Practice's'' Lisa Gay
Hamilton was playing the title role in ``Angelique,'' about a slave
in 18th-century Canada who burns down her owners' homes, until she
pulled out to take a role in a television movie. (The play is a bit
of a jumble, but there are some nice visual metaphors, and Hamilton
was superb.) Her understudy has taken the role. ``Angelique'' runs
through July 11 at the MCC Theater in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Other TV stars tearing up the stage this summer include:
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Knight: ``3rd Rock From the Sun's'' human cop has joined
the cast of Broadway's hit show ``Art,'' along with Buck Henry and
George Segal. Since its premiere, the play has featured several TV
stars, including George Wendt. Through Aug. 15 at the Royale
Theater in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wolf: The ``Party of Five'' pretty boy took over for
Christian Slater in Warren Leight's Tony-winning ``Side Man.'' Wolf
stars through July 17 at New York's Golden Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   David Schwimmer: The ``Friend'' who became interesting again
this season stars in ``Glimmer Brothers,'' written by Warren
Leight, at Massachusetts' Williamtown Theatre Festival, July 14-25.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Danza: He's had more than his share of sitcoms, but
probably did his best work to date guest-starring in ``The
Practice'' this season. He has also been getting warm reviews for
his role in Broadway's ``The Iceman Cometh'' at the Brooks Atkinson
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brochtrup: Who? He plays John, the clerk on ``NYPD Blue.
This summer, he takes on David Marshall Grant's hit off-Broadway
gay play ``Snakebit'' at the Century Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Polly Draper: She's a stage vet, but is best known for playing
Ellen in the yuppie drama ``thirtysomething.'' She recently
replaced Natasha Richardson in Patrick Marber's sex drama
``Closer'' at the Music Box Theatre in New York.

IN GERMANY, OLDER GREENS BEING CHALLENGED BY `YOUNG TURKS'  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It isn't easy being a Green, especially one
accused of being over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the challenge facing many older members of the German
Green Party. In the 1960s and '70s, they were rebels and
nonconformists. They protested against nuclear weapons, were
arrested and rarely wore ties.
</P>
<P>
   But nine months after the Greens became partners for the first
time in a governing coalition, with the Social Democrats, younger
pragmatists in the party are heaping scorn on their elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough with stories from 1968!'' declared a manifesto signed
by 40 of the self-described ``youth of the second generation.''
``We cannot and will not idly watch the moralizing know-it-alls in
our party from the founding generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent Greens have gone further, demanding the
resignation of a top leader, Juergen Trittin, who is also
environment minister. Trittin, 55, leads the party's left wing and
has unsuccessfully campaigned for much steeper gasoline taxes and a
rapid closing of nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   He is in many respects the opposite of the Greens' other top
leader, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, a popular pragmatist who
passionately supported NATO in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Like the children of many aging baby boomers, the younger Greens
are accusing left-wing traditionalists like Trittin of being
self-righteous, out of touch, and ineffective. In many respects,
the ``second generation'' is rebelling at the Greens' own
anti-establishment roots. Its members favor pragmatism, look down
on protest politics, and sometimes sound as pro-business as Young
Republicans in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough with the rituals of an alternative movement,'' they
said in the manifesto. ``Yes, you waged an energetic if
unsuccessful campaign against big money. Yes, you treated
businesses' share of the wealth as an evil. That was wrong then,
and it is wrong today.''
</P>
<P>
   The party has been notoriously chaotic for years, in part
because its open structure is difficult to control and in part
because it has always attracted a motley array of freethinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Though its roots were in the environmental and pacifist
movements, it has attracted many young business professionals who
favor free markets and less regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the divisions are becoming harder to reconcile. The party
came perilously close to collapse at a meeting in May, when
old-line pacifists loudly accused Fischer of being a warmonger, and
one member hit him on the ear with a balloon filled with red paint.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tide has turned, with party pragmatists and freer-market
advocates arguing that the party needs to overhaul its style and
its ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not an opposition party any more, and we have to accept
that,'' said Cem Ozdemir, a Parliament member from
Baden-Wuerttemberg.
</P>
<P>
   Ozdemir, 33, who signed the manifesto, said that the Greens were
in danger of losing young voters. Thanks to its unorthodox image _
harking back to the days when Fischer took his first oath of office
in tennis shoes or to campaign posters that featured green condoms
with smiley faces _ the Greens have usually captured most of the
votes from first-time voters.
</P>
<P>
   But youth support has slipped considerably. In state elections
in February in Hesse, the right-of-center Christian Democrats
received the most first-time votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greens have to get rid of the image that they are against
everything that is fun,'' Ozdemir said, alluding to support for
high gasoline taxes and speed limits on the Autobahn.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the rebels are from the younger generation. Fischer is
51, but has long embodied a pragmatism and an appreciation for
stimulating business.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, one of Trittin's most vehement critics is Oswald
Metzger, the party's top expert on budget policy, who is 54.
Metzger shocked party members late last month by demanding
Trittin's resignation. ``Trittin is for many people a typical
left-wing Green,'' he said in an interview, adding that the Greens
would immediately gain 1 or 2 percentage points in the next
election if Trittin departed.
</P>
<P>
   Like the younger Greens, Metzger preaches passionately about the
need for lower taxes and less intrusive government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe competitive markets are generally better at
regulating than the government,'' he said. ``I am not in favor of
as radical a market culture as the United States. But I do see the
need for less regulation, more competition and for greater
self-responsibility in health and social needs.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how the battle will play out. In response to
the manifesto signed by the 40 self-described young turks, another
group of 40 Greens, who also claim to represent the younger
generation, issued a declaration from the left. Its title, a
reference to the vaguely pro-business ``center'' espoused by
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, was ``Get Out of the New Middle.''

MIXING UP PERCEPTIONS, ON CANVAS AND OFF, IN CALGARY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada )   By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Off the canvas, Chris Cran can be as elusive as one of his
paintings. Certainly he exhibits all the trappings of an art world
denizen: black jeans, black boots, black leather jacket. The
tousled curls framing a crop of serious features. The charm. The
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But like the work for which this Canadian painter is known,
first impressions of him are just the beginning. If you shift your
focus, characteristics begin to morph into something quite
different, even disconcerting. A slice of color peeks out from
behind his collar. His eyes, once professorial, now dart and dance
as he seduces his audience with a huckster's grin. The hipster is
betrayed by an Old World courtesy, the bad boy by a heart of gold.
</P>
<P>
   It's the power of illusion, says the artist, who has built a
career on tampering with people's perceptions. Which is what
painting is all about.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a busy year for Cran. Since January, the 49-year-old
painter has built a new studio in Calgary, had a one-man show of
new works and witnessed the opening of a retrospective, ``Chris
Cran: Surveying the Damage, 1977-97.'' After passing through some
of Canada's smaller cities, the exhibition settles down Thursday
for a three-month stay at the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art
in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just circumstances,'' Cran said, as if to deny any hand
he might have had in the good fortune. ``My obligations are done
for my show, I don't have to do anything in particular. I just go
into the studio and the paintings just sort of happen. It's very
odd.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy for him to just kick back and bask in the
glory. But he doesn't, despite the critical acclaim. The Globe and
Mail called him ``a superb contemporary abstractionist ... a big,
irrepressibly curious painter, and an utter un-Romantic'' in ``the
big art-historical line of descent from Picasso to Jasper Johns.''
</P>
<P>
   Cran is a westerner, and to gain the full-blown commercial
success that has eluded him, he needs to break through the barrier
that is the east, in Toronto, Montreal and even New York, before
the gods of fame and fortune make their peace. He is loath to admit
such yearnings, a posture that is a little puzzling since the
paintings that catapulted him to national recognition are
self-portraits depicting him as a bumptious media hound. In short,
they were about nothing if not the desire to be famous.
</P>
<P>
   Cran says he has chosen not to promote himself aggressively and
has stubbornly remained in the west, closer to his roots, where
life is a little easier and rents a little lower. He paints in a
converted firehouse, holds court in coffee shops and socializes
with nationally respected artists who also prefer to live off the
beaten path. His only foray into New York was a group show in 1992
at the 49th Parallel, a gallery, now defunct, that was owned by his
Toronto dealer, Jared Sable.
</P>
<P>
   But in his own stealthy way, Cran isn't sitting still. He
followed the retrospective as it traveled east from the Kelowna Art
Gallery in British Columbia, near his childhood home, Salmon Arm,
to locales as inhospitable as Saskatoon, where the night air
blasted at a mind-numbing 40 below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is the most important painter in Canada in his
generation,'' said his friend Christian Eckart, a painter and
former Calgarian who made a name for himself in New York. ``Chris
is the quality artist, and has the quality of the project behind
him, that is picked up and pushed out to an international level.
But that doesn't happen to an artist in western Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the German Pop artist to whom Cran is often
compared, Eckart continued: ``In a sense he's a figure like Gerhard
Richter. Richter was a national hero for the first decade of his
career, a European hero for the second decade, and for the third
decade an American hero. It was kind of hanging around long enough
that made it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Nemiroff, curator of contemporary art at the National
Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, which has three of his paintings,
agreed. ``Those people who know him really respect his work,'' she
said. ``He's quite rigorous, very alive, very vital, not an
academic artist at all. But Canada is very compartmentalized. The
scene is very small, very isolated. It's just the regionalism of
the country. It doesn't mean they're not terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   If Richter's time line is a valid indicator, then Cran is nearly
there. The retrospective begins with paintings created before he
graduated from Alberta College of Art in 1979, after which he read
electric meters to support a wife and six children. It progresses
through the self-portraits that brought him success in 1984 after
his marriage ended; the startling shift to stripe and dot paintings
in 1989, and the turn to abstraction in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major thing that ties all his work together is the
collapsing of photography and painting into each other and seeing
what happens,'' said Nancy Tousley, art critic for The Calgary
Herald, who has followed Cran's career since college. ``The studio
is a bit like a lab for him. He is always kind of experimenting.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this experimentation is Cran's fascination with
framing devices and the need for the human eye to create something
_ anything _ where nothing discernible exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eye loves to apprehend space,'' he said, ``something that
visually is not materially how it appears to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on he experimented with Photo Realism, first with
self-portraits, then by blowing up photographs of familiar images
like hand gestures and painting them with dots so that they looked
like outsized, grainy newspaper halftones. Solid and bold at first
glance, they dissolve into abstraction as the viewer moves away.
Ditto for the line paintings, which are static when the viewer
stares at them head on but become three-dimensional as soon as the
eyes look left and right.
</P>
<P>
   Later he transformed nothing more than dark backgrounds, clear
gel and broad brush movements into reflections of pure light. The
works, mercurial and industrial, brought to mind the perfectly
coiffed and lacquered hair of a beautiful woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like magic, a very subtle and elusive thing,'' Ms.
Tousley said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Cran has again turned in another direction. His
latest works, first displayed in January at the Trepanier Baer
Gallery in Calgary, piled up portraiture, still life and landscape,
often in the same painting. These new paintings were ``poignant and
poetic, a kind of visual synesthesia'' along the lines of ``a Dylan
Thomas poem,'' Ms. Tousley said. The National Gallery, hearing the
good news, sent curators to Calgary to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just in the ideal situation,'' Cran said. ``No painter's
block, my time is my own. And it's rolling. That's when it gets
fun.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak used his swearing-in
speech Tuesday to put peacemaking at the top of the nation's
agenda, inviting Arab leaders to help forge a ``a peace of the
brave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is more important in my view than that supreme mission
_ putting an end to the 100-year conflict in the Middle East,''
Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on all the region's leaders to stretch out their hands
to meet our outstretched hands and forge a peace of the brave,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said his new government was determined to advance
negotiations with Syria ``as quickly as possible'' on the basis of
United Nations land-for-peace resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he planned to hold talks with Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat, Jordan's King Abdullah and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and meet President Clinton in Washington in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The overtures confirmed expectations that Barak's government_ a
hodgepodge of peaceniks, Russian immigrants, ultra-Orthodox and
pro-settlers _ would give priority to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   That process has been shaken badly by three years of hard-line
policies pursued by the outgoing prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, whom Barak defeated in elections May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning 56 percent of the vote _ considered a landslide in
Israel's fractious political arena _ Barak has repeatedly promised
to kick start negotiations with the Palestinians, to renew moribund
peace talks with the Syrians and to ``bring (Israeli) boys home''
from a strip in southern Lebanon Israel has occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed overture to Syrian President Hafez Assad &UR; ,  &LR; Barak
called on the Arab leader to put war behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tough and bitter enemies on the battlefield,'' Barak
said. ``The time has come to build an open and brave peace that
will ensure the future and security of our peoples, our children
and our grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad, on a visit to Moscow, issued a joint communique with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin praising Barak's leadership as an
opportunity ``for constructive efforts toward a comprehensive and
just peace in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Palestinians, Barak vowed to come to an ``arrangement for
coexistence, freedom, prosperity and good neighborliness'' and
assured Palestinians Israel's desire for peace with them was on par
with its desire for peace with other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reaching a permanent agreement with the Palestinians and
achieving peace with Syria and Lebanon are equally vital and urgent
in my eyes,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   The words were seen as an attempt to soothe Palestinian fears
that they will be sidelined while Israel pursues peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The swearing-in ceremony, which took place at the Knesset,
Israel's parliament, Tuesday afternoon, signaled the official end
of the Netanyahu government and the beginning of a Barak government
that will include 17 ministers. A new Knesset speaker, Avraham
Burg, was elected by a vote of 110 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously sidelined in Barak's new government were two
fellow Labor Party members most closely associated with previous
peace deals reached with the Palestinians _ Shimon Peres and Yossi
Beilin.
</P>
<P>
   Peres, a former prime minister and advocate of peace deals with
the Palestinians, was appointed minister for regional development,
a new post seemingly created to give the veteran Laborite something
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin, a leading Israeli dove, was made justice minister, a
post far removed from the high-powered bargaining tables of the
peace negotiations. Both men had been natural candidates for the
foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barak appointed David Levy, a member of his One Israel
alliance, as foreign minister, a choice most analysts said amounted
to putting a yes-man into the spot most likely to determine the
kind of peace Israel ultimately makes with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments and the style in which they were made were in
keeping with Barak's reputation as a gruff military man, analysts
here said.
</P>
<P>
   One commentator, Nahum Barnea of the daily Yediot Ahronot, wrote
that Barak wants to lead ``with a commando knife between his
teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Peres said later that he would stick to his new job only if he
could use the post to advance peace. ``I'll do everything to
promote the peace process,'' he said. ``That's my path and will.''
</P>
<P>
   Beilin, behind nearly every peace initiative with the
Palestinians since the first agreement in 1993, said he would
approach his new post ``with a feeling of holy awe'' and
``determination to fortify the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's government, made up of 75 members of Israel's 120-member
Knesset, is the widest in recent Israeli history. Despite the fact
that it is made up of parties with different, and even competing,
agendas, its breadth means that no one party can bring the
government down by quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Such a comfortable majority will give Barak strength to make
tough decisions in peacemaking, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But it may also make negotiations much more slow-going: Barak
must find a consensus within his own coalition before he can make a
deal with his Arab interlocutors. Finding that internal consensus
may require adopting some hard negotiating lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can expect less domestic opposition to whatever the
government agrees on,'' said Efraim Inbar, director of the BESA
Center for Strategic Studies, Bar-Ilan University. ``But they could
have to agree on less in order to get a consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Barak has kept the details of his approach to
peacemaking largely to himself.
</P>
<P>
   But he has set tough terms for a final peace deal with the
Palestinians, including insistence that Israel retain sovereignty
over all of Jerusalem and in large swaths of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech Tuesday, he professed sympathy for
Palestinians, but kept vague his recipe for peace with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know not only the suffering of my nation, but I recognize
the suffering of the Palestinian people,'' Barak said. ``It is my
desire and intention to put an end to violence and suffering and to
work with the elected Palestinian leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Syria, Barak has pledged to negotiate but stopped
short of stating how much territory on the Golan Heights he is
willing to trade for peace.
</P>
<P>
   And he has pledged to quit Lebanon without saying how.
</P>
<P>
   The BESA Center's Inbar said he expects Barak to be much less
willing to give up territory than many of his fellow Laborites, a
stand which Inbar says reflects the opinions of Israelis at the
political center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barak wants to make very minimal concessions,
particularly in the first stage,'' said Inbar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, bulldozers cleared land Monday for a planned Jewish
settlement in the Jerusalem Arab neighborhood of Ras el-Amud. Since
his election, Barak has kept quiet about the project, funded by
Miami millionaire Irving Moskovitz.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Haim Ramon, the incoming minister in charge of
Jerusalem and a leading Israeli dove, suggested the new prime
minister would cancel the controversial building of high rise
apartments for Jews there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to build in Ras al Amud,'' Ramon told Israel
Radio. ``It's a mistake.''

 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ ``Gold Hits New 20-Year Low'' has
become an almost numbingly familiar headline here in the last few
months, but sometimes there are concatenations of events that cause
the country to break out in a fresh cold sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England on Tuesday sold the first 25 tons of a
planned 415-ton sale, the latest in a series of central banks to
unload some of the bullion they have amassed over the years. The
sudden influx of gold on the market pushed prices to yet another
20-year low and led to widespread criticism of Britain in South
Africa, the world's leading gold producer. The National Union of
Mineworkers said it would picket the British Embassy in Pretoria on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The depressed price of gold also claimed its first South African
gold mine victim Tuesday. Trading was suspended in the shares of
East Rand Proprietary Mines, which sought bankruptcy protection and
will lay off 5,000 workers, possibly with no severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   And this past Sunday, the new president, Thabo Mbeki, reversed
himself and came out firmly against the International Monetary
Fund's plans to sell gold to help forgive the debt of desperately
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many South Africans, from the president and gold barons to union
leaders and laid-off miners, are furious at the world's new disdain
for the metal. As the black majority tries to claw its way out of
poverty, the falling gold price is severely undermining that
effort. Since 1997, as the price fell from $325 an ounce to the low
of $255.75 reached Tuesday in Europe, the country has lost 103,000
gold mining jobs, according to the Chamber of Mines.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is at 40 percent and 68 percent of black South
Africans live ``below the bread line'' defined by the University of
South Africa _ $170 a month for a family of four. Sampie
Terreblanche, a political economist from the University of
Stellenbosch, said that unemployment had been closer to 10 percent
in the 1970s and the chief culprits are jobs lost in gold mining
and corn farming.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, even a country like desperately poor Mozambique right
next door _ which is regarded by the IMF as a prime candidate for
debt-forgiveness _ is afraid of the fund's gold-sale plan. The
thousands of Mozambican miners here send $50 million home each
year. Every miner has more than 5 dependents, and in rural
villages, his salary may feed 20 people, so the prospect of more
layoffs in South Africa is terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   By the Chamber of Mines' count, eight of South Africa's 16 gold
mines are rated ``marginal'' at $260 an ounce and two are running
at losses, said Roger Baxter, the chamber's chief economist. Mines
here have aggressively cut production costs. The average cost of
mining an ounce of gold has fallen from $342 in 1997 to nearly $250
now; South Africa went from the world's highest-cost producer to
par with the United States, Canada and Australia, but the gold
price has fallen faster than South Africa can retool.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox, gold analysts say, is that world demand for gold
outstrips supply, so if it weren't for central bank selling and
bearish speculators, the price would probably be going up. As
Brenton Saunders, a gold analyst at the Fleming Martin investment
house here pointed out, jewelers, dentists, electronics-makers and
personal hoarders absorb about 4,000 tons of gold each year. The
world's mines produce only about 2,500 tons a year. The 1,500-ton
shortfall is made up by recycled gold, forward sales by mines and
sales by central banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's ability to digest 25 tons is big, so
theoretically, the Bank of England selling shouldn't create a
problem,'' he said. But central banks have 35,000 tons of gold in
their vaults _ enough to keep jewelers and dentists happy for nine
years. If the market believes governments will sell that gold, the
price can plummet well before any sale is even announced.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the trading in gold futures is by
speculators, not users, Saunders said. ``They're driven by
sentiment, and for the last three years, they've been taking
positions on the down side.''
</P>
<P>
   Baxter agreed. ``A 25-year-old in front of a computer in London
who's never been down a gold mine has no idea of the impact of what
he's doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's sale by the Bank of England, which netted about $210
million, was part of a plan announced two months ago by the British
government to sell more than half its gold reserves and to put the
proceeds into United States, European and Japanese bonds. The plan
was widely viewed as a move by Britain to sell gold before the IMF
and other big central banks do the same, in order to get the best
price.
</P>
<P>
   The damage South Africa will suffer from that angers Professor
Terreblanche, who has an acute sense of history. ``In the 19th
century, Britain profited enormously from South Africa's gold and
diamond mines. The Anglo-Boer war was a gold war _ Britain was
losing to Germany in the gold competition and saw our gold mines as
the solution. Now it's the old colonial power that's giving South
Africa another blow.''
</P>
<P>
   James Motlatsi, head of the mineworkers union, expressed a
thoroughly modern disappointment. ``It's very disappointing from
Tony Blair, since his country colonized most of these countries
that are being hurt,'' he said, referring to African gold producers
that will be hurt by a drop in price. ``If he continues, I will
have no choice but to organize the wives of those who will be laid
off and march on British embassies.''
</P>
<P>
   While the governor of the South African Reserve Bank has lobbied
European banks to drop their sales plans, Bobby Godsell, chief
executive of Anglogold, the world's biggest gold-mining company,
and Motlatsi of the mineworkers union jointly lobbied the U.S.
Congress in June to oppose the IMF gold sale. President Clinton
endorsed an IMF sale in May, so they got some sympathy from
Republicans, Saunders said _ not because Republicans care about
impoverished Africans but because they want the IMF to give any
assets it sells back to member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the World Economic Forum's southern Africa meeting
on Sunday, President Mbeki said he favors debt forgiveness but
opposes using gold sales to fund it. ``It can't be right to address
one problem by creating another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 41 nations on the IMF's list of highly indebted poor
countries, Baxter said, 30 have some sort of gold industry,
including producers like Ghana, Mali, the Ivory Coast and Sierra
Leone. The London-based World Gold Council, which represents the
industry, calculates that while the IMF would raise $108 million a
year by selling gold and buying interest-bearing instruments, those
same poor countries have already lost $224 million from the $30
drop in the gold price of the last three months.

AFTER JEFFERSON, A QUESTION NOW ABOUT WASHINGTON AND A YOUNG
SLAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, in 34th graf, spelling and caps style are from quoted
source.)  
(gm) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did George Washington father a son with Venus, a young slave who
lived on the estate of his brother, John Augustine Washington?
</P>
<P>
   Three descendants of Venus' son, who was called West Ford, say
that according to a family tradition two centuries old, George
Washington was West Ford's father. They hope to develop DNA
evidence from Washington family descendants and his hair samples to
bolster their case.
</P>
<P>
   Historians so far are skeptical, saying there is no documentary
evidence to suggest that Washington ever met Venus, whose son was
born four or five years before he became president, and several
reasons to consider any such liaison improbable. In addition,
Washington, who was 26 when he married Martha, then 27, had no
children with her. But Martha bore four children in her first
marriage, suggesting that Washington may have been sterile.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, reason to believe that if the child's father
was not Washington, it might have been someone closely related to
him. The cousins' claim has several elements of truth, enough to
set up a historical mystery as to the identity of West Ford's
father and to add a new strand to the emerging links between the
black and white sides of slave-owning families.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tradition was passed down with a warning to tell no
white person, the present generation of West Ford's descendants has
spoken freely of their ancient secret. They are doing so again
after DNA evidence, reported last November, supported the tradition
among descendants of Sally Hemings, a slave on Thomas Jefferson's
estate, that Jefferson fathered her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When West Ford was a little boy he heard the slaves talking
about how much he looked like George Washington,'' said Linda
Bryant, a health writer and pharmaceutical representative who lives
in Aurora, Colo. Ms. Bryant is repeating the story her mother,
Elise Ford Allen, heard from Mrs. Allen's grandfather, Maj. George
W. Ford, a grandson of West Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told she was his personal sleep partner and that when
it was obvious she was pregnant he no longer slept with her,'' Ms.
Bryant said, referring to her great-grandfather's statements about
Venus. ``When she was asked who fathered her child, she replied
George Washington was the father.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bryant and her sister Janet Allen, an editor with The
Traveler Weekly of Peoria, have been trying to arrange a DNA test
to compare West Ford's descendants with those of the Washington
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the heirs of George Washington on the slave side and we
can't get a Washington to come forward,'' Ms. Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bryant and Ms. Allen have a distant cousin, Judith S.
Burton, a retired schoolteacher who lives in Alexandria, Va. Dr.
Burton, who has a doctorate in education, is a great granddaughter
of John Bell Ford, George Ford's brother. The cousins say that they
have known one another only since 1994, but that Dr. Burton had
been told the same story by her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother used to tell us all the time when we were very
young that West Ford was the son of George Washington,'' Dr. Burton
said. ``His mother was Venus. Venus was the daughter of Jenny who
was the servant to Hannah Washington, George Washington's
sister-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Oral traditions like this have won a new respect in light of the
Jefferson-Hemings liaison, which until the DNA tests was dismissed
by most historians of Jefferson. But Washington historians have not
so far found any evidence to support the idea that George
Washington might have fathered a child with a slave.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he was protective of his reputation, which the
exposure of an extramarital relationship could have impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Washington had an acute self-awareness of his
importance to a young, untested nation,'' said Dr. Jean B. Lee, a
historian at the University of Wisconsin who is an expert on Mount
Vernon and its slaves. ``He watched and modeled his behavior very
carefully, and that would not comport with a liaison.''
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is no evidence that George Washington ever
met Venus. Unlike Sally Hemings, who was a personal attendant of
Jefferson, Venus lived on a distant estate belonging to
Washington's brother, John Augustine Washington. The plantation was
at Bushfield, one and a half to two day's hard riding from
Washington's home at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   To relate their family tradition to known historical facts, Ms.
Bryant and Ms. Allen have suggested that George Washington visited
his brother in April 1784 for the funeral of John Augustine's
17-year-old son, also named Augustine, who was killed by a
classmate in an accident with a loaded gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that is when he had the relationship with Venus,''
Ms. Bryant said. ``Venus was made available to him for his
comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   But historians disagree. Mary V. Thompson, a research specialist
at Mount Vernon, said she had consulted many records but could find
no evidence that Washington and Venus were ever in the same place
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   West Ford, Venus' son, seems to have been born before June 1784,
or possibly before November 1785, according to an ambiguous
statement in the will of Hannah Washington, John Augustine's wife,
Ms. Thompson said. Only the later date allows any possibility that
George Washington was the father: the general was away fighting the
Revolutionary War and did not return home to Mount Vernon until
Christmas Eve of 1783.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To investigate the cousins' claim, Ms. Thompson said she had
tried to establish Washington's whereabouts for every day in 1784
from his correspondence and for 1785 from his diary. There are
several gaps of a few days in 1784, in which a person could perhaps
have dashed over to Bushfield and back.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington, though officially in retirement, was
extraordinarily busy during this period. His house was so full of
visitors that he rarely sat down to dine with his wife alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called Mount Vernon a well-resorted tavern,'' said Dr.
Dorothy Twohig, who was chief editor of Washington's papers for 30
years. ``It just seems to me, knowing Washington very well, that
whatever the moral aspects, this is a question of politics.
Washington was an extremely careful man, very conscious of his
reputation. He would have been extremely unlikely to have gotten
involved in anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bryant, who is writing a book about her family tradition, is
trying to develop DNA evidence and has consulted Dr. Eugene Foster,
the pathologist who took DNA samples in the Jefferson family case.
Foster told her he would need DNA from men in the all-male line of
descent from West Ford and the Washington families.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bryant said she had a male relative in an all-male line of
descent from West Ford, and that she is negotiating with an
all-male line descendant of Corbin Washington, George's nephew, to
determine whether he would also be willing to be tested.
</P>
<P>
   Although George and Martha Washington had no children,
comparison of a Y chromosome inherited from one of his brothers
with that of a West Ford descendant could indicate whether a
Washington family member was West Ford's father. But it could not
prove that George Washington was the father.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bryant said the Mount Vernon Ladies Association, which runs
Mount Vernon, had refused to provide hair samples for testing. The
association ``will do anything by whatever means necessary to keep
this story hushed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Thompson, the research specialist and a staff member of
the association, said that for a different purpose _ to test their
authenticity _ the Federal Bureau of Investigation had analyzed
samples of hair identified as Washington's from Mount Vernon and
four other museums and had failed to recover enough DNA even to
tell if the samples were from the same person. ``So I don't think
testing the hair would really help,'' Ms. Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   But she and other historians give serious weight to the cousins'
family history, even if they interpret it differently. It is
significant that similar accounts have been preserved independently
by both women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very interesting that the tradition came down in
two branches of the family, separated for over 100 years,'' Ms.
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   West Ford seems to have had a secret, one that was known to John
Augustine and Hannah Washington and that caused them to treat him
with special favor. A portrait preserved at Mount Vernon shows that
West Ford was fair skinned, suggesting that his father was white.
According to the oral history received by Dr. Burton, West Ford
attended church and went hunting with them, as if he were a family
member. Hannah, in her will, directed that West should be
inoculated against smallpox, trained in a trade until he was 21,
and then freed, the only of her slaves to be freed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not impossible that West Ford's father was one of Hannah's
three sons, all of them young, unmarried men at the time of his
birth. In 1784, Bushrod would have been 22 years old, Corbin 19,
and Augustine 17.
</P>
<P>
   Bushrod, who later inherited Mount Vernon and became a justice
of the U.S. Supreme Court, is an obvious candidate. He brought West
Ford to Mount Vernon, where he served as a carpenter and foreman.
Bushrod also left West Ford a tract of land in his will.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you compare pictures of West Ford with Bushrod Washington
they look a lot alike,'' said Philander Chase, who succeeded Twohig
as editor of Washington's papers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson suggests another possibility. When Augustine, the
youngest son, died in the gun accident, his parents were
distraught. Augustine ``possesed as sweet a disposicion as ever a
Youth did,'' his father wrote to George Washington, adding ``I wish
to God Mrs Washington could have borne this loss as well as myself
_ but the shock was too great for her infirm frame to bear with any
tolorable fortitude, upon the first communication she fell into a
Strong Convulsion which continued for some time, and when that went
of, she lay for near four hours in a state of insencibility, when
her reason returned her grief did also and she had a return of the
Fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Hannah have freed West Ford because she believed him to be
Augustine's son? Oral traditions often have large elements of truth
``but sometimes things get a little skewed,'' Ms. Thompson said.
The slain boy's full name, she noted, was George Augustine
Washington, although some documents also give his first name as
William.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bryant rejects the possibility that ``George Augustine''
could have changed into ``George Washington'' at some point during
the telling of her family's story. She emphasized the directness of
the history, saying that West Ford had told it to his grandson, who
told it to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Ford couldn't tell who he was,'' Ms. Bryant said, ``so he
wanted to make sure the story would be handed down for the
generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to believe that Ms. Bryant, Ms. Allen and Dr.
Burton may be true Washingtons, a testimony to the power of their
oral history. But without independent evidence, Venus' voice across
the centuries is too faint for listeners to make out the first name
of West Ford's father.

 &HT;    Kentucky considers casinos
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The casino crowds pass Betty Boone every day
she works, even though Kentucky, capital of thoroughbred horse
racing, has zero casinos _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   Boone runs the gift shop at the Seelback Hilton in downtown
Louisville. Just 15 miles away, docked on the Ohio River in
Indiana, sits the Glory of Rome, a 4,000-passenger casino resort
operated by Caesars.
</P>
<P>
   It opened in November and is one of four Indiana casinos sitting
on northern Kentucky's border. They've lured bettors from
Kentucky's horse tracks and state lottery, prompting Gov. Paul
Patton this spring to float the idea of a constitutional amendment
that would allow up to 14 casinos in the Bluegrass State.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is in full bloom. Patton has ordered a study of the
impact of the Indiana casinos and of what might happen _
economically and socially _ if Kentucky allowed gaming houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was concerned about the money that was leaving the state,''
said Mark Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky state legislators already are promising bills next year
that would introduce casinos. Mississippi and Louisiana are the
South's leading casino hubs, and so-called ``cruises to nowhere''
ply the waters off Georgia, South Carolina and Florida in floating
casinos that allow betting outside the three-mile limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kentucky's feeling left out,'' said Boone, who watches
shuttles leave the hotel every day bound for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Boone sells Kool 100s, Camels and Marlboro Lights to people who
visit from all over the state, many just to plunk money into slot
machines across the river. She says she would vote for casinos and
guesses at least half the hotel's gambling visitors would stay and
spend in Kentucky if the state authorized casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got people who travel 150 miles just for a day out,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Horse tracks like Churchill Downs, where the Kentucky Derby has
been run for 125 years, favor the casino initiative if it would
allow them to set up video slot machines in their grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have it. I don't think it will hurt the horse
business at all,'' Pat Broderick said during a recent day at
Churchill Downs with his family. A police officer in a nearby town,
Broderick raises horses on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to do anything that would hurt Churchill Downs,''
said University of Louisville economics Professor Paul Coomes.
``They're like apple pie around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Leidlein, a 31-year-old sales manager visiting Churchill
Downs from Chicago, said video slots would complement betting on
horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kentucky should have it just because Indiana has it,'' he
said. ``They're probably taking tax dollars away from Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Some gambling companies are waiting to see what happens before
weighing in. One is GTECH, which operates the Kentucky Lottery and
was a partner in the purchase of the Turfway horse track.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is like trying to take a drink from a fire
hydrant right now,'' Bob Vincent, vice president of a GTECH
subsidiary, Dreamport, told the Lexington Herald-Leader. ``There
are ideas being tossed out right now into the public domain, and
they need to settle out.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition already has emerged. Church leaders worry about moral
decay while others are concerned about the proliferation of problem
gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Louisville Galleria, a fading mall downtown, people
collect at the Kentucky Lottery booth. Jan Tinsley, a cashier in a
shop across the street, regularly gets stuck behind people buying
stacks of tickets as she waits to buy a pack of Sweet Heat potato
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me wonder if it's going to be the same people at the
casinos'' as the ones buying lottery tickets, said Tinsley, leaning
on a display case with WWJD necklaces. ``I understand the tax
issue, but what if it's easier to gamble with a boat out there?

FACING LIFE WITHOUT FUNERAL INSURANCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ Charles Holmes was sitting in his wheelchair in
his double-wide mobile home when he heard the news that somebody up
North had run off with the money from a half-dozen Southern
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it didn't register,'' Holmes said. ``Then I said,
`Hey, I got a policy with those folks.' It was kind of a shock. I
thought, `This dude has gone and swindled off all the money and
some of us are going to be left out in the cold.'''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, a former police officer in nearby Pearl, is one of the
tens of thousands of policyholders in Mississippi and neighboring
states wondering how badly they are going to be hurt by a huge
fraud that authorities say was pulled off by Martin F. Frankel, a
reclusive money manager from Greenwich, Conn. More than $300
million is missing from insurers controlled by Frankel, who federal
investigators say may have fled to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Holmes and most of the others have made small monthly
payments on policies worth a few thousand dollars to cover their
burial costs. Regulators have assured them that their benefits will
be paid. But with the looted companies out of money now, many are
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed about it last night, and the church prayed for all
the policyholders,'' said Kitty Ruth Lowry, a 62-year-old widow
with two policies on herself and one on her son.
</P>
<P>
   Even George Dale, the insurance commissioner in Mississippi,
whose staff first discovered irregularities at Frankel's three
companies in the state _ the Franklin Protective Life Insurance
Co., the Family Guaranty Life Insurance Co. and the First National
Life Insurance Co. of America _ betrays some reservations, saying
he is ``99 percent certain'' that policyholders will be made whole.
</P>
<P>
   Dale said he could think of nothing specific that might get in
the way but that ``nothing in life is certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Rusty Haydel, executive director of the Mississippi Life
and Health Insurance Guaranty Association, an industry group
responsible for guaranteeing payment of insurance benefits, is
preparing to put a levy on the more than 640 life insurers doing
business in the state to make up the losses of the Frankel
companies, which have been seized by regulators. As many as 300
policyholders may have died in Mississippi since the three
companies were seized in early May and stopped paying claims, he
said. But he and Dale said they knew of no burials delayed for lack
of insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   Most policies in Mississippi used to pay burial costs are sold
through funeral homes, which have been honoring the policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm guaranteeing my people, they won't lose,'' said Steve
Holland, owner of Lee Memorial Funeral Home in Tupelo. ``I know the
state guaranty fund is ultimately going to pay. I'm trying to keep
pandemonium and bedlam from breaking out with my customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, I placed their money with Franklin Protective.
So I feel bad. My customers feel bad. But I'm reassuring them that
I'm not going to let them lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Gates, a former agent for Franklin Protective Life, said
the funeral homes were usually better known than the insurers.
Burial insurance salespeople, she said, often begin a pitch by
saying, ``I'm representing so and so funeral home.''
</P>
<P>
   Small policies intended to pay burial costs are sold in most
states. But advocates for consumers generally advise against them,
noting that they can be up to 10 times as expensive as term life
insurance. They are popular with low-income people, featuring
monthly payments that are often less than $20 for up to $5,000
worth of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance with better rates rarely comes in such small amounts,
and the bigger, more economically efficient policies require larger
premiums, often paid annually, which many people find beyond their
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Companies specializing in burial insurance charge higher rates,
experts say, because their costs are higher. Even though agents in
Mississippi work out of funeral homes, they often sell policies
door to door and some still personally make monthly collections.
With few exceptions, coverage is available to all comers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a man can fog a mirror _ if he's breathing _ he can usually
buy this kind of insurance,'' said Harland Dyer, actuary for the
Mississippi Insurance Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi and much of the South, burial insurance is a
matter of culture, tradition and economics. People of modest means
say they take comfort in knowing that no matter how bad things get,
they can pay their final expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my kids to have to put out anything to bury me,''
said Van Robinson Kersh, who is retired from a box factory and now
works part time at a funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   For many, this is the only insurance they have, their ties to
the insurers among the few constants in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could call and ask them anything and they would give me an
answer,'' said Frances Thornell, a 70-year-old widow with two
policies on herself from a Frankel company and several on her
children and grandchildren. ``I'm just speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have advised policyholders to keep making monthly
payments so their policies do not lapse. But many find that
difficult to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you want to pay on something if you didn't know for sure
it was going to be there for you?'' Mrs. Lowry asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Phillips, a retired furniture factory worker, said that
every month when she helps her 85-year-old mother send off her
insurance check, her mother tells her: ``Well, I can be buried for
another month. You won't have to put me in a ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Philips said she has kept the news of trouble at Franklin
Protective from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   James Jack Robinson, who has made a small fortune in the funeral
home business and four and a half years ago sold the company now
known as Franklin Protective to a trust that investigators say was
controlled by Frankel, said customers are often not aware that they
can get much more insurance for their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agents for the better-priced insurance don't go out and knock
on doors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many around here say they would never think of buying
anything but burial insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes and his wife, Faye, who drives a pickup for a courier
service, both have $5,000 policies that cost them $23 a month. Even
if they could save up to make one annual payment for more coverage,
Holmes said, they probably would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised on this kind of insurance,'' he said. ``My father
bought it. His father bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way,'' he said, ``you overpay. But these low premiums are
enticing to a person who's only got a certain amount of money
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   To people here, Martin Frankel, the man who apparently made a
fortune by looting their companies, is a hard-to-imagine faraway
demon. If he is ever caught, they say, life in prison would be too
kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize anyone could be so cruel,'' said Mrs.
Thornell. ``He must not have any feelings at all. I'm sure there
are a lot of people like me living on Social Security and just able
to pay for the insurance. Then some idiot like this comes and
destroys us. It just drains you.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said he would like to see Frankel face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people,'' he said, ``would love to get hold of the
old boy and shake him a little bit to see what kind of change fell
out. But I guess it's best for the law to handle that.''

BARAK SWORN IN AS ISRAELI PREMIER, PLEDGES UNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Seven long weeks of political negotiations after he
was elected, Ehud Barak took office as prime minister of Israel on
Wednesday and pledged that the pursuit of a ``true, lasting peace'
would be his foremost concern.
</P>
<P>
   In a passionate inaugural speech, Barak, 57, addressed not only
the Israelis glued to their radios and televisions but also the
many Palestinians and Syrians who watched, waiting for messages.
Despite a chorus of criticism for the composition of his Cabinet
and a wariness about him in the region, Barak sounded a
conciliatory note.
</P>
<P>
   He reached out to all his domestic constituencies _ from
high-tech workers to blue-collar unionists to soldiers' mothers
``who don't sleep at night'' _ as well as to each of Israel's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Departing from the confrontational tone of his predecessor,
Benjamin Netanyahu, Barak, the One Israel/Labor Party leader, told
the Palestinians that he recognized their ``suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the pain and death on both sides of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and suggested that each stop focusing
on the ``account settling of historical wrongs.''
</P>
<P>
   While Netanyahu always emphasized the dangers surrounding
Israel, Barak described his country as ``strong and confident.''
And he urged Israel's neighbors to meet him at the diplomatic table
with an equal determination to ride the ups and downs of difficult
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on all regional leaders to take our outstretched hands
and build a peace of the brave,'' Barak said, embracing the phrase
that Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, often uses.
</P>
<P>
   With a clear intent to allay the concerns of Palestinians that
negotiations with Syria would take precedence, Barak said he would
move forward on both peace tracks at once.
</P>
<P>
   But, underscoring his keen interest in reopening talks with
Syria, which controls much of Lebanon, Barak repeated his campaign
promise to withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza Wednesday night, Barak's words were received by
Palestinians as a welcome break from the perceived hostility of
Netanyahu _ who officially quit the parliament on Wednesday,
shaking hands and walking out with his back to pursuing television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Palestinian leaders, who are wary of Barak, expressed
cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak's speech is an important and positive signal,'' said
Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian
legislature. ``We hope his words will soon be followed by deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is expected to meet next week with Arafat before traveling
to Washington in mid-July for his first official meeting with
President Clinton. Barak is also expected to see President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan this month.
</P>
<P>
   Using vivid language in his address, Barak, a highly decorated
former general, described himself as a ``warrior'' who ``for tens
of years wore no other clothes but the olive uniform.'' Citing
verses from the poet A. Hillel, he called himself one of the ``gray
soldiers whose hands are blackened from war and whose nostrils are
filled with death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tongue is dry from the march,'' he quoted, ``And we cry
love into the insides of your souls.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of political negotiating behind closed doors, Barak
re-emerged into the public eye Wednesday afternoon when he
presented his Cabinet to the parliament. Hours later, in a ceremony
in the Israeli president's house, Barak was sworn in as the leader
of a large majority coalition, controlling nearly two-thirds of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``no accident,'' he said in his inaugural speech, that he
had taken almost all the 45 days allowed by law to form a
government now made up of seven very different political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was forced by the lessons of Jewish history and the deep
divide within our people to form a government that will be able to
function during the most difficult times with the wide acceptance
of the majority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the lectern, as he spoke of inclusiveness, he faced down
catcalls from Israeli Arab members of parliament who feel unjustly
excluded from his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you going to be the prime minister of everyone?'' one
shouted. ``Where are the Arab ministers?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, from another direction, Barak was rebuked by Ariel
Sharon, the temporary leader of the opposition Likud Party, for not
saying ``one word'' that would characterize the importance of the
state as a ``Zionist Jewish'' enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, the former foreign minister, also criticized Barak for
intransigence during the unsuccessful coalition negotiations with
the Likud, and said that the ``unique'' personal relationship
between them had been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon said that he had requested and been denied the power to
monitor the future peace negotiations _ which, he said, in a
reference to Barak, should not be controlled by only ``one person
no matter how talented he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinging news media criticism Wednesday labeled Barak as a
leader with autocratic tendencies _ calling him everything from
``Caligulan'' to a near ``Ehud Bonaparte.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism began after Barak unveiled his Cabinet. He was
accused by many of making weak or inappropriate appointments. And
many suggested that he was doing his best to consolidate his hold
on power so that he could tackle his ambitious political agenda
without interference.
</P>
<P>
   In a country with a parliament, it is unusual for the prime
minister to act in a semi-presidential manner, but Barak, who was
elected in a separate ballot from his party, says that he has
received a personal mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak promised fast economic growth, social justice, leaving
Lebanon, completion of the peace accords, national reconciliation
and security,'' Nahum Barnea, a senior political columnist, wrote
in Yedioth Ahronoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging from the composition of the government, it seems that
he expects to carry out all of these tasks alone, with a commando
knife between his teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new prime minister stared in the face his first political
failure Wednesday, when Avraham Burg, an ambitious Labor Party
official and sometime critic of Barak, was sworn in as speaker of
the parliament. Barak had backed a political novice for the post,
only to have his own party choose Burg instead.
</P>
<P>
   When Burg took his chair late Wednesday afternoon, he shook
hands with the prime minister. ``I have no hate in my heart toward
the prime minister,'' he had said earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, after presenting his Cabinet of 18
ministers, Barak said he would move immediately to alter the basic
law of Israel. In order to accommodate the seven parties in his
coalition and to take on tasks that are ``humongous, maybe even
historic,'' he said he would propose to expand the Cabinet to 24
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And only one woman?'' Tamar Gozansky, a member of parliament
from the Communist Party called out.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although he pledged to include at least three women in his
Cabinet, he has appointed only one, Dalia Itzik of Labor, who will
be Environment Minister, and no female deputy ministers. He has
been roundly criticized for this.
</P>
<P>
   Against the background noise of these charges, Barak nonetheless
portrayed himself as the leader of all sectors of Israeli society,
a proponent of equal rights, and a healer.
</P>
<P>
   He more or less apologized that Israel has ``not always been
wise enough to invest equally in all of its people.'' This echoed a
legendary apology that Barak had earlier made to the Israeli Jews
of Middle Eastern descent, on behalf of the Labor Party, whose
original treatment of them is now largely considered to have been
discriminatory. He said he empathized with poor people who are
``full of broken promises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will change the national priorities,'' he said, promising
to create 300,000 new jobs over the next four years and to invest
heavily in education.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Barak addressed a personal remark to President
Hafez Assad of Syria,
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been harsh and bitter enemies on the battlefield,'' he
said. ``Now it is time to form an open and brave peace that will
insure the future and security of our peoples, our children and our
grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also talked about working with Arafat to build a ``true
partnership in this land in which two peoples will live.''
</P>
<P>
   In a challenge to his intentions, bulldozers cleared land
earlier in the day for a Jewish quarter in an Arab neighborhood of
East Jerusalem. The Palestinians have urged Barak to stop the
expansion of settlements on land whose fate will be negotiated, and
the guidelines of Barak's government promises to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, who was sworn in as a minister Wednesday, will
oversee Jerusalem. He said that the project, Ras al-Amud, should be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will move into the prime minister's office on Wednesday.

England sold the first 25 tons of a planned 415-ton sale of gold,
the latest in a series of central banks to unload some of the

 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACCRA, Ghana _ ``Messiah,'' declared the sign on a street corner
here, above hand-painted portraits of Jesus Christ, Nelson Mandela,
Bob Marley, President Clinton (beloved here for making Ghana his
first stop on his visit to Africa last year) and this country's
longtime leader, Jerry J. Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
   If Rawlings' portrait can be found on this street corner, as
well as on other corners of this capital where street artists sell
their works, it is evidence of the enduring appeal of the man who
since 1981 has guided Ghana out of collapse and through two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   That a framed photograph of the president cannot be found in
every small store in the country _ a common practice in many
African nations where presidents have acquired their position
through decidedly undemocratic means _ is perhaps further
indication of Rawlings' genuine popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' said Ben Smith, the artist who painted the ``Messiah''
portraits, ``he's been too long on the seat. From the head of state
down, everyone has to respect the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghana's Constitution limits the president to two terms, and
calls by even Rawlings' most fervent supporters to respect the law
suggest that a democratic culture is taking root. Many African and
Western officials see Ghana as a success story, a country that has
liberalized politically even as many of its neighbors have
stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Next year in Ghana, if all goes according to plan, something
will occur here that is rare on this continent: the president will
step down and elections will produce a successor. But many
opposition politicians and even members of Rawlings' party are
complaining that the president and his inner circle are maneuvering
to insure that he remains the dominant force in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials and foreign donors, who made Ghana a model for
free-market innovations in Africa, are nervously watching whether
their investments will pay off with a smooth transition. They will
also closely watch the election-year spending by the government,
whose largesse in the last two elections derailed Ghana's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it is a country and a government that have generally
been moving in positive ways, both in terms of the economy and
democratization,'' said an American official here. ``But we
continue to see democracy as an evolutionary process, and one
generally fair and free election doesn't make a democracy. So
that's why the 2000 elections will say a lot about democratization
in Ghana.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rawlings, a former flight lieutenant, seized power in 1981,
Ghana was suffering from economic collapse and millions of people
had left the country in search of work. But under the guidance of
institutions like the World Bank, the economy became one of the
most stable in the region. The country became the United States'
largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa
and Nigeria. Roads, electricity and drinking water reached millions
more of the 18.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Political liberalization followed. After he was elected
president in 1992, in balloting that the opposition described as
unfair, Rawlings was re-elected in 1996 in a vote that was
considered fair by his opponents and by international observers. In
the last three years, a parliament of several parties and a
vigorous press have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   But with the end of the Rawlings era in sight, his party, the
National Democratic Congress, has sent signals that have led people
to question whether the president is really ready to let go of
power.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, party members have floated ideas that appeared
calculated to test the public's willingness to accept a direct or
indirect continuation of a Rawlings rule. Amending the Constitution
to permit Rawlings' tenure to be extended was suggested, followed
by the idea that his wife, Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, a powerful
political figure, would be the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   After Rawlings eventually expressed support for his vice
president, John Evans Atta Mills, as his successor, many of the
president's critics perceived the move as a way of retaining
unofficial control. That belief deepened in December when his party
formed a consultative committee and made Rawlings ``lifelong''
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The party has played down these developments, saying, for
instance, that the committee chairmanship is strictly honorary.
Huudu Yahaya, general secretary of the National Democratic
Congress, said the president's opponents had seized on these issues
to portray the party as increasingly authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he would need now is for his legacy to be
sustained,'' Yahaya said. ``Rawlings has become an international
statesman. He's made a lot of pledges outside. He would not want
his pledges to go down, because other heads of states in other
countries have asked us how this can be sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president's critics are not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   After Rawlings announced his support for his vice president, a
group inside his party calling itself the Reform Movement
criticized the inner circle, saying it was autocratic and corrupt.
The group announced early this year that it was breaking away from
the National Democratic Congress, and a few weeks ago took the
legal steps to become a full-fledged party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since last year, there has been enough information suggesting
that the ruling clique is not really considering a full democratic
handover,'' said Kyeretwie Opoku, general secretary of the Reform
Movement.
</P>
<P>
   But more significant than internal party wrangling is a growing
democratic culture expressed through ordinary people or the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the idea of extending incumbency through a Constitutional
amendment was floated,'' said E. Gyimah-Boadi, a professor of
political science at the University of Ghana, ``it was shot down by
the independent media, radio talk-shows and phone-ins. That to me
gave hope that there was a political opening and, while we cannot
take it for granted that progress will continue, that it was
genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gyimah-Boadi is also executive director of the Center for
Democracy and Development, a year-old nonprofit organization that
receives funds from the Ford Foundation and is an example of the
growing presence of civil watchdog groups.
</P>
<P>
   In measuring democracy's deepening roots in Ghana, people like
Gyimah-Boadi point to the Parliament. After the disputed 1992
presidential election, opposition parties boycotted the Parliament,
which became a one-party forum for the next four years. But since
1996, members of several parties have served in the legislature,
free to criticize the executive branch and summon ministers for
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature, though, remained relatively weak. Kwadwo
Baah-Wiredu, a legislator of the New Patriotic Front, the main
opposition party, said members were not given the resources to work
effectively. He has no staff and no office, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my office,'' Baah-Wiredu said, opening the trunk of
his Peugeot, which contained folders, a cellular phone and a Palm
Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Although all members can introduce bills, not one has ever done
so. Instead, the attorney general's office has introduced all
legislation since 1996. So acquiring a role in policy-making would
be the next step for Parliament, Baah-Wiredu said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his criticisms, Baah-Wiredu added, ``We are moving
forward, there is no doubt about that.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A BAD SWING AT THE FANS BY GONZALEZ
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to throw a tantrum, make it a big one. Better to
throw your snit at, say, 495,817 people, the population of
Cleveland according to the latest census estimate, than to fling a
pique at one.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez got a real good mad-on at the influx of fans who
voted Ken Griffey Jr., Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton onto the
American League's starting outfield for the All-Star Game, while
Gonzalez, the league's reigning most valuable player _ an honor he
has won two of the last three years _ finished fifth in the
national popularity contest, behind even David Justice. Ramirez,
Lofton and Justice happen to be the regular outfielders for the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, maybe the high dudgeon Gonzalez found himself in might
have been directed at the 1,075,894 citizens of Dallas, or those of
the whole state of Texas, pop. 19,759,614. ``I respect the fans,''
Gonzalez said Sunday, ``but if they don't vote me, then I don't
want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez would surely have been picked as a reserve on the team
by the AL manager this year, Joe Torre of the Yankees, who now says
he won't select him.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to make a sap head of yourself, as Gonzalez did,
then at least do it in style. Preferred would be the statement made
by immortal Garry Templeton when he wasn't voted in as the starting
shortstop on the National League team a number of years ago. ``If I
ain't startin','' he said, ``then I ain't departin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few players in the history of the game have taken such an
attitude, but none of them have been named Ruth, Williams,
DiMaggio, Musial, Feller, Mays, Mantle, Robinson (Jackie or Frank),
Rose, Koufax, Ryan, nor Maddux, McGwire or Sosa. The list is long.
</P>
<P>
   The AL starting teams for the game to be played on Tuesday at
Fenway Park in Boston were announced on Monday, but the final
results for many positions, including the one that Gonzalez plays,
were fairly well determined, unless, of course, he called in some
Chicago aldermen at the last minute to monitor the ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't happen. Actually, times change. Instead of tinkering with
a voting machine, Gonzalez might have e-mailed Bill Gates for
support, for in a crush of last-minute votes via the Internet,
Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox nipped the Yankees' Derek Jeter to
make the American League's opening lineup at shortstop. Jeter will
presumably not veto the voters and crawl under his couch and not
come out for the game. Perhaps he agrees with Torre, his manager,
and the AL stars' manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' Torre said about Gonzalez's pout, and he went
on to give his opinion on players being a part of the All-Star
Game, saying, ``I think it is an honor, and if not honored, they
should be obligated.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he was told by the league office that Gonzalez had
asked not to be chosen, so that he would not have to refuse. ``He
deserved to be there,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is 29 years old, old enough to understand that the
All-Star Game is a showcase for his sport. It is a chance for the
fans to see all of the best players at one time on one field.
Baseball is still making its way back from the odor left from the
1994 strike. It has come a long way, but there remains a sense of
fragility about its fan base even yet. The All-Star Game helps
perfume the air a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez understands this not at all. He doesn't understand that
his $7.25 million salary is dependent on the good will, interest
and, it follows, All-Star Game voting of the fans. Gonzalez took
the exuberance of Indians fans for their local love boats as a
personal insult.
</P>
<P>
   Where, as my mother has asked in a comparable goofball attitude,
are his brains?
</P>
<P>
   If anybody should be angry, it's Hank Greenberg. Perhaps the
greatest injustice perpetrated on a potential All-Star player was
done to Greenberg, the Tigers' first baseman, in 1935. He had 103
runs batted in at the All-Star break. Not only wasn't he chosen to
be a starter, he also wasn't chosen to be on the team, period. It's
true that Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx, chosen ahead of Greenberg at
first base, were having pretty good years, as well. But in those
days, the managers of the two teams picked all the players. The
manager of the AL team that year was Mickey Cochrane. Of all
things, Cochrane was the Tigers' manager.
</P>
<P>
   While Gonzalez may indeed merit a place in the starting
outfield, it would surely not be ahead of Griffey or Ramirez. Maybe
Lofton, but Lofton has been terrific. So possibly the Cleveland
fans in their hometown delirium got it right, anyway.

   What should make Gonzalez even madder is that, with the panoply
of stars in the game, he will hardly be missed.

 &HT;    Braves' All-Star run at an end
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One Braves run of this decade has ended. For the first
time since 1990, the Braves won't have a starter in the July 13
All-Star Game at Fenway Park in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In four of the past eight years, the Braves have had the
starting pitcher for the National League, but with Greg Maddux and
Tom Glavine plagued by slow starts and John Smoltz on the disabled
list with a sore elbow, that honor will go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   While the Braves are hoping Brian Jordan, Kevin Millwood and
possibly Chipper Jones will find their way onto Bruce Bochy's squad
as backups, no position players were picked by baseball fans, whose
votes determine the staring lineups.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona second baseman Jay Bell overtook Craig Biggio in vote
totals on Tuesday and joined Diamondbacks third baseman Matt
Williams in the starting lineup, making the second-year team the
only NL squad with two players in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza of the New York Mets will be at catcher, Mark
McGwire of St. Louis at first and Barry Larkin of Cincinnati at
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Sammy Sosa, Colorado's Larry Walker and San Diego's
Tony Gwynn were elected to start in the outfield. Gwynn is on the
disabled list with a calf injury, but has been taking batting
practice and might be activated in time to play.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of fan support in Braves' balloting is puzzling,
because Atlanta has the best record and is among the league leaders
in attendance in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it shouldn't be a surprise. Javy Lopez, Chipper Jones
and Walt Weiss finished in the top three at their positions in the
voting, even though Jones hasn't produced the runs he has in recent
years, and Weiss missed 29 games with a quadriceps injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's a reverse compliment,'' said Tom Glavine, who
started the 1991 and '92 All-Star games. ``That speaks highly of
what we've been able to accomplish. It says we can do it without
one guy. ... I don't think anybody's stats are going to jump out at
you. Brian has got a bunch of RBIs. Chipper has had a solid year
but not what people probably expect out of Chipper. But we're
winning games. Production is being spread out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for feeling snubbed by voters?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a big deal,'' Glavine said. ``It's a
popularity contest for starters ... and that hurts a lot of guys
who have to be picked who deserve to be there and won't be. But
it's the fans' game. They ought to see who they want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, one of the few bright spots in the Chicago Cubs' dismal
season, was the NL's leading vote-getter with 2,315,204, finishing
third overall in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   In the American League, Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr.
(2,918,055) led all players for the fourth straight year and fifth
time overall and was followed by Cleveland second baseman Roberto
Alomar (2,793,891).
</P>
<P>
   Before this week, none of the votes cast on the Internet had
been included in the weekly totals. Fans were allowed to vote up to
22 times on the Internet _ the average number of home games for
each team during the balloting. Sosa gained nearly 1 million votes
in the final week of counting.
</P>
<P>
   AL starters were announced Monday. In addition to Griffey and
Alomar, the lineup includes Cleveland's Jim Thome at first, and
Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton in the outfield. They will be joined
by Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, Boston shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra, Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken Jr. and Tampa Bay
designated hitter Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers and reserves for both leagues will be picked today.

 &HT;    Minicamp to test Falcon no-shows
 &HT;    By Michael Carvel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons will have their first official
team meeting today since the Super Bowl. But they don't know
whether the back who helped the team run away with the NFC
championship will be in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson is considered a possible
no-show for the three-day minicamp, which is mandatory for all
rookies and veterans on the Falcons' roster.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has missed all of the team's voluntary workouts in the
offseason while trying to negotiate a contract extension with the
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect everybody to be here (today),'' coach Dan Reeves said
Tuesday evening. ``Minicamp is mandatory, just like training camp.
Anybody not here will be fined, unless they were previously
excused.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his reaction to unexcused absences, Reeves replied
sternly, ``I worry about that when it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is not the only player who has team officials
concerned. Right guard Gene Williams, like Anderson, has said that
his absence from passing camp last month can be attributed to his
unhappiness about the lack of progress on a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have 79 players listed on the roster for minicamp.
Atlanta has agreed to contract terms with seven of nine draft
choices, including first-rounder Patrick Kerney, a defensive end
from Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Johndale Carty, a fourth-rounder, and wide receiver
Eugene Baker, who was taken in the fifth round, are expected to
sign in the next two days. Both rookies are expected to report to
Suwanee today.
</P>
<P>
   The loosely structured minicamp will consist of daily practices
just over an hour in length and will resemble the workouts at
passing camp. The team also will begin preparation for training
camp, which starts July 28 at Furman University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minicamp is a chance for us to condition the guys that
have not participated in a high percentage of our offseason
workouts,'' Reeves said. ``We'll also be able to get the guys more
familiar with the system and prepared for later this month.

 &HT;    Women's Final Four to be held at Georgia Dome
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With another national sporting event secured, the
Atlanta Sports Council is ready to take on the world. On Tuesday,
the NCAA announced that the 2003 Women's Final Four will be at the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our major initiative right now is to be known as the sports
capital of the world,'' said Gary Stokan, president of the Atlanta
Sports Council. ``A lot of people laugh, but if you look at it from
a business case-study standpoint, as I have, no other city can beat
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA Division I women's basketball committee gave Atlanta
the nod over Charlotte, N.C., Detroit and Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, the host school, teamed with the sports council,
the Atlanta Visitors and Convention Bureau, Philips Arena and the
Georgia Dome in luring the April 4-6 event, which is projected to
have a $25 million economic impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia Tech is thrilled and pleased with the announcement,''
said Kathy Noble, Tech's senior associate athletics director.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Dome, which will use either a 24,000- or 36,000-seat
configuration, will play host to the men's Final Four in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about Atlanta as a great sports city,'' Georgia
Dome general manager Khalil Johnson said. ``Fortunately, we didn't
have to re-invent the wheel in our presentation. We've been in a
lot of these situations in the past few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta hosted the 1993 Women's Final Four, in which Sheryl
Swoopes scored a record 47 points in leading Texas Tech to the
title at the Omni.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision extends an impressive run of sporting events
in Atlanta. The city hosted the Super Bowl in 1994, and it returns
in January. Also next year, Atlanta gets the baseball All-Star Game
at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, Atlanta hosted the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The men's Final Four returns in 2007, and the SEC (2000) and ACC
(2001) basketball tournaments are at the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the annual SEC Football Championship, the Heritage Bowl
and Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, two NASCAR events, an Indy car race and
PGA, Seniors and LPGA tournaments, and Stokan's contention has some
merit. ``Put all those things together _ and hopefully get another
World Series _ and we can say things no other city can say,''
Stokan said.

THE TIDE POOL AS TALENT POOL (IT HAD TO HAPPEN) 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 11) 
(jt) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When children pick up the remote control to watch cartoons, they
find shows about the likes of CatDog, a two-headed mutant (or
``bicranial quadriped,'' as it prefers); Arthur, an aardvark who
wears glasses; a large blue bear who seems to run an animal
commune, and whatever the Teletubbies are. Children's television
hits in recent years have starred giant turtles with martial-arts
skills and a purple dinosaur who appears to be on a sugar high.
Even the classic cartoon shows are about smart-aleck rabbits,
sadistic lisping canaries and laughing woodpeckers. So maybe a
series about a talking sea sponge isn't so odd.
</P>
<P>
   ``SpongeBob Squarepants,'' which has its official premiere on
Saturday at 10 a.m., is not just a new show; it's the first
original Saturday morning series from Nickelodeon, the cable
channel that has owned Saturday morning for the last few years.
Until now, the channel's schedule at that time has consisted
largely of reruns of its weeknight shows like ``Hey, Arnold'' and
``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob, who looks pretty much like one of those rectangular yellow
kitchen sponges in the four-pack at Gristede's, lives in the
undersea city Bikini Bottom. His house is a two-story pineapple.
His best friend is Patrick Starfish, a surfer-dude type whose
hobbies, according to his official biography, ``include sleeping
and lying dormant.'' Bob's neighbor and co-worker is the unlikable
Squidward Tentacles, who plays the clarinet. Bob's girlfriend, of
sorts, is Sandy Cheeks, a squirrel who wears a bikini top and a
skirted swimsuit bottom. She lives in a glass-enclosed air bubble.
(A sponge may love a squirrel, but where would they make a home?)
</P>
<P>
   A sponge may seem like a particularly passive creature to build
a series around, but that gave the show's creator, Stephen
Hillenburg, a blank canvas on which to create an ``innocent, naive,
excited about life'' character who has ``a kid's energy and
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In the preview episode (first shown in May), Bob gets his dream
job: working as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab. He's a wiz with a
spatula and saves the day when the restaurant is overtaken by a mob
of burger-hungry anchovies on a bus tour. He also meets Sandy (who
greets him with ``Hold on there, little square dude''), visits her
for tea and cookies, and tries to pretend he's not dying. ``Air is
not good, Patrick,'' he gasps to his friend, who has also arrived
at Sandy's water-free dome. ``Air is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Future episodes include the following adventures: Bob cheats on
his boat-driving exam. Bob tries to deliver a pizza in the desert.
Bob's pet snail, Gary, gets sick. Wild disco-loving jellyfish take
over Bob's house. Plankton takes control of Bob's brain.
</P>
<P>
   Hillenburg, 38, is a filmmaker who once worked as a marine
science educator at the Orange County Marine Institute in Dana
Point, Calif. There he found that children were particularly crazy
about tide pool creatures, which include sponges, starfish,
octopuses, crabs and sea cucumbers. So doing the series is a fusion
of his two favorite subjects (animation and sea life), exactly the
sort of thing guidance counselors are always recommending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have teachers in high school say, `You should just
draw fish,''' he recalls. Now he does.

 &HT;    Nicklaus to sit out Senior Open
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jack Nicklaus withdrew this week from this week's U.S.
Senior Open in Des Moines, Iowa, preferring to give his sore left
hip more time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus also had to withdraw during the third round of the
Senior Players Championship 10 days ago, marking just the third
time in his 38-year pro career he was unable to finish a tournament
because of injury. Nicklaus, who underwent hip-replacement surgery
Jan. 27, considered playing this week but decided Monday he's
better off taking the conservative route.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hip is starting to feel good. But I think it would be wise
on my part to wait a week or so to test it again,'' Nicklaus said.
``I'm very eager to play golf, but I just don't think I should
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus' decision means he won't finish any of the four majors
on the Senior PGA Tour this year after playing in 35 of the 36
majors since he joined the tour in 1990. He missed the Tradition
and the PGA Seniors' Championship this spring because of the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus admitted he pushed his body too hard to return in time
to play at his Memorial Tournament and the U.S. Open. He says
there's nothing physically wrong with his ceramic hip, but in
addition to the pain, he still feels pain on his sciatic nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Nicklaus played in Johnny Miller's
Champions Challenge last week. Nicklaus also played in two course
openings last week. He shot a four-under 68 Friday at Roaring Fork
Club in Basalt, Colo., the first time he broke 70 since surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus has twice won the U.S. Senior Open (1991 and 1993).

INTERNET INSURANCE SALES DEVELOPER RECEIVES FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Insurance Holdings of America Inc. has a Ford in its future.
</P>
<P>
   IHA, a 3-year-old developer and franchiser of Internet
technology for retail insurance sales, said Tuesday it has arranged
a $67 million, fourth round of financing from four investors,
including Ford Motor Credit Co.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Ford Credit, the finance arm of the Ford Motor Co.,
will get to use IHA's technology, marketing plan, and other
services to support in-showroom marketing of auto and other
insurance products to buyers of Ford cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   While spokesmen for Ford Credit and IHA refused to disclose
Ford's share of the round, sources familiar with the deal put the
amount at around $35 million to $40 million, making the automotive
giant IHA's largest single investor to date.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors in the round were identified as Pacific Life
Insurance Co., Prospector Partners GSA Inc., Dowling &AMP; Partners
Asset Management, and funds managed by Eastbourne Capital
Management. The new round brings total investment in IHA since 1996
to more than $108 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brian K. McCarthy, IHA's 36-year-old founder, chairman, and
chief executive, said much of the fresh cash is earmarked for
upgrading hardware and software so the company can proceed with
installing on-line insurance sales kiosks at 450 Sam's Club
membership discount stores operated by Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said that program, announced 18 months ago, is well
behind schedule because of technological difficulties, including
problems with data storage hardware from Microsoft Corp. He said
that equipment is being replaced with Oracle Corp. units.
</P>
<P>
   IHA's technology lets franchised independent agents, working
inside Sam's Club stores, obtain insurance coverage information
from several underwriters and generate comparative price quotes,
often while the customer waits.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Credit, which already offers its own insurance products
through dealers, said it sees the IHA system as a way to offer
customers a broader choice. ``The way consumers shop is changing,''
Jim Moritz, Ford Credit's director of insurance, said. ``Customers
want choices.'' The company said it is also considering direct
insurance sales via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While apparently ahead of the pack among Detroit auto makers in
forming a partnership with an outside insurance underwriter, Ford
is not the first. Nancy Carini, an analyst with Conning &AMP; Co. in
Hartford, Conn. said Liberty Mutual began mass marketing auto
policies directly to Volvo owners in April 1998, and The Chubb
Group and BMW Financial Services signed a letter of intent last
April to offer BMW owners personalized insurance packages.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Credit, indeed, test marketed a direct insurance sales
program last year in Florida with American International Group, but
IHA was not involved in that test.
</P>
<P>
   Carini described the Ford-IHA alliance as ``just good,
old-fashioned affinity marketing, except with the technology
platform.'' In many ways, she said, this relationship and the
IHA-Sam's Club partnership resembles the in-store insurance
marketing done between 1940 and 1970 by Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and
its subsidiary, Allstate Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Credit and the other new IHA investors were recruited by
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., McCarthy said. Stuart Robbins, IHA's chief
financial officer, said the New York investment banking house was
hired last spring when it became clear more money would be needed
to deal with unexpected technological difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said that along with its problems in data storage, IHA
underestimated the amount of work required to install network
connections to Sam's Club stores and to train personnel. ``The
rollout has been slower than anticipated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said IHA revenues from premiums on policies last year
were almost negligible, with only three states _ New Hampshire,
Michigan and Illinois _ connected to the network between August and
November.
</P>
<P>
   During the first five months of 1999, he said, revenues reached
$12 million, with Arizona, New York, and Georgia already added this
year and Ohio and Pennsylvania about to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins and McCarthy said IHA meanwhile has temporarily
suspended expansion of a separate program that sells group life and
casualty insurance through corporate employee benefit programs,
using franchised local agents to close these sales.
</P>
<P>
   With competition now building, Robbins said, IHA is focused on
building brand identification, in anticipation of an initial public
offering. ``We think we have really solidified ourselves as a
leader by bringing in a partner like Ford,'' he said. ``We are
trying to get this company on a track that will bring long-term
value.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, IHA has about 220 employees in Beverly and 45
at an actuarial center in Longmeadow; 130 more work at a
telemarketing call center in upstate New York.

FASCINATION WITH '49ERS  ENDURES, 150 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By ERIC NOLAND 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALONG CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY 49 _ In Coloma, a docent portraying
James Marshall _ sporting beard, floppy hat and grubby work clothes
_ recounts every detail of his famous discovery in the tailrace of
Sutter's Sawmill. And he's fully in character. If your attention
wanders, he taps you in the shins with his walking stick, as the
impatient Marshall is reputed to have done.
</P>
<P>
   In Columbia, a carpenter in similar attire demonstrates the
operation of a cradle, used for separating gold from gravel and
silt. He built it himself, following precise drawings left behind
by a miner in the middle of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   In Placerville, the proprietress of the Chichester-McKee House
holds up a black morning coat that used to belong to a former
resident of the house, a fellow who ran the town's hardware store.
``There are secret pockets in the tail,'' she says
conspiratorially, revealing the hiding places. ``He probably
carried the flask and the bank deposit in there.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder California's Gold Rush country, which stretches out
along the Sierra Nevada foothills east of Sacramento, continues to
hold such appeal. It is an easily romanticized era of the state's
history _ all the more so this summer, during the 150th anniversary
of the 49ers' frantic stampede to the gold fields.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing imagery is of an intrepid loner swirling his tin
pan while squatting at the edge of a creek, searching hopefully for
a glint of shiny metal. There is curiosity over boom settlements
with peculiar names: Dogtown, Chinese Camp, Cool, Rough and Ready.
There is fascination with colorful characters, from the villainy of
Black Bart to the fanciful storytelling of Bret Harte.
</P>
<P>
   As with most romanticized events, however, harsher realities are
conveniently masked with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, everybody was out for the dollar.
That's what the rush was all about,'' said J.C. Herman, a state
park ranger at the Empire Mine in Grass Valley. ``It's not much
different than today. Greed. This was life in the fast lane.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the original California lottery _ with a perception of
much better odds. And the obsession with sudden wealth can foster
disturbing behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Men deserted jobs and family obligations in the frenzy for a
quick strike. Once here, they encountered back-breaking work in
freezing streams, often for little return. Many times, gambling and
drinking and the staggering cost of provisions ate up a great deal
of what they could pull out of the ground. And it wasn't a
particularly normalized social setting; in the census of 1850,
women represented only 7.5 percent of California's population.
</P>
<P>
   In disputes over claims and perceived wrongs, vigilante justice
prevailed, and people who looked or talked differently than the
American miners _ Mexicans, American Indians, Chinese, Frenchmen,
Hawaiians _ were frequent targets of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 148 years ago today, according to a newspaper account,
Downieville miners who were ``fired with patriotism'' hanged a
Mexican woman for stabbing to death a man who had entered her
cabin. She claimed the man had previously molested her. The jury
deliberated for only a few minutes before returning its guilty
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The land was treated just as callously. In photographs of the
period, not a sprig of vegetation can be seen near placer mining
operations on the banks of streams and rivers. Later, in the 1870s,
as placer gold became harder to come by, miners resorted to
ravaging hillsides with powerful water cannons. Even today, the
scars are evident at the Malakoff Diggins near Nevada City.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Gold Rush era is perceived as brimming with
amusing folklore or as a troubling sociological study of the power
of avarice, visitors find it endlessly fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   There seem to be abundant appeals for making an excursion here.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists have numerous opportunities to sift through the history
of the period, in restored downtown districts, at state historical
parks, in museums and at digging sites. Several old dwellings have
been converted to bed-and-breakfast inns. Stores, meanwhile, stock
much of the same merchandise as in Gold Rush days; the items were
called goods then, they're antiques today. And the drive along
Highway 49 can be a twisting, turning, unhurried pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Those who make their living along this route were anticipating a
heavy invasion of tourism this summer _ a Green Rush, if you will _
especially in light of the state's pledge to spend some $3 million
in tax dollars to promote California's sesquicentennial. But there
is considerable grumbling over the fizzling delivery on the
promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were strongly disappointed, because it was so highly touted
initially,'' said Mary Louise Weaver, who operates Nevada City's
139-year-old Red Castle Inn with her husband, Conley, a former Los
Angeles architect who helped design the Music Center. ``Other
states promote highly on TV. There just wasn't any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say this year has been much quieter for us than other
years. It was like a party you gave but just didn't send the
invitations to the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   For travelers from Southern California who are familiar with the
Gold Rush country, this slackened promotion will probably be a
blessing of sorts, since some of these towns and parks are subject
to heavy visitation in normal years.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a trip is taken in the summer peak or in the off-season,
there certainly is much to see and do.
</P>
<P>
   Highway 49, the vein that courses through the gold country,
stretches about 270 miles between Mariposa in the south and
Sierraville in the north. The popular heart of this country is
directly east of Sacramento, in a region that runs south of
Placerville to Sutter Creek, Angels Camp and Columbia, north to
Coloma, Grass Valley and Nevada City.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of state historical parks along the route,
and they shouldn't be missed.
</P>
<P>
   The park at Columbia, for example, features a restored mining
town with many working shops. A series of wooden troughs _ some of
them ``salted'' with gold flakes _ are set up so kids can gently
swish water and sand in a tin pan, in hopes that the heavier gold
will separate toward the edge, like shells on a beach. The museum
exhibits include such placer-mining implements as the cradle and
the Long Tom. The saloon serves sarsaparilla. Mark Twain, who found
endless fodder for his stories while combing the gold country as a
newspaperman, will be portrayed by an actor at the Fallon House
Theatre starting July 20.
</P>
<P>
   At the park in Coloma stands a replica of the sawmill that John
Sutter had built on the adjacent American River. It was in the
balky first days of the mill's operation, when river water was
diverted to turn the mill's paddle wheel, that Marshall inspected
the channel that returned water to the river and made his momentous
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the town's hunger for gold sparked curiosity over the
only dirt that hadn't been turned _ that beneath the foundations of
Coloma's mostly abandoned buildings. They were promptly torn down,
the dirt sluiced. In several cases, only piles of rubble interlaced
with weeds remain, but placards identify the old sites: Dukehart
Bath House, Fashion Saloon, Express Office.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, at the Empire Mine state park in Grass Valley,
visitors can descend a few steps into the mouth of a hard-rock mine
_ and gaze into a hole that ultimately extends more than two miles
down and is interlaced with 367 miles of tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors to gold country cling resolutely to Highway 49,
but excursions to out-of-the-way spots can be every bit as
rewarding as the historical parks and roadside towns.
</P>
<P>
   This is true in Volcano, population 99, which lies in the hills
inland of Sutter Creek. It is wooded and quiet, far from the main
highway, with a general store built in the classic, fire-preventive
method of the time: a bizarre combination of bricks and rock. It
looks as if it might fall down any second.
</P>
<P>
   In Dutch Flat, off I-80 to the northeast of Auburn, Victorian
homes are no bigger than cottages, and rose bushes cascade over
rickety picket fences. A dog ambled slowly across the narrow
street, smugly oblivious to the bright-red rental car that
approached.
</P>
<P>
   In Murphys, a short drive from Angels Camp on Highway 4, a
pastoral creekside park features the frolic of children where
miners once wreaked their havoc. Wade into that water for a few
minutes, sense the chill _ now imagine putting in 10 hours a day
there, bending to scoop gravel and dirt out of the creek bottom.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS) towns along the route feature historic
districts of restored Gold Rush-era buildings. Some are worth a
visit, others seem in danger of collapsing from the weight of all
the doodads for sale. Nevada City, a vibrant county seat _ and,
thus, less reliant on tourism _ might be the gem of the route, with
a warren of hillside streets, beautifully restored buildings,
several nice places to eat and a reassuring preponderance of book
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice is to explore various locales at your leisure
and determine which ones are worth your time.
</P>
<P>
   The charm of some towns is undermined by their reliance on
visitor bucks. They can usually be identified by the number of
stores selling antiques, which, apparently, are not to be confused
with collectibles, which should never be mistaken for heirlooms,
which are often confused with gifts.
</P>
<P>
   With perseverance, determined hunters will find the occasional
treasure trove _ at the Victorian Closet in Amador City, for
example, where owner Sally Knudson displays antique patchwork
quilts of unsurpassed workmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The drive along 49 can be equally rewarding _ it's considered
one of the finest motorcycle routes in the state, and, accordingly,
the Harleys are in perpetual evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Although some stretches dismay you with suburban and
shopping-center blight (notably immediately north of Auburn),
others wind through forests of oak and pine, alongside bursts of
wildflowers and past orchards, vineyards, ranches, farms and plenty
of California's unique foothill scenery: rolling hills parched
brown in the sun, dotted here and there with dark-green splashes of
oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to this region also find abundant opportunities to stay
in restored buildings of the Gold Rush era _ or in newer buildings
made to look old. Most motels are confined to the outskirts of
towns, far from the historic districts, so those interested in
period immersion gravitate to the numerous bed-and-breakfast inns
that pepper the foothills.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly when choosing a historic building, it is wise to
call ahead and get exact descriptions of the amenities, if such
things are important to you.
</P>
<P>
   The Chichester-McKee House in Placerville, for example, dates to
1892, and the tiny closets of the three bedrooms have been
converted to half baths. In one bathroom, you have to straddle the
commode to wash your hands in a fold-down steel sink that was
lifted from a Pullman railroad car. For anything beyond a sponge
bath, there is one room at the top of the stairs, featuring a
substantial tub, that must be used by all of the inn's guests
(though, fortunately, not at the same time).
</P>
<P>
   In Murphys, the Redbud Inn is only a few years old and features
spacious rooms with intriguing touches _ enormous whirlpool tubs in
some, clawfoot bathtubs positioned next to fireplaces in others.
But corners were obviously cut on construction materials _
specifically in the case of floor and ceiling insulation. Even
kitchen conversation creates a considerable din, starting at about
5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada City, the ancient Red Castle Inn is a red-brick,
Gothic Revival structure built into the side of a steep, wooded
slope. It is painstakingly decorated with Victorian antiques, such
that you hesitate _ for maybe a second or two _ before putting your
beer bottle down on some spindly nightstand.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Castle also has a reputation for housing ghosts. A
former governess reportedly has been encountered tucking in
sleeping guests, as she once did the children of original owner
John Williams, who arrived in '49 and went on to become a mine
owner and local judge. An ethereal gentleman also visited one of
the construction workers who participated in the house's
restoration in 1963, ostensibl to oversee the work.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the kinds of things you want to read about at
10:30 at night, especially when you're sitting in the
otherwise-deserted parlor under some dim relic of a Victorian lamp
_ fully aware that you're the only guest for the night in this
seven-room inn.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I had only one encounter with the spirit world. A
runaway ghost freight train roared through the building just before
dawn _ at least that's what it sounded like when someone elsewhere
in the house flushed a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   The evening before, a walk up Broad Street in Nevada City had
yielded a scene that might be unique to this region and capable of
stirring endless musings about what life was like a century and a
half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The view to the east encompassed rugged, forested slopes where
gold used to hide. At the stately National Hotel, which has been in
continuous operation since 1856, the patrons were
shoulder-to-shoulder at the dark, wood-paneled Victorian bar.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of people strolled the sidewalk, tracking down lodging
or seeking out dinner, confident that their labors had earned them
particular pampering.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the town's steep main street, a sunset in pastels
was visible, directly behind the clapboard United Methodist Church
and the silhouettes of tall pines behind it.
</P>
<P>
   OK. On a visit to the Gold Rush country, maybe there is nothing
wrong with romanticizing things a bit. &QL;

<P>
   CU CHI, Vietnam _ The rattle and pop of automatic weapons greet
a visitor. Young women in the black pajamas of the Vietcong flit
through the woods. A man in green fatigues picks his way down a
narrow trail, leading a small platoon of foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
   This is the site of the Cu Chi tunnels, one of the most famous
battlegrounds of the Vietnam War. Today it is one of the country's
prime tourist attractions, part of a new industry of war tourism.
Sometimes, these spots seem to be memorials to wartime propaganda
as much to the war itself.
</P>
<P>
   Following the man in green fatigues, the tourists arrive at an
open-sided hut, where the women in black show them to their seats.
There, on a big-screen television set, the Vietnam War plays on:
B-52's drop strings of bombs, villagers run for cover, communist
guerrillas fight back.
</P>
<P>
   For those who still don't get the message, a narrator says:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cu Chi, the land of many gardens, peaceful all year round
under shady trees ... Then mercilessly American bombers have
ruthlessly decided to kill this gentle piece of countryside ...
Like a crazy bunch of devils they fired into women and children ...
The Americans wanted to turn Chu Chi into a dead land, but Cu Chi
will never die.''
</P>
<P>
   Knitting past and present jarringly together, the gunfire in the
film mingles with that of the nearby firing range, where visitors
can pay $1 a bullet to shoot an AK-47 rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war ended in 1975 with a communist victory, Vietnam
has rebuilt and moved on. It is almost impossible to find anyone
who still talks like the soundtrack of the Cu Chi film. Even the
young women in black, who work as guides and ground keepers,
dismiss the hard language, repeating instead today's government
line: We're all friends.
</P>
<P>
   But in their new struggle for foreign currency, the Vietnamese
are exploiting their harsh history, offering visits to
long-forgotten places that were once considered vital to America's
national interests. Most of the visitors here are foreigners; the
Vietnamese who come are mostly schoolchildren with their teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cu Chi tunnels, a 75-mile-long underground maze where
thousands of fighters and villagers could hide, are at the top of
the list of tourist spots for Ho Chi Minh City, 45 miles to the
southeast. Another is the city's Museum of War Remnants, with its
displays of captured weapons and its catalog of horrors, which only
recently amended its name, with changing times, from the Museum of
American War Crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Hue, the ancient capital, familiar to many Americans as the
scene of heavy fighting in the Tet offensive in 1968, is the hub of
a network of war tours. Streetside kiosks offer lists of
attractions: ``Khe Sanh, Dong Ha, Marble Mountain, China Beach,
bombed-out church, DMZ with statue of Ho Chi Minh.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the site of the American massacre at My Lai has been turned
into something of a theme park, with a cemetery, museum,
professional storytellers and a memorial reading, ``Forever hate
the American invaders.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plans to develop the DMZ _ the wartime demilitarized
zone separating the north and the south _ as well as parts of the
Ho Chi Minh Trail, neither of which now offer much for tourists to
see.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the visitors to these sites, like most of their guides,
are too young to remember the war. Relatively few tourists come
from the United States. For most people who come here, the war is a
distant curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last few years, since travel to Vietnam became more
open, groups of American veterans have come in search of remembered
battlefields. A small number of American tour companies specialize
in guiding them and gaining permission to visit remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a feeling of closure; that's the big benefit of going
back as a veteran,'' said Richard Schonberger, director of veterans
programs at a travel agency in Washington called Global Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left suddenly,'' he said. ``Now you know how the story
ended. All the Vietnamese are very friendly. It's a different
country now.''
</P>
<P>
   That can be disorienting, said Chuck Searcy, the Hanoi
representative of Vietnam Veterans of America, which now runs
prosthetics and rehabilitation programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has changed,'' Searcy said. ``Almost every time,
the vets are disappointed. They can't figure out where anything
was: Was it here or was it that hill over there? That piece of
rusted metal was the gate to a big army base. You go to Long Binh:
It's an export-processing zone now.''
</P>
<P>
   One American tour company uses a global positioning satellite to
pinpoint battle locations for its clients, said Paulette Curtis, a
graduate student in social anthropology at Harvard who is studying
returning veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to Hill 10, Hill 37, Hill 55 and Hill 65,'' she
said, naming old battlegrounds. There isn't much to see. ``You go
to Khe Sanh and it's just coffee plantations and black pepper
trees. The world of the vets' tour is completely different from the
rest of Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites that have been restored for tourists, with their soft
drink stands, hawkers and eager guides, are almost as
unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Cu Chi, the visitor is greeted by a sign reading: ``Please
try to be a Cu Chi guerrilla. Wear these uniforms before entering
tunnel.'' Black pajamas, pith helmets, rubber sandals and old
rifles are available.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, swimming pool-sized holes in the ground are
neatly labeled: ``B-52 crater.''
</P>
<P>
   The woods are dotted with souvenir kiosks selling these items: a
lighter made from a bullet, a pen made from bullets, a bullet on a
chain, rubber sandals, an ``I've Been to the Cu Chi Tunnel''
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Also abundantly available, as they are wherever tourists are
awaited in southern Vietnam, are Zippo lighters engraved with
reproductions of the swashbuckling mottos that were popular among
American G.I.'s:
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is my business and business has been good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to heaven because I've already been to hell:
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not scared just lonesome. Vietnam 68-69.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tunnels themselves are undeniably impressive. Throughout the
war, the South Vietnamese Communists, or Vietcong, continually
expanded the three-level network, which included mess halls,
meeting rooms, an operating theater and even a tiny cinema.
</P>
<P>
   When the war was over, the people of Cu Chi went to work on the
tunnels once again, widening parts of them and adding steps and
lighting so that foreign tourists could wriggle in for a look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got claustrophobia big time,'' said Lawrence W. Goichman, a
recent visitor from Stamford, Conn. ``I crawled about 30 yards and
then I took the first emergency exit.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``It's very clean down there. The guide said they
have someone dusting every day. They actually let you eat the food
that the people that fought were eating.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he enjoyed his visit to Cu Chi. But he said the
Vietnamese still have some work to do in developing their tourist
sites. ``Let's put it this way,'' Goichman said. ``It wasn't as
good as Disneyland.''

   GARDENING: PLUMERIA BLOOMS TAKE THEIR TIME
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By KATHY HUBER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why won't my plumeria bloom? &QL; 
_ H.H., Houston &QR; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   A:  &LR; A couple of other gardeners have recently asked this
question. Plumerias must reach a certain maturity and produce a
blooming hormone in their tips before flowering. This may take a
year or two if you purchase a rooted cutting. It may take up to
five years for a plumeria to bloom if you start with seed.
</P>
<P>
   The Plumeria Society of America recommends sun, Superbloom and
patience.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn much more about plumerias at the Plumeria Society
of America's meeting at 7:30 p.m. July 13 at the Houston Garden
Center in Hermann Park. The program is free.
</P>
<P>
   The society's plant show and sale will be 9:30 a.m.-3 p.m. July
17 at the Bay Area Community Center, 5002 NASA Road 1 (across the
street from the lake) in Clear Lake Park.
</P>
<P>
   Another free program, ``Growing Plumerias,'' is scheduled for 11
a.m. July 24 at Gateway Ace Hardware &AMP; Garden Center, 6860
Telephone Road, 713-643-0623; and a free Plumeria Workshop and
Garden Tour will be 9 a.m.- noon July 31 at Mercer Arboretum and
Botanic Gardens, 22306 Aldine-Westfield Road, 281-443-8731. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Someone at our church said he saw a blue oleander. I've
never heard of one. Have you?
</P>
<P>
   What is the best time to plant plumeria seeds? What is the best
way to propagate a bottle brush plant?
</P>
<P>
   And, there is a place called Ty Ty Plantation, perhaps in
Georgia. They sell mail-order plants. If you know the address, I
would appreciate your giving it to me. &QL; 
_ C.S.M., Cleveland &QR; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   A:  &LR; Blue oleander sounds vaguely familiar, but I can't remember
exactly a plant that goes by this common name. Usually oleanders
are designated as pink, cerise, red, salmon, white and yellow.
However, these plants have been subdivided as follows: white into
white and cream; pink into pink and lilac; red into red, carmine
and purple; and yellow into salmon, apricot, flesh, copper and
orange.
</P>
<P>
   I think your friend must be referring to something other than a
true oleander (Nerium oleander), but a plant that resembles an
oleander. For example, the blue ginger, Dichorisandra thyrsiflora,
is not a true ginger but certainly could pass for one.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a reader can enlighten us.
</P>
<P>
   Some plumerias rarely develop seed pods, while others produce an
abundance. Among the latter, some create many sterile seeds while
others produce more viable seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Allow plumeria seed pods, or follicles, to ripen on the tree.
This occurs at various times during the year, and it takes eight to
nine months for a pod to ripen. Sometimes, a stem is not strong
enough to hold a heavy seed pod on the tree and it breaks off
before reaching maturity. Should this happen, just let it ripen in
a warm, dry place.
</P>
<P>
   When a pod splits, remove the numerous seeds. Each will be
covered with a tough, brown sheath with a paperlike wing at one
end. Lightly squeeze the seed to test for viability, and keep those
that are solid and plump. Cut a couple of these open, and if this
reveals a creamy-white flesh, chances are good that the seeds will
germinate.
</P>
<P>
   Sow in a well-draining, multipocket tray filled with a
pre-moistened premium potting soil. A warm soil is important
because a cold, damp soil promotes rot.
</P>
<P>
   Sow seed with the wing sticking out of the soil. Press to make
good soil contact around the seed, but avoid pressing the seed
deeper into the soil. Spray to keep the medium moist until
germination, but avoid overwatering to discourage fungal diseases.
You may see germination in three to 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   As the seedling grows, it will cast off the sheath. However,
weak seedlings may need your help _ moisten and remove the sheath.
</P>
<P>
   When the seedlings have put on their true leaves, replant in
4-inch pots. Water thoroughly as seedlings put on good growth, but
allow soil to dry until it feels barely moist before watering
again.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible you may see a bloom in three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   The bottlebrush (Callistemon spp.), a favorite with
hummingbirds, generally blooms off and on from spring to fall. It
is not reliably hardy, especially north of Houston, so it is a good
idea to grow it on the south side of the house. Provide winter
protection with a heavy mulch.
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners prune bottlebrush immediately after it blooms,
and that's fine if done by early September. But pruning late in the
year can be risky since pruning can trigger new growth that will be
more susceptible to cold. Prune winter-damaged wood early the
following spring, after threat of frost. Leaving cold-damaged wood
in place will help protect any live wood farther down the branches.
</P>
<P>
   Bottlebrush likes full sun and an organically enriched soil that
has excellent drainage.
</P>
<P>
   You can propagate with semi-ripe cuttings in summer or by sowing
seed in fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Ty Nursery is in Ty Ty, Ga. It has a good selection of bulbs
and plants and specializes in hellebores, plants that have been
gaining a lot of attention in the past few years. I intend to test
various ones here, but have yet to do so. I'm afraid many may not
like our heat and humidity, but perhaps there is at least one
species or cultivar that would hold up.
</P>
<P>
   You may send $2 for a catalog to Ty Ty Nursery at P.O. Box 130,
Ty Ty, Ga. 31795.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Mail garden questions to Kathy Huber, garden editor, Houston
Chronicle, P.O. Box 4260, Houston, Texas 77210. The bulk of mail
prevents individual replies to all unpublished letters.

ALONG HIGHWAY 49:  gravel and dirt out of the creek bottom.

</P>
<P>
   Most of the towns along the route feature historic districts of
restored Gold Rush-era buildings. Some are worth a visit, others
seem in danger of collapsing from the weight of all the doodads for
sale. Nevada City, a vibrant county seat _ and, thus, less reliant
on tourism _ might be the gem of the route, with a warren of
hillside streets, beautifully restored buildings, several nice
places to eat and a reassuring preponderance of book stores.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice is to explore various locales at your leisure
and determine which ones are worth your time.
</P>
<P>
   The charm of some towns is undermined by their reliance on
visitor bucks. They can usually be identified by the number of
stores selling antiques, which, apparently, are not to be confused
with collectibles, which should never be mistaken for heirlooms,
which are often confused with gifts.
</P>
<P>
   With perseverance, determined hunters will find the occasional
treasure trove _ at the Victorian Closet in Amador City, for
example, where owner Sally Knudson displays antique patchwork
quilts of unsurpassed workmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The drive along 49 can be equally rewarding _ it's considered
one of the finest motorcycle routes in the state, and, accordingly,
the Harleys are in perpetual evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Although some stretches dismay you with suburban and
shopping-center blight (notably immediately north of Auburn),
others wind through forests of oak and pine, alongside bursts of
wildflowers and past orchards, vineyards, ranches, farms and plenty
of California's unique foothill scenery: rolling hills parched
brown in the sun, dotted here and there with dark-green splashes of
oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to this region also find abundant opportunities to stay
in restored buildings of the Gold Rush era _ or in newer buildings
made to look old. Most motels are confined to the outskirts of
towns, far from the historic districts, so those interested in
period immersion gravitate to the numerous bed-and-breakfast inns
that pepper the foothills.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly when choosing a historic building, it is wise to
call ahead and get exact descriptions of the amenities, if such
things are important to you.
</P>
<P>
   The Chichester-McKee House in Placerville, for example, dates to
1892, and the tiny closets of the three bedrooms have been
converted to half baths. In one bathroom, you have to straddle the
commode to wash your hands in a fold-down steel sink that was
lifted from a Pullman railroad car. For anything beyond a sponge
bath, there is one room at the top of the stairs, featuring a
substantial tub, that must be used by all of the inn's guests
(though, fortunately, not at the same time).
</P>
<P>
   In Murphys, the Redbud Inn is only a few years old and features
spacious rooms with intriguing touches _ enormous whirlpool tubs in
some, clawfoot bathtubs positioned next to fireplaces in others.
But corners were obviously cut on construction materials _
specifically in the case of floor and ceiling insulation. Even
kitchen conversation creates a considerable din, starting at about
5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada City, the ancient Red Castle Inn is a red-brick,
Gothic Revival structure built into the side of a steep, wooded
slope. It is painstakingly decorated with Victorian antiques, such
that you hesitate _ for maybe a second or two _ before putting your
beer bottle down on some spindly nightstand.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Castle also has a reputation for housing ghosts. A
former governess reportedly has been encountered tucking in
sleeping guests, as she once did the children of original owner
John Williams, who arrived in '49 and went on to become a mine
owner and local judge. An ethereal gentleman also visited one of
the construction workers who participated in the house's
restoration in 1963, ostensibly to oversee the work.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the kinds of things you want to read about at
10:30 at night, especially when you're sitting in the
otherwise-deserted parlor under some dim relic of a Victorian lamp
_ fully aware that you're the only guest for the night in this
seven-room inn.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I had only one encounter with the spirit world. A
runaway ghost freight train roared through the building just before
dawn _ at least that's what it sounded like when someone elsewhere
in the house flushed a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   The evening before, a walk up Broad Street in Nevada City had
yielded a scene that might be unique to this region and capable of
stirring endless musings about what life was like a century and a
half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The view to the east encompassed rugged, forested slopes where
gold used to hide. At the stately National Hotel, which has been in
continuous operation since 1856, the patrons were
shoulder-to-shoulder at the dark, wood-paneled Victorian bar.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of people strolled the sidewalk, tracking down lodging
or seeking out dinner, confident that their labors had earned them
particular pampering.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the town's steep main street, a sunset in pastels
was visible, directly behind the clapboard United Methodist Church
and the silhouettes of tall pines behind it.
</P>
<P>
   OK. On a visit to the Gold Rush country, maybe there is nothing
wrong with romanticizing things a bit. &QL;

PLANNING A STAY IN THE GOLD COUNTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLACERVILLE _ During California's mad rush for gold 150 years
ago, there was no particular sense of order to the settling of the
Sierra Nevada foothills.
</P>
<P>
   When gold was discovered at a certain location, miners swarmed
it. Tents and lean-tos would go up. An entrepreneur would soon set
up a makeshift store, to be followed closely by a grog shop. Some
plank structures might be thrown up in time. But when the gold gave
out, most everyone would vanish, bound for richer diggings, and the
cycle would begin anew somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that 500 towns were established in Gold Rush
country between 1848 and 1860. Only a handful remain _ often in
areas where hard-rock mining prolonged the life of settlements.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason a visit to the surviving towns of the gold
country needs to be as haphazard as it was during the rush.
Although the region stretches out along a circuitous, near-300-mile
stretch of Highway 49 just east of Sacramento, a little advance
planning _ and staying power _ can make a trip enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   HOTTEST TIP: Visit an Automobile Club of Southern California
office and pick up a map titled Guide to California's Mother Lode
(free to members, $3.95 to non-members). It not only is an
exhaustively detailed map _ including suggested side trips _ but
its wide margins are packed with information about many of the
towns, including listings of hours, phone numbers and admission
charges for the numerous state historic parks and museums.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: On a drive from Los Angeles, you'll reach the
southern extremities of the gold country in a little over 300 miles
_ I-5 and I-99 north to Merced, then Route 140 northeast to
Mariposa. Another approach, if budget permits, is to fly to
Sacramento and rent a car. Round-trip passage can be had on
Southwest for a little over $100; daily car rental has been running
about $30 for weekdays, $50 for weekends. Placerville, the
effective midpoint of the gold country, is about an hour's drive
east of Sacramento on Highway 50.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU HAVE TWO DAYS: Concentrate on a stretch from Coloma (six
miles north of Placerville) to Columbia (85 miles to the south).
This will take in the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park
in Coloma and the restored mining town at Columbia State Historic
Park. In between are several intriguing towns, including
picturesque Sutter Creek and Angels Camp, where Mark Twain made a
jumping frog famous.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU HAVE THREE DAYS: To the previous itinerary, add a drive
north of Coloma to Nevada City (46 miles) and make a stop at the
Empire Mine State Historic Park outside Grass Valley. Nevada City
is perhaps the most enchanting restored town in Gold Rush country.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU HAVE A WEEK: Traverse the entire route, from Mariposa in
the south to Sierraville in the north (267 miles), with as many
side trips as you can work in _ Murphys, Volcano, Fiddletown,
Georgetown, Dutch Flat, Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park (but
only if your vehicle is up to the washboard condition of the dirt
road to the park).
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT ANTIQUES: Sutter Creek is
cheek-by-jowl with antique shops. Don't miss the Gold Rush-era
clothes irons at Alicia's _ cast-iron beasts that were heated on
top of a wood-burning stove. Placerville has eight antique stores
in a two-block stretch of the historic district.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT HISTORY: A long stay at Columbia
State Historic Park is a must. Guides will demonstrate how
gold-panning worked. Some businesses are stocked as they were 150
years ago _ strange potions in the apothecary shop, ghastly
instruments at the dentist's office. The museum offers a wealth of
items from the era. Kids might enjoy a stagecoach ride.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE ON A BUDGET: Avoid the restored inns and hotels _
their nightly rates are in the $100-$150 range _ and stick to the
motels on the outskirts of town, where a double in a two-diamond
property can be found in the $50-$75 range. These won't place you
in the historic district; you'll have to make up for lost time
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU PREFER B&AMP;BS: An excellent resource is the Web site of the
California Association of Bed and Breakfast Inns:
www.innaccess.com. With a key-word search, you can select the town
you're interested in. The site, for example, lists five b&AMP;bs in
Sutter Creek (including the famous Foxes), seven in Placerville, 11
in Nevada City. The organization's published guide is less
comprehensive but does feature 29 pages of listings for the Gold
Rush country. Phone: (831) 464-8159.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: On a four-day trip to the gold country in mid-June, one
dining experience was noteworthy. Zachary Jacques, just outside
Placerville, served an excellent five-course dinner special for
$20, featuring crudites, a superb cauliflower soup and salad
(ITALICIZE)after(END ITALS) the main course, in the European
tradition. The restaurant closes for one month each year so that
its employees may take vacation; it will reopen July 24. Phone:
(530) 626-8045. For sandwiches for a picnic, it's hard to beat the
Chatter Box Cafe in Sutter Creek, though when you're given an
estimate on preparation time, double it and take an extended stroll
through town. Phone: (209) 267-5935.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Want to sleep in a Victorian museum? Then the Red
Castle Inn in Nevada City is for you: (530) 265-5135. In
Placerville, the Chichester-McKee House is a quirky,
turn-of-the-century inn: (530) 626-4008. Modern appointments
(whirlpool tubs, pressed-log fireplaces) and thin walls can be
found at the Redbud Inn in Murphys: (209) 728-8533. &UR;  &QL;

 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Europe's television industry is suddenly in the grip of
an American-style consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the forces of the global economy and the power of the
Internet, European media companies are forging cross-border links,
and American giants like Microsoft Corp. are buying into the
action. The resulting corporate alliances are providing a gateway
for advertisers to reach wider mass audiences and an opportunity
for Europe to challenge America's supremacy in television
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The European television market was first opened up in the 1980s,
as state broadcasting monopolies crumbled and commercial channels
sprang up. Now, the long-expected shakeout of an industry made up
of dozens of struggling private and commercial channels has begun
in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, in fact, seems to be charging into a future very much
like America's present, in which the TV industry is dominated by a
handful of huge conglomerates. ``It's a long road, and it will
require a tremendous amount of money, but it will happen,'' said
Marc Andre Feffer, deputy chairman and chief executive officer at
Canal Plus in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The activity so far this year has been intense.
</P>
<P>
   A company in the Netherlands called United Pan-Europe
Communications NV has been gobbling up cable companies across
Europe and in June took a stake in SBS Broadcasting of Luxembourg,
another innovator, to form a strategic alliance. In March, SBS
acquired Central European Media Enterprises, a chain of TV and
radio stations set up in Central Europe after the fall of communism
by Ronald Lauder. United Pan-Europe recently acquired Poland's
leading provider of cable and satellite service and the fourth- and
fifth-largest cable companies in France, lifting the number of its
subscribers to 7.7 million in 10 European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mediaset SA, the Italian television company
controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, an entrepreneur-turned-politician,
and Kirch Group of Germany announced a joint venture in March to
market pay-per-view programming in four countries and handle
Kirch's international film distribution and Mediaset's advertising
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June, the French conglomerate Vivendi SA tightened its
hold on Canal Plus, the French pay-for-view company, by taking over
the French film production and distribution company, Pathe, that
held a stake in Canal Plus. That gave rise to speculation that
Canal Plus might revive discussions about cooperating with News
Corp. of Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born media mogul. Murdoch,
who is pursuing the kind of television breakthrough in Europe that
he has achieved in the United States with his Fox networks,
acquired a stake in an Italian pay-for-view channel, Stream SpA,
and a major chunk of German soccer rights through a small German
affiliate, TeleMuenchen, last month.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch, at a news conference in London last week, ruled out a
merger between News Corp.'s B Sky B and Canal Plus but kept the
door open for looser alliances in areas like film production and
rights to sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   What's causing this frenzy of reorganization? Mainly, the global
economy, which is forcing Europe's relatively small players to join
forces to cover the costs of switching to digital and pay-for-view
TV and of marketing integrated bundles of television, telephone and
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several axes are evolving,'' said Nick Bertolotti, who follows
the television business at J.P. Morgan in London. Describing the
industry's state as ``very unstable,'' he added, ``Anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   American companies are a big part of the equation. Pan-Europe
Communications is controlled by the Denver-based investor group
Unitedglobalcom, for example. And, imitating the American drive
into ``bundled'' telephone and Internet services, it has already
provided 118,000 of its cable customers with phone service and more
than 40,000 with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft recently acquired a 7.8 percent stake in United
Pan-Europe Communications as part of its effort to extend its reach
into the European telecommunications revolution. ``The rate of
growth is moving very, very quickly,'' said Henrietta Hirst, a
spokeswoman for United Pan-Europe in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also taken stakes in leading cable companies in
Britain and Portugal, while the American television veteran Harry
Evans Sloan has invested in SBS. American groups like
Unitedglobalcom, which was known until recently as United
International Holdings Inc., and Internet service providers like
America Online Inc. are searching out European opportunities, as
are providers of television programming, like Walt Disney Co., that
see the promise of larger markets for their products.
</P>
<P>
   If much of this sounds like an echo of what is happening in the
United States, it is also boosting the local flavor of European
television. European productions are hardly about to outstrip
American programs as Europe's fare of choice, but the Europeans
have reconquered prime time with home-grown quiz shows and soap
operas. Last year, there were no American series and only two
American feature films among the 10 most popular programs in
Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, off-prime time is still saturated with American
products. Cable and pay per view now enable TV audiences to see hit
films like ``Titanic'' within months of their release, and channels
across Europe are showing reruns of ``Little House on the
Prairie,'' ``Hogan's Heroes,'' ``Cheers,'' ``Golden Girls'' and
``Baywatch,'' dubbed into the local languages, as they have for
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer proliferation of new channels and technologies
means more broadcast time for everybody. As a result, European
production of both high-quality programs and knockoffs of American
schlock, like a French version of Baywatch called ``St.-Tropez,''
is making big inroads into American territory.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Europe remains a checkerboard of small markets divided by
culture and language, industry consolidation means that
broadcasters have bigger, more efficient organizations at their
disposal as they offer national programming. Thus, ``the market is
becoming more European,'' said Fedele Confalonieri, president of
Mediaset. He said Mediaset's vision ``is for many local
broadcasters, as there are in the United States, united in large
units, like CBS or ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how this works, consider Mediaset's alliance
with Kirch. Under it, the Germans focus on what they do best _
program production and trading of rights _ while Mediaset brings in
expertise in advertising sales and program distribution.
(Mediaset's parent company, Fininvest SpA, holds a stake in the
European affiliate of the Blockbuster video chain.)
</P>
<P>
   One of last year's most popular programs was ``The Count of
Monte Cristo,'' a $20 million, three-part miniseries produced
jointly by Mediaset, Kirch and the leading commercial broadcaster
in France, TF 1. And as Europe unifies, more and more companies are
broadcasting the same commercial spots across the Continent,
enabling Mediaset to sell air time on a multinational basis. ``The
spots for McDonald's, Sony and Disney are the same in London, Paris
and Milan,'' Confalonieri said.
</P>
<P>
   European regulators are casting a wary eye on the deal-making,
especially on agreements that concentrate a lot of power in a
single entity. In April, for example, Britain blocked a plan by
Murdoch to acquire the leading British soccer team, Manchester
United, for $1 billion. And earlier, Italy limited the television
soccer rights that any one broadcaster could control, thwarting a
bid by Murdoch for most Italian professional soccer rights.
</P>
<P>
   Although those attempts failed, they demonstrated Murdoch's
faith in the power of sporting events to draw big television
audiences. Indeed, News Corp. has succeeded in acquiring broadcast
rights to four of Italy's top soccer teams. And one of the
attractions of Kirch as a partner for Mediaset was Kirch's $1.7
billion purchase earlier this year of the rights to broadcast the
soccer World Cup in 2002 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, TV wants to drive ad revenues, which
come from ratings,'' said Jose Violante, managing director of NBA
Europe SA, the marketing arm of the National Basketball Association
in Paris. ``And how do you get those ads? Sporting events.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, pay-per-view TV companies whose cables
reach into millions of households are drawing considerable
investment in Europe, not least from American companies.
Microsoft's decision to gather stakes in European cable television
operators is based on the expectation they will require cash and
technology to offer customers high-speed access to the Internet. In
Italy, the Mediaset parent, Fininvest, has a deal with Excite Inc.,
America's second-largest Internet portal, while Bertelsmann in
Germany is working similarly with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Georges Nahon, the head of Microsoft's Paris-based European
Internet and telecommunications activities, said Microsoft focused
on cable TV because of regulatory restrictions on the use of phone
lines for Internet service. But the cable companies generally need
both cash and technology, Nahon said, explaining Microsoft's policy
of taking equity shares. Microsoft continues to search for cable
partners, he said, and not necessarily as potential investment
targets, but also as customers for software and services. ``We are
looking at companies that are very connected to high-speed data
carriage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the television companies, while entrepreneurial, are
not necessarily all moving at the speed of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Confalonieri of Mediaset, while acknowledging that Internet
access is part of the company's plans, said the immediate aims of
the deal with Kirch were production, distribution and advertising
sales. ``The rest,'' he said, ``is wishful thinking where tomorrow
is a little blurred.''

BAY STATE TOWER COMPANY GROWS THROUGH MERGER, PURCHASE

<P>
   BOSTON -- American Tower Corp. completed two transactions
Tuesday _ a $73 million acquisition and a merger with CommSite
International of Virginia _ bringing the total number of towers the
company operates to more than 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston company also recently merged with UNIsite Inc. in a
cash transaction worth about $205 million and gained nearly 400
towers in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   American Tower, which pending the transactions will be one of
the largest broadcast and wireless tower company in the nation,
agreed Tuesday to pay $73 million in cash to purchase 21 broadcast
and cellular towers in the San Francisco area from Watson
Communications Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   These transactions ``represent continuation of our strategy to
focus a significant amount of our resources on the acquisition of
young, newly constructed towers and contracts to construct
additional new towers,'' said Steve Dodge, chief executive officer
of American Tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that transactions of this nature provide the
foundation for profitable long-term growth and other investor
returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley A. Williams, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker who
follows wireless communication companies, said these deals follow
American Tower's pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Tower has a history of doing a lot of acquisitions of
smaller tower companies,'' Williams said. ``This is certainly along
that line. The objective is to continue to expand by buying smaller
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The company purchased all of Watson Communications' assets,
including 11 wireless towers, 10 broadcast towers, and a teleport
that will enable Internet access across the Pacific region.
American Tower already owns an Internet teleports in Washington
D.C., Dallas, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   From its $38.8 million deal with CommSite, American Tower will
acquire towers in Maryland, Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Texas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also includes built-to-suit towers in Tennessee,
Mississippi, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Louisiana that
American Tower said it hopes will expand the company's presence in
the Midwest and Southeast.

COMPANIES JOIN IN EFFORT TO CREATE `TV HOMEPAGES' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MarkeTVision Direct Inc. of Boston and a California company have
teamed up to offer TV viewers a way to create their own
``television homepages,'' a service that would supply them with
customized news headlines and sports scores _ and also give them a
chance to buy merchandise tied to the TV shows they watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could buy a Judge Judy gavel,'' said president Andrew
Miller of MarkeTVision, ``or some other kind of collectible.''
</P>
<P>
   MarkeTVision's partner is Steeplechase Media Inc., a California
outfit that looks to make the content of shows such as Judge Judy
interactive. The joint venture, announced Tuesday and scheduled for
a fall debut, is called television.com and aims to be at the
convergence of TV and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to Miller, the day is not far off when many TV viewers
could, by a click of the remote, have a window appear in a corner
of the TV screen on which merchandise tied to the show would be for
sale. A few more clicks, and a purchase could be made, much as
e-commerce consumers buy goods at retail Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   There would also be TV homepages, which could be customized by
viewers to receive the sports scores of a favorite team or weather
reports for an upcoming vacation destination.
</P>
<P>
   Not many viewers can take advantage of interactive TV just yet.
But more will soon have digital cable boxes or special software for
their PCs that could make interactive TV a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe that the majority of people want to interact
with the television most of the time,'' said Larry Namer, chairman
of Steeplechase, which owns 75 percent of television.com. ``But we
do believe that all viewers at some point want customized
information at their fingertips that they can access without
leaving the programs they are watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Steeplechase and MarkeTVision said they're making an initial $4
million investment in television.com. After Steeplechase's 75
percent, MarkeTVision owns 15 percent of the new company and
investors own the remaining 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As with any Web idea, it's hard to say whether television.com
will be a smash, a bust, or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the cost of interactive TV was a big hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   But with the cost to consumers coming down, the challenge is to
make interactive TV easy to use and motivate viewers to make
purchases, said Josh Bernoff, principal analyst for TV research at
Forrester Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this something you can do with a remote in one hand and a
beer in the other?'' Bernoff said.
</P>
<P>
   If the answer is yes, he said, the key questions then are ``do
people really want to look at the Web on TV?'' and can you ``get
people up off their butts to buy things?''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Miller of MarkeTVision fits in. He's gotten folks
to get up off their butts to buy things before, most notably by
devising one of the first infomercials to air on public television
stations.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, public TV infomercials would seem like a
nonstarter. Most people associate infomercials with relentless
pitchmen flogging appliances that process beef jerky _ not at all
the kind of thing that crops up on ``Masterpiece Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, however, produces infomercials that are so low-key that
many viewers mistake them for regular cable TV fare.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a stock broker by trade, Miller was managing money
for violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman when the two realized that an
infomercial might be one of Perlman's best investments.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1996, and Perlman was compiling a special CD of his
favorite selections. To market the CD, Miller taped interviews of
Perlman and mixed them with concert footage.
</P>
<P>
   For public TV, this infomercial turned out to be ideal for
fund-raising drives. During pledge week, viewers got a welcome
break from celebrities making pleas in front of phone banks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, viewers were treated to the infomercial, which public
TV stations paid fees to Perlman and Miller to air. Viewers who
donated a specified amount received the Perlman CD.
</P>
<P>
   That infomercial was so successful that Miller worked on
variations of it for other TV stations and other entertainers,
including the Grateful Dead and the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a rock band, the Dead is also a $100
million-a-year business that relied on the band's constant touring
to drive album and merchandise sales. When band leader Jerry Garcia
died, the band was hit with a marketing and cash-flow crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Enter MarkeTVision, which produced a Dead infomercial fashioned
on the Perlman format, creating a show that promoted CDs of Dead
concerts that weren't yet available in stores but that viewers
could buy by calling a toll-free phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Now Miller aims to use the skills he perfected working with
Perlman and the Grateful Dead to make commercials, and possibly Web
site infomercials, that will drive viewers to television.com and
persuade them to buy the merchandise it features.

BARAK SWORN IN AS ISRAELI PREMIER, PLEDGES UNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS to CORRECT to Tuesday, sted Wednesday, in lede and
throughout; in last graf, Wednesday is cq.) 
 (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Seven long weeks of political negotiations after he
was elected, Ehud Barak took office as prime minister of Israel on
Tuesday and pledged that the pursuit of a ``true, lasting peace'
would be his foremost concern.
</P>
<P>
   In a passionate inaugural speech, Barak, 57, addressed not only
the Israelis glued to their radios and televisions but also the
many Palestinians and Syrians who watched, waiting for messages.
Despite a chorus of criticism for the composition of his Cabinet
and a wariness about him in the region, Barak sounded a
conciliatory note.
</P>
<P>
   He reached out to all his domestic constituencies _ from
high-tech workers to blue-collar unionists to soldiers' mothers
``who don't sleep at night'' _ as well as to each of Israel's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Departing from the confrontational tone of his predecessor,
Benjamin Netanyahu, Barak, the One Israel/Labor Party leader, told
the Palestinians that he recognized their ``suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the pain and death on both sides of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and suggested that each stop focusing
on the ``account settling of historical wrongs.''
</P>
<P>
   While Netanyahu always emphasized the dangers surrounding
Israel, Barak described his country as ``strong and confident.''
And he urged Israel's neighbors to meet him at the diplomatic table
with an equal determination to ride the ups and downs of difficult
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on all regional leaders to take our outstretched hands
and build a peace of the brave,'' Barak said, embracing the phrase
that Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, often uses.
</P>
<P>
   With a clear intent to allay the concerns of Palestinians that
negotiations with Syria would take precedence, Barak said he would
move forward on both peace tracks at once.
</P>
<P>
   But, underscoring his keen interest in reopening talks with
Syria, which controls much of Lebanon, Barak repeated his campaign
promise to withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza Tuesday night, Barak's words were received by
Palestinians as a welcome break from the perceived hostility of
Netanyahu _ who officially quit the parliament on Tuesday, shaking
hands and walking out with his back to pursuing television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Palestinian leaders, who are wary of Barak, expressed
cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak's speech is an important and positive signal,'' said
Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian
legislature. ``We hope his words will soon be followed by deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is expected to meet next week with Arafat before traveling
to Washington in mid-July for his first official meeting with
President Clinton. Barak is also expected to see President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan this month.
</P>
<P>
   Using vivid language in his address, Barak, a highly decorated
former general, described himself as a ``warrior'' who ``for tens
of years wore no other clothes but the olive uniform.'' Citing
verses from the poet A. Hillel, he called himself one of the ``gray
soldiers whose hands are blackened from war and whose nostrils are
filled with death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tongue is dry from the march,'' he quoted, ``And we cry
love into the insides of your souls.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of political negotiating behind closed doors, Barak
re-emerged into the public eye Tuesday afternoon when he presented
his Cabinet to the parliament. Hours later, in a ceremony in the
Israeli president's house, Barak was sworn in as the leader of a
large majority coalition, controlling nearly two-thirds of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``no accident,'' he said in his inaugural speech, that he
had taken almost all the 45 days allowed by law to form a
government now made up of seven very different political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was forced by the lessons of Jewish history and the deep
divide within our people to form a government that will be able to
function during the most difficult times with the wide acceptance
of the majority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the lectern, as he spoke of inclusiveness, he faced down
catcalls from Israeli Arab members of parliament who feel unjustly
excluded from his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you going to be the prime minister of everyone?'' one
shouted. ``Where are the Arab ministers?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, from another direction, Barak was rebuked by Ariel
Sharon, the temporary leader of the opposition Likud Party, for not
saying ``one word'' that would characterize the importance of the
state as a ``Zionist Jewish'' enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, the former foreign minister, also criticized Barak for
intransigence during the unsuccessful coalition negotiations with
the Likud, and said that the ``unique'' personal relationship
between them had been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon said that he had requested and been denied the power to
monitor the future peace negotiations _ which, he said, in a
reference to Barak, should not be controlled by only ``one person
no matter how talented he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinging news media criticism Tuesday labeled Barak as a leader
with autocratic tendencies _ calling him everything from
``Caligulan'' to a near ``Ehud Bonaparte.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism began after Barak unveiled his Cabinet. He was
accused by many of making weak or inappropriate appointments. And
many suggested that he was doing his best to consolidate his hold
on power so that he could tackle his ambitious political agenda
without interference.
</P>
<P>
   In a country with a parliament, it is unusual for the prime
minister to act in a semi-presidential manner, but Barak, who was
elected in a separate ballot from his party, says that he has
received a personal mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak promised fast economic growth, social justice, leaving
Lebanon, completion of the peace accords, national reconciliation
and security,'' Nahum Barnea, a senior political columnist, wrote
in Yedioth Ahronoth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging from the composition of the government, it seems that
he expects to carry out all of these tasks alone, with a commando
knife between his teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new prime minister stared in the face his first political
failure Tuesday, when Avraham Burg, an ambitious Labor Party
official and sometime critic of Barak, was sworn in as speaker of
the parliament. Barak had backed a political novice for the post,
only to have his own party choose Burg instead.
</P>
<P>
   When Burg took his chair late Tuesday afternoon, he shook hands
with the prime minister. ``I have no hate in my heart toward the
prime minister,'' he had said earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, after presenting his Cabinet of 18 ministers,
Barak said he would move immediately to alter the basic law of
Israel. In order to accommodate the seven parties in his coalition
and to take on tasks that are ``humongous, maybe even historic,''
he said he would propose to expand the Cabinet to 24 ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And only one woman?'' Tamar Gozansky, a member of parliament
from the Communist Party called out.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although he pledged to include at least three women in his
Cabinet, he has appointed only one, Dalia Itzik of Labor, who will
be Environment Minister, and no female deputy ministers. He has
been roundly criticized for this.
</P>
<P>
   Against the background noise of these charges, Barak nonetheless
portrayed himself as the leader of all sectors of Israeli society,
a proponent of equal rights, and a healer.
</P>
<P>
   He more or less apologized that Israel has ``not always been
wise enough to invest equally in all of its people.'' This echoed a
legendary apology that Barak had earlier made to the Israeli Jews
of Middle Eastern descent, on behalf of the Labor Party, whose
original treatment of them is now largely considered to have been
discriminatory. He said he empathized with poor people who are
``full of broken promises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will change the national priorities,'' he said, promising
to create 300,000 new jobs over the next four years and to invest
heavily in education.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Barak addressed a personal remark to President
Hafez Assad of Syria,
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been harsh and bitter enemies on the battlefield,'' he
said. ``Now it is time to form an open and brave peace that will
insure the future and security of our peoples, our children and our
grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also talked about working with Arafat to build a ``true
partnership in this land in which two peoples will live.''
</P>
<P>
   In a challenge to his intentions, bulldozers cleared land
earlier in the day for a Jewish quarter in an Arab neighborhood of
East Jerusalem. The Palestinians have urged Barak to stop the
expansion of settlements on land whose fate will be negotiated, and
the guidelines of Barak's government promises to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, who was sworn in as a minister Tuesday, will oversee
Jerusalem. He said that the project, Ras al-Amud, should be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will move into the prime minister's office on Wednesday.

QUIETLY BUT SURELY, ADMINISTRATION OPENING DOORS TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is quietly moving to expand contacts
between the United States and Cuba, pressing a modest opening that
largely sidesteps President Fidel Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   With a series of small steps _ some announced earlier this year
and others now being prepared _ the administration is mainly
seeking to ease the hardships of the Cuban people and to allow
certain Americans to visit Cuba, set up offices there and send
money, food and medicine more freely.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, officials said, they will lift more
restrictions on money transfers and travel and announce the start
of direct charter flights between Havana and the New York
metropolitan region and Los Angeles, in addition to those that now
depart and land at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The moves have included a tentative new approach to the Cuban
government. On June 21 in Havana, U.S. and Cuban officials agreed
to begin working more closely to combat a sharp rise in drug
trafficking in and around the island, and they proposed other
measures that American officials said could lead to greater
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative falls well within the limits on American policy
that were set in 1992 and 1996 by laws that stiffened the
37-year-old economic embargo on the island. Some of the steps now
being taken were postponed in the outcry after Cuban fighters shot
down two civilian planes in 1996, killing four Cuban-Americans who
had planned to fly over Havana and leading to the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   But the laws leave the White House considerable authority to
widen American contacts with Cuba, and officials say they are
resolved to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conscious decision in this administration to do
what needs to be done,'' a senior official said. Referring to
Cuban-American opponents of Castro's government, he added, ``This
is a policy that has been held hostage to interest groups for way
too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said the administration was already being pulled
on Cuba policy between the legacy of President Clinton and the
political aspirations of Vice President Al Gore. Clinton is said by
aides to see Washington's approach to Cuba as archaic and
ineffective. Gore is described as highly aware of the considerable
influence that Cuban-American voters may have in two pivotal
states, Florida and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other officials say however modest the recent measures, the
shift is particularly significant because it reflects a widespread
view in the administration that the domestic politics of dealing
with Cuba are changing in fundamental ways.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the Cold War's end, administration officials say
they see the strength of conservative Cuban-American groups waning,
while opposition to the embargo continues to grow among business
people, farmers, religious groups and younger Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   After years of waiting for some political opening in Cuba,
American officials say, they are now determined to go forward, even
if Castro responds by cracking down on dissent, as he did soon
after Washington announced measures in January to increase contact
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban response has even encouraged some American proponents
of a hard-line policy to say that the so-called people-to-people
initiative might help destabilize the Communist government by
empowering the few dissidents on the island.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the administration sees the approach as a means of
undercutting Cuba's argument that it is under siege by the United
States. The new direction is also widely seen as a way to present a
kinder American face to ordinary Cubans and, perhaps, to build a
modicum of trust with younger Cuban officials who will become more
important after the 72-year-old Castro passes from power.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's latest actions on Cuba recall an even more
low-key White House effort in late 1995 and early 1996. Officials
said that initiative, which focused more directly on the Cuban
government, was approved by Clinton and managed by Sandy Berger,
deputy national security adviser at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a relaxation of travel and other restrictions in
October 1995. But according to current and former officials, the
administration also choreographed a series of possible steps to
ease American sanctions if Cuba continued to open up its economy
and to promote a more cooperative relationship with the Cuban
government.
</P>

   ``We were trying to open the door _ to push it open if necessary
_ and make it clear to the Cuban government that if they walked
through that door, nothing bad would happen to them,'' one former
official involved in the planning said.
</P>
<P>
   Then as now, officials said, collaboration in antinarcotics
efforts was high on the agenda. In meetings with Cuban officials,
U.S. officials raised the possibility of American law-enforcement
training for Cuban police and border-guard officials, as well as
the stationing of a representative of the Drug Enforcement
Administration in Havana, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Narcotics was going to be a vehicle to get to other things,''
another former official involved in that initiative said. ``The
real question was what the next step would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals included encouraging American nongovernmental
groups like environmental and human rights advocates to work in
Cuba, some collaboration with the Cuban government on environmental
issues and an exploration of how to initiate contacts abroad
between military officers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts slammed to an abrupt halt in February 1996 when the
civilian planes were shot down. The next month, Congress passed the
Helms-Burton law, codifying the embargo and adding sanctions.
Clinton signed the legislation over the advice of some senior aides
and that November came surprisingly close to winning a majority of
the Cuban-American vote in Dade County, Fla.

   In recent months, the Treasury Department has begun to simplify
the cumbersome procedures for travel to Cuba by Americans like
researchers and athletes, aid workers and freelance journalists.
Similar consideration is most likely to be extended soon to others
like students, artists and representatives of religious groups.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In March, the administration moved to streamline the sale and
donation of medicines to Cuba, and next month, a Florida
pharmaceutical company is to start shipping medicines to Cubans for
benefactors in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules that will take effect this month, Cuban
emigres and others will be able to send money to Cubans by Western
Union, reducing the cost of transfers that have been handled by
travel agencies and other small businesses. Americans can now send
up to $300 to the island every three months, as long as the money
does not go to senior government or Communist Party officials.
</P>
<P>
   How much advantage Americans will take of the new rules remains
to be seen. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, Maria
Ibanez, said travel to Cuba had steadily increased since the new
regulations were issued in May. The expected addition of direct
charter flights from New York and Los Angeles is intended to
accommodate that rise.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since baseball games in the spring between the Baltimore Orioles
and the Cuban national team, the administration has offered
proposals for other sports events. Those plans have been set back,
however, by differences over how to avoid generating revenue for
the Cuban government, a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past years, FBI counterterrorism officials have
traveled to Havana to discuss the bombings of tourist hotels there,
and weather experts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration have met Cuban officials to discuss sharing
information on hurricanes. But the administration move last month
to explore a more cooperative antidrug relationship with the Cuban
government has run into stronger opposition, mainly from a few
members of Congress, who say the Cuban authorities are involved in
the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials who have read a recent Central
Intelligence Agency assessment of Cuba's role said it concluded, to
the contrary, that although traffickers in the Caribbean might have
bought the complicity of low-level Cuban officials, there was no
evidence of high-level drug corruption.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also cite a series of incidents in recent
years in which Cuban officials helped track down drug shipments, as
well as one in which they even testified in a federal
drug-smuggling case in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Cuba have communicated for some time by
fax about suspicious boats and planes around the island. At the
meetings on June 21 in Havana, Cuban officials told State
Department and Coast Guard representatives that they would speed up
communications by using telephones and radios.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba will not allow American ships to pursue suspected drug
boats into Cuban waters, but will consider letting the Coast Guard
station a drug-interdiction specialist at the American diplomatic
mission in Havana and having Coast Guard experts join Cubans in
searching large ships, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some officials said the administration's new approach
was gaining momentum, others predicted that it would increasingly
be filtered through Gore's presidential campaign. Gore, the
officials said, has taken a relatively hard line on Cuban policy in
the past, playing a prominent role in the decision to suspend
charter flights in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the administration wants to help Gore, they're not going to
push beyond the parameter of what they're doing now,'' said Rep.
Robert Menendez, D-N.J., who also credited Gore with helping to
defeat a proposal for a bipartisan commission to reassess Cuba
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they push the envelope much further,'' Menendez said, ``I
think you'll see more negative reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gore, Tom Rosshirt, said the vice president
supported a policy of building contacts with the Cuban people while
maintaining economic pressure on the government. Rosshirt declined
to comment on specific advice that Gore has given Clinton on Cuba.

FLORIDA OFFICIALS TO SEEK OTHER DUTY FOR KIDNAP FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Reacting to bitter criticism over Stephen Fagan's
court-ordered service at a veterans hospital, Florida correction
officials will propose at a hearing this month in Massachusetts
that the convicted kidnapper be assigned instead to do social work
with the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The site chosen by Florida probation officials is Cafe Joshua, a
West Palm Beach facility that provides a wide range of services to
hundreds of people attempting to begin the transition from the
streets to the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is tentatively scheduled for July 20 before Judge
Peter M. Lauriat in Middlesex Superior Court, said Coria Holland,
spokeswoman for the Massachusetts probation department.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, who was convicted in May of kidnapping his two daughters
from Massachusetts in 1979, began doing 2,000 hours of community
service at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Riviera Beach,
Fla. The assignment outraged former Florida Governor Claude Kirk, a
World War II and Korean War veteran, who said that a felon's
presence at the hospital was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk said Tuesday that he has no objection to Cafe Joshua. ``I
think that's a better place,'' said Kirk, a West Palm Beach
resident who served as governor from 1967-1971. ``Veterans, in my
mind, are people we're supposed to honor, and they don't need to be
exposed to this. I don't care where he is, just so it's real public
service and also doesn't put veterans in a less than honorable
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Porter, director of interstate compacts for the Florida
correction department, described the request to change Fagan's
community service as routine. He also said that Kirk was not alone
in criticizing the assignment to the VA hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's attorney, Richard Egbert, said Tuesday that he had not
been informed of the hearing date and was unaware of the choice of
Cafe Joshua.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Sweeting, social services director at Cafe Joshua, said
the facility is ``disguised as a restaurant'' with an eating area
in one part of the building and working offices in another section.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person is homeless, not only is there hunger in their
stomach, but there's also a hunger of the soul and the spirit,''
Sweeting said. Cafe Joshua strives to give its clients ``spiritual
support, empowerment and encouragement, and to treat them with
dignity and respect,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The facility retains a five-star chef from Switzerland to
prepare three-course meals for its clients, who are referred from
other agencies. Often, they have left the street recently and are
staying in transitional housing.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Joshua provides drug and alcohol counseling, emergency
vision and dental care, legal services, mental health therapy, even
makeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting said she did not know what kind of work Fagan would do
at Cafe Joshua if the new assignment is approved.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan and his fourth wife have put their oceanfront Palm Beach
mansion up for sale. He has staunchly defended his decision to flee
to Florida with his daughters, then 5 and 2 years old, and assume a
new identity. Fagan has justified his decision by describing the
girls' mother, Barbara Kurth, as alcoholic and neglectful at the
time of their abduction.
</P>
<P>
   The daughters did not know their mother was alive until Fagan
was arrested in April 1998. He had told them she died in a car
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's home was the site of a Father's Day protest by a group
called Voice for the Children, some of whose members allege that
their spouses abducted their children.

KOSOVAR ORPHANS MAY BE HEADED TO BAY STATE

<P>
   BOSTON -- Four Kosovar Albanian orphans, who witnessed the
murder of their father by three masked Serbs, hope to find a new
home in Massachusetts because of the efforts of Kitty Dukakis, to
bring them here.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Tirana, Albania, Tuesday Dukakis,
the wife of former governor Michael S. Dukakis, said she may be
returning with the children, two boys and two girls, ranging in age
from 15 to 19, this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   She was acting, she said, on behalf of a Concord family, who
wants to give the youngsters a home, and a Concord church who is
assisting them. She did not identify the family.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice tinged with emotion, one of the children, Kreshnik
Zejnullahu, 16, described by phone what had happened to the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 14, my mother died from cancer,'' she said. ``Last
November, when I was in the garden of our home in Pec about 8 at
night, three masked Serbs arrived and grabbed me. They didn't say
anything except to tell me to call for my mother. I told them she
was dead. But, they didn't believe me and started yelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, who was a doctor, came to the door and, when he
tried to close it, they fired through the door and killed him in
front of all of us. Then, they ran away.''
</P>
<P>
   The children buried their father, and, then, in March, they left
Kosovo by car, arriving in Montenegro, about 45 kilometers away, at
midnight. There, they stayed for about one month and made their way
to Tirana where they have been living with nine other people in a
bedroom in the house of an Albanian man who has opened his home to
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to coming to America,'' Kreshnik said,
speaking for his sisters, Amella, 19, and Aida, 18, and brother,
Sokol, 15. ``Our only fear now is that it may not really happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Dukakis, who has been involved with the resettlement of
refugees and victims of war for more than 20 years, says she is
going to make sure it does happen. She has enlisted the aid of the
United Nations and official sources on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is cleared so far,'' she said. ``The children's
relatives have consented and their health has been approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis, 62, went to Albania last week on behalf of Relief
International, a California-based refugee organization, where she
had agreed to speak to the women in the camps the organization has
been operating about health and resettlement issues. When the
Concord family learned she was going, they asked her to intercede
on the children's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   While there, she crossed the border into Kosovo, to the town of
Prizrin, something she had promised her husband back in Boston she
would not do because of the presence of landmines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful small city with many burnt houses and
farms,'' she said by phone from Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis said she was impressed by the work of Relief
International, whose executive director, Farshad Raftegar, is,
himself, an Iranian refugee. ``It is a small non-governmental
agency, a small entity without a bureaucracy, that has programs in
six countries. As soon as the Kosovo war broke out, Mr. Rafetgar
had physicians from San Francisco and Los Angeles at the scene,''
Dukakis said.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Dukakis has a long history working with refugees and
victims of war.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, she received a degree in social work from Boston
University and for the last three years she has been working as a
constituent advocate at the International Institute of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, she assisted survivors of the Holocaust and the
Armenian genocide in their efforts to ensure these horrible events
are not forgotten. In 1979, former President Jimmy Carter appointed
her to the Holocaust Council, on which she still serves.
</P>
<P>
   She began working with victims of the Cambodian war in the early
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   Her most dramatic rescue came in 1985 when she went to a
Cambodian refugee camp on the border of Thailand and found the
brother and only surviving family member of a young Cambodian woman
refugee who had been resettled in Lynnfield.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Dukakis was denied entrance to the camp by its
commandant but, when she fell to her knees and begged his approval,
he relented and let her in. She brought Hout Pich back to the
United States and a reunion with his sister Sarom Taing.
</P>
<P>
   Pich is now a physician's assistant working with the Khmer
community in Lowell.

WHITE HOUSE PLANS GALA TO WELCOME MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To usher in the new millennium, the White House is
planning to host a star-studded New Year's Eve gala on the Mall
that could rival New York City's Times Square bash, where thousands
traditionally gather to watch the ball drop and count down the
seconds until the stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Millennium Council, created last year by the
president and headed by Hillary Rodham Clinton, is planning the
three-day event that starts on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities will include a short film by director Steven
Spielberg and outdoor concerts headed by Quincy Jones and producer
George Stevens Jr. of the Kennedy Center. Spielberg's 20-minute
film will highlight historic moments of the 20th century and will
feature an original score by former Boston Pops director and
Hollywood composer John Williams, who did music for films such as
``Star Wars'' and ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make this a truly American event,'' Ann Lewis,
counselor to the president, said Tuesday. ``We want people to
realize what a milestone the millennium is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said she expects the New Year's celebration to attract
even bigger crowds than the Fourth of July celebration, which draws
hundreds of thousands of people each year.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials insist the public festivities have nothing
to do with Mrs. Clinton trying to one-up the celebration in the Big
Apple, where her expected chief opponent for a Senate seat, Rudy
Giuliani, is mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always said she would balance her time being a first lady
and a candidate,'' Lewis said. ``This would fall under the role of
first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   And Toby Graff, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said: ``Plans
for the formation of the Millennium Council began before the buzz
about Mrs. Clinton's potential run for the New York Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration will stretch across the Mall, from the Capitol
to the Lincoln Memorial, and along parts of Pennsylvania Avenue
leading to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10 p.m. on New Year's Eve, participants will parade down
Constitution Avenue to the Lincoln Memorial. President Clinton is
scheduled to speak, and at the stroke of midnight, ``something
magical'' should light up the sky, according to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The official theme for the millennium celebration is ``Honor the
past, imagine the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at trying to make the New Year's weekend really
special,'' Lewis said. ``We definitely want to mark the turn of the
century with something very festive and patriotic.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultural events on the Mall the following two days are being
coordinated with the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   According to Anne Donovan, the Millennium Council's deputy
director, the Smithsonian envisions bridging a generation gap by
setting up ``teach-ins'' along the Mall, where leaders in
disciplines such as law, sports, medicine, and music teach the next
generation about their respective fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will act as role models for the future generation of
American leaders,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   While the celebration is intended to be ``rowdy and fun,''
Donovan said the activities will stay ``family focused.'' Because
the National Park Service oversees the grounds where most of the
events will take place, alcohol will be banned from the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Large corporate donors are expected to cover the $10 million
cost of the celebration. Lewis said donors will be recognized in
some formal way during the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who may be busy campaigning for a Senate seat in
New York by that time, plans to mark the turn of the century in
Washington instead of in the state she intends to adopt as her
home, according to Lewis.

 &HT;    Strike reported over, but Teamsters picket
 &HT;    By Shannon Shelton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Overnite Transportation Co. announced the end of a
Teamsters strike at its suburban Atlanta service center Tuesday,
but picketing continued at the trucking company's other terminals
here.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company issued a news release announcing the end of
the strike, Teamsters national spokesman David Cameron said he
hadn't received any information about the action being over.
</P>
<P>
   Dockworkers and truck drivers at the Marietta center in
Kennesaw, the north Atlanta center in Lawrenceville and the Atlanta
center on Moreland Avenue began the walkout Monday night. Union
members also picketed at Overnite facilities in Memphis,
Indianapolis and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron said the strike was in response to complaints Overnite
harassed or illegally discharged union workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just false,'' said Ira Rosenfeld, Overnite's director
of corporate communications in Richmond, Va. ``We categorically
deny anybody's been discharged for union activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnite and the union disputed the effects of the strike on the
trucking company's operations Tuesday. Rosenfeld said the strike
has not hindered operations and that 75 volunteer drivers from
centers within 90 minutes of metro Atlanta made sure all deliveries
were completed. He also questioned Teamsters figures on the number
of workers on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people out there aren't Overnite personnel,''
Rosenfeld said, claiming the Teamsters brought in a striker from
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron said Overnite wasn't being truthful about its operations
continuing as normal. ``They say there are no disruptions, but at
the same time, they are bringing in people from other locations.
They can't have it both ways,'' Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking firm is negotiating with the international
Teamsters organization, but no negotiations are taking place with
Local 728, the Atlanta-area branch involved in the strike.

<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ Jiri Kylian makes his appearance
dressed all in black and riding a bicycle, which seems fitting for
a Czech choreographer who is also artistic director of the
Netherlands Dans Theater. This being a country none too respectful
of hierarchies, however, his arrival at the Lucent Danstheater, his
company's headquarters here, goes almost unnoticed. For all his
international fame, Kylian does not play the star in his own house.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, 90 minutes later, as he presides over a
rehearsal of a dozen young dancers, his authority is absolute.
Sitting on a metal chair beside the console that controls the
music, he speaks softly in English (the lingua franca of the
multinational ballet corps) and makes light of mistakes he spots.
Tall, slim, youthful looking, with only streaks of gray in his
goatee hinting that he is now 52, his very presence seems enough to
bring out the best in his dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for many critics, it is through his quiet leadership as
much as his emotionally charged choreography that he has turned the
Netherlands Dans Theater _ the NDT _ into one of Europe's most
admired dance companies. In September, Kylian steps down after 24
years as artistic director, but he is not abandoning ship.
Dispensing with administrative duties that have begun to weigh on
him, he will stay on as chief choreographer and artistic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   He will not be underemployed. On his watch, two new ensembles
were added: the original 32-member corps founded in 1959 became
NDT1; a 14-member group, NDT2, was created in 1979 for dancers
between the ages of 17 and 22; and since 1989, NDT3 has enabled
five ``seniors'' to keep dancing, as he puts it, ``between 40 and
death.'' They often tour separately, but for Lincoln Center
Festival '99, the entire company will be performing at the New York
State Theater this week: NDT1 will present the United States
premiere of ``One of a Kind'' on July 13 and July 14; and all three
ensembles will participate in an eclectic program July 16 through
July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Kylian has picked his New York showpieces carefully. He
describes ``One of a Kind,'' only his third full-evening work
(after ``L'Histoire du Soldat'' and ``Kaguyahime''), as his gift to
the company because it includes all NDT1 members, dancing as
individuals rather than as a group. Commissioned to celebrate the
150th anniversary of the Dutch Constitution, it is also a homage to
his adoptive country since individual freedom is the unifying theme
of its three sections. Adding an unusual visual dimension, the set
has been designed by an architect, Atsushi Kitagawara of Japan, who
created mysterious abstract shapes through random computerized
programs.
</P>
<P>
   With the second program, the choreographer said, ``the idea is
to show all three ensembles at their best.'' Two of Kylian's works,
``Bella Figura'' and ``Wings of Wax,'' will be performed by NDT1
and a third, ``A Way a Lone,'' by NDT3, while four young dancers
from NDT2 will present ``Skew Whiff,'' by Paul Lightfoot, who is
still a member of the main NDT1 ensemble. These are also American
premieres. Finally, the evening will close with an excerpt from
Kylian's 1995 epic work, ``Arcimboldo,'' which he describes as ``a
cheerful polonnaise'' in which all his dancers as well as students
from the Juilliard School will fill the stage.
</P>
<P>
   So, Kylian was asked, what should people unfamiliar with his
work expect to see?
</P>
<P>
   He looked suddenly uneasy _ choreographers generally dislike
having to define their work. Having abandoned narrative for
abstraction, all too often they prefer audiences to make what they
will of what they see. So, in that respect, Kylian seems no
different. What distinguishes him from some of his contemporaries,
however, is that he aims unabashedly for the heart over the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every piece should give you something to take home with you,''
he said. ``If you don't come away thinking, `I feel a little richer
today because I have seen something special that has to do with
me,' then there is no justification for its existence. But if 30
different people see my work, there will be 30 different responses
to it. My work is very ambiguous. I acknowledge that, but I can't
do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work more realistically before,'' he went on. ``My
themes were such that you could detect them. But lately, some of
the things I choose are quite realistic, but I filter them, I
abstract them. This `One of a Kind,' it started with the Dutch
Constitution. Very nice, but you can't make ballets on the Dutch
Constitution, so you read as much as you can, and then you filter
and filter and filter, and then you come up with an absolutely
basic thing which is the freedom of the human being, freedom of
expression, sexual liberty, freedom of speech. And you make an
abstract version of the kind of freedom you can have within a
certain time and a certain space.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the creator, then, finds it easier to explain his
objectives than to describe the result. ``It's a dance you cannot
define,'' offered Brigitte Lefevre, director of dance at the Paris
Opera Ballet, where ``One of a Kind'' was performed by NDT1 last
December. ``It's a dance with today's dancers, today's concerns,
plus a certain concern for intemporality. It's not a reactionary
dance, it is not reacting against Classicism or Modernism and it
can't be called post-Modernist. It is the product of the experience
and culture of a man called Jiri Kylian who meets a designer and a
musician. It is simple and wise.''
</P>
<P>
   After recently watching Kylian work with eight Paris Opera
Ballet dancers on a new work, ``Deux Mensonges,'' presented at the
Palais Garnier in May, she was more than ever convinced that his
personality held the key to his choreography.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told our dancers, `Since everything we're doing is
absolutely pointless, it must be admirable,' which reveals his
duality,'' said Ms. Lefevre, who has commissioned Kylian to create
another work for her ballet corps in March 2001. ``He makes the
body think, but at the same time it is not an intellectual dance.
It is a dance inscribed in the universe of today, but it is not
avant-garde. It is above all a reflection on life. It is his
personal philosophy of life, his humanity, that shape his
choreography.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, though, it was his talent as a dancer that set him on
his way. Having studied dance at Prague National Theater's ballet
school and later at the Prague Conservatory, at the age of 20 he
won a one-year scholarship to the Royal Ballet School in London.
While dancing there, he was offered a contract to join John
Cranko's Stuttgart Ballet, a contract that enabled him to escape
Prague after the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. In
Stuttgart, he tried his hand at choreography. Then, in 1975, having
created two works for the NDT, he was named its artistic director.
Three years later, he made his name at the Spoleto Festival USA in
Charleston, S.C., with ``Sinfonietta,'' performed to music by
Janacek.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since then. His choreography has become more
abstract and varied and, while his point of departure can still be
a painting or a sculpture or some tiny autobiographical incident,
more than ever his work is inspired by music. And, although trained
as a classical dancer, he now feels less and less constrained by
questions of technique.  &QL;

SELLOFF LEAVES STOCKS SLIGHTLY LOWER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An afternoon selloff pulled stock prices down from
early gains and left the main market averages slightly lower at the
close Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the session, the Dow Jones industrial average, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and the NASDAQ composite index
were all trading at new highs despite an unfriendly bond market,
where long-term interest rates again moved above 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and traders said that optimism about coming
earnings reports outweighed concerns about interest rates. And
after five days of strong gains, it was not surprising to see some
investors taking some profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have run so far so fast we have to digest'' the gains, said
Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``But I
wouldn't place too much importance in the price moves today because
trading is so thin and the breadth is so lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was at 11,135.12,
down 4.12 points, or four-hundredths of a percent. Early in the
day, the blue-chip index was up almost 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader averages, the S&AMP;P 500 fell 3.10 points, or
two-tenths of a percent, to 1,388.12. NASDAQ fell 4.24, or
two-tenths of a percent, to 2,736.78. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies managed to eke out a gain, rising 0.04 points, to
456.55.
</P>
<P>
   With many investors and traders still on vacation, trading on
the first day after the Fourth of July holiday was fairly subdued.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 723 million shares changed
hands. Volume on the NASDAQ stock market was 1.14 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Bullish comments by Ralph Acampora, director of technical
research at Prudential Securities, and Thomas Galvin, chief
investment officer at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities,
helped to push prices higher early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   John Manley, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said the
optimism was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news is pretty good, but as much as I hate to say it, we
can't go up every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, over the course of the next few weeks and months, he
said, the ``earnings numbers should be very good and interest rates
should not be a problem. I think the market has an upward bias
through the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar Tractor and Merck were the biggest drags on the Dow.
Caterpillar fell 2 5/8, to 59 9/16. And Merck lost 1 5/16, to 73
7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Gold stocks were punished after the price of bullion fell to a
20-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Newmont Mining fell 1 11/16, to 17 15/16. And Battle Mountain
Gold dropped 3/16, to 2 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   But oil stocks did better after crude oil prices rose near $20 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, a Dow component, rose 2 1/16, to 98 5/16. Royal Dutch
Shell, which is part of the S&AMP;P 500, gained 1 13/16, to 61 15/16.
And BP Amoco closed at 112 15/16, up 1 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, which is expected to report its second-quarter results
Wednesday, fell 3, to 175. But America Online jumped 5 11/16, to
120 15/16. And Amazon.com gained 2 13/16, to 126 7/8.

CLINTON URGES RETAIL DEVELOPMENT IN POVERTY AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. _ Midway through his four-day anti-poverty
tour across America, President Clinton came to this small,
struggling city of 38,000 people along the Mississippi River
Tuesday to hail the opening of a Walgreens drug store, an event
that usually does not prompt a presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   But the store is the largest retail establishment built here
since the 1950s, and to Clinton it is a shining example of the
profit-making opportunities in low- and moderate-income inner-city
neighborhoods for businesses willing to locate there.
</P>
<P>
   Standing atop a makeshift stage on the parking lot of the
glittering new store, Clinton said, ``We see in this community both
poverty and great promise.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're all going to have to work hard at this.
Nobody's got all the answers. There is no magic wand. But we know
one thing: people make these investments one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came armed with a new federal study by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development that shows such communities are
``under-retailed,'' meaning sales fall significantly short of the
residents' retail purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   The HUD report, titled ``New Markets: The Untapped Retail Buying
Power in America's Inner Cities,'' said the retail purchasing power
of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods was estimated at $331
billion last year, or one-third of the $1.1 trillion total for the
central cities that include those neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Among 48 inner-city areas where HUD found a retail gap and where
20 percent or more of the population lives in poverty, the total
shortfall last year was $8.7 billion, which equals the purchasing
power minus sales.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Optional graf grim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of those areas, six were in Massachusetts _ Gloucester, Lowell,
New Bedford, Waltham, Westfield and Yarmouth. The study showed
Westfield with the biggest gap between the purchasing power of its
residents and retail sales, 22.7 percent, while Gloucester had the
least at 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(End optional trim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge buying power among inner-city residents, the
study said they often must make purchases in such places as
suburban malls because there are too few retail stores in their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In this city where the unemployment rate last year was 9.6
percent, more than twice the national average, and the poverty rate
is 44.3 percent, even a Walgreens store that employs about two
dozen people is considered good news.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest stop on Clinton's six-state tour of poverty
areas to promote greater public and private investment in urban and
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with a small band of corporate CEOs and members of
Congress and his Cabinet, Clinton is touting these areas as a way
to keep the economy strong through job creation and lowering of
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``America needs to wake up and recognize that the best new
market for American products and for new American investment is
right here in the US of A,'' he told a group of entrepreneurs from
the Mississippi Delta in a roundtable discussion earlier Tuesday in
Clarksdale.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies apparently are listening. Tuesday, the Bank of
America announced it will commit $500 million of equity to support
community development in poor areas.

   BOSTON -- Four Kosovar Albanian orphans, who witnessed the
murder of their father by three masked Serbs, hope to find a new
home in Massachusetts because of the efforts of Kitty Dukakis, to
bring them here.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Tirana, Albania, Tuesday Dukakis,
the wife of former governor Michael S. Dukakis, said she may be
returning with the children, two boys and two girls, ranging in age
from 15 to 19, this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   She was acting, she said, on behalf of a Concord family, who
wants to give the youngsters a home, and a Concord church who is
assisting them. She did not identify the family.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice tinged with emotion, one of the children, Kreshnik
Zejnullahu, 16, described by phone what had happened to the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 14, my mother died from cancer,'' she said. ``Last
November, when I was in the garden of our home in Pec about 8 at
night, three masked Serbs arrived and grabbed me. They didn't say
anything except to tell me to call for my mother. I told them she
was dead. But, they didn't believe me and started yelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, who was a doctor, came to the door and, when he
tried to close it, they fired through the door and killed him in
front of all of us. Then, they ran away.''
</P>
<P>
   The children buried their father, and, then, in March, they left
Kosovo by car, arriving in Montenegro, about 45 kilometers away, at
midnight. There, they stayed for about one month and made their way
to Tirana where they have been living with nine other people in a
bedroom in the house of an Albanian man who has opened his home to
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to coming to America,'' Kreshnik said,
speaking for his sisters, Amella, 19, and Aida, 18, and brother,
Sokol, 15. ``Our only fear now is that it may not really happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Dukakis, who has been involved with the resettlement of
refugees and victims of war for more than 20 years, says she is
going to make sure it does happen. She has enlisted the aid of the
United Nations and official sources on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is cleared so far,'' she said. ``The children's
relatives have consented and their health has been approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis, 62, went to Albania last week on behalf of Relief
International, a California-based refugee organization, where she
had agreed to speak to the women in the camps the organization has
been operating about health and resettlement issues. When the
Concord family learned she was going, they asked her to intercede
on the children's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   While there, she crossed the border into Kosovo, to the town of
Prizrin, something she had promised her husband back in Boston she
would not do because of the presence of landmines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful small city with many burnt houses and
farms,'' she said by phone from Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis said she was impressed by the work of Relief
International, whose executive director, Farshad Raftegar, is,
himself, an Iranian refugee. ``It is a small non-governmental
agency, a small entity without a bureaucracy, that has programs in
six countries. As soon as the Kosovo war broke out, Mr. Rafetgar
had physicians from San Francisco and Los Angeles at the scene,''
Dukakis said.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Dukakis has a long history working with refugees and
victims of war.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, she received a degree in social work from Boston
University and for the last three years she has been working as a
constituent advocate at the International Institute of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, she assisted survivors of the Holocaust and the
Armenian genocide in their efforts to ensure these horrible events
are not forgotten. In 1979, former President Jimmy Carter appointed
her to the Holocaust Council, on which she still serves.
</P>
<P>
   She began working with victims of the Cambodian war in the early
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   Her most dramatic rescue came in 1985 when she went to a
Cambodian refugee camp on the border of Thailand and found the
brother and only surviving family member of a young Cambodian woman
refugee who had been resettled in Lynnfield.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Dukakis was denied entrance to the camp by its
commandant but, when she fell to her knees and begged his approval,
he relented and let her in. She brought Hout Pich back to the
United States and a reunion with his sister Sarom Taing.
</P>
<P>
   Pich is now a physician's assistant working with the Khmer
community in Lowell.

FLEET-BANKBOS MERGER FACES ACTIVIST ONSLAUGHT AT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Fiery attacks and impassioned defenses might seem the
stuff of courtroom dramas and public demonstrations. But the
usually staid walls of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston will echo
Wednesday with rhetoric more typical of a trial or a street
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Community activists and politicians, worried about the impact of
New England's largest bank merger on poor neighborhoods, will
square off against executives from Fleet and BankBoston, who will
defend the merits of their historic deal.
</P>
<P>
   Public hearings, held by regional branches of the nation's
central bank, have become an industry rite of passage for large
banks seeking to merge.
</P>
<P>
   As consolidation sweeps through the financial services industry
and spawns ever larger giants, regulators who must approve the
combinations want to ensure that the new behemoths will continue to
lend to areas where they do business. While regulators are more
concerned with antitrust implications than community issues, they
are happy to encourage face-offs between banks and the groups as a
way of reminding banks of their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every big bank deal of substance has a Fed hearing, some
variation of this zoo-like process,'' said analyst Nancy Bush, who
covers regional banks for Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. ``This one is going to
be especially bloody, with the community groups going really wild,
because the banks' market share numbers are going to be so big.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston are merging into the nation's
eighth-largest bank, with more than $160 billion in assets. While
New England has seen plenty of mergers this decade, the $16 billion
combination is pathbreaking in that it will leave a major banking
market with a single, dominant competitor.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, which has one of the most highly regarded community
lending programs in the nation, has said it will imprint its urban
investment philosophy onto Fleet, even though Fleet is technically
acquiring its smaller rival. Fleet, which is traditionally viewed
as a more hard-nosed lender, has attracted criticism for its
affordable mortgage programs and for allegedly cutting lending
after it buys other banks.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the new giant has promised it will not cut spending to
poorer neighborhoods and borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that the proceedings may turn into a circus
reminiscent of the raucous hearing that accompanied the merger of
CoreStates Financial, a Philadelphia bank, with Charlotte,
N.C.-based First Union last year. At that hearing, community
activists raised a storm of protest over the deal's implications
for low-income housing.
</P>
<P>
   At its trademark aluminum skyscraper in Boston, the Fed plans to
allow 160 people to make five-minute presentations throughout the
day on why the Fleet-BankBoston merger should or should not go
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a prominent New York religious figure and
community activist; US Representative Barney Frank of Newton; and
other leading figures will raise questions about the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting is an opportunity for those with concerns about
the merger to voice them cordially,'' said a Fed spokesman, Thomas
Lavalle.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Marks, a feisty Boston housing activist and a national
poster boy for protesters against bank mergers, promised fire.
``Things could become a mini-riot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks dislike the public hearing process, which they say
encourages activists to blackmail them into spending ever larger
sums on low-income programs and affordable mortgages. Community
groups seize upon hearings as a means for leveraging as much money
as possible out of banks. In the middle are Fed regulators and
Justice Department officials, who are responsible for listening to
complaints about the merger before approving it later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 federal law, allows
regulators to torpedo mergers involving banks with poor records in
lending to the areas they serve. While regulators almost never
block big mergers, they can put pressure on banks to increase
community spending.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's patrician and relaxed chief executive, Chad
Gifford, who will speak on the merits of his merger with Fleet,
said Tuesday that he ``was about as unnervous for this hearing as
I've ever been.'' Gifford said the new company would lend as much
as each bank individually, minus the amounts the two companies will
shed after divesting branches and deposits to meet antitrust
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the hearing, Gifford's counterpart at Fleet,
Terrence Murray, was less sanguine. Using a hunting metaphor,
Murray, a fiery-tempered Irishman and factory worker's son, said,
``We're in season.'' He added later: ``The key is to be sure that
you don't take anything they say personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who will head the new bank until he retires in 2001, is
dogged by criticism of Fleet's past lending records _ a legacy he
resents. He plans to tell protesters that 35 percent of Fleet's
mortgages nationwide go to lower- to moderate-income borrowers _
above the industry average of 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is because the strong economy engenders questions
about what might happen if the boom ends, but community lending is
such a hot topic that not even BankBoston's past strong record is
enough to quell protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston, once bitter rivals, see great irony in all
the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, whose inner-city bank network is among the best
regarded in the banking industry, is the force behind the combined
company's proposal to commit $14.6 billion over five years to
low-income projects, affordable housing programs, small businesses,
and disadvantaged consumers. The proposal, which has been
cautiously welcomed by some community groups, spans eight states,
mostly in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks plan to detail how their multibillion-dollar package
will be spent. About 40 percent of the total package, or more than
$5.8 billion, is earmarked for programs and borrowers in
Massachusetts, Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   The next largest chunk, from $2.9 billion to $4.4 billion, will
go to programs in New York, where Fleet has a major presence.
Around 10 percent to 20 percent of the total package, or $1.5
billion to $2.9 billion, will each go to Connecticut and New
Jersey. Rhode Island will get five percent to 10 percent of the
sum, while New Hampshire, Maine, and Florida will get anywhere from
5 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By merging, Murray and Gifford argue, New England has a better
chance at retaining strong banks that know the community. Had a
financial institution outside the region acquired either bank, the
two men have argued, lending to area small businesses would almost
certainly have dropped. ``The irony as we approach the Fed meeting
was that this deal was a home run for New England,'' Gifford said.

KEY OIL PRICE BRIEFLY TOPS $20 A BARREL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A key oil price topped $20 a barrel on
Tuesday for the first time since November 1997, and experts see it
as a signal for energy rigs to get back to work in Texas and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Cross Timbers Oil Co. of Fort Worth is ready to do just that.
The company had trimmed its spending plans to $60 million this
year, from $90 million two years ago. But with the rise in prices,
the company reversed course, and now plans to spend $70 million to
$90 million this year for exploration and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is looking better for oil and gas prices,'' says
Louis Baldwin, a senior vice president for Cross Timbers.
</P>
<P>
   World economic forces are behind the rise in oil prices. The
oil-producing nations have limited their output, and they signalled
yesterday that they intend to adhere to promised production cuts.
At the same, Asian economies are recovering from a slump,
increasing global demand.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, futures contracts for the August delivery of crude
oil crossed $20 a barrel for the first time in 19 months. They
later settled back, closing at $19.78 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The posted price, paid at the wellhead, has cleared $16 for West
Texas Intermediate crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   That is a balm to an industry that has suffered for 18 months
from consolidation, layoffs and other turmoil, as prices fell 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Baker Hughes Rig Count, which measures the number of rigs
drilling for oil, was up last week by 17 nationally, to 580, and by
13 in Texas, to 208. The Texas rig count stood at 200 in the first
week of the year, then plunged to a low of 171 for the week of
April 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more activity in the fields now that people have seen
prices stabilize and some evidence of discipline on the part of
producers,'' said analyst Ken Miller of Purvin &AMP; Gertz, a Houston
energy consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil-producing
nation and the linchpin of OPEC, said on Tuesday that his nation
would stay with production cuts agreed to earlier this year.
Bloomberg News reported that Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
also said they also would hold the line on production.
</P>
<P>
   Obeid bin Sief al-Nasseri, the UAE oil minister, cautioned
fellow OPEC members not to exploit recent increases in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the good news for producers has not been all bad
news for gasoline consumers. While crude prices are almost double
their lows recorded late last year and early 1999, the price of gas
at the pumps has risen only 20 percent nationally, according to a
Lundberg Survey at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are now waiting to see if the recent oil price spike
was bolstered by the increased demand for gasoline from July 4
travelers. Miller of Purvin &AMP; Gertz thinks it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting prices to drop back a bit, now to the $16.50
to $17 per barrel range,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason the energy producers have not seen their
stocks rise as fast as the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, three Fort Worth companies watched their stock prices
decline yesterday. Union Pacific Resources Group fell 25 cents a
share, to $15.5625, Cross Timbers dropped 12.5 cents to $14.25 and
Range Resources was off 12.5 cents, to $6.3125. Quicksilver
Resources was unchanged at $7.25.
</P>
<P>
   Miller cautions that the supply overhang of oil in U.S.
refineries and pipelines is still almost as high as the record 340
million barrels reported last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest inventory reports show about 330 million barrels
available onshore in the U.S.,'' Miller said. ``So demand will have
to stay very high in order to sustain these prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a decline of a couple of dollars a barrel probably
would be acceptable to producers who were looking at $10 prices six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Energy producers in Texas and elsewhere did the logical thing in
the face of such prices: they slashed budgets for exploration and
development. In turn, jobs were lost and equipment sat idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We capped our capital spending at $500 million for this
year,'' said Dan Sullivan of Union Pacific Resources Group of Fort
Worth. ``Even with that, we really didn't spend much during the
first half of the year because of the price situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan says that while UPR doesn't plan to increase its
capital spending budget for the rest of this year, it will spend
more aggressively within the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said that Cross Timbers will split its extra capital
expenditures on oil and gas wells. Earlier, it had planned to
concentrate almost exclusively on natural gas production.
</P>
<P>
   Like many energy producers, Cross Timbers has focused itself
heavily on natural gas in recent years. Natural gas prices have
stayed consistently above the profit level of $2 per thousand cubic
feet _ they closed at $2.16 on Tuesday _ and gas prices aren't
subject to the whims and politics of international oil markets.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it seems as though the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries has gotten a handle on production and prices.
OPEC let the throttle out in November 1997, and the resulting lack
of discipline among members showered the world with overproduction,
resulting in lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   After several false starts last year and early 1999, OPEC
finally was able to impose some production controls. A survey of
producers by Bloomberg News showed that in June, OPEC producers
made 94 percent of the promised cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC has a goal to reduce production by 7 percent this year, or
about 5 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, OPEC at least hasn't added to the oversupply of oil
stocks in the U.S.,'' says Miller. ``But for prices to rise even
higher, that oversupply will have to be reduced.''

IF TODAY IS SHOT, GO FOR TOMORROW

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Last in their division at the season's midpoint,
10{ games out of first place and no closer to a wild-card playoff
spot, the Los Angeles Dodgers must consider a dramatic solution to
their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up on 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up on the dream of trading for a savior, and instead
seeing the wisdom of trading veterans for prospects to begin
shoring up the team's future.
</P>
<P>
   We raise this possibility now, with weeks to go before the July
31 non-waiver trading deadline and the Aug. 31
playoff-roster-setting deadline, because it might take Dodgers fans
that long to get used to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   It might take Dodgers MANAGEMENT that long to get used to the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's the wise course in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Chase Carey and Peter Chernin, club president Bob Graziano
and general manager Kevin Malone don't seem like men who admit
defeat easily. How embarrassing would it be to acknowledge that
their $84 million team is a bust?
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson isn't close to waiting till next year,
either. ``There's a lot of season (remaining) to put things in
order,'' Johnson said over the weekend, when the Dodgers had lost
six games in a row to sink to the bottom of the National League
West.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the players packed it in, hard as that might be to
believe, looking at the results. ``I wish I could say we've been
lackadaisical, that we weren't giving a good effort, but I can't,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   So giving up on the season would be painful and unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been the Dodgers' way.
</P>
<P>
   Most years, when pennant contenders line up to fleece the
noncontenders by dealing unknown youngsters for key veterans, the
Dodgers are among the contenders, if they play that
trading-deadline game at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even this year, the Dodgers don't fit the profile of a
veteran-dumping team, usually a small-market franchise trying to
get !ital!something in exchange for a potential free agent it
couldn't afford to re-sign anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But barring an on-field turnaround (and soon) the Dodgers front
office will face a pivotal decision this month.
</P>
<P>
   Is it time to think about the next century?
</P>
<P>
   If they live for the moment and go after veterans (a shortstop,
a starting pitcher, a middle reliever), they merely continue the
pattern of the past season-and-a-half, during which they've
acquired 14 major-leaguers through trades or free agency, their
desperation only digging them deeper into the quicksand.
</P>
<P>
   But if they go after prospects, they begin a vital and urgent
task, restocking their minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   Once the foundation of a dynasty, the Dodgers' farm system is
barren, the result of lamentable drafts, a tendency to rush
youngsters to the big leagues, and trades like the ones last summer
that sent top prospects Paul Konerko and Dennis Reyes to Cincinnati
(for Jeff Shaw) and Peter Bergeron and Ted Lilly to Montreal (along
with Wilton Guerrero and a minor-leaguer) for Mark Grudzielanek,
Carlos Perez and a minor-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, Triple-A Albuquerque's RBI leader was Wes
Chamberlain, a 33-year-old journeyman outfielder; the home run
leader was Brent Cookson, an outfielder who looked overmatched in
an emergency call-up to Los Angeles last month, and no pitcher had
more than six wins.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the list of All-Stars who were once the unknown parts of
deadline trades for veteran ``pennant insurance'': Jeff Bagwell,
Sammy Sosa, Curt Schilling, Jay Buhner, John Smoltz and Moises
Alou, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Even if finding hidden gems such as those is a rarity, trading
for prospects might look genius-like in a couple of years if it
merely pays off in depth and maneuverability the Dodgers lack now.
</P>
<P>
   One reason they haven't dealt severely with Chan Ho Park's
clueless pitching by sending him to the minor leagues is that
there's nobody worth bringing up to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   First, Malone must decide if it's too soon to give up on this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Is the team underachieving, as the conventional wisdom holds,
and likely to click in the second half? Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitchers are disappointing. But the failures of the
hitters are just as important. In the 26 games in which Dodgers
pitchers have been unspectacular but solid and allowed 3, 4 or 5
runs, the hitters have produced wins for them only 13 times (.500).
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's hard to say the everyday players are doing worse than
expected. Eric Karros, Raul Mondesi, Gary Sheffield and Adrian
Beltre are off to good starts. That's half the lineup. Todd Hundley
(coming off elbow surgery) and Devon White (36 years old) were
question marks to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if Malone decides to concentrate on the future, he has
to decide who he's willing to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's contract might be too big to unload. Trading
21-year-old Beltre would defeat the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But if Boston wants Karros at first base, Cincinnati wants
Mondesi in right field, Texas wants Darren Dreifort on the mound or
Arizona wants Shaw in the bullpen enough to give up young talent,
why should any of them be untouchable?
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers don't make the best of a bad situation now, they
might still be facing this unpleasant decision in July 2002.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ There is a rhythm to day camps, whether
they are focused on soccer, computers or just enduring summer days
while parents work. The cars line up, the children _ at first a bit
unsure _ emerge, the counselors greet them, and off they go.
</P>
<P>
   That familiar cycle was evident at a new camp at a private
school here last week, but quickly a different rhythm dominated:
the boom-tch, boom-boom-tch of rock `n' roll. Instead of carrying
balls, rackets or gym bags, the arriving children, ranging from 10
to 15 years old, held electric guitars, drumsticks and keyboards.
Conrad Capalbo, 10, had blue spiked hair. Erik Peterson, 14, had
glossy red fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Several moms served as roadies, lugging heavy amplifiers down
the hallways of Archbishop Stepinac High School, past framed
pictures of Pope John Paul II and Cardinal John J. O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong sessions of the camp, called Day Jams, offer
children a chance to learn basic music theory, form rock bands,
write songs, design album-cover art and perform a Friday-night
concert that is recorded on a CD. In its first year, the camp is
taking place here and at private schools in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
Towson, Md., and Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   After the first music-filled day, Ronald Gerard, a computer
programmer from Dobbs Ferry, asked his grinning son, Timothy, a shy
10-year-old keyboard player, what he liked best about the camp so
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's loud,'' Timothy said.
</P>
<P>
   Day Jams was created by David Smolover, 49, a guitar teacher
from Lakeside, Conn., who also has a 16-year-old business running
one- to four-week guitar workshops for adults and teen-agers around
the country and in Germany. From the reactions of the 29 children
who enrolled in the first session in White Plains last week, rock
camps for children will be around for a long time. The cost of the
weeklong session is $375.
</P>
<P>
   An indirect gauge of the students' enthusiasm was the failure of
one part of the curriculum: recreation. Originally, the schedule
included daily breaks for sports. ``We bought soccer balls,''
Smolover said. ``But no one's used them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in snippets of free time, the children focused largely on
making music. Their tastes ranged from hip-hop to heavy metal, from
the Spice Girls to punk ska bands like Blink 182 and Reel Big Fish.
A few were not afraid to play tunes they learned from their
parents' album collections: ``Sunshine of Your Love,'' ``Stairway
to Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Erik, the red-nailed bass player, and Conrad, the
blue-haired guitarist, had already cut their teeth in garage bands.
</P>
<P>
   But most, like Timothy Gerard, said that they had never
performed with other children. Music, so far, had been a solitary
activity _ picking out piano scales or aping guitar chords from a
favorite CD in their bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   That was all about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mix of skills and tastes, over the course of the
week the corridor echoes evolved from an ear-numbing cacophony of
clacking drumsticks, synthesizer notes and distorted guitar into
original songs penned by the children, backed by sturdy drum beats
and throbbing bass lines.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, June 28, the arriving students sank into
velvet-covered seats in a cavernous, 1,000-seat auditorium at the
school. On stage, their teachers, from Westchester County and New
York City, formed a band and began slamming through several rock
and blues tunes, laced with acrobatic guitar solos, one of which
evoked a smile from Jonathan Gerundo, 12, of White Plains, who
began strumming his unplugged black Fender Squire guitar in
synchrony.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan said his main influences were Pantera, Metallica and
``all the hair bands,'' a galaxy of heavy metal acts known for
their fluffed manes.
</P>
<P>
   The budding musicians then headed down the hallways to separate
classrooms for different specialties: drums in room 102, guitars in
104 and 105, keyboard and bass players in 107, and singers in 108.
</P>
<P>
   Several guitar players began setting up for David Moreno, a
music teacher from the East Village who had the glazed, scruffy
look of someone who had awakened long before his normal sleep cycle
had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the room began to vibrate as Jonathan Gerundo did his best
Black Sabbath imitation, followed by Jonathan Vingiano, 12, from
Hastings-on-Hudson, who chopped out syncopated ska chords in the
style of the Police. The two Jonathans spent the rest of the week
trading lead riffs and becoming friends.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, the voice teacher, Leslie Barlow Mostyn, asked
her pupils to sing a few lines so she could gauge the work ahead of
her. Junki Sugiyama, a 12-year-old vocalist from Rye, stood
straight as a stick and proudly sang the Japanese national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first day, the children had been formed into
three sprawling Grateful Dead-size bands, each with a bass player,
two drummers, several singers, a keyboard player and an abundance
of guitarists. They voted for names: New Generationzzz, 103 (the
classroom number), and Zero.
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, the bands began to create the foundations for songs,
working out melodies and parts. By Wednesday, lyric writing was in
full swing. Junki Sugiyama and Michael Marell, 14, from White
Plains, were the vocalists and lyricists for the band called 103.
</P>
<P>
   Junki had come a long way from his stiff debut and now belted
out a blues-style beat poem, ``Sacrifice,'' like a veteran punk
rocker, leaning into the microphone and tripping over the tangle of
cords and cables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need something better to do,'' he sang. ``It looks like
tasty music.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Marell took his turn as the band's front man, holding
his lyric sheet for ``Thunder'' high as he quietly sang: ``I don't
know what I'm singing. I don't know the words. It doesn't need a
melody or even a single chord. It just needs some beat, rhythm, and
a style. When it all comes together you get music with a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   During a brief break, Moreno and Adam Issadore, the drum
teacher, conferred about how to make the bands coalesce. Even
though both had taught music for many years and played in bands
themselves, neither had taught kids how to  &UR; become &LR;  a band _
certainly not how to do it in the space of a week.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Late on June 30, the pupils were clearly drifting in the
building summer heat and humidity. Waves of chatter and stray notes
built to a crescendo before Jonathan Rubin, one of the guitar
teachers, called for silence. Miraculously, silence descended.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. ``You hear that?'' Rubin said, describing the
momentary quiet. ``On every CD you own, just before the song
starts, you hear that sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he warned them that the clock was ticking toward their
stage debut. ``Here's the deal,'' he said. ``We're halfway through
the week and we've got a gig in 48 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, the campers arrived nervous but well coiffed,
girded for their culminating stage performance. Erik Peterson
showed up with freshly dyed Day-Glo pink hair.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Green, 11, from Dobbs Ferry, was primed for her role as
part of a reincarnated Spice Girls ensemble, but also provided
makeup assistance for several newfound friends. Using a mascara
brush, she added sparkling purple highlights to the dark forelocks
of Ryan Clark, a 12-year-old bass player from White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the auditorium began to fill with parents and siblings
brandishing an array of camcorders and cameras. This time, the room
filled from the front, not the back.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Janet Vingiano, whose son was the Jamaican-influenced
guitarist, smiled broadly as the concert got under way. ``When you
see kids this motivated to learn music, it's pretty wonderful,''
Vingiano said.
</P>
<P>
   The first band, 103, took the stage, and Junki _ despite shining
loafers and pressed khakis _ did his best Jim Morrison imitation,
smoothly delivering his memorized meandering poetry over the steady
hiss of cymbal strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the curtains to each side, the teachers dripped sweat in
the stuffy air as they waved their arms and counted out beats.
</P>
<P>
   Zero, comprised of the most experienced students, sandwiched its
original song between two Jimi Hendrix classics, with Ryan Clark,
the sparkle-haired bassist, falling to his knees on stage as he
slammed out the closing notes. As Zero left the stage, Ryan
high-fived his band's Hendrix-playing guitarist, Alex Gordon, and
even though they lived miles apart _ in White Plains and
Hastings-on-Hudson, respectively _ they vowed to start a band
together.
</P>
<P>
   Young Generationzzz played an artfully arranged pop tune
punctuated with cymbal crashes and clavier chords that built to a
punchy finale, with blue-haired Conrad and his cousin, Arden
Rosenblatt, 10, slashing closing windmilling guitar chords, in the
best Judas Priest tradition, then tossing their plastic picks into
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   All of the children and teachers took the stage for a final bow,
bathed in applause. Then the campers rushed the exits, ready for
the rest of summer.

GUNMAN'S FAST-GROWING HATE GROUP IS RECRUITING WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They peddle hatred to children, with a brightly
colored Web page featuring a coloring book of white supremacist
symbols and a crossword puzzle full of racist clues.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to attract women, by talking about family issues
and preaching that rapists should get the death penalty. They
recruit aggressively on college campuses with a blizzard of
leaflets handed out by their ``missionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Its efforts to broaden its appeal have made the World Church of
the Creator perhaps the fastest-growing and one of the largest hate
groups in the country. Promulgating an anti-Jewish, anti-black,
anti-Christian doctrine, the group has increased its chapters from
13 to 41 in 17 states in the last year, experts on hate groups and
the group's leader say. Estimates of its membership range from
hundreds to several thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most active and it's the most sophisticated,'' said
Mark Weitzman, director of the Simon Weisenthal Center's Taskforce
Against Hate.
</P>
<P>
   And while the group says that it does not advocate violence,
some members have been linked in recent years to violent incidents
including the killing of a black sailor and the pistol-whipping of
a video store owner believed to be Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   It is the World Church of the Creator that drew the attention of
Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, the 21-year-old student who went on a
rampage over the Fourth of July weekend, shooting blacks, Jews and
Asians in Indiana and Illinois, killing two people and wounding 12,
the authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree ended Sunday night, when Smith stole a van
from a woman at gunpoint, and, while being chased by the police,
shot and killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Wednesday that Smith purchased his guns, a
.380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a .22-caliber pistol, from
an illegal gun dealer in late June. At first, he tried to buy the
guns from a licensed dealer, but was turned away because one of his
ex-girlfriends had filed an order of protection against him.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Smith represented the kind of recruit that the
World Church of the Creator and groups like it are increasingly
trying to attract: young, educated, energetic, articulate.
</P>
<P>
   Hate groups once appealed primarily to older white men in mostly
rural areas with little education and blue-collar jobs, and later
attracted young ruffians called neo-Nazi skinheads. But in the last
few years, these groups have begun to broaden their constituencies
and increase their influence inside the political and legal
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a departure from the traditional rank and file of
these groups,'' said Mark Potok, who follows hate groups for the
Southern Poverty Law Center. ``These are not people who live in
trailers. There is a concerted effort on the part of white
supremacist leaders to recruit college-bound middle- and
upper-middle-class kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Smith, the son of a doctor and a real estate agent from
an affluent Chicago suburb, attended New Trier High School, one of
the nation's most elite public schools, and had Jewish friends
growing up. As a teen-ager, there were few overt signs that he
would develop virulently racist leanings, but he later wrote in a
white supremacist newsletter that he thought that an eighth-grade
class covering the Holocaust had tried ``to instill a strong and
lasting sense of white guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   In his high school yearbook, he included the slogan ``Sic Semper
Tyrannis'' (``Thus ever to tyrants''), the words spoken by John
Wilkes Booth after he shot Lincoln and displayed on a T-shirt worn
by Timothy J. McVeigh the day he bombed the federal office building
in Oklahoma City. In college at the University of Illinois, Smith
later wrote that he thought that the foreign students and foreign
professors he met were benefiting too much from government aid.
</P>
<P>
   These were the raw ingredients Smith took to the World Church of
the Creator. His career ambitions also seemed an advantage. After
being forced to leave the university in February 1998 after being
charged with attacking his girlfriend and possessing marijuana, he
enrolled in Indiana University in Bloomington and switched his
major from computer science to criminal justice so that he could
become a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, he was following the example of several of the
movement's younger leaders, who want to be lawyers so they can be
advocates for the white race inside the nation's courtrooms. In
Bloomington, Smith was so active for the World Church of the
Creator that he was named ``creator of the year'' in 1998 because
he distributed the most leaflets and recruited the most members.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who came in contact with Smith said he appeared
calm, not excitable, another hallmark of some of the younger
leaders of groups like the World Church of the Creator, who appear
to be striving to couch their extremist views in almost
rational-sounding arguments for why Jews and minorities are
inferior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about moderating the image and trying to fit into the
mainstream,'' said Mark Hamm, a professor of criminology at Indiana
State University who has written extensively about hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew F. Hale, the leader of the World Church of the Creator
and at 27, apparently the youngest hate group leader in the
country, comes across as articulate, patient, telegenic and media
savvy. His father is a policeman and he lives with his parents in
East Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hale is credited with reviving the group in 1996 after it nearly
evaporated when its founder, Ben Klassen, a former Florida state
legislator and the man who invented the electric can opener,
committed suicide in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hale has had minor skirmishes with the law over activities like
burning an Israeli flag, and he ran unsuccessfully for the East
Peoria City Council in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hale is definitely the most articulate and upfront of this new
generation,'' said Weitzman, of the Wiesenthal Center. ``He's
trying to give his movement a veneer of respectability _ as well as
the blow-dried look.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Where then, does Benjamin Smith's violent rampage fit in?
</P>
<P>
   Hale said he did not condone Smith's actions, but he also said
that he felt no compassion for the victims, only for Smith and his
family. He said he believed Smith was ``a martyr for free speech
for white people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the group is committed to achieving its goals throughout
legal means, but that he could think of circumstances in which
violence might be acceptable under the ideology of his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``As any free people we do insist on remaining free,'' Hale
said. ``Our position is similar to that of Thomas Jefferson. If our
constitution is destroyed, if our right to free speech is denied,
then we have the right to use whatever means necessary to survive
and to advance our position. If you're cornered in an alley you
have the right to defend yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's credo is ``RAHOWA,'' which stands for racial holy
war and members have been linked to violent activities over the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   One member was convicted of killing a black sailor returning
from the Persian Gulf War in 1991 in Florida. Two members pleaded
guilty to the 1997 beating of a black man and his son in Miami,
and, last year, also in Florida, four members pleaded guilty to
robbing and pistol-whipping a video store owner they believed to be
Jewish. Potok said members of the group have also been linked to
plots to bomb a large Los Angeles African Methodist Episcopal
church and an NAACP office in Tacoma, Wash., both in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, literature from the World Church of the Creator was
found near synagogues that were burned down last month in
Sacramento, Calif., and the authorities are investigating whether
the group's followers were involved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hale believes that what might have set Smith off on his
murderous tear was a setback in Hale's drive to become a lawyer in
Illinois. Hale, who graduated from law school and passed the state
bar exam, wants to become a lawyer to advance the cause of his
group. He has been denied a license to practice law by a state
panel that ruled earlier this year that his racist activities
indicated he did not have the fitness of character to qualify as a
lawyer in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Hale appealed the ruling and Smith testified at his appeal
hearing. Last Friday, Hale's appeal was denied and hours later,
Smith began shooting Orthodox Jews walking home from Sabbath
services in a north Chicago neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said that although he told Smith he planned to appeal all
the way to the Supreme Court, Smith might have interpreted the
decision as a sign that the group's rights were being so trampled
upon that legitimate methods to advance the white racist agenda
would not succeed.

A PIANO SONATA CREATED FROM FIRE AND ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 11) 
(pr) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the dust slowly settles over the second half of the 20th
century, the music of Jean Barraque comes ever more clearly into
view as one of the time's great monuments. Last year his complete
output, of just six big works and an electronic essay, was released
in a set of recordings made by the leading ensemble Klangforum
Wien. Now come two further versions of his Opus 1, the Piano Sonata
of 1950-52, in performances by Pi-Hsien Chen (Telos TLS 006; CD)
and Herbert Henck (ECM 1621; CD).
</P>
<P>
   Barraque's Sonata is an astonishing and challenging achievement
in so many ways. It was written by a man who, in his early 20s,
knew with complete conviction that what was required of him was a
masterwork on the Beethoven level. The work took the highly
fragmented language of immediate postwar Serialism and created from
it a single movement lasting around 40 minutes. It also found,
within a new musical language that was being generally admired (or
despised) as abstract, resources for expressing colossal effort,
heady exhilaration, frustration and, finally, a despair that is
bleak but also life-supporting in being so trustworthy and real.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the piece, in fast or moderate tempos,
oscillates between rampaging passages and others that are still,
fixed around a few notes that go on being repeated in what is
almost a maddening depiction of futility. It is a contrast of fire
_ suggested by how shapes burst into life and re-form within a
supple rhythmic continuity _ and ice. And there can be fire and ice
at the same time, as when beautiful singing melodies, often in a
high register, are combined with cold sequences of notes, or when
the music becomes so violent as to be at once angry and chilling.
</P>
<P>
   These conflicts are not so much resolved as transcended in the
second half, which is slow and much thinner in texture, often
pursuing a single line interrupted by silences, but with occasional
reminiscences of what went before. In some respects, the music
seems to have lifted into the air. In others, it has sunk into an
abyss of hopelessness _ but of hopelessness on the grandest and
most magnificent scale.
</P>
<P>
   The size and technical difficulty of the work deterred
performers for many years. So did Barraque's inconsistency in
matters of rhythmic notation _ a carelessness that may have spoken
for his sense that what mattered was to heave this immense work
onto paper, not to attend scrupulously to its details. Music, for
him, was to be created, not constructed: summoned into being.
Professional etiquette was, at best, an irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Loriod made a recording in 1958, but there was no public
performance until 1967, when Elisabeth Klein played the work in
Copenhagen, not knowing that she was giving the world premiere. By
that time the music had been published, in an edition that was
apparently faithful to the problem-filled manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Other pianists performed the Sonata during Barraque's lifetime _
notably Claude Helffer and Roger Woodward, both of whom recorded it
in his presence but neither of whom was able, it would seem, to
persuade him to give definitive answers to questions raised by the
printed music. Only now, 16 years after his death, is a new edition
on the way, prepared by the leading Barraque scholar Heribert
Henrich.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pianists drawn to the piece have had to work out
their own solutions, and Henck, in the note he wrote to accompany
his recording, indicates just what a task this was for him: ``When
I had finished examining the text, an operation that I have to
admit would not satisfy any academic criteria, I had filled 125
handwritten pages with corrections and rhythmic notations.''
</P>
<P>
   He had also, to judge from his recording, filled his mind with
the music. He plays the work with a wonderful fluency, and though
the expressive content is often intense, insistent, even brutal,
the chords, counterpoint and melodies sound right. Often there is a
hint of the composer's beloved Debussy, especially of ``Feux
d'Artifice'' and ``L'Isle Joyeuse.'' It is as if the opals of
Debussy's music had been smashed: the effect is beautiful and
worrying at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen's recording is also remarkable. She takes a more
sparky, crystalline view of the music than does Henck, especially
in the first part of the work. In a way, this brings it near the
music of Barraque's principal French contemporary, Pierre Boulez,
whose Third Sonata and early ``Notations'' Ms. Chen also includes.
But both she and Henck reveal the Barraque work as having an
imposing continuity and a wide reach far beyond what Boulez was
attempting at that time, or indeed later.
</P>
<P>
   This feeling for the big substance of the piece is missing in
the recording by Stefan Litwin provided in the CPO set, and
Litwin's performance is also dangerously slow. Barraque indicated
tempos only in relative terms, but suggested that the work should
play for about 40 minutes. Litwin extends it to over 54 minutes;
Ms. Chen and Henck are both much more convincing at durations a
little over 45.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen is a little slower than Henck in the fast music and a
little faster than he is in the finale. Henck's compelling tendency
to push to the extremes adds to the force of his recording. The
Barraque Sonata, like those of Beethoven, is susceptible to very
different interpretations, and Henck's and Ms. Chen's offer
alternative aspects of it. But Henck's recording provides the place
to start.

LONG-TERM CAPITAL RETURNS $1.3 BILLION TO INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose near failure
last fall rocked world financial markets, returned approximately
$1.3 billion of capital to its investors Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium of 14 financial institutions that injected $3.625
billion into Long-Term Capital in September will receive $1
billion, or 27.5 percent, of their money back under the terms of
the repayment. The other $300 million will be returned to original
outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the consortium, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said in a statement, ``This is tangible evidence of the
significant risk reduction program that has been achieved'' at the
fund. The statement also noted that after the return of capital,
the portfolio remains ``more than adequately capitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   After Russia defaulted on its debt payments in August, world
bond markets froze and investors fled any instrument that carried
risk. This decimated Long-Term Capital's holdings, causing losses
of about 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the roughly 10 months since the fund's rescue, Long-Term
Capital's much-diminished portfolio has risen in value by 14.1
percent. Year-to-date, the fund is up 4.1 percent. Its portfolio is
valued at approximately $3.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A Long-Term Capital spokesman said Tuesday's payment means that
all of the hedge fund's outside investors have now had their
interests fully redeemed by the fund. Partners of Long-Term Capital
and the consortium of banks including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and
Merrill Lynch remain as investors in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Original investors in the Long-Term Capital Fund have endured a
roller-coaster ride since the fund, which is based in Greenwich,
Conn., started in March 1994. One dollar invested at the fund's
outset had grown to be worth $2.78 by the end of 1997. The fund's
management returned money to investors claiming that the
opportunities in world markets were increasingly limited. Then
disaster struck last year. Over the life of the fund, investors
have earned an annual return of around 18 percent, well below the
returns of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index during the period.
</P>
<P>
   The return of capital announced Tuesday gets John Meriwether,
Long-Term Capital's founder, one step closer to being able to raise
money for a new hedge fund. Under the terms of the bailout,
Meriwether cannot start a new fund until he has returned 90 percent
of the consortium's original investment, or $3.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Generating a gain in its portfolio this year puts Long-Term
Capital's returns ahead of some of the biggest, most well-known
hedge funds that have stumbled in 1999. Tiger Management, a hedge
fund with $13 billion managed by Julian Robertson, was down 7.36
percent as of early June. And Quantum Fund, the flagship fund
overseen by George Soros, had lost 14.8 percent at that time.
</P>
<P>
   After years of big returns, these huge hedge funds that make
so-called directional investments, betting on where the price of a
currency, equity or bond will be sometime in the future, have had a
tough time recently. Part of the problem is that the size of their
portfolios makes it difficult to maneuver in any but the deepest
and most liquid markets. But they have also been simply unlucky in
their bets.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller, more specialized funds are doing much better. Still,
hedge funds on average have not been stellar performers. According
to Tremont Advisers, a company in Rye, N.Y., that tracks more than
1,000 hedge funds, the average return during the first quarter of
1999 was a gain of 2.47 percent. A spokesman at the firm, which
only tracks quarterly performance, said second-quarter numbers were
not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   If Long-Term Capital pays the consortium the remainder of the
money it put into the fund last fall, hedge funds' reputations as
investment vehicles may begin to be restored. Hunt Taylor, senior
vice president of Tremont Advisers, said his firm's analysis shows
that using hedge funds as a part of a balanced portfolio does
increase that portfolio's returns and reduce its risk of losses. An
index of pension funds created by the firm showed annual returns of
13.1 percent from January 1990 through the first quarter of this
year. Taylor said that based on hedge fund returns, if a pension
fund had allocated 20 percent of its portfolio to hedge fund
investments, that annual return since 1990 would have risen to 13.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while the pension fund index's biggest loss from peak to
trough during the period was 9.41 percent, according to Taylor,
with 20 percent of assets in hedge funds, the losses would have
fallen to 7.86 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we looked at hedge funds,'' Taylor said, ``we found in
almost every category some level of advantage. Either in terms of
their information or their market access or their trading costs.
When you look at the whole body of trading advantages, it amounts
to an inherent return in the discipline.''

SPRINTING AUSTRALIAN FALTERS; KIRSIPUU HOLDS ON TO LEAD IN TOUR DE
FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAVAL, France _ Jay Sweet is a 23-year-old Australian in his
first Tour de France who insisted beforehand that he was not
intimidated by most of the greatest sprinters in bicycle racing,
although in his heart he must have known that he was going to a
sword fight armed with a penknife. Then, he crashed twice and badly
sprained his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweet is a sprinter and a good one. Despite his
inexperience, the overall weakness of his Big Mat-Auber team and
now his injury, he has the sprinter's qualities of courage and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I crashed the first time yesterday, the pain in my ankle
was so, so severe that I thought it was broken,'' he said this
morning. ``When the doctor said it wasn't broken, just sprained, I
said to myself I'll push on to the finish, I'm not going to let
that stop me. Then I went down a second time and I thought it's
definitely not my day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the starting area of the third stage in Nantes, he
brightened. ``But today,'' he continued, his voice underlining the
time element, ``is another day, another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, but not for Sweet, who finished far back as Tom Steels,
a Belgian with the Mapei team, won his second consecutive sprint.
Steels easily finished ahead of Erik Zabel, a German with Telekom,
and Stuart O'Grady, an Australian with Credit Agricole. This was
the 15th time this year that Zabel has finished second in a sprint.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was timed in 4 hours 29 minutes 27 seconds for the
194.5-kilometer (121-mile) spin over moderately rolling terrain
into the likable city of Laval. That was an average speed of 43
kilometers per hour (27 miles per hour), including a high of 67 kph
(41 mph) in the sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In cool sunshine, the stage passed grazing cattle in Brittany's
dairy region and was watched by enormous crowds from start to
finish. So far, this 86th Tour seems to have kept its hold on the
French public despite the drug scandal that nearly scuttled the
last one.
</P>
<P>
   Jaan Kirsipuu, an Estonian with Casino, continued in the yellow
jersey of the overall leader, with time bonuses putting Steels into
second place 17 seconds behind and O'Grady into third 20 seconds
behind. Lance Armstrong, the American leader of U.S. Postal Service
team, was tied with O'Grady, 20 seconds behind Kirsipuu.
</P>
<P>
   An unbroken line of 162 of the remaining 177 riders finished in
the same time as the winner. Forty seconds behind that pack was
Sweet, gamely riding on. The stage Wednesday is also ideal for
sprinters and will offer, as he says, another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking earlier about such champions as Steels, Zabel and Mario
Cipollini, Sweet said: ``Last year, in the Tour Med, I came within
half a wheel of beating Cipo and I came from a long way back, too.
Since then I haven't raced him, so I've been waiting to have
another go.''
</P>
<P>
   Cipollini, who was 10th Tuesday and has been blanked so far in
this Tour, won four daily stages in the recent Giro d'Italia, or
two more than Sweet has won this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian's bravado is typical of sprinters, even when they
do not have the strong teams that the others have _ teams to catch
a breakaway and set the stage for a mass sprint or provide a
leadout, letting the sprinter ride in a slipstream and save some of
his energy for the final dash.
</P>
<P>
   Teams, do it, moreover, to perhaps impede a rival trying to ride
in their leader's slipstream. ``There's a lot of elbowing and
pushing and shoving but there's not much head-butting now,'' Sweet
said. ``Jersey grabbing, that's happened to me once or twice, but
it's a rare thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said slowly. ``Cipollini's got such a strong team,
Zabel's got a strong team, Steels' got a really strong team.'' He
left unsaid that his team, Big Mat-Auber, is a French
second-division team with a small budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I need is perfect positioning in the last kilometer,''
Sweet said. ``If I get a look at the finish line, I'll give it my
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect positioning, however, is not easy to get without some
help. ``Definitely not, not when 50 guys all want the same wheel''
to follow, he acknowledged. ``If I'm lucky enough to hold the wheel
of Cipo and Saeco is giving him a leadout, that's the perfect
opportunity to maybe go for a stage win, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to not having a leadout man, Sweet is also
handicapped by the presence of a second sprinter, Christophe
Capelle, on Big Mat-Auber. ``Obviously, Capelle and I will try to
get organized, but it's difficult,'' Sweet said. ``He's going for
the win and I'm going for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has advantages, too. If he's on the left side of the road
and I'm on the right and it's blocked on the left, maybe I can get
through on the right. Or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Sweet added, ``we might end up on the same side
of the road and both get blocked.''

   MUSIC-KIDDIE-POP (Undated) _ This season belongs to the
kiddie-pop brigades. Applause is passe; the reaction most eagerly
sought by pop culture right now, from music to television to
movies, is a high-pitched squeal from a mob of young girls. When
it's directed at males, that squeal signifies romantic fantasy
while it tests out some newly active hormonal responses. Directed
at females, it's a squeal of sisterly solidarity and fashion
approval. And for the last few years, its volume has been steadily
rising until it threatens to drown out anything with more mature
audiences in mind. Kiddie-pop has always been available to those
who wanted it, but in the late 1990s, it's turning into the only
game in town. By Jon Pareles.

   FILM-FRANCE (Undated) _ In France, comedy is what we call `une
maladie du regard,' an outlook dooming you to see what is
ridiculous in life,'' said the writer-director Francis Veber. In
Veber's case, comedy has proved to be a malady worth having. In
France, he is like a one-man comedy industry: among the classic
hits that he has created are ``La Cage Aux Folles,'' ``Les
Comperes,'' and ``The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe.'' Veber's
most recent movie, ``The Dinner Game,'' (``Le Diner de Cons'')
which opens July 9, has the clash of wills and split-second timing
that are his trademarks. By Laura Winters.

   DANCE-NY-BALLET (New York) _ Since it ain't over till it's over,
it may be premature to declare the New York City Ballet's 50th
anniversary year at an end. The celebration continues through July
24 at the company's summer home, the Saratoga Performing Arts
Center in upstate New York. Nonetheless, the sum went beyond the

   SCULPTURE-ITALY (Pistoia) _ Sculpture gardens bloom in many a
cultured field today. Museums consider them prestigious adjuncts,
cities invest in them as tourist attractions, philanthropists see
them as proof that art is long, life short and bronze a kind of
immortality. In Italy today, the past takes precedence, and
Italians show almost no interest in gardens planted with the work
of living artists. One rare exception is the home of Giuliano Gori,
an industrialist who has created a lovely and uncommon blend of
19th-century Romantic garden and art of the last 20 years at the
Fattoria di Celle, his villa and farm near Pistoia, in Tuscany. By

   ARTIFACTS-HUGUENOTS (New York) _ When looking at good English
silver from the 17th and 18th centuries, one should remember that
it was meant to be seen by the flicker of candlelight. In such

lighting that suggests candlelight, the 112 pieces of silver in
``The Huguenot Legacy: English Silver 1680-1760,'' an exhibition at
the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in Manhattan, is like a
glittering ocean with more than a few lobsters, dolphins and water
monsters surfacing in the decor of the objects. By Paula Dietz.

BLOCK TO U.N. NOMINEE IS APPARENTLY SENATE LEADER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Ky., Miss., Ohio)   (rk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Majority Leader Trent Lott, whose office
has refused to identify the two senators secretly blocking a final
confirmation vote on Richard Holbrooke as chief diplomat to the
United Nations, turns out to be one of the two, government
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lott placed a secret ``hold'' on the long-stalled nomination of
Holbrooke in an effort to pressure the White House to name a
conservative Ohio law school professor to the Federal Election
Commission, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have opposed the selection of the Ohio
professor, Bradley Smith, because his writings suggest that he
opposes most campaign finance regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The other lawmaker secretly blocking the nomination is Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a government official said, but this could
not be confirmed elsewhere. McConnell has championed Smith's
appointment to the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The hold means that _ for reasons that have nothing to do with
Holbrooke's qualifications and may have a lot to do with the
partisan debate over campaign finance laws _ a final Senate vote on
the nomination could be delayed several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Relations Committee approved the nomination of
Holbrooke, the former American ambassador to Germany and architect
of the 1995 peace agreement that ended the war in Bosnia, on a
unanimous voice vote last week.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's nomination was announced in June of last year, but
the nomination papers were not forwarded to the Senate for eight
months because of a federal ethics investigation of Holbrooke that
ended without criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   A third Republican senator, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, has
blocked a vote on Holbrooke's nomination for different reasons,
involving the unrelated case of a State Department whistleblower.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Grassley, who has long called for an end to
the Senate tradition of allowing secret holds on nominations, has
acknowledged his role in preventing a vote on Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, whose office manages the holds, has not acknowledged his
role, and his spokesman said that the senator had no comment on the
issue Tuesday. Spokesmen for McConnell did not return repeated
calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Holbrooke's nomination last week, Lott, a
Mississippi Republican, said that Holbrooke ``has some problems
right now and we'll have to see how that works out.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator did not detail the problems, nor did he give any
hint that he was one of the lawmakers holding up the nomination.
His spokesman refused last week to identify the senators blocking
the vote beyond Grassley or to explain the reasons for the holds.
</P>
<P>
   The secret move to block the nomination has been described by
Democrats as a violation of the spirit of a recent agreement
between Democratic and Republican leaders intended to curtail the
Senate's arcane practice of secret ``holds.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate rules designed to encourage consensus, any lawmaker
can delay a final vote on a nomination or legislation indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   But under the agreement last February designed to end some of
the secrecy, Democrats and Republicans decided that senators
seeking a hold had to identify themselves to both the Senate
majority leader _ Lott _ and the chairman of the committee with
jurisdiction over the nomination or legislation _ in this case,
Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, neither Lott nor Helms was talking, so the
identity of the two lawmakers remained secret. A spokesman for
Helms did not return calls Tuesday. The White House had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's nomination appears now to be tied to the makeup of
the Federal Election Commission, which regulates campaign finance
laws. Under its rules, the six-member commission is made up of
three Democrats and three Republicans, who are appointed by the
president and confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican leadership wants to fill a Republican
vacancy with Smith of Capital University Law School in Columbus,
whose writings have questioned the constitutionality of federal
campaign finance laws. The White House has resisted the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley has said that his hold on Holbrooke's nomination will
remain in effect until the State Department reaches an
accommodation with Linda Shenwick, a budget specialist in the U.S.
mission to the United Nations. Ms. Shenwick has charged that she is
being forced from her job because she provided damaging information
about the United Nations to members of Congress and to reporters.
The State Department has denied her claims.

CLINTON REMINDS RETAILERS OF PROFITABLE MARKETS IN POOR REGIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Miss.)   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. _ Nothing motivates business like the
prospect of profits.
</P>
<P>
   That is the fundamental message underlying President Clinton's
tour of the nation's impoverished precincts this week. Government
tax credits and loan guarantees are fine as far as they go, Clinton
says at each stop, but corporations are not going to invest in the
Kentucky highlands, the Mississippi Delta or poor East St. Louis
without hope of a decent return.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton drew attention to the opening of a new Walgreens drug
store here in East St. Louis _ one of the first new retail
businesses to open in this struggling suburb of St. Louis in 40
years _ as an example of a corporation taking advantage of the new
markets available in America's poorest regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Clinton told a crowd of several hundred in the parking
lot of the Walgreens store as a thunderstorm threatened behind him,
``there are business opportunities out here. If you have people who
want to go to work and people with money to spend and they're both
in the same place, it's a good place to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government's not going to do it,'' Clinton continued.
``Nobody's going to put money here if they think they're going to
lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   That calculation animated Bank of America, which Tuesday
announced the formation of a $500 million ``catalyst fund'' to make
equity investments in businesses in poverty-ridden areas. The fund
will buy stakes in inner-city and rural real estate projects, urban
shopping malls, job-training facilities and other ventures that the
bank hopes will have a cascading effect on the areas they serve, a
bank official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's real money to be made in these markets,'' Cathy
Bessant, Bank of America's president of community development, said
in an interview. ``All businesses go where profits are easier, and
we believe there are booming markets here, regardless of
geography.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bessant, who is traveling with Clinton, said that
traditional lenders are reluctant to lend in distressed areas
because of false perceptions of risk and the lack of established
lending relationships with inner-city entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of America fund is designed not only to make money for
the bank's shareholders, but also to inspire other lenders and
venture capital firms to help in the revitalization of areas
starved for investment capital, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's ``new markets'' proposal, if passed by Congress,
would help protect Bank of America's investments against losses by
providing tax credits for new businesses and Federal guarantees for
matching loans to such enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to ask people to make charitable
contributions,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House chief economic
adviser, ``but to make companies take a second look in our own
backyard where there could be profitable business opportunities
while also helping rebuild communities that have been left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped in Clarksdale, Miss., in the lower Mississippi
Delta before flying to East St. Louis late Tuesday afternoon. He
walked through Clarksdale's desolated center and visited a small
manufacturing plant recently rescued from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good business opportunity here,'' Clinton said at a
policy discussion at the factory, owned by the Waterfield Cabinet
Co.. ``If we cannot fully develop the Delta now when we have the
strongest economy in our lifetime, when will we ever get around to
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew W. Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development,
who is traveling with the president, released a report on the
untapped retail market of the nation's inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that cities like East St. Louis, which have
seen their retail bases evaporate over the past several decades,
have more than $300 billion in pent-up retail demand, presenting an
enormous opportunity for retailers like Walgreens.
</P>
<P>
   With neighborhood stores shuttered, inner-city residents are
driving to the suburbs to shop, buying by mail, or, in some cases,
shopping over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to use government to tap those markets,''
Cuomo said in an interview. He said that Clinton waited this long
to make a major push for inner-city and rural economic development
because only now does he have the economic and political clout to
pull it off. Also, the electronic revolution has changed the nature
of business, making it possible to conduct all manner of commerce
from virtually anywhere on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't have done this six or seven years ago,'' Cuomo
said of the president. ``He has the economy at his back, he has
credibility in his government and business is more mobile. These
high-tech guys can go anywhere. They don't need water. They don't
need ports. They can move to Appalachia, they can move to East St.
Louis, they can move to the Bronx.''

   BRITISH TELECOM ORDERED TO OPEN NETWORK TO RIVALS
</P>
<P>
   Already under pressure from rival telephone and cable operators,
British Telecommunications, which controls about 85 percent of the
``local loop'' copper network used by home subscribers and small
businesses, was ordered by regulators to upgrade its network and
open it to competitors by July 2001. The directive reflects the
rapidly intensifying competition in Europe to offer high-speed
Internet access and other broadband services. But it also
highlights the difficult situation facing the former state
monopoly: competition is likely to accelerate the growth of the
high-speed market, but it could also reduce British
Telecommunications' slice of it.
</P>
<P>
   BILL COULD CREATE NEW TYPE OF BANK
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what a Congressional conference committee does,
legislation that would overhaul the nation's financial system could
include a provision for wholesale banks, which would take only
large deposits and do everything else a commercial bank does.
</P>
<P>
   OIL PRICES APPROACH $20 A BARREL
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil rose to a 19-month high, near $20 a barrel, on signs
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would adhere
to its promised production cuts in the months ahead. King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil-producing nation and OPEC's
most influential member, said that his country would stick with its
cuts. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates also said the output
reductions should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   LATE SELLOFF PUSHES STOCKS LOWER
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon selloff pulled stock prices down from early gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.12 points, to 11,135.12.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.10 points, or
two-tenths of a percent, to 1,388.12, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 4.24 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 2,736.78.

   Bond prices fell, sending yields to their highest level in a

   In an unusual legal tussle between the government and its

   DEATH CASTS LIGHT ON FRANKEL'S LIFE
</P>
<P>
   The death of a woman two years ago at the Greenwich, Conn., home

several states of hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN BUSINESSMEN AID CHARITY
</P>
<P>
   Although Russian businessmen are often vilified as exploiters
and tax cheats, many are making significant contributions to
nonprofit causes. The largest donation made by a Russian company or
individual since 1917 came from Vladimir Potanin, who runs a
financial-industrial group called Interros. He gave $1.4 million to
support the reconstruction of the Rostral Columns, one of St.
Petersburg's historic landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   BATHROOM HUMOR WORKS FOR FILM AD
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaign for the film ``Big Daddy,'' which shows
two actors poised as if urinating, represents what may be the first
time that a major Hollywood studio has sold a mainstream movie on
the basis of a bodily function. But the ads have received almost
universal acceptance by the media and few complaints.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN OFFICIAL TO HEAD COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to political pressure to reduce the role of foreign
investors, the board of Russia's largest shipping company, Far
Eastern Shipping, elected Aleksandr Lugovets, Russia's deputy
transportation minister, as chairman.
</P>

   PURCHASING INDEX SHOWS GROWTH

   The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that
its index of nonmanufacturing business rose last month, suggesting

FOREIGN INVESTORS LOSE A ROUND AT RUSSIAN SHIPPING COMPANY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RUSSELL WORKING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia _ The board of Russia's largest shipping
company elected a ranking official of the Russian government as the
company's chairman Tuesday, bowing to pressure from a powerful
regional governor who has expressed anger over the influence of
foreign investors in post-communist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Alexander Lugovets, Russia's deputy transportation
minister, to lead the board of the Far Eastern Shipping Co. is the
latest in a series of moves by Yevgeny Nazdratenko, governor of the
southeastern region of Primorsky, to reduce the role of foreign
investors in the company. Nazdratenko's nationalist zeal has
received attention from foreign investors in Russia as an
indication of resentment over non-Russian ownership stakes in
privatized Russian businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Nazdratenko allegedly threatened to jail a British
member of the shipping company's board, Andrew Fox, if several
demands were not met, among them the election of Lugovets to the
chairmanship. Nazdratenko also demanded that 7 percent of the
shares owned by foreign investors, who hold 42 percent of the
company, be sold to the government of Primorsky, which already owns
some shares, Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring those shares would give Nazdratenko effective control
of the company. Formerly state-run, it is a major employer, with
11,400 workers and 112 ships.
</P>
<P>
   Although the governor's motives for wanting the company remain
unclear, Far Eastern Shipping does most of its business in dollars
and other hard currency, with annual revenue of $370 million, which
has raised speculation that he may want access to that money to
help finance his upcoming re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nazdratenko has denied that speculation and has also denied
threatening Fox, who is also chairman of a Vladivostok brokerage
firm called Tiger Securities. Fox has lived in Vladivostok since
1992 but fled to London after the incident with Nazdratenko.
Nazdratenko also told reporters he had requested an investigation
of foreign shareholders of the shipping company by the Federal
Security Services, the main successor agency to the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from London, Fox said the selection of
Lugovets as chairman of the company was unacceptable to foreign
investors and they would contest it. But how and when such a
challenge would take place remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Nazdratenko's spokeswoman, Natalya Vstovskaya, welcomed the
selection of Lugovets, saying he would be an effective leader.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign investors and their Russian allies, resisting the
idea of being dictated to by government officials, had opposed
Lugovets for the position. But he won in a 6-5 vote after an
American board member, Richard Thomas, who had worked at Fox's firm
until recently, broke ranks with the other foreigners and cast an
affirmative vote. The reasons behind Thomas' decision were not
clear, and he could not be reached Tuesday.

FIRST LADY TAKES ANOTHER BIG STEP TOWARD SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton filed Tuesday with the Federal Election
Commission to form a committee to run for U.S. Senate in New York
next year, taking a formal step toward becoming the only wife of a
sitting president in American history to actively seek elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of a so-called exploratory committee allows Mrs.
Clinton to raise money for travel, advertising, polling and other
expenses in her effort to succeed Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a
Democrat, who is retiring next year after 24 years in office.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton, who has never lived in New York
state, is to begin a four-day ``listening tour'' through central
New York, starting at Moynihan's farm in Delaware County and
continuing through Oneonta, Cooperstown, Utica, Rome, Syracuse and
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady is not expected to face a challenge in next
year's Democratic primary. She is widely expected to face New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, who formed his own
exploratory committee in April.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island, has
indicated that he also plans to run for the Senate despite
Giuliani's far-wider name recognition and already formidable
advantage in campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has taken to mocking the Mrs. Clinton repeatedly in
recent weeks for seeking public office in a state where she has
never resided. To that end, Giuliani has planned a campaign trip
later this month to Arkansas, where Mrs. Clinton used to live.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in response to a question about Mrs. Clinton's
impending visit to New York, Giuliani said that he was far more
knowledgeable about New York state than his reputation as the
consummate urbanite might suggest. ``I have a great deal of
knowledge of the state of New York, far more than you actually
think I do because you know you think of me as being the mayor of
New York City,'' Giuliani told reporters at his daily news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who often takes great glee in his image as a
Flatbush-born, maniac Yankee fan wholly devoted to the hometown he
modestly refers to as the Capital of Everything, instead stressed
his ties to places like Saratoga, Lake George, Utica and Elmira.
``I have always spent a great deal of time upstate. I know Saratoga
really well. I have been to Lake George. I worked in Syracuse and I
worked in Utica and I have worked in Albany and I have worked in
Binghamton and I have worked in other parts of the state,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani apparently spent the time upstate when he worked as a
law clerk to a judge after graduating from New York University Law
School in 1968. The mayor's press secretary, Sunny Mindel, did not
respond to requests Tuesday for specific details about his upstate
work experience.
</P>
<P>
   Those details are likely to become an issue as the campaign
develops and suburban and upstate voters begin to consider whether
Giuliani, as the mayor of New York City, is any more familiar with
their local needs and concerns than Mrs. Clinton is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani believes he is. ``Every time I have gone up there, I
have gotten the sense that they like me,'' he said of upstate
voters Tuesday. `` I think they like what I did with New York
City.''
</P>
<P>
   But in yet another example of the difficulty that both
candidates will have in navigating unfamiliar terrain, Giuliani
also said he spent Monday relaxing with his son in Monroe County. A
spokeswoman, Jennifer Chait, later said he had actually been in
Monroe, N.Y., which is in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Tuesday morning, Mrs. Clinton remained at the
White House while Lynn Utrecht, an expert in elections law who is
serving as general counsel to Mrs. Clinton's committee, brought the
single-page filing form to the Federal Election Commission's
downtown offices.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Utrecht was accompanied by Howard Wolfson, the committee's
press secretary, who addressed a crowd of about 10 television crews
that had gathered in the suffocating heat outside the commission's
offices just across the street from the headquarters of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Wolfson said, ``Over the next months, Mrs.
Clinton will travel throughout the state meeting with New Yorkers
in small groups and listening to them discuss the issues that
concern them the most.'' He added, ``Thank you and see you in New
York.''

COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TOPS HEALTH ISSUES IN UAW TALKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Tenn.)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The soaring cost of prescription drugs for aging auto
workers and retirees is the top health care issue in national labor
talks pitting the United Automobile Workers union against General
Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler AG, auto executives said.
</P>
<P>
   While many industries face rising costs for pharmaceutical
benefits, the auto makers said they had particularly acute
problems. Benefits consultants, who compare costs in various
industries, agree.
</P>
<P>
   Including the cost of covering retirees and their spouses,
Ford's expense is now approaching $2,800 annually for each active
hourly worker. That is roughly six times the typical cost in large
companies, which commonly include retiree costs in such
calculations but seldom have as many retirees, compared to active
workers, as the three auto makers.
</P>
<P>
   The auto makers' costs for prescription benefits are also rising
10 percent to 18 percent a year, the companies said. This is
squeezing profits because new automobile prices have stayed
virtually flat.
</P>
<P>
   The union opposes broad changes in its members' health plan when
current labor contracts with the auto makers expire on Sept. 14. On
the other hand, the union has worked with the auto makers on some
minor modifications, such as suggesting that workers choose less
expensive generic versions of drugs when they are available.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW contended that since some new medicines address ailments
previously requiring hospital treatment, the auto makers should use
the savings to cover pharmaceuticals. Workers should not be asked
to pay more for medicines that save money for employers, the union
said in a recent, book-length resolution outlining its bargaining
goals, adding, ``Such shell games must be resisted.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the labor talks is likely to influence companies
and workers in many other industries, because of the auto
industry's sheer size. The final settlement here could affect the
debate in Congress over President Clinton's proposal last week to
add prescription drug benefits to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the Medicare debate is likely to focus on whether
the costs of a federal prescription benefit program can be
controlled. The labor negotiations here will revolve around the
same issue and are expected to be concluded first.
</P>
<P>
   GM is the nation's largest corporate provider of pharmaceutical
benefits, covering 1.5 million employees and retirees along with
their spouses and dependents. This includes salaried employees,
whose benefits are kept similar to those negotiated for unionized
workers. Ford covers 650,000 Americans and DaimlerChrysler another
400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The three auto makers' benefits costs are particularly high
partly because their work forces are relatively old _ the average
age ranges from 43 at DaimlerChrysler to 48 at GM After hiring few
workers over the last quarter of a century, the three unionized
auto makers also have as many retirees as active workers.
</P>
<P>
   Their pharmaceutical plans are generous, with no monthly fees
and few restrictions on the number of prescriptions, although plan
participants must make a small co-payment, typically $2 to $5, each
time a prescription is filled. While Clinton's plan would initially
limit Medicare's annual payments per person to $1,000, rising to
$2,500 by 2008, there is no such limit on annual payments in the
health plans for current and retired auto workers and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers and the union have not taken a position on the plan
but are likely to support it. The president's proposal calls for
subsidies to companies already offering prescription benefits to
retirees, so as to dissuade businesses from abandoning their plans
and shifting their retirees' pharmaceutical costs on to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Costs have soared for new, so-called life-style drugs, notably
Viagra, an impotence medicine, auto executives said. One reason,
they said, is that the Food and Drug Administration weakened its
restrictions on the advertising of pharmaceuticals in 1997,
allowing drug companies to bolster demand for their products.
``Many individuals as patients are going to their physicians and
demanding drugs that they've seen on television,'' said Preston M.
Crabill, GM's director of health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former union officials share auto executives'
criticisms of pharmaceutical companies' advertising, saying that it
drives up costs. They say that overall costs for the benefits
should be controlled, but not in ways that penalize the health or
pocketbooks of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll always find a sympathetic ear from us, because that's
$2,800 a year you can't spend on wages, pensions and so forth,''
said Douglas Fraser, a former president of the UAW.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign auto makers with operations in the United States were
also complaining about rapidly climbing pharmaceutical costs. While
only their joint ventures with Detroit auto makers are unionized,
the foreign auto makers have chosen to offer the same benefits
packages nationwide to discourage broader unionization. The cost of
these benefits is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be the nature of the medical business right now,
everybody's looking at skyrocketing drug costs,'' said Thomas P.
Groom, the director of human resources at the Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. USA in Smyrna, Tenn. But the foreign auto
makers have few retirees so far, and their work forces are still
fairly young, so their costs per active worker are much lower.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has begun steering employees toward generic drugs by
setting lower co-payments for them and higher co-payments for
costlier medicines still under patent. DaimlerChrysler made the
same change for its nonunion, salaried workers at the start of this
year, and found that it helped control costs in the first quarter
of 1999, said Nancy Rae, the company's vice president for
compensation and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has long resisted such changes. Union officials maintain
that financial considerations should not discourage workers from
seeking the best possible medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives declined to discuss specific negotiating
positions on how to control costs.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and union officials differ on how much blame for
rising costs should be given to new medicines like Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Executives cite the introduction of Viagra last year to
illustrate the problem of rising costs. Union officials said that
while heavy advertising for Viagra may have increased demand,
emphasizing an impotence medicine trivializes the overall problem.
</P>
<P>
   At GM, Viagra accounted for $10 million of the $676 million in
prescription benefit costs last year, but the cost has leveled off
this year, the company said.

<P>
   UZICE, Yugoslavia _ About half an hour before the rally against
President Slobodan Milosevic was to begin Wednesday night, the town
square was mostly empty, but the police were there, scowling.
</P>
<P>
   Then, within the minutes it took worried opposition politicians
organizing the protest to walk two blocks from their headquarters
to the central square, more than 10,000 citizens materialized, many
of them parents with small children in tow.
</P>
<P>
   The police, who had declared the rally illegal, used force to
prevent a sound system from being erected, but the crowd peacefully
overwhelmed them and speakers were set up. For more than an hour
the crowd shouted that Milosevic must give up power _ and soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are a lot of us, they will not use force,'' Zoran
Djindjic, the opposition leader who returned from self-imposed
exile two days ago, told the crowd. He fled during the Kosovo war
after he said that paramilitary thugs loyal to Milosevic had
threatened to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be brave. It will be a hot summer, hotter than any summer that
has come before,'' he said, adding that in the next three months he
expects daily demonstrations in cities across Serbia. He also said
he expects the Serbian Orthodox Church, which last month demanded
that Milosevic resign, to join the opposition in calling for a
nationwide general strike.
</P>
<P>
   No speaker said anything to criticize NATO, which during the
Kosovo war, flattened the post office here and destroyed the local
telephone exchange. Nearly all of Uzice, an industrial town of
62,000 people about 120 miles southwest of Belgrade, is still
without phone service. As the crowd gazed Wednesday night at the
rally's speakers, they could see beyond them to the ruins of the
post office. But it was never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bombed us because our wrong politics are not in accord
with the rest of the world,'' said Ljubise Maksimovic, 46, a
railroad foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's rally went silent shortly after it began when
the police unplugged a power cord that ran into a private apartment
facing the town square. The sound system came back on when rally
organizers fired up a gasoline-powered generator.
</P>
<P>
   From the elevated edge of the town square, opposition speakers
shifted back and forth Wednesday night between denouncing Milosevic
for ``shaming'' Serbia and mocking members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, a philosopher and key opposition leader who helped
lead street rallies two years ago that brought tens of thousands of
people in the streets of Belgrade daily for nearly three months,
said, ``In the last 10 years, four times we went into war with
tanks and four times Serbs came back from war on tractors,''
referring to lost wars in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and, this year,
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst ruler in the history of the world.'' Mr.
Djindjic said. ``We will not allow them to provoke a new war _ a
civil war in this country. The maximum that we demand and the
minimum that we will accept, is this: He must go away before new
elections are held.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing the possibility of any negotiations with the
Milosevic regime, an approach advocated by the largest single
Serbian opposition party, Djindjic said, ``It is too late for
negotiations. We don't have time for a transitional government. The
end of this regime is necessary for the survival of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers focused on Marko Milosevic, 25, the president's
son and a well-connected entrepreneur whom American intelligence
officials have said is a major cigarette smuggler in Serbia. This
weekend he opened a private sports theme park called Bambipark,
which he and other investors built during the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is spending $380,000 dollars on Bambipark while we have
columns of Serbian refugees coming back from Kosovo,'' said
Miroslav Martovic, deputy mayor of Uzice, as the crowd whistled and
booed.
</P>
<P>
   Uzice, a city ruled by an opposition coalition since 1996, was
once a prosperous manufacturing town, with copper, aluminum and
car-parts factories.
</P>
<P>
   Before Yugoslavia began to fall apart in 1991, this city was the
country's second largest earner of foreign currency, exporting
goods worth about $100 million a year, according to the mayor,
Milan Nikitovic. Those hard currency earnings, the mayor said, have
slipped to zero this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we export only fog,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Protests boiled over again Wednesday in Leskovac, a town in
Milosevic's traditional base of southern Serbia. About two thousand
protesters clashed with police day in the town, not far from the
border with Kosovo. They were demanding the release of a local
television technician who had been arrested and sentenced to 30
days in jail on Monday for an unusual protest.
</P>
<P>
   The TV employee, Ivan Novkovic, started the ball rolling in
Leskovac on Friday when a large TV audience was watching a
basketball game between Yugoslavia and Germany in the European
championship tournament.
</P>
<P>
   During half-time, Novkovic, who works for TV Leskovac, switched
off regular programming and broadcast a videotape starring himself.
In it, he denounced a local political boss who belongs to the
hard-line Yugoslav Left Party headed by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana
Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   That programming change, which left Novkovic unemployed and
which made him into a national celebrity, ignited the unplanned
demonstration Monday in Leskovac, which mushroomed from a march
against an unpopular local politician into a rowd of 20,000 people.
Local press accounts described the protest as the largest
demonstration calling for the resignation of Milosevic since the
end of the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That crowd, according to local news reports, included many
disgruntled Yugoslav army reservists who fought in Kosovo and who
joined the crowd in shouting, ``Go Away Slobo'' and ``Leskovac is
No Longer Red.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Uzice the adventures of Novkovic in southern Serbia were
seized upon as a sign that popular discontent with Milosevic may
run much deeper than anyone had dared hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man called them on TV and 20,000 people went to the
central square without a single political leader _ that's the real
stuff,'' said Slobodan Vuksanovic, a leader of the Alliance for
Change, the umbrella group that called the rally here and is
organizing a string of demonstrations in small and medium-sized
towns in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a signal that shows what we all know and what we
sometimes forget,'' said Vuksanovic. ``People are sick of
politicians. They desperately need an alternative.''

FILMMAKERS OF `BLAIR WITCH PROJECT' SAY EMOTION WAS KEY TO SCARY
MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The premise is simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, 1994, three Montgomery College film students hike
into Maryland's Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary on the
local legend, ``the Blair Witch.'' They disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, their film footage is found. It may be simple, but
it's a premise that warrants goosebumps even in the telling. It's
as chilling onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' moved critic Roger Ebert to write:
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time you went to a movie and were actually
scared? Not spooked, shocked or having fun at being scared, but
completely horrified?''
</P>
<P>
   It's also taken on a life of its own, achieving near-cult status
with a Web site and hundreds of fans tapping into the history and
mythology of the Blair Witch even before the film opens in theaters
on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   This ``virtual reality'' phenomenon and scarefest is the
brainchild of two young University of Central Florida film
graduates, Dan Myrick and Ed Sanchez, who have known each other
since 1990 and who still call Orlando home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met at film school, first semester,'' says Sanchez who,
with Myrick, recently visited Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is the more outgoing of the duo and he shoots from the
hip with his stream-of-consciousness opinions. Myrick is thoughtful
and reserved. They have a finely balanced relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best stuff comes when Ed comes to me with an idea. It's a
natural collaboration and makes the end product of what we do
individually even better,'' says Myrick.
</P>
<P>
   The two would be thrilled if their film became a regular on the
midnight movie circuit and they're also happy about the early,
positive praise after a screening shook up the Sundance Film
Festival in January. Yet they're wary of the overly lavish hype
that can kill a small film with unreal expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an experimental film,'' reminds Sanchez. ``We shot it
in October of '97. We shot it in only eight days. But we started
casting it in 1996. We thought of the idea in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a year to edit because the pair had 20 hours of footage,
all shot in real time in the forest and in a car.
</P>
<P>
   It also took a year to cast because they needed actors with
exceptionally strong improvisational skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a film where we essentially threw our actors out there
in the woods and let them make our movie for us,'' laughs Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Myrick says they were initially concerned with the big buzz at
Sundance because ``at the time we didn't want to let people down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse to build a thing up and be let down than to not
expect anything. We're just happy the hype control mechanism is in
place as much as it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he notes proudly ``The Blair Witch Project'' is one of
the few times ``where a movie is just one part of an overall
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We created a realm that people can interact with, especially
with the Web site. There's even a comic book coming out. It's
become an alternate world that the movie itself is just a part of.
It proves if something is cool, entertaining and insightful as well
as emotional, people will engage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez enthuses, ``There's even a guy at a software company who
has 1,500 employees and he's downloaded `Blair Witch' screensavers
on their computers and he's giving his employees the Friday opening
a half day off so they can go see the film.''
</P>
<P>
   All for a little movie based on old '70s TV shows like ``In
Search Of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' admits Sanchez. ``Anything with Big Foot, the Loch
Ness monster or the yeti ... scenes with UFOs. That inspired us
more than any conventional film.''
</P>
<P>
   So what, besides the fascination with being scared to death,
makes this movie so different from say, ``Scream'' or ``Nightmare
On Elm Street?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to scare people on film, the first couple movies
in a series are a trick,'' notes Sanchez. ```Blair' throws the
rules away and says you can't expect anything because you don't
know what's coming. There are no flags or triggers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done,'' explains Myrick, ``is make an emotional
film. It operates on an emotional level. A lot of films coming out
now are full of techno-wizardry and that's cool if you're an
animator, but good films, whether scary, funny or whatever, tap
into some key emotional core.''
</P>
<P>
   The star of too many Hollywood horror films is no longer the
horror, Sanchez says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a monster, the star, the effects and that's not what
scares you. It's impressive, it looks nice. But what it ultimately
means when there's so much special effect is the filmmakers don't
trust their audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a prime directive to keep it real,'' says Myrick. ``We
also discussed `what do we show if we don't show the monster'? We
built this reality process and then trusted the instincts of our
actors. We hoped that the reality-based way we shot the film would
be scary. We took a risk. In the end it was what we wanted in that
we captured the moments off-camera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear is a lot easier to capture than drama or comedy because
it's primal,'' he adds. ``I mean, what scares the hell out of you?
It's universal. We've not all been in love but we've all been
scared. I love to hear about people, after they've seen the film,
who have some sense memory about a recollection from childhood. And
that's what the movie does. There's something subtextual about
knowing what happens to these people in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez says they'll take the same approach no matter what kind
of movie they make together.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at the heart of a film?'' he asks. ``Our next movie is
a comedy. So we ask each other `what makes us laugh?' We basically
just strip away the rules. If the film winds up following
convention, it does. There's no formula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, we weren't taken seriously before `Blair' and we
didn't ever take ourselves seriously. We just wanted to prove we
aren't afraid to take chances. More than being thought of as
directors, I'd just like our production company, Haxan, to be
thought of as a place where you can't predict what's coming next.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrick adds, ``Yeah, where no matter what, if you see one of our
movies you'll know we had our hearts in what we did. It may flop,
it may not, but it'll be a ride. That's what I like about Jim
Jarmusch and John Sayles. They take chances and you have to respect
that. That's all I can ask for.''

OIL AND MINING INTERESTS AMONG WINNERS IN SPENDING BILL ADD-ONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Idaho, Mo., Texas, Wash.)   (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate is setting up a festival of favors for
oil, gas, timber, mining and ranching interests in its spending
bills this year.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies would keep hundreds of millions of dollars in
royalties that the Interior Department says they owe the public.
Miners would be able to dump thousands of tons of waste on federal
land. Loggers would reap new harvests in Alaska's forests. Ranchers
could let their cattle graze in a national recreation area.
</P>
<P>
   None of these measures might pass easily on their own. But all
are wrapped as riders inside the bill financing the Interior
Department, which must pass in some way, shape or form. It was
approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee last week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, the 105th Congress used riders to promote
timber cutting in national forests, block a clear-air program for
national parks, freeze fuel-efficiency standards for cars, let more
livestock graze on federal lands and increase logging in California
forests.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in the Senate, Western Republicans like Sens. Larry
E. Craig of Idaho, Slade Gorton of Washington and Ted Stevens of
Alaska, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, have
inserted measures into spending bills that have gladdened oil men,
loggers, miners and ranchers. Since 1991, these three pivotal
senators have received more than $850,000 in campaign contributions
from those interests, federal records show.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say there is a direct connection between the
money the senators receive and the laws they write.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mining, timber and oil industries are using key senators as
political pawns to checkmate the environment,'' said Courtney Cuff,
legislative director of the Friends of the Earth group.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate used to have a century-old rule, called Rule XVI,
that in principle barred members from adding new laws to spending
bills. But in 1995, while trying to undercut the Endangered Species
Act, Republicans killed the rule with a swift parliamentary blow.
</P>
<P>
   Its death opened the way for amendments and riders to piggyback
on spending bills. It meant that new laws, sometimes impenetrably
written, could be enacted without the usual public hearings and
public debate, or public disclosure of their legislative intent.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Craig, chief of the Republican Policy Committee,
inserted an amendment to the Interior bill that wipes out a rule
that had limited mine dumps on federal and Indian land to five-acre
sites. The measure overturns Interior Department policies and legal
rulings by the department's solicitor general. Similarly, Gorton
used a rider in May to pave the way for an open-pit gold mine in
Washington whose operators will crush, leach and dump nine million
tons of rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mineral is where you find it,'' Craig said. ``It may not be
the most suitable place in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Mining companies have more than 300 pending applications for new
projects on federal land affected by Craig's measure, the senator
said. One proposed mine would create more than 220 tons of waste
for every ounce of gold it produces, Interior officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Gold mines use cyanide to separate the metal from rock, and that
poison can wash into streams and rivers, killing fish and wildlife,
environmentalists protest.
</P>
<P>
   The measure could create hundreds of mining jobs and hundreds of
millions of dollars of profit. But ``the mining rider would
devastate beautiful places forever,'' Ms. Cuff said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Gorton together have received $100,000 in campaign
contributions from mining interests since 1991, federal records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Wetstone, advocacy director at the Natural Resources
Defense Council in Washington, called the mining rider a case study
of democracy in inaction, ``an abuse of what is supposed to be an
open democratic process and an open door for special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine a more telling example of unconscionable
legislation that could never be passed in the light of day,''
Wetstone said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Another amendment, by Stevens and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, would spare oil companies from paying the public hundreds
of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department contends that oil companies have
underpaid royalties on oil extracted from federal land. These
royalties go to government environmental programs and to state
public education funds. The money due, by some estimates, is $856
million and growing.
</P>
<P>
   The senators' amendment places a continuing moratorium on the
oil companies' having to pay up.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators have riders that bar the Interior Department from
prohibiting lead mining along the Ozark National Scenic Riverways
in Missouri, open a national recreation area in Washington state to
cattle ranchers and promote logging in federal forests.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is threatening to veto the Interior spending
bill over such riders. The Senate will soon vote on the bill;
assuming it passes, it will then be reconciled with the House
Appropriations Committee's version, approved on Thursday, which
contains no environmental riders.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's fondness for such riders grew mightily after it
abolished Rule XVI. Ever since, Craig said, ``appropriations bills
have become vehicles'' for all manner of riders as Democrats and
Republicans alike have loaded laws onto spending bills for seven
federal agencies. Just last week, Senate Democrats tried to attach
a patient's bill of rights onto the agriculture spending bill,
stalling its passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all fairness,'' Craig said, ``the reason that has happened
is that appropriations bills must pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice ``is one of the reasons we get wrapped around the
axle,'' said the spokeswoman for the House Appropriations
Committee, Elizabeth Morra.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative standoffs on spending created the government
shutdown of 1995 and a last-minute spending free-for-all last
October _ both of which embarrassed Congress and diminished its
reputation among voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is now considering reinstating Rule XVI, and 85 House
Democrats have signed a bill, called The Defense of the Environment
Act, to outlaw special-interest riders like the Senate's. It has
little or no chance of passage.

POLISHING THE GALLIC ART OF A WELL-HONED VERBAL JAB 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 11) 
(jt) 
 By LAURA WINTERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In France, comedy is what we call ``une maladie du regard,'' an
outlook dooming you to see what is ridiculous in life,'' said the
writer-director Francis Veber.
</P>
<P>
   In Veber's case, comedy has proved to be a malady worth having.
In France, he is like a one-man comedy industry: among the classic
hits that he has created are ``La Cage Aux Folles,'' ``Les
Comperes,'' and ``The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Veber's most recent movie, ``The Dinner Game,'' (``Le Diner de
Cons'') which opened here on Friday, has the clash of wills and
split-second timing that are his trademarks. The premise of the
film is disarmingly simple. Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte) is
an ultrasnobbish book publisher in Paris who participates in a
nefarious little ritual with his friends. On a regular basis, they
each invite the stupidest person they can find to a ``dinner of
idiots,'' where they subtly make fun of their hapless prey.
</P>
<P>
   For this particular dinner, Brochant has invited Francois Pignon
(Jacques Villeret), a lowly accountant who painstakingly constructs
matchstick replicas of French monuments. When Brochant throws out
his back, he is forced to cancel his plans and is sequestered, to
his horror, with the very man he had planned to mock. The balance
of power slowly reverses as the well-meaning Pignon, who is a
world-class catastrophe magnet, manages to lay waste to the other
man's privileged way of life.
</P>
<P>
   (It is a lesson familiar to Americans from the television comedy
``Seinfeld'' _ bad things happen to selfish people. And that can be
hilarious.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game'' was the most popular film in France last
year after ``Titanic,'' and has opened from Hong Kong to Turkey.
This past May the Cannes International Film Festival gave an homage
to Veber, an honor almost unheard of for a French comedy writer in
a country where the boundaries between the commercial and the
artistic are usually clearly drawn.
</P>
<P>
   While French critics may malign them, the public attends
comedies en masse. ``The Dinner Game,'' which originated as a play,
has many of the farcical elements that the French love: a comic
set-up embellished by pratfalls and swift repartee. In his
attention to carefully crafted situations and verbal fireworks,
Veber is in line with the classic tradition of the French stage
farce, which reached its peak with Moliere. Said Daniel Toscan du
Plantier, president of Unifrance, an organization that promotes
French films abroad, ``It's a verbal virtuosity which we now see
returning again with Veber.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Veber's nimble dialogue and astringent tone are
distinctive, many French comedies share a certain verbal
sleight-of-hand and lack of sentimentality. This may be news for
Americans who think of French humor either as broad physical comedy
_ see their adulation of Jerry Lewis _ or as sex farces, where love
and lust are delivered with a knowing wink. But the French also are
up for ``The Dinner Game,'' and gossamer comedies of manners _
think Eric Rohmer _ that explore the fragile relations between
people and the inanity of social mores.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so American about American comedies is that the
underdog has to triumph at the end,'' said Mark Urman, co-president
of Lions Gate Releasing, which is distributing ``The Dinner Game.''
``What is quintessentially French about `The Dinner Game' is that
Villeret's character has his revenge, but remains as annoying at
the end as he was at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The satire in ``The Dinner Game'' springs from actual incidents
in Paris. ``There was a coterie of show biz people who used to get
together at a club called Castel,'' Veber recalled, ``and who used
to invite the people who they thought were the stupidest possible.
A truly mean and despicable game. So I thought it would be
interesting to punish one of those people, someone who has
everything he could possibly want in life. I wanted to show that
those we consider stupid may not be as dumb as we think. If there's
one thing I hate in this world, it's the scorn that people can have
for others.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Unfortunately, I think that `mean' is universal.
When I was writing this film, I heard about that practice in the
U.S. called `the dog fight,' where fraternity brothers invite the
ugliest girls they can find.'' He raised his eyebrows. ``So I was
not ashamed to be writing about jerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Veber, 61, relishes recounting how he cast the chiseled, strong
Lhermitte and the spherical, hapless Villeret as his dueling
protagonists. ``I love moments where you have a cat and a dog face
to face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in these two different types of
personalities: force in relation to weakness. The character that
Lhermitte plays is the man I would have liked to have been.'' He
laughed. ``And the character that Villeret plays is the man who I
actually am.'' In short, a Woody Allenesque fantasy of comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   While some of Veber's films have been released in the United
States (like the hit ``La Cage aux Folles'') not all brands of
French humor make it across the Atlantic. ``The wisdom is that
people who go to see foreign-language films are highbrows who
equate art with seriousness,'' Urman said of American audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Largely untried here, however, is the new stream of humanistic
comedies from a younger generation of writers in France. Two such
writers are Jean-Pierre Bacri and Agnes Jaoui, a team who have
co-written several hit French plays, including ``Un Air de
Famille,'' which was made into a 1996 film directed by Cedric
Klapisch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Un Air de Famille'' (translated as ``Family Resemblances''
when finally released here last year) is about a squabbling French
family which meets every Friday night in the cafe owned by one of
the sons. The writers (who also act in the film) manage to lampoon
everything from family tensions to class snobberies.
</P>
<P>
   Television has played a large role in creating film comedians
such as Alain Chabat. The 40-year-old Chabat made his debut as a
director with his 1997 hit ``Didier,'' in which he stars as a dog
who finds himself transformed into a man.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he appeals to the French love of broad physical comedy,
though, as he pointed out over the telephone, his brand of humor is
not so different from the American-style comedy of ``There's
Something About Mary.'' ``I like silly jokes, but I also really
like it when you feel something for a character,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And though he comes from a different place, Chabat also admires
the work of Veber. ``There are many young people today who are
looking closely at Veber's work,'' he said. ``His films have an
extraordinary sense of timing, as precise as a clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the landmark French comedy of the early 1990's, however,
is ``The Visitors,'' the story of a medieval French knight and his
vassal who find themselves in contemporary provincial France. The
film, directed by the comedy veteran Jean-Marie Poire and starring
Christian Clavier and Jean Reno, was the second most successful
French film of all time, appealing as it did to the French fondness
both for their own history and for incongruous comedic situations.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``The Visitors'' performed only modestly at the box
office in America, Poire is currently directing the American
remake. It has its two French stars in the central roles and will
also star American actors. The French countryside becomes
contemporary Chicago, where the medievals meet the knight's
American descendant (Christina Applegate).

<P>
   UZICE, Yugoslavia _ About half an hour before the rally against
President Slobodan Milosevic was to begin Tuesday night, the town
square was mostly empty, but the police were there, scowling.
</P>
<P>
   Then, within the minutes it took worried opposition politicians
organizing the protest to walk two blocks from their headquarters
to the central square, more than 10,000 citizens materialized, many
of them parents with small children in tow.
</P>
<P>
   The police, who had declared the rally illegal, used force to
prevent a sound system from being erected, but the crowd peacefully
overwhelmed them and speakers were set up. For more than an hour
the crowd shouted that Milosevic must give up power _ and soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are a lot of us, they will not use force,'' Zoran
Djindjic, the opposition leader who returned from self-imposed
exile two days ago, told the crowd. He fled during the Kosovo war
after he said that paramilitary thugs loyal to Milosevic had
threatened to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be brave. It will be a hot summer, hotter than any summer that
has come before,'' he said, adding that in the next three months he
expects daily demonstrations in cities across Serbia. He also said
he expects the Serbian Orthodox Church, which last month demanded
that Milosevic resign, to join the opposition in calling for a
nationwide general strike.
</P>
<P>
   No speaker said anything to criticize NATO, which during the
Kosovo war, flattened the post office here and destroyed the local
telephone exchange. Nearly all of Uzice, an industrial town of
62,000 people about 120 miles southwest of Belgrade, is still
without phone service. As the crowd gazed Tuesday night at the
rally's speakers, they could see beyond them to the ruins of the
post office. But it was never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bombed us because our wrong politics are not in accord
with the rest of the world,'' said Ljubise Maksimovic, 46, a
railroad foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's rally went silent shortly after it began when
the police unplugged a power cord that ran into a private apartment
facing the town square. The sound system came back on when rally
organizers fired up a gasoline-powered generator.
</P>
<P>
   From the elevated edge of the town square, opposition speakers
shifted back and forth Tuesday night between denouncing Milosevic
for ``shaming'' Serbia and mocking members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, a philosopher and key opposition leader who helped
lead street rallies two years ago that brought tens of thousands of
people in the streets of Belgrade daily for nearly three months,
said, ``In the last 10 years, four times we went into war with
tanks and four times Serbs came back from war on tractors,''
referring to lost wars in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and, this year,
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst ruler in the history of the world.'' Mr.
Djindjic said. ``We will not allow them to provoke a new war _ a
civil war in this country. The maximum that we demand and the
minimum that we will accept, is this: He must go away before new
elections are held.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing the possibility of any negotiations with the
Milosevic regime, an approach advocated by the largest single
Serbian opposition party, Djindjic said, ``It is too late for
negotiations. We don't have time for a transitional government. The
end of this regime is necessary for the survival of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers focused on Marko Milosevic, 25, the president's
son and a well-connected entrepreneur whom American intelligence
officials have said is a major cigarette smuggler in Serbia. This
weekend he opened a private sports theme park called Bambipark,
which he and other investors built during the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is spending $380,000 dollars on Bambipark while we have
columns of Serbian refugees coming back from Kosovo,'' said
Miroslav Martovic, deputy mayor of Uzice, as the crowd whistled and
booed.
</P>
<P>
   Uzice, a city ruled by an opposition coalition since 1996, was
once a prosperous manufacturing town, with copper, aluminum and
car-parts factories.
</P>
<P>
   Before Yugoslavia began to fall apart in 1991, this city was the
country's second largest earner of foreign currency, exporting
goods worth about $100 million a year, according to the mayor,
Milan Nikitovic. Those hard currency earnings, the mayor said, have
slipped to zero this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we export only fog,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Protests boiled over again Tuesday in Leskovac, a town in
Milosevic's traditional base of southern Serbia. About two thousand
protesters clashed with police day in the town, not far from the
border with Kosovo. They were demanding the release of a local
television technician who had been arrested and sentenced to 30
days in jail on Monday for an unusual protest.
</P>
<P>
   The TV employee, Ivan Novkovic, started the ball rolling in
Leskovac on Friday when a large TV audience was watching a
basketball game between Yugoslavia and Germany in the European
championship tournament.
</P>
<P>
   During half-time, Novkovic, who works for TV Leskovac, switched
off regular programming and broadcast a videotape starring himself.
In it, he denounced a local political boss who belongs to the
hard-line Yugoslav Left Party headed by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana
Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   That programming change, which left Novkovic unemployed and
which made him into a national celebrity, ignited the unplanned
demonstration Monday in Leskovac, which mushroomed from a march
against an unpopular local politician into a rowd of 20,000 people.
Local press accounts described the protest as the largest
demonstration calling for the resignation of Milosevic since the
end of the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That crowd, according to local news reports, included many
disgruntled Yugoslav army reservists who fought in Kosovo and who
joined the crowd in shouting, ``Go Away Slobo'' and ``Leskovac is
No Longer Red.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Uzice the adventures of Novkovic in southern Serbia were
seized upon as a sign that popular discontent with Milosevic may
run much deeper than anyone had dared hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man called them on TV and 20,000 people went to the
central square without a single political leader _ that's the real
stuff,'' said Slobodan Vuksanovic, a leader of the Alliance for
Change, the umbrella group that called the rally here and is
organizing a string of demonstrations in small and medium-sized
towns in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a signal that shows what we all know and what we
sometimes forget,'' said Vuksanovic. ``People are sick of
politicians. They desperately need an alternative.''

 &HT;    Texas prisoner escape plays up guard shortage
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas' highest-security prison was short 31
guards when a Dallas murderer escaped last week, and officials said
Tuesday that they are investigating whether the job vacancies could
have been a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they were not, prison officials said the staffing
shortage at the Estelle High-Security Unit near Huntsville
highlights a growing problem throughout the Texas prison system _
too few guards.
</P>
<P>
   At that unit, officials said only 167 of the 198 guard jobs on
three shifts were filled when Clifford Dwayne Jones escaped June 27
by scaling two tall fences and leaping over a third. He was
captured 49 hours later, treed in muddy swamps less than three
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be looking at whether the manpower shortage at
that unit was a factor,'' said A.M. ``Mack'' Stringfellow, a member
of the prison's system's nine-member governing board who is heading
an official investigation of the escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost positive we were above the minimum staffing level
on the day it happened, but the vacancy rates are definitely a
concern there and at almost every other prison in Texas right
now,'' Stringfellow said. ``We are understaffed throughout the
entire system.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoed board Chairman Allan Polunsky: ``Any time you operate at
less than 100 percent you risk problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the shortage of prison guards has increased during
the past year _ a problem that officials attribute to Texas'
booming economy, low pay and less-than-desirable working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great job if you like low pay, bad working conditions,
a foul-smelling work space _ and if you like dangerous criminals
cursing at you all day,'' one Huntsville area guard said after the
escape last week, when he called the Austin American-Statesman to
complain about the chronic staffing shortage. ``It's no wonder the
system is having trouble filling jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Texas' prison agency had 1,068 job openings for
guards _ 5 percent of the number authorized. Currently, 23,755
guards staff posts at the 112 prisons and state-run lockups. Texas'
prison system houses 145,000 convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pay for prison guards is just over $17,724 a year,
$25,524 after 20 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a victim of a good economy,'' said Gary Johnson, prisons
director for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``People are
simply leaving for other jobs that pay more, and even though we're
putting four- to five-hundred new officers a month in training, we
just can't keep up with the attrition rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some large prisons are running up to 80 guards short, Johnson
said, while others are fully staffed. Hardest hit are prisons in
the Palestine and Huntsville areas, and in Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Heightening officials' concern over the vacancies is that the
first of four new prisons just like the Estelle High-Security Unit
are scheduled to open between October and April 2000, adding 792
guard jobs to a hiring list that Johnson and Polunsky say already
is too big.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the record vacancy rate, Johnson and Janie
Cockrell, the prison system's security director, said Tuesday that
all ``primary positions'' _ the guards in convict cellblocks and
dorms, in hallways, in guard towers and manning security doors _
are being manned. Secondary guard jobs _ such as outside work
details _ are going begging at some prisons, they said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Estelle High-Security Unit, Johnson said, ``the escort
officers, the rec yard officers, the outside perimeter officer _
all those posts were manned just like they should have been. Even
if we had full staffing there, I don't think it would have made a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's something we're going to be looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Cockrell said officials have been able to maintain proper
security by paying overtime and juggling vacations. ``This is
really more of a management problem than it is a security
problem,'' Cockrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, to reduce an attrition rate among guards that reached
18 percent last year and is expected to hit 20 percent this year,
officials have launched a vigorous campaign to find new recruits.
In addition to newspaper and radio ads, career days at community
colleges and recruiting trips to military bases, they offer rewards
for employees who recruit new guards.
</P>
<P>
   Posters have even been tacked up at some prisons urging guards
not to resign _ a tactic Johnson said was started after officials
noticed that 30 former guards a day were reapplying with the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salary and stresses of the job are the two biggest
detractors to these jobs,'' said Larry Todd, a prison system
spokesman. ``Just like the ballet is not for everyone, being a
correctional officer is not for everyone.''

SYRIA SIGNALS WILLINGNESS TO REOPEN TALKS WITH ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-BARAK) 
(pr) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Hafez Assad of Syria, in Moscow for the first
time since the end of the Cold War, signaled Tuesday that he might
be ready to rejoin the Middle East peace effort he abandoned after
Benjamin Netanyahu became Israel's Prime Minister in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by Assad and President Boris Yeltsin, the
two leaders said the election of Ehud Barak as prime minister of
Israel opened ``specific opportunities for constructive efforts
towards a comprehensive and just peace'' in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was issued hours after Barak challenged Assad, in
a speech delivered before his swearing-in, to make peace with
Israel ``as quickly as possible.'' Yeltsin and Assad did not
mention that challenge in their remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, told
reporters that no Middle East peace would be possible until Israel
and Syria resumed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East was a key element in Tuesday's meeting, an
effort by Russia and Syria to breathe new life into an alliance
that flourished during the Soviet era but since has withered along
with Moscow's military and political influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   One telling indicator is commerce. In Soviet times, the two
countries conducted more than $1 billion in trade each year. In the
first quarter of 1999, Russian sold Syria only $12 million in
goods, and Syria shipped less than $6 million worth to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday there was every indication that the two nations'
interests dovetailed.
</P>
<P>
   Assad arrived asking for the same things he sought when Leonid
Brezhnev ran the Soviet Union: jets and arms, Moscow's backing in
the struggle with Israel and, perhaps, a scolding for the United
States. Yeltsin, eager to put his military industry to work and
looking for a greater role in world affairs, seemed only too happy
to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   As for the United States, Ivanov said the two men had agreed
that Washington and its allies must not be allowed to impose their
will on other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is reported to be seeking to buy as much as $2 billion in
weaponry, including Russia's new MIG-29 SMT jet fighter, to
modernize a Syrian military equipped almost entirely with aging
Soviet-supplied weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States officially frowns on the sale, and should it
go through, a Federal law penalizing governments that supply lethal
weapons to terrorist countries could require the White House to
suspend some assistance to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is a perennial member of the State Department's annual
list of nations that sponsor international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over weapons purchases have been clouded by another
factor: Syria owes Russia $12 billion, debt accumulated during
Soviet times and never repaid.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin appeared to remove that obstacle Tuesday by ordering
his government's ministries to form a committee to settle the loan
issue.
</P>
<P>
   No weapons deal was concluded Tuesday. But Russian officials
said the two leaders agreed to step up military and technical
cooperation, and Assad is to meet on Wednesday with Russia's
defense minister, Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   Assad wants to buy weapons in part to strengthen his hand if
peace talks with Israel resume. In their statement tonight, Yeltsin
and Assad argued that a peace agreement should satisfy one of
Syria's basic demands, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
southern Lebanon and territory in the Golan Heights that Israel
captured from Syria during the Arab-Israeli war of June 1967.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James P. Hoffa, the new president of the teamsters' union, plans
to hire a respected former federal prosecutor to set up an in-house
anti-corruption program for the 1.4-million-member union _ the
first step in an effort to persuade the federal government to end
its decade-long oversight of the teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Teamster officials said Tuesday that Hoffa had selected Edwin H.
Stier _ who oversaw the cleanup of what was often called the
nation's most corrupt union local _ because of his track record in
working with unions to rid them of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Several teamster officials and labor experts said Hoffa's choice
of a well-known crime fighter showed that he was making a serious
first step toward attacking corruption in a union that was long
viewed as the nation's most mob-dominated. In this way, the labor
experts said, Hoffa appeared to be taking a more sincere
anti-corruption stance than did his father, James P. Hoffa, a
former teamsters president who was widely linked to racketeers and
went to prison after being convicted for fraud and jury tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Szymanski, general counsel of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, said Stier's responsibilities would
include educating the union's members about ethical standards and
training them to investigate allegations of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the union can have true reform unless we show we
can handle our problems in a responsible fashion,'' said Szymanski.
``We have to do that ourselves. It can't be imposed from the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Teamster officials announced Stier's appointment three weeks
after Hoffa wrote the Justice Department to ask it to begin a
dialogue that the union hopes will lead to shrinking and perhaps
ending government oversight of the union. In 1989, the teamsters
agreed to far-reaching government supervision, which included a
court-appointed investigations officer and election monitor, to
settle a federal racketeering lawsuit that charged the union with
being controlled by the mob.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Hoffa wrote, ``The union will assume full
responsibility for proceeding with the reforms which the government
has initiated, obviating the necessity for continued government
supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Szymanski said Hoffa had chosen Stier because the union
president respected Stier's work in rooting out corruption from
Teamsters Local 560, a New Jersey-based local notorious for being
dominated by mobsters. For decades, the 4,400-member local was
controlled by Anthony (Tony Pro) Provenzano, a Mafia boss who was
convicted of murder and who law-enforcement officials say had a
hand in the 1975 disappearance of Hoffa's father.
</P>
<P>
   Stier, who once headed New Jersey's Division of Criminal
Justice, said he was taking the job because he was convinced that
Hoffa was serious about attacking corruption _ although one
prominent union faction, Teamsters for a Democratic Union, has
insisted Hoffa has links to criminal elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that I've seen and heard,'' Stier said, ``suggests
to me that he is completely serious about dealing effectively with
corruption and dealing with it in an even-handed way that doesn't
just go after his political enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   As trustee of Local 560 for 12 years, Stier had more than a
dozen officials removed or expelled for misconduct including having
ties to organized crime. He often braved threats against him, he
helped restore the welfare and pension fund to financial health,
and he worked closely with the FBI to uncover corruption in the
local.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Judge Harold A. Ackerman of the U.S. District Court
in Newark lifted the trusteeship, confident that Stier had rid
Local 560 of criminal elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Local 560 experiment was about transforming the
culture of a union from tolerance of racketeering to one of
rejection of racketeering,'' Stier said in a telephone interview
while vacationing in Brussels. ``I think a lot of the strategies
that I used over the last 12 years in helping the local transform
itself will be useful for the whole international union.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in New York who is the Justice
Department official in charge of monitoring the teamsters, declined
to comment on the appointment of Stier or about Hoffa's call to end
federal supervision.
</P>
<P>
   In the past she has said she looked forward to working wth Hoffa
to insure progress in cleaning up the union. She has also said the
fight against corruption in the teamsters is not complete,
considering that over the past few years more than 200 teamster
officials or members have been removed or pressured to resign after
facing corruption charges from a court-appointed review board.
</P>
<P>
   Several labor experts applauded Hoffa's appointment of Stier.
``I don't think he could have picked a better person for the job,''
said Linda Kaboolian, an associate professor of labor relations at
Harvard's Kennedy School of government. ``Compared with other
trusteeships, he stands out head and shoulders above everyone else
for the way he conducted the trusteeship and the results he got.''
</P>
<P>
   But some labor relations experts questioned whether Hoffa might
be appointing Stier less to clean up the union than to impress the
government that Hoffa was putting in place his own anti-corruption
program. Richard Hurd, a Cornell University professor of labor
relations, asked whether Hoffa might someday fire Stier, the way
President Richard Nixon once fired the special prosecutor Archibald
Cox, if Stier's anticorruption mechanism targets Hoffa or his close
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naming Stier is the kind of thing you'd expect a reformer to
do, not the kind of thing you'd expect someone who had questionable
intentions,'' Hurd said. ``I'm reluctant to say this is proof that
Hoffa is serious, but it's certainly a positive sign. The truth
will be in how it plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stier said that he expected his title to be special counsel and
that he would quit if he grew convinced that Hoffa was not serious
about fighting corruption or was undercutting him. He said he could
not give details of his plans because he still has to work many
things out with the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective,'' Stier said, ``is when there is an allegation
against anybody at whatever level _ and that includes the executive
board _ then that allegation will be thoroughly and impartially
investigated and if it's found to be true, the members of the union
and the people in power, even if it's an ally of theirs, will view
that as a betrayal and not just a guy doing what comes natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Stier, 59, once worked as director of the criminal division for
the U.S. attorney in Newark and for five years was head of the
organized crime division in the office of the New Jersey attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Brandt, a spokesman for Rep. Pete Hoekstra, a Michigan
Republican who heads the Oversight Subcommittee of the House
Education and the Workforce Committee which has held many hearings
on teamsters scandals, said, ``As long as Stier is given the
freedom that he needs to do his job then this is a very positive
step forward for the teamsters.''

CLINTON PRESSES CALL FOR INVESTMENT IN POOR COMMUNITIES

</P>
<P>
   EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. _ Normally, the only presidential attention
drawn by a new Walgreens would come from the local head of the
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But in this distressed Mississippi River city, President Clinton
on Tuesday toured a month-old drugstore that is the largest retail
store to be built here in 40 years, calling it proof that private
investment can rally not only businesses but entire communities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his delegation of corporate chiefs and Cabinet
members traveled up the Mississippi Valley, from the impoverished
flatlands of the Mississippi Delta to this struggling town as they
continued their tour of hard-pressed regions left out of the
nation's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Americans benefit when all Americans work,'' Clinton told
1,000 people gathered outside the Walgreens.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the president's emphasis on private-sector
investment, the Bank of America announced it was creating a $500
million Catalyst Fund to invest in projects in economically
depressed areas around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Bessant, president of community development for Bank of
America, said the fund would be just what its name implies, ``a
catalyst for our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America also helped finance the construction of the
Walgreens here.
</P>
<P>
   And, Walgreens' President David Bernauer announced that the drug
chain would build 400 more stores nationwide, many of them in
impoverished areas, and add 10,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walgreens is very committed to serving Americans in every type
of neighborhood,'' Bernauer said.
</P>
<P>
   This small city of 38,000 located across the Mississippi River
from St. Louis, Mo., was once a thriving shipping community
dominated by stockyards and meat-packing companies. But as the jobs
disappeared so did the people. Its population declined 45 percent
in 25 years. The jobless rate, at 9.6 percent, is twice the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a lure to potential businesses, Clinton also touted a
new Department of Housing and Urban Development report that claims
people living in inner cities have about $8.7 billion in potential
purchasing power and that this spending potential far outstrips
retail sales in their areas.
</P>
<P>
   The survey compared the estimated purchasing power with the
amount of retail sales in a city. The gap exists, the HUD report
said, because some poorer communities are dramatically underserved
by retail stores and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that nationwide, residents in poor, inner-city
neighborhoods earn 25 percent more money than they spend in their
neighborhoods. In Los Angeles the gap is 35 percent, and in East
St. Louis it is 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As he has throughout the trip, Clinton promoted his New Markets
Initiative, a mixture of tax incentives for corporate investment
and government assistance, to encourage the economic revival of
areas long burdened by poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing that we encourage people to invest
in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, but they ought to have
the same incentives to invest in the Mississippi Delta and
Appalachia and the Native American reservations and the inner
cities,'' Clinton said to cheers at an earlier stop in Clarksdale,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   In Clarksdale, Clinton toured a section of the small downtown
where shops, restaurants and a movie theater have been shuttered
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-six years ago, on Friday and Saturday, this place was
crawling with people _ it was shoulder-to-shoulder,'' said Mayor
Richard Webster. But as agriculture and other industries became
more mechanized, laborers lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to bring back a different type of labor _ bring
back tourism,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   But there also were signs of success. Clinton toured the
Waterfield Cabinet plant that was reopened after being in
bankruptcy. He also heard from several area business owners who
struggled to get the investments they needed to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in America has a selfish interest now in developing
the Delta. Why? Because most economists believe that if we're going
to keep our economic recovery going without inflation, the only way
we can possibly do it is to find more customers for our products
and then add more workers at home,'' Clinton told several hundred
people sweltering in the cabinet-making plant, which lacks air
conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   While in Clarksdale, the president announced $46.5 million in
community development grants, including $15 million for the
Mississippi Delta, where, he said, poverty and unemployment rates
far exceed national averages.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America's Bessant and Richard Huber, chairman of Aetna,
have spent the week traveling with Clinton to Kentucky, Mississippi
and Illinois, and both support the New Markets Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're ever going to get a few of these areas jump-started
it has to be now,'' Huber said, praising Clinton's initiative for
``having some rationale'' behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all the incentives in the world and if there
isn't economic reality to draw investors, it isn't going to
happen,'' Huber said. But he said the historically poor regions
provide an untapped market for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's real money to be made in these markets,'' Bessant
said. But she said those regions also are a hard sell to investors,
which is why government incentive programs are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of incentives really attract private sector
investments that otherwise might not be interested,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will continue the tour today with a visit to the Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and a visit to a
Mexican-food factory in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The president was to end his trip Thursday in Los Angeles but
now may stay in California through Saturday to watch the United
States squad play in the women's World Cup soccer match.

CLINTON URGES RETAIL DEVELOPMENT IN POVERTY AREAS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. _ Midway through his four-day anti-poverty
tour across America, President Clinton came to this small,
struggling city of 38,000 people along the Mississippi River
Tuesday to hail the opening of a Walgreens drug store, an event
that usually does not prompt a presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   But the store is the largest retail establishment built here
since the 1950s, and to Clinton it is a shining example of the
profit-making opportunities in low- and moderate-income inner-city
neighborhoods for businesses willing to locate there.
</P>
<P>
   Standing atop a makeshift stage on the parking lot of the
glittering new store, Clinton said, ``We see in this community both
poverty and great promise.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're all going to have to work hard at this.
Nobody's got all the answers. There is no magic wand. But we know
one thing: people make these investments one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came armed with a new federal study by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development that shows such communities are
``under-retailed,'' meaning sales fall significantly short of the
residents' retail purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   The HUD report, titled ``New Markets: The Untapped Retail Buying
Power in America's Inner Cities,'' said the retail purchasing power
of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods was estimated at $331
billion last year, or one-third of the $1.1 trillion total for the
central cities that include those neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Among 48 inner-city areas where HUD found a retail gap and where
20 percent or more of the population lives in poverty, the total
shortfall last year was $8.7 billion, which equals the purchasing
power minus sales.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Optional graf grim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of those areas, six were in Massachusetts _ Gloucester, Lowell,
New Bedford, Waltham, Westfield and Yarmouth. The study showed
Westfield with the biggest gap between the purchasing power of its
residents and retail sales, 22.7 percent, while Gloucester had the
least at 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(End optional trim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge buying power among inner-city residents, the
study said they often must make purchases in such places as
suburban malls because there are too few retail stores in their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In this city where the unemployment rate last year was 9.6
percent, more than twice the national average, and the poverty rate
is 44.3 percent, even a Walgreens store that employs about two
dozen people is considered good news.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest stop on Clinton's six-state tour of poverty
areas to promote greater public and private investment in urban and
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with a small band of corporate CEOs and members of
Congress and his Cabinet, Clinton is touting these areas as a way
to keep the economy strong through job creation and lowering of
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``America needs to wake up and recognize that the best new

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As New York City sagged Tuesday under a second day of
record high temperatures, city officials said that as many as three
people had died from heat-related illnesses, and the region
continued to struggle with maddening power failures that trapped
people in stifling elevators, cut air-conditioning to thousands of
homes and buildings, and knocked out some subway service as safety
signals suddenly flicked off.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulance crews responded Tuesday to more than 130 calls from
people complaining of cramps and exhaustion from the heat, and
emergency officials said the heat may have contributed to several
heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first confirmed heat-related death, an autopsy Tuesday
revealed that Julia Johnson, 79, of Manhattan, had died of
hyperthermia on Monday, said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the
city's chief medical examiner. Mrs. Johnson was found unconscious
at home by a health care worker.
</P>
<P>
   Her body temperature was 108.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said two other people may have died from
the heat. They were described as a 40-year-old man whose Brooklyn
home had a temperature in excess of 108, and a 27-year-old man who
died at Interfaith Hospital in Brooklyn. Names were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Summer school was canceled in Washington, the lights were dimmed
in much of the Massachusetts Statehouse and block captains checked
on the elderly in Philadelphia's row houses. But relief was in
sight, the National Weather Service promised, with lower
temperatures forecast for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said, ``This is one of the more difficult days the city
has ever had in regard to heat.'' He canceled a political
fund-raising trip to Nantucket to deal with the heat emergency.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that while they expected the death toll to
climb, they were confident it would come nowhere near the hundreds
of deaths the city of Chicago experienced during a brutal heat wave
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``That number might grow a bit, but certainly it will not
approach what happened in the Midwest,'' said Jerome Hauer,
director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave _ combined with record demands for electricity _
put enormous pressure on the region's power system. Transformers
overheated and burst into flames. Power lines melted through from
the heat and high usage. In the dense humidity, bolts of
electricity arced across power lines, causing short circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Utility companies first issued urgent appeals for customers to
conserve energy. Later, to ease the strain on power lines and
transformers and because of ``insufficient'' power reserves, the
companies reduced their voltage output by 5 percent. Even so, power
failures were reported throughout New York City, Long Island,
Westchester County, and New Jersey and Connecticut. At least 55,000
people were affected.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene McGrath, chairman of Con Edison, blamed power failures on
equipment breakdowns, not on the power cutback. ``Those problems
come about from the cables overheating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani scolded Con Edison officials for not giving city
officials more explicit warnings about the extent of the power
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Con Ed is its own entity unto itself and sometimes they notify
us late and sometimes they notify us only when the problem has
already started,'' the mayor said. ``I think it's a cause of great
frustration, for me and my administration and every other mayor
that's ever had this job. They call you about 10 minutes before
there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Weather Service, the temperature in
Central Park reached 101 degrees at 3:11 p.m. Tuesday, breaking the
old record of 98 degrees set in 1986. Temperatures were expected to
moderate this week as a cool front moved through the region Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   As New York City activated its emergency operations center
Tuesday, Giuliani appealed for residents to avoid strenuous
activity and stay indoors near fans and air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember hotter days than the last several and
particularly hotter nights,'' he said at a City Hall press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like everyone to be very, very careful.''

BRITISH TELEPHONE COMPANY ORDERED TO UPGRADE AND OPEN UP TO
COMPETITION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: France, Japan)    By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Already under pressure from rival telephone and cable
operators, British Telecommunications PLC was ordered by regulators
Tuesday to upgrade its huge local network and to open it to
competitors by July 2001. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The British telephone giant, which is known as BT, controls
about 85 percent of the ``local loop'' copper network used by home
subscribers and small businesses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's directive from the Office of Telecommunications, a
government watchdog, reflected the rapidly intensifying competition
in Britain and other parts of Europe to bring high-speed Internet
access and other so-called broadband services to homes and offices.
</P>
<P>
   But it also highlighted the difficult situation facing the
former state monopoly: competition is likely to accelerate the
growth of the high-speed market, but it could also reduce British
Telecom's slice of it. Still, the company's shares rose 42 pence,
or 3.8 percent, in London trading to 1,151 pence ($18.04). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cable operators like Telewest Communications PLC and NTL Inc.
already offer telephone services along with cable television, while
rivals including MCI Worldcom of the United States and Energis PLC
are pressing for access to British Telecom's local networks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Edmonds, the head of Oftel, as the Office of
Telecommunications is known, said in a statement that ``with
concentrated work by the industry and successful trials concluded
by the end of 2000, I am confident competing operators can have
direct access to BT's network by July 1, 2001.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, competitors ``should have the ability to roll
out their own technology,'' adding that ``they should not have to
wait for BT to make decisions that determine the timetable for the
rolling-out of new services.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   British Telecommunications, Britain's second-largest telephone
company after Vodafone Airtouch PLC, gave a lukewarm response to
the idea of permitting its competitors access to its networks for
their technology.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BT has argued that it should use its own technology and then
bill its rivals for access. Oftel's directive favored rivals that
seek to install their own technology once local networks have been
upgraded to permit much higher speeds for telephone, data and other
services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, British Telecommunications said it had placed a
``multimillion-pound order'' for equipment from Alcatel SA of
France and Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan, enabling it to enhance 400 of its
2,800 exchanges _ catering to some six million households and
businesses _ using what is called asymmetric digital
subscriber-line technology. The technology creates digital channels
for Internet access and multimedia services at much higher speed
than are now available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   British Telecommunications said the use of its rivals'
technology ``raises significant technical and security issues which
will need to be evaluated.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement drew a sharp response from Michael Butler, MCI
Worldcom's managing director in Britain. ``If implementing
competition proves `too difficult,' we might as well all go home,''
he said. &QL;

WITH A.C. AT A PREMIUM, POWER UTILITIES SET DEMAND RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (With NY-HEAT) 
 (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Electric companies from here to Maine were
stretched so thin Tuesday by demand from millions of air
conditioners that they breathed a sigh of relief when the weather
broke, even though the break was in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news; they'll have a little more to send us,'' said
William J. Balet, executive director of the New York Power Pool, a
consortium of the state's power generators and users that imports
and exports power to and from utilities outside the state based on
supply, demand and price. The pool also helps coordinate power
production within the state.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities in the eastern United States set new records for
demand Tuesday. Most of those utilities were able to squeak through
on available supplies that they produced or imported, although
electric companies in New York state and a broad area to the south
cut voltage, and some neighborhoods in New York City, Long Island,
central New Jersey and elsewhere lost all power, mostly because the
distribution lines and transformers overheated.
</P>
<P>
   In all, hundreds of thousands of people lost power for at least
part of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The peaks in demand for electricity are getting ever higher,
experts say, because all new commercial buildings and most new
houses have air conditioning, and air conditioning is being added
to older houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People left their air conditioners on for four consecutive
days, day and night,'' said Ron Morano, a spokesman for General
Public Utilities, in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Many utilities called on customers to shut off nonessential
appliances; the New England Power Pool avoided voltage cuts but
asked the governors of each of the six states in the region to
appeal to the public for conservation.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Potomac Electric Power Co., known as Pepco,
warned on its Web site that people should curtail consumption to
prevent a ``complete failure of the electric power grid.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pepco, like other utilities, made do with voltage
reductions. Such reductions make electric motors run a bit slower
and make the picture shrink slightly on computer and television
screens, but generally do not hurt computers or other energy-using
appliances. The same cannot be said in cases where power is cut
completely, when computers can crash and data can be lost.
</P>
<P>
   The three major power pools in the northeast all set new demand
records Tuesday: the New York Power Pool, the New England Power
Pool and the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, which
covers most of Pennsylvania and all of New Jersey, Maryland,
Delaware and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   To meet demand, utility officials imported power from Ontario,
Quebec and the Canadian Maritimes, among other sources.
</P>
<P>
   All reported having much less generating capacity in reserve
than they are accustomed to. That left them vulnerable to ``load
shedding'' (their preferred term for blackouts) if they lost a
single big generating station or transmission line.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All said that in areas where power was deregulated, electricity
was trading at a price 10 to 20 times higher than normal, near
$1,000 a megawatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Such extreme prices are so far a wholesale phenomenon, but some
energy economists think that they should make their way into
pricing for factories and other big customers, to encourage them to
close up and send employees home on the hottest days, moderating
the demand peaks and reducing the number of plants built to supply
power only a few days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Already, many utilities offer big customers an ``interruptible''
rate, giving them lower prices for most of the year, in exchange
for being allowed to cut them off on days like Tuesday. And
Tuesday, they all got shut down.

 &HT;    Delta worst for bumping
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines has achieved the dubious distinction
of leading the industry in bumping passengers off flights.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's rate of involuntary passenger bumpings soared in the
first three months of the year, leaving the carrier at the bottom
of the industry for its management of overbooked flights. The
Atlanta-based airline reported 8,144 involuntary bumpings in
January-March, almost as many as the other nine major airlines
combined. Delta reported 13,449 involuntary bumpings for all of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's rate of involuntary bumpings was 3.33 per 10,000
passengers in the first quarter, worst in the industry, according
to government figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary bumpings occur when airlines overbook flights to
ward against no-shows, then can't get enough passengers to
volunteer to be bumped to a later flight. Volunteers usually get
credit toward a future trip.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny fraction of air travelers are involuntarily bumped, but a
longtime consumer advocate says aggressive overbooking contributes
to broader problems that have made airline service a subject of
congressional debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things that causes not huge delays but
annoying delays and tension while things are worked out,'' said Ed
Perkins, former editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers held off flights against their wishes are eligible
for as much as $400 in compensation under U.S. Transportation
Department rules.
</P>
<P>
   Voluntary service guidelines recently adopted by the airline
industry include a general pledge of ``fairness and consistency''
in handling bumped passengers, but no specific measures.
</P>
<P>
   The government tracks bumping as part of its periodic Air Travel
Consumer Report, which lists comparative passenger service
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has recently improved its standing in other categories:
on-time performance, lost baggage and formal consumer complaints to
the Transportation Department. It's ranked among the leaders in all
three categories over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But a high rate of involuntary bumping has become a nagging
problem for the carrier, which handles 80 percent of the passenger
traffic at Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Delta executives have promised fixes for more than a year, but
new computer programs to help manage overbooking were delayed and
won't be in use until later this year, spokesman Bill Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot sickout at American Airlines last winter may have
contributed to the spike as Delta tried to accommodate last-minute
passengers stranded by its rival, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want to use excuses,'' Berry said. ``The hard fact
is we're by no means satisfied, and we have a high-level team
working on changes.'' The team reports directly to Chief Executive
Leo Mullin, Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said overbooking to prevent against financial losses
caused by no-shows ``is a real balancing act for airlines.'' But an
airline with an unusually high rate of involuntary bumpings ``can
instantly solve it by backing off on the numbers they overbook.
It's totally within their control,'' Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of airline bumpings are voluntary. Delta
reported 54,835 voluntary bumpings in the first quarter, second to
American with 70,213.
</P>
<P>
   American, however, reported only 848 involuntary bumpings, about
one-tenth Delta's number.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said the disparity suggests American either offers
better incentives or does most of its overbooking on routes
dominated by leisure fliers, who are more willing than business
fliers to volunteer to be bumped.

 ICANN NO MASTER OF ITS INTERNET DOMAIN  &HT;     By JON SWARTZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
ICANN or I can't?
<P>
   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers _ a
nonprofit concern created to relieve the federal government of the
task of dispensing Web addresses _ has been anything but master of
its own domain names.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of planning, haggling and negotiations by
government officials, computer geeks and private businesses, ICANN
was supposed to break Network Solutions Inc.'s monopoly for
registering domain names ending in .com, .net and .org. Beginning
in late June, ICANN was to delegate naming rights to America
Online, France Telecom and three other high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the plan as of a month ago, before infighting
delayed the plan until at least July 16. Now, there is a power
struggle between NSI, which appears reluctant to relinquish
control, and ICANN, which has drawn accusations of making major
policy decisions behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mess,'' acknowledged Christopher Clough, a spokesman
for NSI in Herndon, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from consumer advocate Ralph Nader to the
ultra-conservative Americans for Tax Reform have taken pot shots at
the arrangement, and many are singling out ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   ``ICANN is a mushy, disorganized hodgepodge of an
organization,'' said Naseem Javed, president of ABC Namebank
International, a brand-name consulting company in New York and
frequent critic of ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem to have the proper hierarchy or people,''
Javed said. ``Basically, it's a team of 10 people responsible for
assigning 10,000 names a day. At $70 per name, that's a
multimillion-dollar business.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, meanwhile, are distressed by ICANN's secrecy that
led to such decisions as imposing a $1 per domain name registration
fee for administrative use. That backroom decision would create
within a year a $5.9 million fund for ICANN. (The previous group in
charge of administering domain names, IANA, had an annual budget of
$500,000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Such decisions likely exceed the authority that (the
government) originally contemplated for ICANN,'' U.S. Rep. Thomas
Bliley Jr., R-Va., said in a scathing June 22 letter to ICANN
Chairman Esther Dyson. ``Rather than promote the Internet's
evolution, your organization's policies actually may jeopardize''
its growth.
</P>
<P>
   There are even rumblings inside the Beltway that Congress will
conduct hearings on ICANN and call Dyson to testify, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding matters, hackers broke into ICANN's computer servers
for several hours Friday, diverting traffic from its Web site to
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But ICANN's harshest detractor is NSI _ which, of course, has
its own ax to grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disturbing that ICANN is making major policy decisions
behind closed-door meetings,'' Clough said.
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue that Clough is describing his own company. NSI,
benefiting from a federal contract and boasting a board sprinkled
with military-industrial types, is worth nearly $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview from London, Dyson admitted that ICANN made
mistakes but said it has improved. The Los Angeles group holds
public hearings before its quarterly board meetings and posts the
text of its resolutions online (www.icann.org). It also is
hammering out a plan to select new board members.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson dismisses ICANN's critics as NSI mouthpieces who are part
of a scheme to gum up the transition of power. She said furor over
the $1 fee, for example, is their most outlandish gripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use a national park, there is a $1 fee; if you use the
Internet, there should be a $1 fee,'' Dyson said. ``It is a minimal
tax but small compared to NSI, which charges $35 per year for
registration fees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Despite the acrimony, Dyson clearly is extending the olive
branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to work with NSI; it would make everyone's life
much simpler,'' Dyson said. ``We're not trying to create a mess. We
really are not the bad guys. We're trying to create competition to
a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That, everyone agrees, eventually will benefit consumers. More
choices ultimately will result in cheaper registration fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a wake-up call,'' Javed said. ``E-commerce will
eventually be a $1 trillion business worldwide, and an organization
like ICANN needs to harness it.''
</P>
<P>
   LET THE BIDDING BEGIN: The domain-name business has been good to
Alexis Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen recently sold the rights to Mall.com, which he acquired
for pocket change in 1992, to an online shopping portal in Austin,
Texas, for at least $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of NETFILES () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``I didn't really plan to sell it, but I got an incredible
offer,'' said Rosen, founder of Panix of New York, one of the first
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen also is one of the lucky cybersquatters. While other
individuals have been either sued or vilified by corporations over
the rights to Web addresses with trademarked names, Rosen made a
small fortune because he bought the rights to a generic title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps I had a foolish notion that the Net was for
educational _ not commercial _ purposes,'' Rosen said. ``If I was
in this for the money, I could have registered several thousand
(well-known domain) names and made $500 million.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he'll settle for a healthy quarter-million dollars.

NOT-GUILTY PLEA IN SLAYING A SURPRISE TO FAMILY AND LAWYER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Israel)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A plea of not guilty by a Maryland man facing a
murder charge in Israel has produced anger and frustration in
Montgomery County, Md., where the crime was committed two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   After assuring the Israeli Supreme Court that he would plead
guilty if he were not extradited to the United States, the
defendant, Samuel Sheinbein, unexpectedly entered a not-guilty plea
on Monday in a lower court in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein, 18, and a friend, Aaron Needle, are accused of
strangling a classmate, Alfredo Enrique Tello Jr., then burning and
mutilating his body to cover up the crime. Needle hanged himself in
a jail cell 15 months ago, just before his trial was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid prosecution in the United States, where he faced life
in prison without chance of parole, Sheinbein fled to Israel, where
he had never lived, claiming citizenship by virtue of his father's
birth there in 1944. In fighting extradition, his lawyer told the
Israeli Supreme Court in February that Sheinbein would admit to the
killing if he could stand trial in Israel, where a conviction would
bring a lesser penalty and the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Gansler, the Montgomery County state's attorney, who
has been working with the Israeli authorities on the case, said in
an interview Tuesday that the change in plea caught him by surprise
and could result in a chance for Sheinbein to win acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Sheinbein's plan to fight the charges would
put enormous pressure on Israeli prosecutors to mount a convincing
case before the three-judge panel that will preside over the trial,
scheduled to begin in October. With virtually all the evidence and
witnesses in Maryland, he said, Israeli prosecutors have only
passing familiarity with details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has manipulated the judicial system of Israel to his
advantage,'' Gansler said of the defendant, predicting that, if
convicted, Sheinbein would be sentenced to no more than 20 years in
prison, a term that could be reduced to as few as 11 years if the
defendant pleaded a form of insanity defense known in Israel as
diminished responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens,'' Gansler added, ``it pales in comparison to
the crime as a torturous murder.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court ruling, the Israeli Parliament repealed
the extradition law, lifting a ban and allowing Israeli citizens
who are not residents to face prosecution abroad for crimes
committed abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The not-guilty plea also caught the victim's mother off-guard.
Eric Dawes, a banker from Silver Spring, Md., who is engaged to
marry Tello's mother, Eliette Ramos, said she was ``bummed out,
exhausted and frustrated'' by Sheinbein's latest judicial
maneuverings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her son was brutally murdered, and she has no way for
closure,'' Dawes said. ``It has been one charade after another. She
feels no sense of justice. She is more than frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said his chief concern now was helping the Israeli
prosecutor, Hadassah Naor, build her case, given the limitations of
distance, money and language.
</P>
<P>
   Had the trial been held in Maryland, Gansler said, he was
prepared to call as many as 80 witnesses who would have weaved
together evidence showing that Sheinbein had engaged in what
Maryland prosecutors say was a ``thrill kill,'' by strangling Tello
in a car after picking him up from his job at a shopping center on
Sept. 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said prosecutors had also collected forensic and genetic
evidence, as well as handwriting samples, to show premeditation.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein's lawyer, David Libai, a former Israeli justice
minister, told the Tel Aviv court that his client would only admit
to picking up Tello and that the victim's body was moved, cut up
and burned. He said Sheinbein would not admit to any part of the
killing, a suggestion that Needle played the leading role in the
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   But Gansler said he had evidence that Sheinbein confessed the
murder to his father and his brother. In Israel, however, parents
and siblings of a defendant, like spouses, are not required to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   He also doubted whether there was enough time before the
scheduled start of the trial for Israeli prosecutors to organize a
complete case. He said that Ms. Naor spoke ``little English'' and
that all the documents her office had shared with the authorities
in Montgomery County were written in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler also expressed concern about the Israelis' promise to
pay costs of litigation, which will undoubtedly include
transportation and hotel expenses for witnesses. He predicted the
cost could reach as much as $500,000. But an unsatisfied request by
his office for $14,000 to cover costs incurred over the year
following Sheinbein's flight to Israel has left him wondering about
their commitment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what's going to happen next?'' Gansler said. ``This
is going to be a logistical nightmare. We could try the case here
tomorrow. They say they have a trial date of Oct. 10 and it will
take about a week. I think that's highly unrealistic.''

 BIOTECH LEERY OF CLINTON'S MEDICARE DRUG PROPOSAL  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;        c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
On its surface, President Clinton's proposal to add a drug benefit
to Medicare would seem to give the biotech sector a boost, making
more money available for new remedies.
<P>
   But industry lobbyists are leery of the plan's nuances, and even
more fearful of what might happen as Congress has its say on a
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed last week that Medicare pay half of a senior's
prescription drug bill _ up to a limit. The annual cap would start
at $2,000 in 2002 and rise to $5,000 in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech lobbyists want Clinton to take an entirely different
approach. Let seniors pay for the first $1,000 or $2,000 in
prescriptions. Once their spending exceeds this deductible, let
Medicare kick in to pay the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the seniors spending $10,000 to $20,000 a year on
medications who have the most dire need,'' said Walter Moore,
Genentech's lobbyist in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the biotech industry is motivated partly by
self-interest. Biotech-created drugs tend to cost thousands of
dollars a year, so the industry would rather have catastrophic care
coverage than a payment cap with no deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is one case in which industry's position may coincide
with the needs of the sickest and poorest Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton's proposal is enacted, thousands of seniors
would exceed the Medicare drug cap and find themselves right where
they are today: unable to pay for their medications and without
government help. So why would Clinton opt for such a ``cap out''?
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the financial and political realities, said Carl
Feldbaum, president of the industry trade group called BIO.
</P>
<P>
   To finance his drug plan without bankrupting Medicare, Clinton
had to propose that seniors pay a monthly premium starting at $24
in 2002 and rising to $44 in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Because it would be tough to persuade seniors to pay for a
benefit with a high deductible, political expediency demanded that
the president offer to pay 50 cents on the first dollar in drug
costs _ even if that meant imposing a $1,000 to $2,500 cap on this
government help.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly looking to appeal to the broadest electorate
possible, by giving everyone at least a little benefit,'' Feldbaum
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Pete Stark, D-Hayward, have
authored a Medicare drug benefit bill far more generous than
Clinton's proposal. Under this plan, once seniors satisfied a $200
deductible, Medicare would cover 80 percent of their drug expenses.
Once their drug costs exceeded $3,000, Medicare would pay the
entire bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kennedy and Stark haven't yet put a price on their
proposal, BIO lobbyist Chuck Ludlam called it ``vastly too
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry likes one aspect of the plan. ``We'd like the
catastrophic part of the Kennedy-Stark bill grafted onto the
Clinton proposal,'' Feldbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   FEAR AND LOATHING? On the subject of Medicare and drugs, another
bill floating around Washington, D.C., has industry quivering in
its lab coat.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, has authored legislation that would
force drugmakers to offer steep discounts on all prescriptions sold
to Medicare beneficiaries. The discounts, amounting to roughly 24
percent of the drug's wholesale price, would pertain regardless of
whether the government, a private insurer or the patient paid the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has imposed similar price controls on
drugs sold through the Medicaid program since 1990, said Moore, the
Genentech lobbyist. Medicaid patients buy 10 to 15 percent of the
nation's drugs. Medicare patients buy another 30 to 40 percent.
Private insurers buy the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Industry is adamant that the price controls on Medicaid not be
extended to Medicare's larger client population. They argue that
price controls on Medicare drugs will make it harder to recoup the
high cost of developing new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must oppose (price controls) to the death,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's bill has six Bay Area co-sponsors, all Democrats. They
are: Stark, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, Rep. Barbara Lee of
Oakland, Rep. George Miller of Martinez, Rep. Lynn Woolsey of
Petaluma and Rep. Tom Lantos of Hillsborough.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lobbyists worry that Allen's price-control language
might get inserted into one of the Medicare drug benefit bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of bashing drug companies is quite delicious in
Washington, D.C.,'' said Moore, adding that ``some Democrats have
identified Medicare drug benefits as a wedge issue'' to get seniors
out to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Others scoff at the notion that drug benefits and price controls
are issues cooked up for election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members have been hearing consistently of the enormous
difficulty seniors are having keeping up with the cost of
medications,'' said an aide to Stark. She added that although
industry argues that price controls would squelch the flow of R&AMP;D
money into research, ``we haven't seen any evidence of this.''

DONOR IMPLICATES MEXICAN PARTY IN SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A financier who recently disclosed that he was a
donor of large sums to President Ernesto Zedillo's presidential
campaign before he broke with the governing party and fled Mexico
now says that senior party officials conspired with him in 1994 to
arrange $4 million in illegal donations to the Zedillo campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The financier, Carlos Cabal Peniche, said senior aides to
Zedillo put pressure on him during the 1994 campaign to direct his
troubled banks to pay for $4 million worth of Zedillo-for-President
posters and other expenses. The Zedillo campaign sent him invoices
and his banks paid the bills, Cabal said.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions, as Cabal outlined them, would have violated
campaign finance laws prohibiting donations by banks, election
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal made his assertions in a written response to questions
passed to him in an Australian prison by a reporter for The New
York Times. He is battling a Mexican request that Australia
extradite him to face fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians Tuesday expressed special outrage over
Cabal's assertions that Zedillo's aides were pressing banks for
huge donations even though the government knew that the banks were
sliding into bankruptcy. The Zedillo administration was eventually
forced to provide $4 billion in taxpayer funds to restore the bank
to solvency.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's spokesman denied Cabal's assertions, as did the
current chairman of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But the president and his party have blocked all outside
scrutiny of the party's 1994 campaign finances. And although
Cabal's credibility is in question because he has been charged with
financial fraud amounting to $700 million, he made public Tuesday,
though a spokesman, several canceled checks and receipts issued by
the party that appear to confirm some of the apparently illegal
payments he described.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year after Zedillo's inauguration in 1994, the first of
several businessmen reported donations to the campaign that were
not included in party reports. But the Zedillo administration has
blocked opposition attempts to organize investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI and the government are fighting to keep these matters
secret because we're discovering how they used the banks like the
party's own funding agencies,'' said Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,
who filed a complaint during his tenure as head of an opposition
party, the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition legislators said Tuesday that Cabal's assertions
would aggravate a dispute with the Zedillo administration over the
government's handling of the records from Cabal's banks, an issue
that some lawmakers say is heading toward a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are serious charges,'' Luis Felipe Bravo Mena, head of
the center-right National Action Party, said Tuesday. ``What Cabal
is saying about political donations are sufficiently believable
that the public needs a full accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the Mexican Congress and the Zedillo
administration centers on the work of a Canadian auditor contracted
by Congress to investigate Mexico's $80 billion banking bailout.
</P>
<P>
   The auditor, Michael Mackey, has requested that the government
turn over documents from Cabal's banks, Banco Union and Banca
Cremi, related to the campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the Treasury Ministry formally refused to release
documents from Cabal's banks, citing banking law secrecy
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Fauzi Hamdan Amad, the chairman of the congressional committee
overseeing the audits, said a law passed in December obligated
political parties to forfeit any money they had received from banks
that were later rescued with taxpayer funds and waived the bank
secrecy provisions. He ordered the government to turn over
documents related to such transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Antonio Gonzalez Fernandez, the governing party's chairman,
acknowledged in an interview that Cabal had donated $15 million to
a party trust fund in 1993 and the equivalent of $294,000 to the
Zedillo campaign in 1994. But he denied that Cabal had arranged $4
million in payments to the campaign by his banks.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Lerdo de Tejada, Zedillo's spokesman, also denied that
the Zedillo campaign had received more than the $294,000 donation.
``We reject these new claims by Mr. Cabal,'' Lerdo said. ``He's
just playing a game to avoid extradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabal said the party official who had requested that he make the
illegal donations was Oscar Espinosa Villareal, the party's finance
secretary. In an interview, Espinosa, who today is Mexico's Tourism
Secretary, acknowledged that he had met with Cabal to solicit
donations, but denied having urged Cabal to instruct his banks to
make direct payments to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the Colosio and Zedillo campaigns were meticulous in
setting up mechanisms that adhered strictly to the law,'' Espinosa
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Espinosa appeared to misrepresent the status of a committee
called the National Committee for Financing and Patrimony
Strengthening, to which Cabal paid several large checks, insisting
that it was a private organization with no formal ties to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   The checks that Cabal provided copies of Tuesday were Banco
Union checks written to the party. Cabal also provided the receipts
for those checks sent to the bank by the committee. The receipts
identify the committee as an arm of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Cabal was a rising star among the party's
business supporters, and President Carlos Salinas encouraged him to
purchase the two banks from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal said his admiration for Luis Donaldo Colosio, the man
originally nominated as the party's presidential candidate in the
last election, inspired his $15 million donations in 1993. Zedillo
was Colosio's campaign coordinator and became the candidate after
Colosio was assassinated in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal said he met Zedillo on Jan. 12, 1994, and pledged $5
million in additional donations. But Colosio's assassination
dampened Cabal's interest in politics, and months later his
financial situation became precarious because the government began
auditing his banks.

 BIGSTEP A BIG BOOST TO SMALL BUSINESSES  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Internet startup Bigstep.com will unveil a full menu of services
Wednesday to help small businesses get into e-business quickly,
easily without hiring a professional or spending a dime.
<P>
   The design-it-yourself services, available at www.bigstep.com,
let little companies build and host Web sites, communicate with
customers and visitors, set up online product catalogs, promote the
sites, take and fulfill orders, and analyze site traffic and
trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigstep.com allows small businesses and entrepreneurs to do
what they do best _ create a unique business and provide
personalized customer service, instead of forcing them to be tech
wizards,'' said Andrew Beebe, co-founder and CEO of the year-old
San Francisco company. ``Our goal is to make Bigstep.com a place
where e-business is everybody's business.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly will please Internet users who are used to getting
a lot of free stuff online.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will small-business owners pay nothing for the service
and step-by-step instruction, Bigstep will not run advertisements
on customer Web sites. Beebe said businesses do not like it when
their customers leave their Web sites for someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bigstep will not charge any fee to connect small
businesses to outside e-commerce services, such as to register a
Web address or establish a merchant account with a bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are giving away the store,'' said Beebe, who talks
differently from most CEOs and also wears a ponytail. ``We look at
e-business as a right, not a privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   How, then, does Bigstep expect to make money for its 45
employees and its venture capital backers, including U.S. Venture
Partners and Mayfield Fund, which invested $10 million last month?.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe said Bigstep plans to get revenue eventually by selling
``value-added'' services such as customer-lead lists and online
auctions. It also will accept sponsorships on its own Web site from
companies such as Visa and UPS that have relevant products and
services for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe was student body president at Dartmouth College and a
White House intern before getting into the Internet world. After
stints at NetObjects and Tele-TV and as a Web designer, he started
the predecessor of Bigstep. Called the Springfield Project, it was
named for TV character Homer Simpson's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Bigstep and its investors hope the company will be as popular as
the cartoon icon. The market is huge. Bigstep estimates that less
than 10 percent of the more than 7 million U.S. small businesses
have e-business sites. But within three years, it is expected that
more than 3.3 million small businesses will be creating online
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bigstep is in a competitive market. IBM, Intel, Hewlett-Packard,
Microsoft and many other high-tech players all have products and
services aimed at the small business sector.
</P>
<P>
   But Bigstep's free services and broad array of do-it-yourself
tools make it stand out.
</P>
<P>
   One Bigstep fan and adviser is Terri Lonier, author of several
popular books on small business and founder of the Working Solo
consulting firm. ``When I learned about the company in March, I
thought it was too good to be true,'' she said. ``Small businesses
want freedom, flexibility, fun and control and Big Step provides
all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some big companies also support Bigstep. The company said 14
organizations, including First USA, Sun Microsystems and Service
Corps of Retired Executives, have signed up to develop and
distribute its service.

WHO IS THIS REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR FROM TEXAS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ He's a Republican governor from Texas, a self-described
``compassionate conservative,'' and on Tuesday he could be found on
an airport tarmac urging Colorado voters to get behind a certain
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush? Nope. It was Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, a Fort
Worth native who, unlike Bush, was actually born in Texas. (Bush
was born in Connecticut.)
</P>
<P>
   Tapped to drum up support and money here for the Bush
presidential campaign, Owens helped round up a group of Hispanic
leaders to endorse Bush. Some of them crossed party lines to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Democrats up here,'' Bush said. ``We
welcome them. My vision for America includes everyone.'' About 14
percent of Colorado's 4 million people are of Hispanic origin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was greeted at Centennial Airport by about 350
placard-waving supporters, who sang ``Happy Birthday'' as the Texas
governor took the stage. Bush turned 53 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   After the airport rally, Bush went to a fundraiser at the Hyatt
Regency in downtown Denver. Hosts included Peter Coors, CEO of
Coors Brewing Co., and both of Colorado's GOP senators, Ben
Nighthorse Campbell and Wayne Allard.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who graduated from a Fort Worth high school, moved to
Colorado 22 years ago. Last year, he became the state's first
Republican governor since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is backing Bush for president because the two share a
similar philosophy, including the ``compassionate conservatism''
they both proudly promote.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush popularized the phrase, Owens said he has been a
practitioner of compassionate conservatism for years. He cited, for
example, his efforts to reach out to minorities and members of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of his cabinet are Democrats, including Larry
Trujillo, director of General Support Services. Trujillo, a former
Democratic state senator, joined other Hispanic Democrats in
announcing their support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said reaching across the partisan divide has not been
difficult, since he once worked in Washington for former U.S. Rep.
Jim Wright, a liberal Democrat from Fort Worth who later became
House speaker. The two have been close friends ever since.

<P>
   DENVER _ He's a Republican governor from Texas, a self-described
``compassionate conservative,'' and on Tuesday he could be found on
an airport tarmac urging Colorado voters to get behind a certain
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush? Nope. It was Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, a Fort
Worth native who, unlike Bush, was actually born in Texas. (Bush
was born in Connecticut.)
</P>
<P>
   Tapped to drum up support and money here for the Bush
presidential campaign, Owens helped round up a group of Hispanic
leaders to endorse Bush. Some of them crossed party lines to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Democrats up here,'' Bush said. ``We
welcome them. My vision for America includes everyone.'' About 14
percent of Colorado's 4 million people are of Hispanic origin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was greeted at Centennial Airport by about 350
placard-waving supporters, who sang ``Happy Birthday'' as the Texas
governor took the stage. Bush turned 53 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   After the airport rally, Bush went to a fundraiser at the Hyatt
Regency in downtown Denver. Hosts included Peter Coors, CEO of
Coors Brewing Co., and both of Colorado's GOP senators, Ben
Nighthorse Campbell and Wayne Allard.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who graduated from a Fort Worth high school, moved to
Colorado 22 years ago. Last year, he became the state's first
Republican governor since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is backing Bush for president because the two share a
similar philosophy, including the ``compassionate conservatism''
they both proudly promote.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush popularized the phrase, Owens said he has been a
practitioner of compassionate conservatism for years. He cited, for
example, his efforts to reach out to minorities and members of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of his cabinet are Democrats, including Larry
Trujillo, director of General Support Services. Trujillo, a former
Democratic state senator, joined other Hispanic Democrats in
announcing their support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said reaching across the partisan divide has not been
difficult, since he once worked in Washington for former U.S. Rep.
Jim Wright, a liberal Democrat from Fort Worth who later became
House speaker. The two have been close friends ever since.

 FERRETING OUT Y2K WOES THIS YEAR  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: I have a small business and haven't the foggiest idea about
whether my computer is Y2K compliant or whether it will crash at
the end of the year. What can I do to find out?
<P>
   A: You are not alone. According to the U.S. Commerce Department,
40 percent of U.S. small businesses are still not prepared for
computer problems that could be triggered by the year 2000. Even
more alarming, a third of small businesses plan to do nothing at
all to address this complicated issue.
</P>
<P>
   But with 177 days to go before Y2K, help is available.
</P>
<P>
   The department has a Y2K Self-Help Tool/CD-ROM, available in 11
languages. Its goal is to help small and medium-size business
managers around the world identify and rate their various
functions, from accounting to telecommunications to utilities, that
might be susceptible to Y2K problems. The easy-to-use program also
contains helpful online links, checklists and contingency plan
templates.
</P>
<P>
   You can get it by calling the National Institute for Standards
and Technology's Y2K Help Center for Small Business at (800)
925-7557. The software also can be downloaded via the Commerce
Department's Y2K Web site (www.doc.gov/y2k).
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act signed
into law in April, the U.S. Small Business Administration provides
a loan guaranty program for fixing Y2K problems that allows up to a
one-year moratorium on principal payments. Check www.sba.gov/y2k
for further details.
</P>
<P>
   There also are private companies that specialize in helping
small businesses over Y2K hurdles. One of these is Oasys Network
Solutions Inc. in Concord, which offers consulting services and a
$49.95 online compliance service at www.fixyear2000.com.
</P>
<P>
   Oasys manager Rod Bacon offers these 10 Y2K tips for small
businesses:
</P>
<P>
   -- Get Informed: Y2K exposure can exist  &LR; exists  &LR; in your
computer's hardware and software, other office hardware and your
business relationships. Check out helpful Web sites like
www.sba.gov/y2k or www.year2000.com.
</P>
<P>
   -- Check The BIOS. The only piece of hardware to be concerned
with in your computer is a chip called the BIOS, the basic
input-output system that controls the PC. Test your computer's BIOS
with a free testing tool from www.rightime.com or www.ntsl.com. (Do
not test by simply rolling your computer clock forward.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Correct BIOS problems. If after completing this test, you
find that your BIOS is not Y2K ready, you will need to acquire and
apply any available patches. See www.mitre.org for a good list of
BIOS patches.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make a list of key software installed on your computer
(including the operating system and business applications). You
will need the following information: manufacturer, application name
and version number.
</P>
<P>
   -- Check the software. Go to the software manufacturer's Web
site to determine compliance, and download any patch you need for
the application. These patches are usually free.
</P>
<P>
   -- Follow the directions and apply patches or upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   -- Document everything you do to make your business Y2K
compliant. This will be useful in case of any future legal battles.
</P>
<P>
   -- Control your environment by tracking all new hardware and
software brought into your business.
</P>
<P>
   -- Check back. Keep compliant by returning to the manufacturers'
Web site in November and applying any new patches.
</P>
<P>
   -- Verify, in writing, that all of your vendors and suppliers
are following a similar Y2K compliance program.
</P>

 DEVELOPER CREATES CORPORATE HOMES FOR TECH TENANTS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Rich Robbins is not your Donald Trump-style real
estate mogul. The transplanted New Yorker doesn't have his name on
his company or bask in publicity.
<P>
   Over the past 22 years, Robbins has built four corporate
campuses along the I-80 corridor in the East Bay. He also has a
dream list of bio- and high-tech tenants occupying more than 3
million square feet of space in more than two dozen buildings.
</P>
<P>
   His East Bay empire includes the Point Richmond Tech center,
longtime home to Steve Jobs' Pixar Animation Studios; Aquatic Park
Business Center in Berkeley, Calif., which is dominated by such
biotech heavyweights as Bayer Pharmaceutical, Roche Diagnostics and
Xoma; Chiron's headquarters campus in Emeryville, Calif.; and the
nearby EmeryStation-Heritage Square project.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the tenants moving into the new EmeryStation project this
summer are NorthPoint Communications and Ask Jeeves, which both
recently launched wildly successful initial stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   While many developers build corporate campuses for a single
client, like Levi Strauss in San Francisco or Oracle at Redwood
Shores, Calif., Robbins' niche is providing homes for multiple
clients.
</P>
<P>
   His Wareham Development firm, based in San Rafael, Calif., near
where Robbins lives, specializes in turning old factories and
abandoned warehouses into mixed-use developments. Not only do these
multiclient complexes often generate more rental income than
projects leased to a single tenant, they create interesting
communities that become a magnet for additional development. In
addition, they are more financially stable because the departure of
one business does not cloud the future of the entire campus.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins prides himself on preserving much of the original
character of the buildings he buys while adding airy skylights and
other architectural touches, gardens and patios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers are competing more than ever before to attract and
keep the best employees,'' said Robbins. ``They realize the
workplace can be part of their package of benefits. Workers who
have their pick of the job market prefer offices with the right
amenities _ windows that open to let in fresh air, gardens and
atriums, workout rooms with showers, and terraces and balconies
throughout the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, 50, grew up in Jamaica Plains, N.Y., the son of an
entrepreneur who manufactured everything from decorative
refrigerator magnets to wooden spoons at factories in Hong Kong and
Brooklyn. During college _ Bucknell as an undergrad, Wharton for an
MBA _ he made money on the side renovating brownstones, and then
went to work for a very successful real estate and insurance
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Robbins decided to strike out on his own and moved to
California. His first project was buying a paper recycling plant
near the Albany shoreline for $1.6 million and turning it into a
mixed-use development. Consolidated Fibers was paying 15 cents a
square foot (per month) for the space, but Robbins figured he could
make twice that by chopping it into smaller chunks and renting it
out to auto painters, brass bed-makers, sculptors and others.
</P>
<P>
   He approached his father about making an investment. But Robbins
recalls that after looking at the property, his dad told him,
``It's such a good idea you don't need to borrow from me.'' Robbins
values this lesson in ``tough love.'' He said it helped him to
develop relationships with bankers and be innovative.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, he legally converted the first industrial building in
the Bay Area into artists' lofts and studio residences. The
live-work space at the Hollis Street Complex in Emeryville
originally was built in the 1920s by General Cableand, and for many
years, it churned out submarine engines. Now, it is home to more
than two dozen artists and a host of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great work environment,'' said Alan Rhodes, an 18-year
tenant who owns Pacific Flame Glass Works, which designs
sophisticated scientific glassware. ``There's a Tibetan prayer flag
flying on the building, and Rich is interested in the community and
has kept rents down to help artists.''
</P>
<P>
   At his Aquatic Park Center in Berkeley, Robbins similarly turned
the the former Art Deco headquarters of Durkee Famous Foods into a
consortium of artist live/work studio galleries. Durkee's former
spice warehouse was renovated as a theater and cultural center.
Bayer Pharmaceutical occupies a gutted 40-year-old industrial plant
at the same complex, and at the other end of the campus, Roche
Diagnostics is housed in a former Langendorf bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, Robbins has focused primarily on
serving the burgeoning Berkeley biotech businesses, starting with
Cetus and Chiron and attracting university researchers with an
entrepreneurial streak. More recently he has turned to Internet
up-and-comers.
</P>
<P>
   A new Wareham tenant is NorthPoint Communications, the San
Francisco Internet access service company that is growing so fast
it needs a new headquarters in San Francisco and an additional
100,000 square feet in the new five-story EmeryStation complex.
</P>
<P>
   The company looked at a dozen other sites in the East Bay before
settling on Robbins' latest development just an exit and on-ramp
away from the Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked the location and links to the Amtrak station (which
Robbins also built) and the Emery-Go-Round shuttle to BART,'' said
NorthPoint real estate manager Bryce Mason. ``We also like the
campus-style setting, the wide open floor plans and Rich's
personable style and reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-story, brick-clad $75 million complex features a large
glassed-in atrium ``winter garden'' and patios that are accessible
to more than half of the office space.
</P>
<P>
   The building is already fully leased. In addition to NorthPoint,
tenants include Ask Jeeves, the natural-language online search
service; the Gallo Center, a research group affiliated with the
University of California at San Francisco that is researching
alcoholism and is financed by the Gallo wine family; and the
nonprofit Save-the-Redwood League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new work culture wants more unconventional spaces and
amenities like access to balconies,'' said Jeff Heller of San
Francisco's Heller-Manus Architects, who designed EmeryStation.
``Rich believes in this and buildings that fit the character of the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, ticked off by what he calls ``the
mow-and-blow'' gardeners, Robbins started the ``Gardening Angels''
group with the help of his wife. Now a half-dozen gardeners are on
the payroll planting wild flowers beside the sidewalks and tending
the gardens at Wareham's various developments.
</P>
<P>
   To cement long-term relationships, Robbins also likes to keep
10,000 to 20,000 square feet of what he calls ``surge space''
available to accommodate the short-term needs of new and future
tenants. For example, he recently bought out the California State
Automobile Association's lease on a building in Berkeley to make
way for NorthPoint Communications until its space in the new
EmeryStation is ready for occupancy next month.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also has been willing to work out other deals with
tenants. For example, he took stock from Chiron, Sybase, Xoma and
other companies instead of cash for some tenant improvements. A
number of these trades proved very lucrative, but that was not the
only motive, Robbins said. ``Sometimes it was necessary to make a
deal happen, and it also created a stronger bond with management.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins declines to discuss his personal finances or those of
his private company. Until recently, he leveraged Wareham's growth
with his own funds and loans. Six months ago, he sold half interest
in the EmeryStation project and eight other properties to a unit of
Prudential Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many developers, Robbins professes no interest in
forming a public real estate investment trust where he would be
obliged to worry about quarter-to-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in my makeup to buy and sell,'' he said. ``I get
committed to the land and involved in the community.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Some NATO officials and local residents
say the mile-deep shafts, the steaming smelting vats and the tanks
of hydrochloric acid at the Trepca mine here were used as a vast
disposal site for the bodies of ethnic Albanians killed by Serbian
forces, and the International War Crimes Tribunal has agreed to
investigate their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians who live near the state-owned mine say bodies
were brought to the mine in covered trucks escorted by Serbian
jeeps and troop carriers. The first day they reported seeing the
trucks was Sept. 17, 1998, the day Serbs launched one of several
major attacks to wipe out the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks continued to enter the mine frequently until a few
days before NATO troops arrived in June, the Kosovars say.
</P>
<P>
   Residents on the perimeter of the mine report that an unusual
pungent, bittersweet smell, which they assumed to be burning
bodies, frequently wafted up day and night from the chimneys that
ventilate the huge, bowl-shaped smelting vats. No such smell, they
say, had ever come from the chimneys before last September.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed NATO peacekeepers from France searched the mine
when they first came to secure the area, despite what the French
said were Serbian attempts to keep them out. The mine is in the
sector of Kosovo assigned to the French forces.
</P>
<P>
   French soldiers reported to the tribunal in The Hague that they
had uncovered piles of ethnic Albanians' clothes, shoes, family
photos and identity documents in the smelting area and near the
mine shafts, according to officers who have read the report.
</P>
<P>
   The French also reported that the vats had been thoroughly
cleaned before Serbian troops stationed in the complex left. The
cleaned vats stood in stark contrast with the filth that
characterizes the other parts of the mine.
</P>
<P>
   There were several large ash heaps, the French report said, and
French troops found numerous empty bins of hydrochloric acid.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing concern among ethnic Albanians and human rights
investigators that the evidence is being slowly removed or
destroyed by Serbs still inside the complex. French soldiers who
were in the mine a few days ago say some of the piles of clothes
and belongings have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   A tribunal investigator said the site is on the list to be
inspected, but would not comment on the French report. He did say
that he had heard that the area around the mine had been
booby-trapped and would have to be inspected with great caution.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to get to two sites inside the mine where stacks of
clothes and documents were reported by French troops was thwarted
by two nervous-looking men in track suits who carried AK-47 assault
rifles. Officials of the mine complex, where gold, silver, lead,
zinc and cadmium are extracted, would not speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   No one has even an estimate for how many Kosovo Albanians remain
unaccounted for. Thousands have disappeared from villages and towns
across Kosovo and investigators from the war crimes tribunal are
uncovering an average of one mass grave each day. There are some
graves, like the well publicized one in Izbica, that have been
emptied of bodies. At Izbica, 142 bodies remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of smelting plants in Serbia,'' said Yves Roy,
an investigator for the tribunal working at the Izbica site. ``If
the bodies were taken to smelting plants in Serbia, we may never
find them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Some French soldiers speculate that bodies may have been
submerged deep in the shafts. Aziz Abraski, an Albanian who was the
general director of the mine in the 1980s, said that because the
mine's water pumps are operating, the mine shafts are not flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Kavja Buran, an Albanian who was once director of the smelting
operations, said: ``If corpses were trucked into the mine, they
could easily have been disposed of in the vats of hydrochloric acid
or burned in the smelting plants. The living could simply have been
pushed into tunnels and had the air supply cut off. Mines are ideal
places to carry out genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Halid Barahi, the local representative for the Kosovo Council
for The Defense of Freedom and Human Rights, who kept a daily tally
of the trucks that entered the mine, said that at the end of
January every Albanian inhabitant in the Serbian-dominated part of
Mitrovica, which surrounds the mine, was expelled and it became
much harder to monitor activities there.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb-held part of the city became a killing zone, he said.
``After January, Albanians who were taken by Serbs into this part
of Mitrovica were murdered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian leaders said they have implored the French to provide
an armed escort to visit the mine and take samples from the ash
heaps to do a chemical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But French commanders have refused, fearing such a visit could
lead to a violent outburst in a city so bitterly split between
Serbs and Albanians. ``We are soldiers,'' said Col. Arnauld
Bellynck, a senior officer. ``We are here to keep the peace, not
investigate war crimes.''

LOW DRUNKEN-DRIVING LIMIT IS QUESTIONED IN A REVIEW
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal highway safety agency has overstated
the effectiveness of state laws that lower the threshold for
alcohol in the bloodstream to be considered legally drunk, a
government review has found.
</P>
<P>
   The review concluded that lowering the blood alcohol limit alone
did not demonstrably reduce the number or severity of
alcohol-related car crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The review, by the General Accounting Office, challenged the
findings of the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration in several published studies commissioned by the
safety agency, which supports tighter restrictions on drinking and
driving.
</P>
<P>
   In its analysis of the data from the studies, the accounting
office found little statistical evidence to confirm that lowering
the permissible blood alcohol concentration to 0.08 percent, from
0.10 percent, significantly reduces the number of automobile
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the accounting office concluded that the best
countermeasure against drunken driving was a combination of
vigorous enforcement of blood alcohol laws, strong laws requiring
that the licenses of violators be revoked, and sustained public
education.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office's finding undermines efforts by the
Clinton administration to establish a national standard of 0.08
percent. While 16 states and the District of Columbia have adopted
the 0.08 standard, most states, including New York, Connecticut and
New Jersey, have a limit of 0.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, President Clinton endorsed a bill that would have
required the 35 states with a threshold of 0.10 percent to adopt a
standard of 0.08 percent within three years or lose 5 percent of
federal highway money the first year and 10 percent each succeeding
year. The Senate approved the proposal, but it was rejected by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office, the congressional investigative agency,
concluded that the highway safety agency's position that the
evidence supported the stricter standard was ``overstated.'' The
accounting office report, released last month, criticized the
methodology of seven published studies on how motor vehicle crashes
and deaths had been affected by laws requiring the threshold of
0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One group of studies conducted by the highway safety agency from
1991 to 1995 cited California's law setting a limit of 0.08 percent
as evidence of the effectiveness of such limits in general. But
after reviewing the studies, the accounting office report concluded
that while a 1991 study by the safety agency did find a 12 percent
decline in alcohol-related deaths after the 0.08 percent law took
effect in 1990, the study used only one year's worth of data.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, six months after the 0.08 percent limit took effect,
California also subjected violators to the possible suspension or
revocation of their driver's licenses, a provision that could have
skewed the results, the accounting office said.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office also faulted the methodology in a 1996
Boston University School of Public Health study published in the
American Journal of Public Health. This study sought to compare
drunken-driving deaths in the first five states to adopt the 0.08
percent standard with five nearby states that retained laws with
the 0.10 percent standard.
</P>
<P>
   According to the accounting office, the Boston University study
used one state as a control to assess the effectiveness of a new
law in another state, incorrectly assuming that all other
conditions were equal. Three of the five states also enacted laws
to revoke driver's licenses within 10 months of enacting laws for
the lower limit.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving favors a national 0.08 percent
standard but supports the accounting office's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research shows that virtually all drivers are substantially
impaired at 0.08 BAC and that 0.08 is a reasonable limit to set,''
said Karolyn Nunnallee, the organization's national president.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the review, the Department of Transportation said
there was ``consistent evidence supporting the effectiveness of
0.08 BAC laws in reducing alcohol-related fatalities.''

RUSSIANS FLY INTO KOSOVO AFTER IMPASSE IS RESOLVED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SLATINA, Yugoslavia _ Russian airborne troops flew into Kosovo
Tuesday, starting the deployment of the main Russian peacekeeping
contingent, a day after NATO and Russia worked out the last
wrinkles to their participation.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of about 200 Russians was greeted with general
relief on the ground. It signaled the opening of Slatina airport,
just west of the capital, Pristina, for military flights, and for
the first U.N. relief flight Tuesday, which arrived with vital
communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the thorny political issues have been resolved, some
eight more relief planes are expected to arrive in coming days,
U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For the several hundred Russian paratroopers already based at
the airport, the flights will provide welcome reinforcements of men
and equipment and enable the Russians to start deploying properly
as a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have seen how difficult it is for our Russian contingent
to fly here, but I think these problems are behind us,'' said Gen.
Anatoly Volchkov, chief of the airport, as the second Russian plane
touched down in mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians had been ready to fly in for several days but were
prevented from doing so after neighboring countries denied them
flight paths, at NATO's request. Two days of talks in Moscow ending
on Monday cleared up remaining issues, but the delay seems to have
irritated the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was frustration here,'' said a British liaison officer
to the Russian general. ``They were all ready. They have the most
difficult logistics to get here of all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Valery Yevtukhovich, who will command the Russian
forces in Kosovo, arrived with the first of three planes of Russian
troops and equipment that flew in Tuesday. He replaces Col. Gen.
Viktor Zavarzin, who led the Russians into Kosovo in the early
hours of June 12, stealing the show from NATO forces and taking
control of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, the commander of NATO forces in
Kosovo, greeted Yevtukhovich and joined him at lunch in a tent by
the tarmac. The Russian brought along ``a very good bottle of vodka
which was shared by General Jackson and General Zavarzin,'' the
British liaison officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Zavarzin returned home Tuesday, and Volchkov, who met with
reporters later, said he expected no difficulties with the chain of
command worked out for the Russian force. ``For all safety and
security of aircraft in the airfield, it would not be possible
without coordination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the agreement with NATO, the Russians have reserved the right
to refuse to carry out orders. But Volchkov said he did not expect
to receive orders from his commanders that would go against the
NATO commanders' wishes. ``I only receive such an order from the
command after there have been consultations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude may end the one-upmanship that has troubled the
NATO force's first weeks in Kosovo, after the Russians seized
control of the airport. The Russian presence and the subsequent
political wrangling delayed use of the airport for both military
and aid flights for weeks. It also delayed the deployment of the
full Russian peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The running of the airport now seems to be worked out. The
Russian and British troops have agreed on a detailed
military-technical protocol outlining their respective areas of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians will make it their main base and will have 750
officers at the airport, part of a total contingent of 3,600. They
will be in charge of security and transport on the airfield.
British forces, which number 250 at the airport so far, will be in
charge of air traffic control, and they have supplied radar
equipment and fire services.
</P>
<P>
   Together they have patched up the bomb-scarred runway and
prepared the airport to handle civilian flights. Commercial flights
are not expected for several months.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have been hampered by the dispute since they rely
almost entirely on direct flights for their supplies and
reinforcements. The British have helped them out with water,
providing 20,000 liters of bottled drinking water to keep them
going. In the meantime, the Russians are sorting out local
contracts for supplies of food and meat.
</P>
<P>
   They now have a logistics base at Kosovo Polje, a predominantly
Serbian settlement between the airport and the city, and can be
seen buying local produce from Serbs on the street. During the next
weeks they will start to deploy their forces out into the regions,
basing hundreds of troops in each of the French, German and
American sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted by the Serbian community as fellow Slavs, the Russians
are viewed with suspicion by Albanians. Volchkov said they did not
expect to encounter antagonism from the Kosovo Liberation Army, but
were ready for all contingencies. ``They fully understand why we
are here and what task we are fulfilling,'' he said. ``It is quite
normal for them to be suspicious, especially after what happened
here. It will need time.''

GUNMAN'S FAST-GROWING HATE GROUP IS RECRUITING WOMEN AND CHILDREN

<P>
   CHICAGO _ They peddle hatred to children, with a brightly
colored Web page featuring a coloring book of white supremacist
symbols and a crossword puzzle full of racist clues.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to attract women, by talking about family issues
and preaching that rapists should get the death penalty. They
recruit aggressively on college campuses with a blizzard of
leaflets handed out by their ``missionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Its efforts to broaden its appeal have made the World Church of
the Creator perhaps the fastest-growing and one of the largest hate
groups in the country. Promulgating an anti-Jewish, anti-black,
anti-Christian doctrine, the group has increased its chapters from
13 to 41 in 17 states in the last year, experts on hate groups and
the group's leader say. Estimates of its membership range from
hundreds to several thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most active and it's the most sophisticated,'' said
Mark Weitzman, director of the Taskforce Against Hate for the Simon
Wiesenthal Center, a research and educational organization based in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And while the group says that it does not advocate violence,
some members have been linked in recent years to violent incidents
including the killing of a black sailor and the pistol-whipping of
a video store owner believed to be Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   It is the World Church of the Creator that drew the attention of
Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, the 21-year-old student who went on a
rampage over the Fourth of July weekend, shooting blacks, Jews and
Asians in Indiana and Illinois, killing two people and wounding 12,
the authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree ended Sunday night, when Smith stole a van
from a woman at gunpoint, and, while being chased by the police,
shot and killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Wednesday that Smith purchased his guns, a
.380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a .22-caliber pistol, from
an illegal gun dealer in late June. At first, he tried to buy the
guns from a licensed dealer, but was turned away because one of his
ex-girlfriends had filed an order of protection against him.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Smith represented the kind of recruit that the
World Church of the Creator and groups like it are increasingly
trying to attract: young, educated, energetic, articulate.
</P>
<P>
   Hate groups once appealed primarily to older white men in mostly
rural areas with little education and blue-collar jobs, and later
attracted young ruffians called neo-Nazi skinheads. But in the last
few years, these groups have begun to broaden their constituencies
and increase their influence inside the political and legal
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a departure from the traditional rank and file of
these groups,'' said Mark Potok, who monitors hate groups for the
Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala. ``These are not
people who live in trailers. There is a concerted effort on the
part of white supremacist leaders to recruit college-bound middle-
and upper-middle-class kids.''
 &UR;  &LR; The Southern Poverty Law Center says the World Church of the
Creator is strongest in California and Florida, followed by New
York, Indiana, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The other 11 states that
the group has chapters in are: Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Texas, Washington and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Smith, the son of a doctor and a real estate agent from
an affluent Chicago suburb, attended New Trier High School, one of
the nation's most elite public schools, and had Jewish friends
growing up. As a teen-ager, there were few overt signs that he
would develop virulently racist leanings, but he later wrote in a
white supremacist newsletter that he thought that an eighth-grade
class covering the Holocaust had tried ``to instill a strong and
lasting sense of white guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   In his high school yearbook, he included the slogan ``Sic Semper
Tyrannis'' (``Thus ever to tyrants''), the words spoken by John
Wilkes Booth after he shot Lincoln and displayed on a T-shirt worn
by Timothy J. McVeigh the day he bombed the federal office building
in Oklahoma City. In college at the University of Illinois, Smith
later wrote that he thought that the foreign students and foreign
professors he met were benefiting too much from government aid.
</P>
<P>
   These were the raw ingredients Smith took to the World Church of
the Creator. His career ambitions also seemed an advantage. After
being forced to leave the university in February 1998 after being
charged with attacking his girlfriend and possessing marijuana, he
enrolled in Indiana University in Bloomington and switched his
major from computer science to criminal justice so that he could
become a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, he was following the example of several of the
movement's younger leaders, who want to be lawyers so they can be
advocates for the white race inside the nation's courtrooms. In
Bloomington, Smith was so active for the World Church of the
Creator that he was named ``creator of the year'' in 1998 because
he distributed the most leaflets and recruited the most members.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who came in contact with Smith said he appeared
calm, not excitable, another hallmark of some of the younger
leaders of groups like the World Church of the Creator, who appear
to be striving to couch their extremist views in almost
rational-sounding arguments for why Jews and minorities are
inferior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about moderating the image and trying to fit into the
mainstream,'' said Mark Hamm, a professor of criminology at Indiana
State University who has written extensively about hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew F. Hale, the leader of the World Church of the Creator
and at 27, apparently the youngest hate group leader in the
country, comes across as articulate, patient, telegenic and media
savvy. His father is a policeman and he lives with his parents in
East Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hale is credited with reviving the group in 1996 after it nearly
evaporated when its founder, Ben Klassen, a former Florida state
legislator and the man who invented the electric can opener,
committed suicide in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hale has had minor skirmishes with the law over activities like
burning an Israeli flag, and he ran unsuccessfully for the East
Peoria City Council in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hale is definitely the most articulate and upfront of this new
generation,'' said Weitzman, of the Wiesenthal Center. ``He's
trying to give his movement a veneer of respectability _ as well as
the blow-dried look.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Where then, does Benjamin Smith's violent rampage fit in?
</P>
<P>
   Hale said he did not condone Smith's actions, but he also said
that he felt no compassion for the victims, only for Smith and his
family. He said he believed Smith was ``a martyr for free speech
for white people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the group is committed to achieving its goals throughout
legal means, but that he could think of circumstances in which
violence might be acceptable under the ideology of his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``As any free people we do insist on remaining free,'' Hale
said. ``Our position is similar to that of Thomas Jefferson. If our
constitution is destroyed, if our right to free speech is denied,
then we have the right to use whatever means necessary to survive
and to advance our position. If you're cornered in an alley you
have the right to defend yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's credo is ``RAHOWA,'' which stands for racial holy
war and members have been linked to violent activities over the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   One member was convicted of killing a black sailor returning
from the Persian Gulf War in 1991 in Florida. Two members pleaded
guilty to the 1997 beating of a black man and his son in Miami,
and, last year, also in Florida, four members pleaded guilty to
robbing and pistol-whipping a video store owner they believed to be
Jewish. Potok said members of the group have also been linked to
plots to bomb a large Los Angeles African Methodist Episcopal
church and an NAACP office in Tacoma, Wash., both in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, literature from the World Church of the Creator was
found near synagogues that were burned down last month in
Sacramento, Calif., and the authorities are investigating whether
the group's followers were involved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hale believes that what might have set Smith off on his
murderous tear was a setback in Hale's drive to become a lawyer in
Illinois. Hale, who graduated from law school and passed the state
bar exam, wants to become a lawyer to advance the cause of his
group. He has been denied a license to practice law by a state
panel that ruled earlier this year that his racist activities
indicated he did not have the fitness of character to qualify as a
lawyer in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Hale appealed the ruling and Smith testified at his appeal
hearing. Last Friday, Hale's appeal was denied and hours later,
Smith began shooting Orthodox Jews walking home from Sabbath
services in a north Chicago neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said that although he told Smith he planned to appeal all
the way to the Supreme Court, Smith might have interpreted the
decision as a sign that the group's rights were being so trampled
upon that legitimate methods to advance the white racist agenda
would not succeed.

CLINTON URGES RETAIL DEVELOPMENT IN POVERTY AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Restores full text)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. _ Midway through his four-day anti-poverty
tour across America, President Clinton came to this small,
struggling city of 38,000 people along the Mississippi River
Tuesday to hail the opening of a Walgreens drug store, an event
that usually does not prompt a presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   But the store is the largest retail establishment built here
since the 1950s, and to Clinton it is a shining example of the
profit-making opportunities in low- and moderate-income inner-city
neighborhoods for businesses willing to locate there.
</P>
<P>
   Standing atop a makeshift stage on the parking lot of the
glittering new store, Clinton said, ``We see in this community both
poverty and great promise.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're all going to have to work hard at this.
Nobody's got all the answers. There is no magic wand. But we know
one thing: people make these investments one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came armed with a new federal study by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development that shows such communities are
``under-retailed,'' meaning sales fall significantly short of the
residents' retail purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   The HUD report, titled ``New Markets: The Untapped Retail Buying
Power in America's Inner Cities,'' said the retail purchasing power
of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods was estimated at $331
billion last year, or one-third of the $1.1 trillion total for the
central cities that include those neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Among 48 inner-city areas where HUD found a retail gap and where
20 percent or more of the population lives in poverty, the total
shortfall last year was $8.7 billion, which equals the purchasing
power minus sales.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Optional graf grim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of those areas, six were in Massachusetts _ Gloucester, Lowell,
New Bedford, Waltham, Westfield and Yarmouth. The study showed
Westfield with the biggest gap between the purchasing power of its
residents and retail sales, 22.7 percent, while Gloucester had the
least at 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(End optional trim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge buying power among inner-city residents, the
study said they often must make purchases in such places as
suburban malls because there are too few retail stores in their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In this city where the unemployment rate last year was 9.6
percent, more than twice the national average, and the poverty rate
is 44.3 percent, even a Walgreens store that employs about two
dozen people is considered good news.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest stop on Clinton's six-state tour of poverty
areas to promote greater public and private investment in urban and
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with a small band of corporate CEOs and members of
Congress and his Cabinet, Clinton is touting these areas as a way
to keep the economy strong through job creation and lowering of
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``America needs to wake up and recognize that the best new
market for American products and for new American investment is
right here in the US of A,'' he told a group of entrepreneurs from
the Mississippi Delta in a roundtable discussion earlier Tuesday in
Clarksdale.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies apparently are listening. Tuesday, the Bank of
America announced it will commit $500 million of equity to support
community development in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   And Greyhound Bus Co. and Federal Express announced a new
partnership that will provide transportation connecting workers in
Clarksdale to jobs in Memphis, Tenn., about 100 miles away, for a
roundtrip fare of $4.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the White House pledged tens of millions of
dollars in grants to community development organizations across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to Mississippi, Clinton's first since he became
president, he got an earful from Clarksdale Mayor Richard Webster
and other business owners who seemed to be looking for the federal
government to do more.
</P>
<P>
   Standing inside the ``Ooo So Pretty'' flower shop, Webster made
a pitch for federal aid to the distressed business area. During a
walking tour through downtown, the president passed a two-block
stretch were nearly all of the shops, restaurants, bars and the
movie theater were shuttered or abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   During the roundtable discussion, Clinton said he would present
Congress with details of a $15 billion plan to invest in
economically depressed rural and urban areas over the next five
years as part of his ``new markets initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is to make every area in America that needs
an investor equally eligible to get the investors' attention by
being able to get these kinds of tax benefits,'' he said. ``I think
it will really, in the next five or six years, would make a
breathtaking difference, because people are out here looking at
these markets now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMECULA, Calif. _ The biggest problem about a golf getaway to
this southern Riverside County wine country might be choosing which
course to play. Given the combination of beauty, price and
facilities, the area is hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   With SCGA Members club, Redhawk, Temeku Hills and the 27-hole
Temecula Creek Inn all within six miles of each other, the golfing
choices are multiple and optimum. In the summer, none of these
courses costs more than $55 (cart included) to play during the
week. All can be played for much less with super-twilight rates
(after 4 p.m.), which are worth trying just for the spectacular
sunsets in this mountain-highlighted region.
</P>
<P>
   The best test in terms of difficulty is Redhawk, but
single-digit handicappers only need try this beast from the back
tees.
</P>
<P>
   At its full length of 7,180 yards, par-72 Redhawk plays to a
course rating of 75.7. The slope rating, used to assess the
relative difficulty of all golf courses, is 149 at 9-year-old
Redhawk. By comparison, Industry Hills and TPC Stadium Course in La
Quinta, courses legendary for their difficulty, have respective
back-tee-slope ratings of 142 and 143.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique and a challenge,'' Redhawk head pro J.B. Sneve
said of the Ron Fream-designed layout that can test golfers with
rolling terrain, five water holes, elevation changes and 18 tiered,
undulated greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got some sensational views from elevated tees and there
are a lot of holes that can be visually intimidating,'' Sneve said,
``but it's a course for all ability levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty, he said, depends on what tees you choose and how
aggressively you play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more aggressive you are, the more apt you are to make
mistakes that can get you into trouble,'' Sneve said. ``If you play
a little more conservatively, you have a chance of doing better.
Keep the ball in the fairways and on the right tier on the greens
and you can score. Shortside yourself and you'll have to find some
magic in those wands.''
</P>
<P>
   __ SCGA Members Club, designed by Robert Trent Jones Sr.,
features the large scale that has defined his architectural style.
Everything seems bigger than normal at Members Club, from gaping
bunkers to huge, undulating greens to wide, sweeping fairways.
</P>
<P>
   Even the wind is big, especially in the afternoons, and it is
the single biggest barrier to low scores. In keeping with that
theme, Members Club offers SCGA members a sizable discount _
charging $40 on weekdays and $55 on weekends, cart included.
</P>
<P>
   __ Temecula Creek Inn gives golfers a choice of three par-72
courses from a mixture of three nine-hole layouts. The Creek/Oaks
combination (both courses designed by Dick Rossen) has been the
most popular mix. The newer Stonehouse side, designed by Ted
Robinson, is most scenic. Temecula Creek also offers lodging, with
all-you-can-play packages available.
</P>
<P>
   __ Temeku Hills, another Ted Robinson-designed course,
challenges visitors with elevated, snaking greens that are the
course's primary defense against par. Hitting approach shots below
the flagstick is the key to success here. But that can seem
difficult for golfers who approach with a club longer than the
distance would indicate because of those elevated greens.

INDIA AND U.N. WORKING ON KASHMIR FLIGHT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations and India are struggling to
resolve a dispute over an airport that India closed to
international civilian traffic as fighting erupted in May in
Kashmir, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the dispute involves the United Nations' use of the
airport in the Indian city of Srinagar, south of the line that
divides hostile Indian and Pakistani forces in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute also reflects the far broader tensions between
the United Nations and India, which has refused since 1972 to
recognize U.N. involvement in the fate of the disputed Himalayan
territory.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the United Nations had used the airport to transport
personnel, equipment and supplies for a small observer mission that
has been stationed on the dividing line since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   But about the time the fighting erupted in May, India told the
United Nations that its chartered plane from Pakistan could no
longer land at the airport, because Srinagar did not have
installations to control customs and immigration. All planes from
foreign countries would have to land first at New Dehli, which has
such an ability.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations stopped using the airport, one official said,
arguing that routing its plane through New Dehli would cost the
extra time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have been conducted since then, and it now appears
that the United Nations is ready to yield to the demand that its
flights land first at New Dehli.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to regain the use of the airport soon,'' said Joachim
Hutter, director of the Asian and Middle East department of
peacekeeping operations for the United Nations. ``It's one of
several issues that we've been trying to sort out.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has little choice, a senior official said,
adding: ``We cannot challenge India's sovereignty in its right to
control its air space. But it will be more expensive for us to
operate now. There's no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said he could not yet say how much more the mission
on the Line of Control would cost because of India's decision.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Indian mission to the United Nations in New
York said only that the matter was ``under consideration'' by his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the timing of the decision, he said only it was
intolerable for India to have ``people wandering around the country
without stamps in their passports'' and to have equipment moving
through it that had not been cleared through customs.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat played down the notion that the decision reflected
India's uneasiness with the U.N. stance on the Kashmir conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But other diplomats said the dispute reflected India's
unhappiness with the U.N. role on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Like Indonesia's incorporation of East Timor in the mid-1970s,
India's claim to what it regards as its part of Kashmir has never
been recognized internationally.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Security Council passed resolutions in 1948 and
1949 that called for a plebiscite among Kashmiris to decide the
future of their territory. India has consistently refused to heed
the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, India has also refused to recognize the observers,
stating that the U.N. mandate was no longer valid, because New
Dehli and Lahore signed an agreement that year to settle the fate
of the disputed territory bilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, India maintained, the mandate of the mission had
lapsed, a position that Pakistan rejected.
</P>
<P>
   A succession of secretaries-general has maintained that only the
Security Council can end the mission, an action the council has
chosen not to do.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the dispute over the mandate, the 47-member
mission, the second oldest U.N. peace-keeping mission, is stationed
on the Pakistani side of the line that divides the forces in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The mission, now headed by Col. Fleming Johansen of Denmark, has
had little to observe, because the peacekeepers are far from the
region where Pakistani-backed Islamic militants and Indian forces
have been fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout its history, the mission has had nine fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of May, Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged India and
Pakistan to continue discussing their differences and stop
resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan could do little more than express his concern about
the conflict near Kargil, the scene of recent heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
   After India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons last year, India
refused to see a U.N. emissary sent to the region to encourage both
sides to stop such tests and abide by treaties that ban them.

U.S. ACCUSES BOEING OF BLOCKING RACE-DISCRIMINATION INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusual legal clash between the government and its
second-largest defense contractor, the Department of Labor filed
three lawsuits against Boeing Co. Tuesday, accusing Boeing of
blocking an investigation of charges of racial discrimination at
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The suits accuse Boeing of refusing to provide access to records
after an African-American employee complained of widespread
discrimination last December. The suits also accuse Boeing of
refusing to cooperate in a review of the company's compliance with
federal nondiscrimination requirements at operations in Wichita,
Kan., and Mesa, Ariz., as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denying us that access cannot _ and will not _ be tolerated,''
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing said that requests by the department's Office of
Federal Contract Compliance Programs were out of line. ``To the
extent that Boeing has withheld data from the agency,'' said Peter
Conte, a Boeing spokesman, ``it has done so based on its good-faith
belief that the request is either unreasonable or exceeds the scope
of the OFCCP's authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Conte said the company hoped to resolve the issue informally,
but he added that Boeing ``is prepared to defend its positions
vigorously and believes that it will ultimately prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company and the
country's single largest exporter but only its second-largest
military contractor after Lockheed Martin Corp. During the 1998
fiscal year, Boeing was awarded $11 billion in government
contracts, according to the Labor Department. As a federal
contractor, the company is prohibited from discriminating against
its employees on the bases of race, sex, religion, color, national
origin, disability or veteran status.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation by the Labor Department, which was begun
earlier this year, came at the same time Boeing was facing a
private class-action lawsuit charging racial discrimination against
10,000 African-American employees. The lawsuit accused the company
of, among other things, discriminatory hiring practices, failing to
promote qualified minority workers and tolerating a hostile work
environment.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Boeing chairman Philip Condit, flanked by the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, announced a $15 million settlement of the suit in
which Boeing did not acknowledge any wrongdoing. But the deal has
since been challenged by some Boeing workers and has not yet been
approved by the federal judge sitting in the federal class-action
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two cases are technically separate, they are
connected, according to two people involved in the current dispute,
because much of the information the government is seeking is
related to the charges in the private lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Conte said that the government requests were unreasonable
because they were ``so broad that it would take hundreds if not
thousands of hours and hundreds of people to actually gather and
compile the information. Or the requests are so narrow in scope
that the data they are seeking does not exist in the form they are
seeking it.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the the Labor Department, which conducts 4,000
to 5,000 compliance reviews a year and rarely sues a company in
such a case, believe they were on firm legal ground and have asked
for an administrative law judge to hear the case on an expedited
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a condition of their contract, they agree that they will
engage in certain affirmative actions,'' said a Labor Department
official. ``They also agree to maintain certain records and make
them available. We think that we have a clear legal issue that
entitles us to these records.''

<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. _ The Vietnamese immigrants gathered outside
the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art here believe that the Communists
they crossed an ocean to escape are haunting them again, this time
with paint and canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants have been protesting against an exhibition of
contemporary Vietnamese art since it opened at the museum on June
25. They are angered by the origin of the art and that some of the
paintings depict communist symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that painters try to convey a feeling,'' said Ky
Ngo, 47, who fled Vietnam in 1975 and who stood across the street
from the museum with a few dozen other protesters on a recent
afternoon. ``But here they want to convey communist thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   In one painting, a woman standing next to a forge is wearing a
military uniform, its lapels decorated with the red flag of
Vietnam. In another painting, a mother prays at an altar of
photographs, some of which show communist soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the paintings in the exhibition, which features
nearly 100 works since the 1920s, do not have any political
imagery. Many are scenes from Vietnamese life like fishing boats
and rice paddies.
</P>
<P>
   That makes no difference to the immigrants, who believe that the
entire exhibition, which runs through Sept. 30, should be closed.
They say that artists in Vietnam do not have the freedom to paint
what they want and that the show is propaganda for the Vietnamese
government.
</P>
<P>
   The show, called ``A Winding River,'' was organized by the
Meridian International Center, a nonprofit cultural institution in
Washington. Nancy Matthews, vice president for arts at the Meridian
Center, said the exhibition's curators, who traveled to Vietnam to
select much of the art, had total freedom in visiting galleries
there and were not required to receive permission from the
Vietnamese government to take the works out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Nghi Phan, a Vietnamese immigrant who fled Saigon a day
before the Viet Cong took control of the city in 1975, sees the
show as ``just the start of the infiltration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Communists are very malicious; they go little by little like a
drop of oil,'' Phan said.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants say their protest is part of their larger agenda
to end all interaction between the United States and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition has appeared in seven American cities. The only
other significant protest was at the Artcenter in Plano, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Baker, curator for Asian art at the Bowers Museum, which
is operated by the City of Santa Ana, said she had expected some
criticism of the exhibition and had invited prominent members of
the Vietnamese community to view slides of the show before it
opened.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the immigrants liked the show, Ms. Baker said,
others were critical.
</P>
<P>
   As a concession, museum officials agreed to remove the painting
of the woman at the forge, which was a particular concern to the
immigrants, but reversed their decision after some members of the
public and other museums complained that they were submitting to
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baker agreed with the protesters that artists in Vietnam do
not have total freedom but said visitors could take that into
account and decide for themselves whether the art was communist
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protesters are very concerned about freedom,'' Ms. Baker
said. ``But if they are protesting the right of museums to show
this work, then they are denying the museums their First Amendment
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baker said the debate had doubled museum attendance to about
200 viewers a day. The exhibition has been the focus of dozens of
local news reports by English and the Vietnamese news
organizations.

ADVERTISING: THE GROSS-OUT GENRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When historians of advertising and popular culture look back at
the emblematic campaigns of 1999, the images they will scrutinize
will most likely include an adorable girl who sells soft drinks
with the dubbed voices of celebrities, a dog that seemingly talks
to peddle tacos, a veritable galaxy of aliens pitching products
tied to a science-fiction film _ and two actors posed as if
micturating.
</P>
<P>
   That last image, promoting the film ``Big Daddy,'' starring the
comedian Adam Sandler, represents what may be the first time that a
major Hollywood studio has sold a mainstream movie on the basis of
a bodily function. Print and poster advertisements for ``Big
Daddy,'' created in-house at Columbia Pictures, depict a scene from
the movie in which Sandler, portraying a slacker who plays father
to a boy, teaches the child how to cope with a sudden need to
urinate by using a restaurant wall as a lavatory. The scene is also
included in some of the television commercials and trailers for the
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' is one of the hit films of the summer, taking in
an estimated $90.1 million at the box office since opening on June
25. The opening-weekend take of $41.5 million was the most ever for
a Sandler film so far.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a special ad created to run during the Fourth of
July weekend, when ``Big Daddy'' finished second in ticket sales
behind only ``Wild Wild West.'' The original image was revamped to
pose Sandler and the boy facing an elaborate display of fireworks
exploding behind the Manhattan skyline _ and the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing a multimillion-dollar campaign for a movie on a call of
nature may well be a sign of the times, reflecting a general
coarsening of commercial speech as well as popular entertainment.
After all, ``Big Daddy'' is competing against films in the
so-called gross-out genre whose very titles titillate: ``South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me'' and ``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a striking visual that would represent the
movie's irreverence and `break us out' in a very competitive time
period,'' said Senn Moses, senior vice president for worldwide
marketing at Columbia in Burbank, Calif., owned by Sony Corp. of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a naughty movie,'' he added. ``We're a funny
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   No less indicative perhaps is the almost universal acceptance of
the campaign by the media and owners of outdoor advertising spaces
and the almost complete absence of negative reaction to the ads,
apart from scattered complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new high in low that an image like this raises no one's
eyebrows,'' said Richard Kirshenbaum, co-chairman at Kirshenbaum
Bond &AMP; Partners in New York. ``I personally found the image
distasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, The New York Times has received just 10 complaints
protesting a decision to run the ad.
</P>
<P>
   While ``we take all complaints seriously,'' said Lisa
Carparelli, a spokeswoman for The Times, ``given the millions of
readers exposed to our advertisements, 10 is a relatively small
number of complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Daily News in New York, owned by Mortimer Zuckerman, Les
Goodstein, executive vice president and associate publisher, said:
``We of course reviewed the ad and decided to take it. We have
gotten not one complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   There have also been no complaints to speak of at The Washington
Post, owned by Washington Post Co., or The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, owned by Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do take a look at ads and try to think through what issues
there may be,'' said Debbie Reetz, assistant national ad manager at
the Atlanta newspaper. ``We kind of thought we possibly might hear
something, but there haven't been any comments that I've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Why has there been so muted a response to what at one time may
have been so provocative an image?
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture is totally debased,'' said Barbara Lippert, a
critic for the trade publication Adweek in New York. ``There is
tolerance because this is accepted now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not responding because it could be worse,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Donny Deutsch, chairman and chief executive at Deutsch Inc. in
New York, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't even do a double take anymore because you're
desensitized,'' Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are `overmedia-ed,''' he added, ``and living in a world
where almost nothing is sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirshenbaum attributed the calm to a perception that the ad fits
the product being marketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at Adam Sandler as a brand,'' Kirshenbaum
declared. ``He is known for such fraternity-style humor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad is not out of character, so it's not controversial,''
he added. ``People do not look at it as they would if it were
Harrison Ford.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Senn at Columbia said that ``the way we approached''
creating the campaign was to consider ``what would most represent
the movie and the Adam Sandler brand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find a visual with that irreverent and
unpredictable appeal Adam has,'' he added, ``and to convey his
comic take on fatherhood. And we wanted to find something everyone
could relate to, either the younger or the older audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Dick, vice president for worldwide advertising at Columbia,
echoed his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never considered the ad in bad taste,'' Dick said, adding
that the image ``seemed to encapsulate the character Adam played, a
guy not equipped to be a father but trying to do his best.''
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Weekly magazine, in an article that graded poster
ads for summer movies, condemned the image as ``revolting'' _ but
quickly added that it works because ``you pretty much know the
plot, the cast and the tone of `Big Daddy' in one quick glance.''
That earned the ad a grade of B+.
</P>
<P>
   The ad has proved so popular that it was spoofed to promote a
rival release. A newspaper ad that was part of the campaign for the
``Austin Powers'' movie replaced Sandler and the boy with two
characters from that film, Dr. Evil and his smaller doppelganger,
Mini-Me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a parody ad,'' said Steve Elzer, senior vice
president for corporate communications at New Line Cinema in Los
Angeles, the unit of Time Warner Inc. that released and marketed
the Powers comedy. ``It's keeping with the spirit of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line, too, received no complaints about its ad, Elzer said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few rejections for the ``Big Daddy'' ad came from the
Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York City, which vetoed the
image ``because of what it depicted,'' said Tom Kelly, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes against everything we're trying to do with the
system,'' he added. ``You don't want to have anyone urinating
against a wall or a door.''
</P>
<P>
   Which might be the next summer movie ad to walk the fine line
between acceptance and outcry? It could be the campaign for
``American Pie,'' a coming-of-age comedy opening this Friday that
seeks to be the ``Porky's'' for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the ad's double entendres about ``your first piece of
pie.'' Wait until moviegoers find out the significance of the flute
displayed in the ad.

CHASING PERFECTION: A PORTRAIT OF FISCHER-DIESKAU 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, July 11) 
(jt)

<P>
   All superlatives for the artistic impact and record-setting
extensiveness of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's singing career have
long since been exhausted. It is to the credit of Bruno
Monsaingeon, the director of a documentary film on the singer just
released by Atlantic Records, that he makes the stale fresh.
Leonard Bernstein sings tonelessly at an orchestra rehearsal and
dryly admits, ``Fischer-Dieskau I'm not.'' The soprano Elisabeth
Schwarzkopf observes that perfection is unattainable and amends
that with ``Fischer-Dieskau, perhaps,'' kissing the air. Yehudi
Menuhin just says his name, trails off and looks happy.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows better that perfection is unattainable than
Fischer-Dieskau himself. We later hear him say that one rarely gets
as much as halfway toward what one is attempting when interpreting
a great piece of music, and that eventually one must content
oneself to say, ``weiter komm' ich nicht'': roughly, ``that's as
far as I'm going to get just now.'' But his ``halfway'' has taken
the ears of three generations farther than they could ever have
expected to go toward the heart of some of the world's most
wonderful music, and it is sheer joy watching him go about that on
film. This is a must-see, surely the most satisfying film yet about
any singer's work. And what work!
</P>
<P>
   The format is simple: some introductory and biographical
material, then long segments on the singer's activity in opera,
oratorio, German song and the various pursuits that have occupied
his ``retirement'' years. All of it is illustrated with an
astonishing variety of television and concert footage, linked by
discreet off-camera commentary from the director and longer
on-camera reminiscences from the baritone himself. These are in
German, with an English voice-over; in two nice touches,
Monsaingeon repeatedly lets the baritone be heard for a bit in his
native tongue before the voice-over cuts in, and the translation is
read by Fischer-Dieskau himself.
</P>
<P>
   The commentaries take the story from the singer's childhood (he
is a lifelong Berliner) through his harrowing apprenticeship
(called up for the German army at 17, just after that
``Winterreise'' debut, he got his early recital experience singing
from the back of a truck to fellow prisoners of war) to the debuts
in radio, concert, opera and recording that established him after
his release. There the ``story'' pretty much stops as far as
narrative is concerned, because Fischer-Dieskau had no long
struggle; he became world-famous practically overnight and
maintained his position throughout a long and honored career.
</P>
<P>
   The important story, though, is of an artistic journey almost
impossible to evoke in words. ``Autumn Journey'' is packaged with a
second video (in NVC Arts 23031-3; two VHS cassettes), a recital of
Schubert songs with the pianist Hartmut Hoell filmed in 1992, the
last year of Fischer-Dieskau's vocal activity. One can hear him
singing many of the same songs as far back as 1948 _ ``pirate''
labels have issued the broadcasts that made the singer's reputation
already before his 23rd birthday _ and in many intervening
versions.
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing thing about the early ones is how much the
beginner was already the Fischer-Dieskau we know: the incisive
delivery of the texts, the beautiful sound uniquely combining
darkness of timbre with lightness of texture, the subtlety of
rhythmic direction and phrasing, the sheer concentration and
confidence of address _ all there from the start. The astonishing
thing about the late versions is the extent to which,
notwithstanding wear and tear on the instrument, the sound is still
itself; and the extent to which, notwithstanding an overall
approach that has scarcely changed at all, he has taken the
qualities that matter most immeasurably farther.
</P>
<P>
   The video recital is spellbinding. One notes the agedness of the
voice in the vigorous opening song and quickly forgets it as the
singer moves from world to world in other numbers. He is wonderful
to watch as well as hear: in ``Wehmut,'' only a page long, the way
he moves from the striding span of the opening lines through the
``storm and stress'' of their continuation, then suddenly draws
himself and the listener into the utter stillness of the final
observation (that all human endeavor vanishes and falls away) is
stunning.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer-Dieskau became ever bolder in his rubato, in his ability
to make the shifts of rhythm and tempo tell an emotional story yet
never dissolve the musical coherence that contains it. In this
case, when the Schubert goes suddenly into slow sustained notes, he
makes them even slower. This is the opposite of what most musicians
would advise in such a passage: conventional wisdom would say:
``Don't retard the tempo. The effect of ritardando is already built
into the long notes.''
</P>
<P>
   And for most singers that advice might be right, because not
everyone has the powers of continuity this one has. He gives a
series of steady pure notes in no hurry to go anywhere, each one
like a trance, each trance bound to the next inexorably but without
overt ``direction,'' the series rising and falling like the human
strivings being described, but the embodiment of it as neutral, as
distanced, as the neutral march of indifferent time past all the
busy activity it passes by.
</P>
<P>
   Who else could sing like this? Who else so learned to live
within these songs that he could seem to be making them up as he
went along? (Cliches can't be evaded when Fischer-Dieskau is being
discussed.)
</P>
<P>
   In the documentary portion, the baritone's filmed reminiscences
may have a whiff of scriptedness, and there may be something a tad
``actorish'' in the way the narrator recreates his own pauses,
emphases and even chuckles as he reads the translation, but the
effect is agreeable, and some strikingly candid and interesting
comments pop out of the narrative. Unprepared stage directors do
not get off easy, and it is fascinating to hear that in the midst
of praising his colleagues, Fischer-Dieskau doesn't mind pointing
out that when a conductor is at the piano, the singer must beware
the ``invisible wand'' with which he is accustomed to control
matters.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the essential material here is the video excerpts.
Fischer-Dieskau is seen in early operatic triumphs in the '50s,
made-for-TV performances, live concerts, rehearsal footage and
late-career recitals that were actually planned in part to enable
filming of important parts of his repertory that had escaped the
camera before. Some of the music is to be expected _ Mahler's
``Kindertotenlieder'' with Lorin Maazel from 1960; favorite songs
like Schubert's ``Erlkoenig'' and Schumann's ``Ich grolle nicht'' _
and some is off the beaten path (Britten's ``War Requiem,'' a Bach
aria with Yehudi Menuhin and Mstislav Rostropovich, and a Puccini
rehearsal scene with his wife, the soprano Julia Varady).
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, some questions are raised without being explored. As
he explains himself, the baritone came up at a time when opera in
Europe was still usually translated into the audience's language.
(We see excerpts from ``Don Giovanni,'' ``Don Carlos,''
``Falstaff,'' ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' and ``Il Tabarro'' sung in
German.) He adds that Mozart had the language in his ear when
composing in Italian and that he himself would never have consented
to sing those works in translation today. But he does not address
the contradiction between that opinion and his observation that he
cannot imagine how the ``great stage personalities'' of Ms.
Schwarzkopf, Lisa Della Casa and other colleagues from his early
years could have developed outside the German-speaking repertory
system that nurtured them.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some reference to a universality and versatility
of artistic reach (Debussy as well as Schubert, Verdi as well as
Wagner) that is offered as one of Fischer-Dieskau's great qualities
_ and a hint of complaint, even from the singer himself, that this
may be insufficiently appreciated. I think it's more interesting to
look at why, wide-ranging as his interests were, he changed the
world's way of hearing German lieder and not the rest.
Fischer-Dieskau gave many fine performances of all sorts of music,
and no doubt his art was enriched by his excursions, but had he
sung all his Verdi and Debussy and none of his Schubert and Wolf,
he would have been an artist of minor interest.
</P>
<P>
   In part this was a matter of the nature of the voice. To go to
the simplest aspect, it was a voice that functioned supremely well
in piano and only reasonably well in forte. Not that the singer's
sound was by any means small or weak; rather, even in the full glow
of youth his loud high notes sometimes protested under pressure,
and as the instrument aged, they were apt to turn dry in comparison
with the startlingly vital and beautiful soft notes that he
preserved up to the moment of his retirement on New Year's Day
1993, after almost half a century of singing in public.
</P>
<P>
   So to the extent that operatic singing is naturally biased
toward the louder end of the spectrum, the baritone was just as
naturally more fully able to realize his intentions in the realm of
piano-accompanied song. On the other hand, his performance at the
actual occasion of that retirement _ a gala concert in Munich from
which excerpts appear in ``Autumn Journey'' _ is not likely to put
anyone in mind of limitations. There he stands, singing Falstaff's
``Honor'' monologue with such uninhibited zest and such vocal
firmness right up to the top G that one feels he could have gone on
and on.
</P>
<P>
   His description for Monsaingeon of the decision to retire is
nice to have. Like any singer lucky enough still to have a full
schedule as he approaches 70, Fischer-Dieskau had been pondering
when he ought to draw the line. But the actual choice came suddenly
during the performance, and not because he wasn't having a good
time. As he sang the joyous concluding fugue from the same opera,
``tutto nel mondo e burla'' (``all the world is a joke''), he
recounts, ``the thought came to me in a flash: this is the motto on
which I would like to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning he canceled all scheduled performances and
recordings and threw himself into the other activities in which he
had already dabbled: teaching, writing, conducting and even a bit
of accompanying at the piano.
</P>
<P>
   It is also good to have his precise observations and generous
praise of his colleagues. Of Gerald Moore, who accompanied him so
often from 1951 to the early '70s, he says, ``he was like a lynx,
totally concentrated on what his soloist was doing.'' That is true,
and the stature of Moore's contribution is still somewhat
underappreciated. But the great difference when he performed with
Fischer-Dieskau is that there were two lynxes: the singer was just
as intently focused on the keyboard part.
</P>
<P>
   This is a rarer capacity than might be suspected, and it was
crucial to his collaborations with the long list of virtuoso
pianists (Sviatoslav Richter, Daniel Barenboim, Vladimir Ashkenazy,
Maurizio Pollini, Murray Perahia, Alfred Brendel, Wolfgang
Sawallisch, Christoph Eschenbach, Vladmimir Horowitz and more) who
accompanied him from time to time. When in the film he discusses
the process of collaborating with a great soloist and sums it up by
saying, ``it consists in fact of accompanying him,'' he is not
offering a platitude.
</P>
<P>
   The baritone ``accompanied'' all his partners in the same sense
that the members of a great string quartet accompany one another:
an infinitely subtle, lightning quick, unobtrusive and probably
sometimes unconscious way of responding to the partner's
moment-by-moment rhythmic or coloristic impulses; a joining of two
independent spontaneities into an intricately well-meshed yet still
spontaneous-sounding unity.
</P>
<P>
   The great lieder of Schubert, Schumann, Brahms and Wolf are
simultaneously ``songs'' in the ordinary sense of a vocal-poetic
statement with instrumental support, and musical duos in the same
vein as the violin sontatas or piano trios of the same composers.
If dozens _ even hundreds _ of these songs had to wait a century or
more for Fischer-Dieskau to show that they held more than
specialized appeal, it was in large part because of the rarity of
artists simultaneously equipped to fulfill the traditional
communicative role of ``singer'' and the subtle musical role
implied above.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And here we approach the reasons beyond vocal practicality for
his ability to make revelations in this field. Younger audiences
today at the recitals of Bryn Terfel, Thomas Hampson or Matthias
Goerne may not realize what an enormous portion of their repertory
lay silent before Fischer-Diekau's career. The way he heard this
music, the way his every spontaneous execution of a detail related
at once to a clear conception of the whole and to an in-the-moment
awareness of exactly how and to what purpose the pianist has
executed his last detail: this is a contribution comparable to
Callas' reimagining of bel canto, Gould's or Casals' of Bach,
Toscanini's of Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   In the film we see him performing with (among others) Hoell,
Sawallisch, Eschenbach and Moore; recording with Moore and
Barenboim; rehearsing with Richter, Eschenbach and Brendel. In a
way the most interesting bits are the practice sessions with
Eschenbach and Brendel, where Fischer-Dieskau does not sing in full
voice but ``marks'' his part, striding to and fro and guiding the
rehearsal through his rhythm and the most expressive and precise
gestural ``conducting'' of the pianist.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise at all, watching this physicalization of
rhythmic thought, either that the more restrained physicality of
his public recitals was so compelling to watch or that when he
turned to actual conducting, he met with success. By now there are
a good dozen disks on the market that show what he has to offer in
this field, and if he is granted long life and good health, a
second career of some importance may be in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Tutto nel mondo e burla: Fischer-Dieskau the grave exponent of
the heart's winter journeys was actually able to feel the truth of
that statement just as roundly as Verdi the tragedian. If there is
a regret over the selection of a Schubert recital for the
full-length program, it can only be that Schubert does not offer
the humorous songs with which Fischer-Dieskau closed his Wolf and
Mahler recital programs.
</P>
<P>
   No one who heard him in Mahler's ``Knaben Wunderhorn'' songs on
his last Carnegie Hall visit in 1987 will forget the concluding
``Ich weiss nicht wie mir ist.'' ``I don't know what's the matter
with me,'' the singer asks, and the listener gets ready for the
conventional answer (it must be love driving you crazy), but
instead comes, ``ein ganzes Narr bist du gewiss'': ``You're a
complete fool, that's what.'' And the singer responds in effect,
``ah, now I see, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer-Dieskau never made one feel that he was ``selling'' the
joke and milking the laugh; he gave the last phrase as a throwaway
tumble and was practically shaking the pianist's hand by the time
it was out of his mouth. It came across as someone pretty keenly
alive to the fact that much of life is ridiculous, and happy to let
the public in on that little insight.
</P>
<P>
   There's something essential about the man in that, and it comes
through in his narration as well. There is a combination of honest
pride with unostentatious humility that is of a piece with his
artistic stance.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer-Dieskau's life has been marked by tragedy: in youth he
lost a handicapped brother to Nazi extermination policies, and in
middle age he lost his first wife, the cellist Irmgard Poppen, who
died giving birth to their third son. The tragic sense was never
far from his art, but there is nothing of tragedy about his own
story. ``Adventurous'' is how he chooses to describe himself in one
word, and that is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Another that he would never offer is ``heroic'': the striving
hero of an adventure with a happy ending. Music lovers who have
lived in his time are lucky, and one can't praise the film more
highly than to say it reveals why this is so.  &QL;

PIAZZA AN ALL-STAR STARTER AS ORDONEZ HOPES FOR BID  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering that he had been either elected or selected to the
All-Star Game in each of his first six seasons in the majors, Mike
Piazza was pretty much a shoo-in in the balloting for starting
catcher this year. The National League confirmed it Tuesday when it
announced the starters for next Tuesday's All-Star Game in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mets will have at least one representative in Fenway
Park. But will Piazza have company?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm not going alone,'' Piazza said after he was elected
by fans as the NL's starting catcher for the sixth consecutive
season. ``It's no fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The National League reserves will be announced Wednesday, and
from the Mets, Edgardo Alfonzo, Robin Ventura, Rey Ordonez, the
injured John Franco and his replacement as closer, Armando Benitez,
all merit consideration for San Diego manager Bruce Bochy's roster,
as might Roger Cedeno, who leads the major leagues in stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Piazza seemed to be pushing extra hard for Alfonzo, who
was seventh in the league in hits and was batting .299 with 12
homers and 53 RBI going into last night's game with Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they give me the opportunity to go, then do you think I'm
going to say no?'' said Alfonzo, who otherwise will spend the
three-day break helping his wife take care of their newborn son
while trying to convince his 3-year-old son that the new addition
to the family is not a new toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fonzie, for a second baseman, has some tremendous numbers,''
said Piazza, who has some pretty good numbers himself: a .306
average, 16 homers and 47 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza received 1,645,304 votes, third-most overall, and he
easily out-polled the runner-up at catcher, Pittsburgh's Jason
Kendall, who received 511,587 votes, but a fractured ankle ended
his season on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa, who leads the league with 32
homers, led all NL players in the balloting with 2,315,204 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was voted to the National League's starting outfield along
with Colorado's Larry Walker and San Diego's Tony Gwynn. However,
Gwynn, who is on the disabled list with a strained left cal,
announced Tuesday that he will not play. Barry Bonds of the Giants
finished fourth in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   The other winners at their positions were St. Louis' Mark
McGwire at first base with 1,669,066 votes, second most in the
league; Arizona's Jay Bell at second base and Matt Williams at
third, and Cincinnati's Barry Larkin at short.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin edged Ordonez by a margin of 58,345 votes _ 858,203 to
799,858. But Larkin was pulling away from Ordonez by the end of the
voting period.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mets General Manager Steve Phillips and Manager Bobby
Valentine were pushing for Ordonez's selection, which would be his
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's played like an All-Star,'' Valentine said of his
shortstop, even though the two have sometimes had a tacky
relationship this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go,'' said Ordonez, who was hitting .296 _ 54 points
better than his career average before this season _ going into last
night. ``Everyone wants to go to the All-Star Game. But if I don't,
I'll go to Miami for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, not everyone wants to go if they are not voted in; see
Texas' Juan Gonzalez. But Piazza, who has never missed the game,
feels pretty much like Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get tired of going,'' Piazza said. ``As long as I'm
elected or selected, I'm going to go. I even have a routine, now.''
</P>
<P>
   That routine will not include the home run derby, although
Piazza will serve for the second consecutive year as an ESPN
commentator on the exhibition. ``I've done it before,'' Piazza said
of the home run hitting contest, ``and I didn't do too well. ``It's
nice for me to take that off and just watch it and let the McGwires
and Sosas do it. And with the weather and the position I play, I'd
rather go up and watch it in the air-conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is looking forward to getting to hit at Fenway Park. His
only previous visit there was last June _ and Pedro Martinez of the
Red Sox, who will likely start the game on Tuesday for the American
League, hit Piazza with a pitch in his first at-bat. Piazza missed
the rest of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to hit in a game there and not get hit,''
Piazza said. ``It will probably be against the same guy, too.''  &QL;

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CELL PHONES ON AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)   
 (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Passengers were still filing down the aisle. The American
Airlines flight attendant had to scoot around them to pounce on the
miscreant like a hall monitor cornering a school scofflaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, you put that away immediately!'' he barked.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger, who had just completed a quick cell phone call to
check his office voice mail, was already putting the phone away.
But he told the flight attendant that he had thought it was
permissible to use a cell phone on an airplane at the gate when the
doors were still open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly against federal law,'' the flight attendant
declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal law or airline policy?'' the passenger asked.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing discussion ended when the flight attendant
threatened to have the passenger removed from the plane for
questioning the source of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, incidentally, is that individual airlines, not
federal regulations, set policies about the use of cell phones
while an aircraft is still at the gate with its doors open. But
those policies are changing.
</P>
<P>
   While most airlines still prohibit the use of cell phones at any
time on an aircraft, others have begun to loosen the rules and
allow passengers to use the electronic devices until the plane's
doors are shut. Some industry officials predict that the trend will
soon encompass all major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines, the latest carrier to allow cell phone use on
board at the gate, changed its policy last month after an
eight-month study of the potential for cell phone interference with
preflight preparations in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded it was safe,'' said John Kennedy, a spokesman for
Delta. ``All the airlines have been looking at this for some time.
We just did not know how cell phones might interfere with all the
other communications that are going on in an aircraft'' while it is
still boarding passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides improving customer satisfaction, especially among
business travelers, the policy change has the effect of expediting
the boarding process and departure times, because those who have to
make a call know they can now do it on board. When cell phones
began proliferating several years ago, airlines noticed that many
business passengers held back to make cell phone calls even after
boarding was announced. ``You had all these passengers using their
cell phones near the gate'' until the last minute, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of airlines, including Delta and Northwest
Airlines, now allow cell phone use at the gate. But policies can
change fast once one of the major airlines takes a step that
customers like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines are gradually coming out and saying, it looks OK,
cell phones appear not to interfere with safety'' while the plane
is at the gate,'' Kennedy said. ``It's happening quickly. I would
imagine ultimately we'll all be on board with the same program.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication of when _ or if _ cell phone use might
ever be allowed on airlines in flight. Though no airline official
likes to discuss this, on-board telephones available at airline
seats generate revenue that is lost when customers use personal
phones.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, is continuing to
study the possible interference posed by cell phones and other
devices to aircraft navigation systems. Right now, the law is
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cell phones and other personal electronic devices, everything
from laptops to Furbys, cannot be used in the critical phases of
flight, which are defined as 10,000 feet and below, and during
takeoffs and landings,'' said Kathryn Creedy, a spokeswoman for the
FAA.
</P>
<P>
   While federal law does not address it, airlines are free to
enforce their own policies for cell phone use on the ground. ``At
the gate is a gray area,'' Ms. Creedy said.
</P>

   On the subject of cell phones, Singapore Airlines, a popular
carrier among business travelers, said Tuesday that starting July
15 it would offer free cell phone rentals in Singapore for two days
to economy-class passengers holding round-trip tickets. Customers
must pay only the normal air-time charges for using the phones
while in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   James Boyd, an airline spokesman, said that about six months ago
the company noticed a sudden jump of nearly 20 percent in
economy-class business travel on its flights _ a possible
indication of an improving economy in Asia. Offering the free cell
phones to economy customers was a marketing decision aimed at
pleasing the growing numbers of business customers ``in the back of
the plane,'' he said. &QL;

   DENVER _ When Texas Gov. George W. Bush touched down in Colorado
on Tuesday, his birthday party was a bipartisan one _ he turned 53
and collected endorsements from 26 of the state's Hispanic leaders,
more than half of whom are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the front-runner for the 2000 Republican presidential
nomination, also stayed long enough to continue his voracious
fund-raising, appearing at a $1,000-a-person downtown event on the
first leg of a three-day campaign swing through three Western
states.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Republican Gov. Bill Owens said he was not surprised
that his Texas counterpart was attracting support from outside the
party. At an airport rally early in the day, Owens appeared with
Bush and Hispanic elected officials, business leaders and
educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a campaign bring together the excitement and
unity this campaign has brought together,'' Owens said. ``Not just
in this state, but in the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, many of the Hispanic leaders endorsing Bush said
they did so based on his record in Texas, and also his promises to
Colorado and the nation. Hispanics make up Colorado's largest
minority, accounting for about 13 percent of the state's
population.
</P>
<P>
   Many noted Bush's accomplishments in education as a key factor
in deciding their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are faced today with a great opportunity,'' said Larry
Trujillo, a Democrat acting as spokesman for the group. ``I know
Governor Bush is going to help us solve our problems in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, former President George Bush, lost Colorado to
President Clinton in 1992, but Republican nominee Bob Dole carried
the state in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, looking tanned and relaxed, made a few remarks in Spanish
and offered some snippets from a speech he would give later in the
day to prosperous downtown contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a uniter, not a divider,'' Bush said. ``I understand
polls, they're important. But there is only one election that
matters, and I am going to work Colorado as hard as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was traveling without his wife, Laura, was greeted at
a private airport by about 200 mostly Anglo supporters who carried
signs that read, ``Viva Bush!''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he was particularly pleased that 14 of the 26
Hispanics who endorsed him are Democrats. He said there is room on
his stage for many, because ``my vision for America includes
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a few Democrats standing up here,'' Bush said.
``And they are showing a lot of intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his likely general election opponent, Vice President Al
Gore, intend to compete for Hispanic voters, who may be a key group
in many states. Bush's appeal to non-Cuban Hispanics, a traditional
Democratic constituency, is one of his greatest assets entering the
Republican nominating contest.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll of 505 Hispanic adults released Tuesday shows
Bush and Gore currently tied for the Hispanic vote, with each
attracting about about 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a fund-raiser attended by several hundred supporters,
Bush offered a general outline of his priorities for himself and
the nation, including civil justice reform, strengthening the
military, improving free trade and emphasizing ``responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my most important responsibility is when I put my hand
on the Bible, I will not only swear to uphold the laws of our
country, I will swear to uphold the dignity of the office of the
president of the United States of America,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also made solemn reference to the recent tragedy at
Columbine High School, which is in a Denver suburb, promising
``tough love'' policies to instruct young people about the
consequences of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can pass laws to give schools and principals more authority
to discipline children and protect the peace of classrooms,'' Bush
said. ``We must encourage states to reform their juvenile justice
laws. We must say to our children, `We love you, but discipline and
love go hand and hand, and there will be consequences for bad
behavior.'''
</P>
<P>
   Toughening juvenile justice laws was a centerpiece of Bush's
first term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting his own success in Texas, Bush promised to allow
states more authority and flexibility to fashion their own
solutions to education. He said Americans should make a solemn
commitment that every child will be educated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also told the crowd of business leaders, lawyers, elected
officials that the nation's prosperity should be inclusive and
available to all. To that end, Bush suggested reducing the
regulations that ``strangle enterprise'' and creating an
environment where businesses and families can flourish.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of his remarks, Bush was presented a cake and he
remarked of his 53rd birthday, ``I used to think it was old. Now I
know it's young.'' Overhead, speakers blared Lyle Lovett's song,
That's Right, You're Not From Texas.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CELL PHONES ON AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication warning: also sent with `f' code)   
 (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Passengers were still filing down the aisle. The American
Airlines flight attendant had to scoot around them to pounce on the
miscreant like a hall monitor cornering a school scofflaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, you put that away immediately!'' he barked.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger, who had just completed a quick cell phone call to
check his office voice mail, was already putting the phone away.
But he told the flight attendant that he had thought it was
permissible to use a cell phone on an airplane at the gate when the
doors were still open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly against federal law,'' the flight attendant
declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal law or airline policy?'' the passenger asked.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing discussion ended when the flight attendant
threatened to have the passenger removed from the plane for
questioning the source of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, incidentally, is that individual airlines, not
federal regulations, set policies about the use of cell phones
while an aircraft is still at the gate with its doors open. But
those policies are changing.
</P>
<P>
   While most airlines still prohibit the use of cell phones at any
time on an aircraft, others have begun to loosen the rules and
allow passengers to use the electronic devices until the plane's
doors are shut. Some industry officials predict that the trend will
soon encompass all major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines, the latest carrier to allow cell phone use on
board at the gate, changed its policy last month after an
eight-month study of the potential for cell phone interference with
preflight preparations in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded it was safe,'' said John Kennedy, a spokesman for
Delta. ``All the airlines have been looking at this for some time.
We just did not know how cell phones might interfere with all the
other communications that are going on in an aircraft'' while it is
still boarding passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides improving customer satisfaction, especially among
business travelers, the policy change has the effect of expediting
the boarding process and departure times, because those who have to
make a call know they can now do it on board. When cell phones
began proliferating several years ago, airlines noticed that many
business passengers held back to make cell phone calls even after
boarding was announced. ``You had all these passengers using their
cell phones near the gate'' until the last minute, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of airlines, including Delta and Northwest
Airlines, now allow cell phone use at the gate. But policies can
change fast once one of the major airlines takes a step that
customers like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines are gradually coming out and saying, it looks OK,
cell phones appear not to interfere with safety'' while the plane
is at the gate,'' Kennedy said. ``It's happening quickly. I would
imagine ultimately we'll all be on board with the same program.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication of when _ or if _ cell phone use might
ever be allowed on airlines in flight. Though no airline official
likes to discuss this, on-board telephones available at airline
seats generate revenue that is lost when customers use personal
phones.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, is continuing to
study the possible interference posed by cell phones and other
devices to aircraft navigation systems. Right now, the law is
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cell phones and other personal electronic devices, everything
from laptops to Furbys, cannot be used in the critical phases of
flight, which are defined as 10,000 feet and below, and during
takeoffs and landings,'' said Kathryn Creedy, a spokeswoman for the
FAA.
</P>
<P>
   While federal law does not address it, airlines are free to
enforce their own policies for cell phone use on the ground. ``At
the gate is a gray area,'' Ms. Creedy said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the subject of cell phones, Singapore Airlines, a popular
carrier among business travelers, said Tuesday that starting July
15 it would offer free cell phone rentals in Singapore for two days
to economy-class passengers holding round-trip tickets. Customers
must pay only the normal air-time charges for using the phones
while in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   James Boyd, an airline spokesman, said that about six months ago
the company noticed a sudden jump of nearly 20 percent in
economy-class business travel on its flights _ a possible
indication of an improving economy in Asia. Offering the free cell
phones to economy customers was a marketing decision aimed at
pleasing the growing numbers of business customers ``in the back of
the plane,'' he said. &QL;

BOWDEN HAS BUILT REDS INTO SURPRISE CONTENDER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ga., Calif., Wash., Texas, Ariz., N.J.)   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Mets can accept the reality of their inability to
overtake Atlanta for the National League East championship, they
can then focus on a second-half pursuit of the wild-card spot for
the playoffs. But in assessing their chances for that position,
they have to face the emergence of two new, unexpected guests at
the wild-card party.
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, the Arizona Diamondbacks were given, at
best, a remote chance to contend for a playoff spot. Their
expensive stockpiling of starting pitchers during the winter
created that chance. They have unleashed an unexpectedly potent
offense on the league, however, and appear to have become a
legitimate contender for something (as opposed to the illegitimacy
of the Los Angeles Dodgers, but that's another tale).
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, the Cincinnati Reds were, at best, an
intriguing team. Some off-season moves they made _ the acquisition
of starting pitcher Denny Neagle and slugger Greg Vaughn, for
example _ gained them some attention, but many weren't sure what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them at the beginning of the season as one of the
mystery teams because of the moves they made,'' said Gerry
Hunsicker, general manager of the Houston Astros, the team that had
been viewed as the best in the NL Central. ``A team with the
ability to surprise but with enough questions that you couldn't say
they were going to be one of the top teams in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Mets can't be sure if the Reds or the Astros
will contend with them for wild-card honors, but they both can't
win the division title. The same idea applies to the Diamondbacks
and the San Francisco Giants in the West, or any other team that
becomes a second-half bloomer.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one team to watch as the second half progresses,
it's the Reds. They have just gone through possibly the most
arduous stretch of the schedule that any team will face this year,
and they responded magnificently.
</P>
<P>
   Playing two division leaders, the Astros and the Diamondbacks,
the Reds won 12 of 14 games and leaped from six games behind to one
game ahead in first place. In the course of that sizzling span,
they became the first team in history to win 10 consecutive games
against first-place teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they're playing about as good as any team could
play,'' Hunsicker said Tuesday by telephone from Phoenix. ``They're
getting great offense up and down the lineup, they're getting great
pitching and they're not beating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They surprised me with the consistency they've shown. The
first month of the season, they looked like they were just another
team. Now they look like a legitimate contender. They're going to
be a team to be reckoned with the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are the $31 million production of Jim Bowden, who is
perhaps the most creative general manager in the business. Saddled
with the shrunken payroll of a low-revenue team, he has pieced
together a team that has produced unexpected developments all over
the field.
</P>
<P>
   The infield epitomizes the talent the Reds have exhibited:
</P>
<P>
   _ First baseman Sean Casey, who entered last night's game
hitting .371, has been first or second in the league in batting
much of the season. He also leads the league's first basemen in
fielding average and is among the league leaders in a host of other
offensive categories, including slugging and on-base percentages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second baseman Pokey Reese has made only one error, none in 58
games since April 27, and is hitting .305, not bad for a third-year
major leaguer who had a .241 average in six minor league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shortstop Barry Larkin has been his old reliable self but
outdid himself in June, leading the league with a .430 batting
average.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third baseman Aaron Boone was hitting .218 when he was sent to
the minors May 12. Since returning two weeks later, he has hit
.310.
</P>
<P>
   Surprises abound on the pitching staff as well, although they
work both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had told me in spring training,'' Bowden said, ``that
Neagle wouldn't win a game and Brett Tomko would have three wins
and we'd have the second-best record in the league, I wouldn't have
believed you.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, whose acquisition opened second base for Reese because
Bret Boone was sent to Atlanta in the trade, has been on the
disabled list (for the second time) since May 24 with a weak left
shoulder. He has made only six starts, losing three and winning
none.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko is a third-year major leaguer who spent the first half of
May in the minors taking a refresher course. Bowden had counted on
15 victories from him this season after 11 and 13 the previous two
years. Tomko took a 3-4 record into his start in St. Louis Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the surprise line, Ron Villone stands very
tall. ``He was drafted No. 1 by Seattle and he's been traded for
Andy Benes, Greg Vaughn and Marquis Grissom,'' Bowden said.
``That's four teams that saw potential. I guess it took the fifth
team for him to reach the potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving credit to manager Jack McKeon and his pitching coach, Don
Gullett, Bowden was talking about a 29-year-old left-hander from
Bergenfield, N.J., who had relieved in the majors 162 times and had
never started a game before June 8. He has made six starts, and in
three of them he allowed only one hit each _ in five innings
against the Mets, seven against Houston and eight against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The last two games were part of the Reds' recent remarkable run.
``What we've shown,'' Bowden said, ``is we have a baseball team
that can play with the big boys in our league. Obviously our young
players have matured and come together quicker than anticipated.
The young kids have been phenomenal, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   So has the Reds' relief corps. Led by Scott Williamson with 10
saves, a 7-2 record and a 1.45 earned run average, the bullpen crew
has been the best in the league, achieving the most victories and
the lowest ERA and opponents' batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teams that won in 1995 and 1990 had good bullpens and good
defense,'' Bowden said. ``That's what this team has in common with
those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden expects the team to suffer a letdown at some point. ``I
think all teams go through a cycle where they have a good run and
then a bad run,'' he said, ``but I think this team has proven since
opening day that we can play with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Because their starting pitching has been the Reds' weakest
ingredient, Bowden is scouring the other 29 teams for possible
acquisitions, an exercise being undertaken by just about every
other contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all of our scouts out in the field,'' he said.
``We've targeted 32 pitchers. Not all are available, but we're
doing our homework.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bowden does his homework, he more often than not gets an
A. &QL;

CLINTON AID PLAN IN PARTISAN GRINDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For lawmakers who want to strengthen the military
or save Medicare, there are plenty of opportunities to write
legislation to make their case. After all, the federal government
controls the purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   But because more than 90 percent of the money spent on public
education comes from state and local governments, members of
Congress have few ways to show they care about it. And that is why
the law intended to improve the education of children from poor and
minority families, up for renewal in Congress this year, has become
an object of sharp partisan debate over how the money should be
spent, with no resolution in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines are sketched in these comments from two
veterans, one from a Democratic administration, one Republican:
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Smith, President Clinton's acting deputy secretary of
education: ``In this nation's brand of federalism, there is more
disparity at the local level, less at the state level and even less
at the federal level. The allocation of resources is fairer at the
federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Chester Finn, an assistant secretary of education in the Reagan
administration and now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute:
``We've had 34 years of a Washington-knows-best education policy,
and it hasn't worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Title I provides federal money, now $8 billion a year, to
schools in poor and minority neighborhoods for things like teacher
training, after-school tutoring and classroom aides, with the
Education Department overseeing how the money is spent. When it was
first approved in 1965, in the rush of domestic legislation that
President Lyndon Johnson called his Great Society program, there
was little question that the spending of the federal money ought to
be directed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Finn, most of them conservative, say that the
law has not worked and that the spending ought to be directed from
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, an undersecretary of education in the Reagan
administration who is now seeking the Republican nomination for
president, said, ``As a conservative, I already had my biases, but
it became clearer to me that it was better when decisions on
education are made on the local or state level.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, Republican leaders in Congress introduced a bill
that would embody that philosophy by allowing the states to use
federal money for education programs of their choice, pledging in
return to meet specific performance goals.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on
Education and the Work Force, said: ``For more than three decades,
the federal government has been sending money to the states through
scores of Washington-based programs. But all the studies,
evaluations and reports show little or no academic results from
these programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration insists that there has to be a
national program, run from Washington, to insure that the spending
is highly focused and increases the chances of helping poor
children.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dale Kildee of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the
Education Committee, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governors like to spread the money around rather than target
it,'' Kildee said. ``They would like the money to be left on a
stump and let them come and pick it up and spend it where they
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a program loses its identity, it loses its advocacy, and
then it loses its dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Partisanship over Title I goes back a long way.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why the law had not achieved its goals after 34
years, Smith blamed the Republican administrations of the 1980s,
which he said sought to cut the law back and otherwise neglected
it.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, the Reagan education official, ridiculed the work of the
Education Department, saying, ``I spent 90 percent of every day
saying no to dopey ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone sees the debate in these terms. One
conservative who does not agree with the concept of block grants _
the federal government sending money to the states to administer a
program _ is Michael Greve, the author of ``Real Federalism: Why It
Matters, Why It Could Happen'' (American Enterprise Institute,
1999) and the director of the Center for Individual Rights, a
conservative public-interest law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governors, mostly Republicans, say, `Give us the money and
we'll decide how to spend it,''' Greve said. ``That is an
irresponsible position.'' If states and school districts continue
accepting the federal money, he predicted, ``regulations grow and
money gets scarcer: a bigger stick and a smaller carrot.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor George Farkas, director of the Center for Education
and Social Policy at the University of Texas at Dallas, said, when
asked to choose between Federal and state control, ``I have a third
way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've spent $118 billion since 1966 when Johnson did all
this,'' Farkas said, and the gap in achievement between children
from poor and better-off families has not been narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a portion of the money to go into an account that the
parent controls, from which money could be spent for things like
tutoring,'' the professor said.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies have found that Title I programs ``weren't narrowing
the gap,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Department counters by saying that scores last
year for reading were up in all three grade levels tested _ 4, 8
and 12 _ for the first time since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Educator Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, said of Smith: ``He's overstating the academic gains.
There was a dip, then it rose slightly. You can't say the federal
program did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The education law, which expires this year, is renewed in
five-year segments and will remain effective even if Congress does
not get around to acting on it soon, a practice that is not
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to have a bipartisan reauthorization by mid-2000,''
Smith said. ``We won't have it this year.''

`WOOFIE' BANKS, AN IDEA WHOSE TIME MAY HAVE GONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They go by the name ``woofie,'' although, in truth, they do not
have much ``woof'' to them. The term woofie refers to a type of
wholesale bank that was to have been created in the financial
overhaul measure that recently passed both houses of Congress. In
reality, however, the measure has dragged on so long that an idea
that seemed sparkling many years ago has little backing or meaning
today.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when the idea of eliminating Glass-Steagall
restrictions separating commercial from investment banking was
first floated, a basic bill was written. After various forms and
incarnations, it is now heading toward the finish line in Congress.
In that bill was a provision to create a new financial charter that
became known as a woofie.
</P>
<P>
   So, what is a woofie? It is a nickname for a wholesale financial
entity, a bank that would take only large deposits _ the minimum
would be $100,000 _ and, then, function essentially as a commercial
bank. It would not get federal deposit insurance, but would be part
of the Federal Reserve system and have access to the Federal
Reserve's discount window, should it need to borrow money for
liquidity needs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the House version of the measure provides for
woofies, but the Senate version does not, and it is unclear whether
woofies will be restored or jettisoned as congressional conferees
reconcile the differences between the two versions later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woofies are these bizarre little things,'' said Andrew
Parmentier, assistant communications director of the House Banking
Committee. ``Well, actually, they are not so little. They would be
a full-service financial institution for wealthy individuals and
corporations. They could do anything a commercial bank could do _
like make loans. But instead of managing $100 million from a
million people, the bank would be doing it for 10 people.''
</P>
<P>
   A woofie is basically a commercial bank that does not engage in
retail activities _ making car or mortgage loans _ and does not
take retail deposits. Instead, it would do all the corporate
activities of big banks, like making big loans to big corporations,
but would not have to pay insurance premiums to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. since the insurance covers only deposits under
$100,000. As a result, woofies would not be subject to oversight by
FDIC examiners.
</P>
<P>
   But while escaping FDIC oversight, woofies would still be
subject to the same capital and soundness requirements of all
commercial banks and would be regulated by the Federal Reserve,
state banking regulators or the office of the comptroller of the
currency, depending on how the woofie was chartered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not sure anyone is interested in woofies anymore,''
said Ed Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers
Association. That is because the financial overhaul bill has
dragged on so long that financial institutions that once pressed
for woofies either no longer need them or no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people who were interested in woofies have been
merged out of existence,'' added Yingling. ``So a lot of the oomph
has gone out of woofies.''
</P>
<P>
   As some lobbyists explain it, woofies were originally proposed
as a way to get securities firms, which felt that banks were
encroaching on their turf but that were prohibited from doing
banklike activities, to endorse the concept of ending
Glass-Steagall restrictions and allowing banks to begin to
underwrite securities. The idea was that this would allow
securities firms to begin to take on more banking activities, while
avoiding the difficulties of a retail banking operation, with
tellers, branches and consumer concerns. A woofie would enable a
securities firm to get into commercial banking _ but only with
their familiar big-ticket customers and big-ticket numbers.
</P>
<P>
   So, a woofie working group including Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.,
Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, J.P. Morgan Securities,
Salomon Brothers and several other firms was formed to start the
woofie bandwagon rolling. Since then, several of these firms have
merged and lost interest in woofies; those that have not, have
little interest in woofies anymore.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, woofies have gotten ensnared in issues related to
the Community Reinvestment Act, which is intended to get more bank
credit extended to low-income areas. Originally, woofies would have
come under the provisions of that act, something that most Wall
Street firms accepted readily. But, this year, Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, who heads the Senate Banking Committee, has objected
strongly to extending the act's provisions to woofies, and his
opposition is one reason that woofies are no longer in the Senate
version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Securities firms had no intentions of wanting to become a
retail bank,'' said Karen Thomas, director of regulatory affairs
for the Independent Community Bankers of America. ``But they liked
having the bank charter as an adjunct to their securities
business.''

COMPUTER JOCK TRIED TO HELP RED SOX IN ALL-STAR VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The worst suspicions harbored by Yankee
fans were true. In an attempt to swing the close vote for the
American League's All-Star shortstop in Nomar Garciaparra's favor,
a 25-year-old computer hacker from Carver, Mass., cast around
25,000 votes on the Internet for the Red Sox star on the last day
of balloting.
</P>
<P>
   But relax, Red Sox fans, your man apparently beat Derek Jeter of
the Yankees fair and square. The computer police entrusted with
sniffing out corruption did their job, according to Alex Tam,
director of Major League Baseball's web site (mlb.com). Chris
Nandor, who used a computer programming language to circumvent
limits on how many times a person could vote on the Internet, was
caught in the act, Tam said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the 25th and 27th of June, 25,259 votes for
Garciaparra were rejected,'' Tam said Tuesday night. ``The same
person also voted for (Scott) Hatteberg, (John) Valentin, and
(Jose) Offerman.''
</P>
<P>
   Nandor, Tam said, had tried this once before. ``We know all
about him,'' Tam said, reeling off Nandor's name, address, age,
place of employment, and computer number. ``On May 19, he voted
14,702 times for Garciaparra. We caught all of them and filtered
them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is foolproof. But if you're talking about the average
high-end hacker, we think we can catch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nandor, who didn't know his votes were thrown away until Tuesday
night, thought he'd done a big favor for Garciaparra, according to
Jon Orwant, a doctoral candidate at the MIT Media Lab and
editor-in-chief of the Perl Journal. Perl is the computer
programming language Nandor used in his attempt at chicanery in
cyberspace. Orwant and Nandor are friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've examined his program and can confirm that it would have
stuffed the ballot box,'' Orwant said in an e-mail message to the
Globe, to whom he had indirectly provided a tip about Nandor's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs are easy to write with Perl. In broad strokes,
the way his program worked is that it pretended to be a human being
visiting the All-Star web site, where it would click on the
appropriate buttons and fill in nonsense for the different fields
(e-mail address, city, state, zip, etc.).''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball rules limited Internet users to 22 votes,
which equaled the number of times All-Star ballots were distributed
in major-league parks. What prompted Nandor to weigh in with far
greater numbers?
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks ago I was at Fenway with some people,
watching the Red Sox go through an 11-run first inning against the
White Sox, and we were having a great time and talking about all
the different players, and the upcoming All-Star game,'' Nandor
wrote in an e-mail message. ``Someone mentioned Nomar was falling
behind. So I decided I would go home and try to help Nomar win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in large part I did it just because the All-Star game
was going to be in Fenway, so I felt Nomar deserved a start on his
home turf, with the incredible season he's had. I still might have
done it if the game had been in New York, but it makes me feel good
to have this justification for my actions.''
</P>
<P>
   But what apparently did in Nandor was a certain amount of
laziness uncharacteristic of his hero, Garciaparra. In his first
attempt, in May, Orwant said, Nandor used the same e-mail address.
His last attempt, in June, he used the same phone number
(111-222-3333) and Zip Code (11111). Nandor wrote that he set his
computer to run repeatedly, then went to a barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Because he didn't vary those basic bits of information, the
systems administrators at CBS Sportsline, the Internet site which
conducted the voting on the Web for Major League Baseball, caught
on quickly, Tam said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sportsline developed the ballots with numerous safeguards in
place,'' Tam said. ``They look at all the results on any given day
and scan for patterns. They also have a way to scan for Perl
scripts. They were very well aware of him from Day 1, and blocked
him out.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of what could have been the worst All-Star voting
scandal since 1957, when Cincinnati fans voted eight Reds as
starters on the National League team, leading commissioner Ford
Frick to take the voting away from the fans altogether, MLB claims
a clean election.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gehl is president of The Marketing Center (TMC), the
counting house that tabulated all the All-Star votes for Major
League Baseball. TMC is based in Brookfield, Conn., with offices in
Weymouth and Newport Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Gehl said Tuesday the Internet accounted for less than 20
percent of the vote. Most of the ballots counted in the last week
were cast at WalMart and Pepsi-Cola outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several million ballots, and they were sent in one
lump sum at the end of the program,'' Gehl said. ``We had three
shifts working last weekend, processing the ballots.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention, WalMart shoppers: The brand of choice, evidently, is
Garciaparra, who was in third place in the voting until the last
batch of votes were counted.
</P>
<P>
   Orwant, for one, remains unconvinced that the system can
withstand a clever hacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they claim their system is foolproof, they're wrong,'' he
said. ``I'll prove it to them next year.''

CELLUCCI SET TO NAME TOCCO HIGHER ED CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Governor Paul Cellucci plans to appoint Stephen P.
Tocco, former head of the port authority and a well-connected
political strategist, as chairman of the state's board of higher
education, administration sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is expected to make the announcement in the next
several days, but well-placed sources said that he had decided last
week to appoint Tocco, his close political adviser, to the powerful
education post.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the planned appointment stunned those in education
circles Tuesday night. In choosing Tocco, the governor is opting
for someone with strong political and adminstrative skills, but no
background in education, and a history of making headlines and
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Cellucci is convinced Tocco, 52, can provide the
leadership the governor wants to advance the administration's
higher education agenda. Tocco has a reputation for taking on tough
assignments, butting heads with opponents, and battling special
interests, most notably the state's labor establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good leader,'' said one top administration source
familiar with the governor's thinking. ``We need leadership and he
can drive the agenda for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though unpaid, the chairman's post is among the most prominent
in the administration, with responsibility for the state's public
colleges and university system.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci had been struggling to choose a successor to James F.
Carlin, who chaired the board for 3 1/2 years. The governor sought
to appoint Charles D. Baker Jr., his former secretary of
administration and finance, to the job.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker pulled himself out of the running when he took over as
president and CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, the beleaguered
health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   Tocco, who served in the Weld/Cellucci adminstration as
secretary of economic affairs and earlier as a senior aide to
former governor William F. Weld, now heads a public strategy and
lobbying unit at one of Boston's major law firms, Mintz Levin Cohn
Ferris Glovsky &AMP; Popeo.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci first brought Tocco into state government in 1991, and
promoted his advancement in the Weld/Cellucci admininistration.
Their relationship dates back to Cellucci's days as a legislator,
when Tocco headed the state's building contractors association.
</P>
<P>
   But as head of Associated Builders &AMP; Contractors, Tocco deeply
alienated the state's labor unions by pushing to roll back certain
wage laws.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci brought Tocco into the Weld/Cellucci inner circle in
the 1990 campaign, but immediately his divisive style _ and what
some call an outsized ego _ created friction. Weld and Cellucci
handed him major assignments after they took office, and Tocco's
personality again generated strong resentment, this time among
other top administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Weld, who had taken control of the Massachusetts Port
Authority board, engineered Tocco's appointment as the agency's
executive director. There, Tocco launched the $1 billion-plus
renovation of Logan Airport and concentrated on developing the
seaport.
</P>
<P>
   But he also tried to quarterback the development of megaplex for
South Boston, at times crossing swords with former Senate president
William M. Bulger, who is now president of the University of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Tocco was too close to Patriots owner Robert Kraft,
and that he was trying to strong-arm the South Boston community
into swallowing a new football stadium on Massport land.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Tocco, Cellucci is turning to someone with political
skills but with no significant education experience. While Carlin,
too, had a business background, he had served on the University of
Massachusetts board of trustees for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spencer, a current board of higher education member and
the entrepreneur behind the Pizzeria Uno empire, reportedly was
interested in assuming the chairmanship. But some said Spencer
would not command the same headlines and high profile needed to
succeed in the job.
</P>
<P>
   The new chairman inherits a 29-campus system _ with 175,000
students on five UMass campuses as well as state and community
colleges _ largely in good health.
</P>
<P>
   Applications are breaking records at UMass, and the quality of
students is higher than ever. The board has cut tuition for four
straight years, while the average price of public universities and
colleges nationwide has continued to rise about 4 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts board has also won nationwide acclaim for
eliminating remedial education at state universities and state
colleges, referring unprepared students to community colleges
instead.
</P>
<P>
   But not insignificantly, Tocco also faces a union alienated by
Carlin, whose reputation as a change agent was largely due to his
willingness to battle head to head with the state's professors. An
extension on the state college professors' contract expired at the
end of last month, and the past year of negotiations has been
largely hostile and unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin and the state's higher education chancellor, Stanley Z.
Koplik, have called repeatedly for reducing the number of tenured
professors in the state's schools, which have a higher rate of
tenured faculty than universities and colleges nationwide. Carlin
also suggested increased teaching loads.
</P>
<P>
   The unions, in turn, accused Carlin of doing nothing but
constantly attacking them. They derided him as an ``insurance
salesman,'' referring to the insurance company that is part of his
multimillion dollar network of successful businesses. In firing
back at him, the unions often said Carlin had no experience in
education, and insisted that just as they wouldn't tell him how to
make his money, he shouldn't tell them how to run their campuses.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ Mia Hamm did the unthinkable Tuesday, she
took the day off.
</P>
<P>
   Not from training, jogging around or joking with teammates, just
from the dozens of camera crews and journalists that have become
Mia's very own Paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   She's a national icon now, bigger than she ever imagined. She
never looked for celebrity status, commercials with Michael Jordan
or a Nike building with her picture on it _ it all just came.
</P>
<P>
   Why? She asks the same question's sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why all this happened to me,'' said Hamm earlier
this month. ``All I can say is that when I go out, I play as hard
as I can. I play with intensity, emotion and passion. I can't
change that, it's who I am. It's the only way I've known how to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that grabs the attention of some, if people enjoy it, then
that's great for this game and great for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Those around her, the rest of the U.S. women's national team,
are not that humble speaking of Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows she's the best in the world, but she won't admit
it,'' said defender Lorrie Fair. ``She'll always put it on our
team. She'll say, `oh, our team made me this way.' Well, yeah Mia,
but you're a big reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her status could hit epic proportions this weekend if the
Americans defeat China in the Women's World Cup final at the Rose
Bowl. Should Hamm score, her patented wide-mouthed, fist-pumping
celebration will hit every highlight reel from here to the 2000
Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said it won't change
her at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has so many wonderful qualities,'' said DiCicco.
``One is how humble she is. In a day and age where athletes expect
accolades, Mia is the opposite. She always refers back to our team
accomplishing these things. It's sincere, it's not rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many other wonderful qualities to Hamm, like the one
fellow striker Tiffeny Milbrett described, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you about Mia,'' she said. ``Last night she asked
me if I wanted to get some Indian Food. I was just tired and said,
`don't worry about me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So she goes by herself and an hour later I get a knock on my
door and it's Mia. She brought me half of her dinner. It wasn't
that I was shocked, but it was just one of those kind and warm
gesture's. She didn't have to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think above it all, you forget sometimes that behind this
superstar is just a kind, warm-hearted person. I think if anything,
that's what people should know about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me she's just a total prankster,'' said Tisha Venturini.
``She's a jokester, comedian, always making fun of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, she does this Scottish accent she learned from a
friend back in college. It's actually very good, you know, this
girl has these hidden talents people don't know about.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hamm's not dishing it out, however, her team is.
</P>
<P>
   She may be the biggest thing to hit women's sports since Mary
Lou or Billie Jean, but on this team, she's just one of the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tease her and that's what makes her so appealing,''
said goalkeeper Briana Scurry. ``All the fame she's had hasn't gone
to her head, which allows us to have fun with her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I give her a hard time about that Pert commercial.
It didn't look anything like her. They put so much make-up on that
girl I couldn't recognize her. She's throwing her hair around,
tossing it all over, it just wasn't the Mia we know.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there's the practical jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rearrange her chair in the locker room all the time,'' said
Fair. ``When the media comes in, we'll put her chair way back in
the corner to get her away from us. We don't want to get trampled
on.''
</P>
<P>
   And the bus rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time we were on the bus to one of the stadiums and there
was a girl wearing Mia's jersey,'' said Cindy Parlow. ``She had
brown hair like Mia, kind of similar looking, and Carla (Overbeck)
start's banging on the window screaming Mia's name.

<P>
   `Hey look everyone it's Mia, everybody look. Mia, Mia, Mia.' And
Mia just laughs along with us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Hamm wants it. Any other way she would be just a big
fake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want what's happening to ever change the way I treat
people,'' said Hamm. ``I've had a lot of people who have been very
helpful to me growing up, and I want to maintain the same
perspective that I had from when I started playing the sport to
when I leave it.''

IN RUSSIA, BUSINESSMEN RATHER GIVE TO CHARITY THAN PAY TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN VAROLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Businessmen are often vilified in
Russia as exploiters, who flout tax laws and played a role in last
August's financial crash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of them, from small shop owners to leading tycoons,
have been making significant contributions to nonprofit causes _
sponsoring culture and education, sporting events, helping the poor
and supporting religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many Russian businessmen may be simply using a tactic
well known to their counterparts in the West: Showering money on
worthy causes can often improve a businessman's poor reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many have earned their money in dubious ways, but it's better
that they give away something than nothing at all,'' said Daniil
Granin, 80, a leading Russian writer and an activist in the rebirth
of the country's charitable sector in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Potanin, a wealthy executive who runs a
financial-industrial group called Interros, donated $1.4 million to
support the reconstruction of the Rostral Columns, one of St.
Petersburg's most venerable historic landmarks. This donation is
the largest made by a Russian company or individual since 1917.
</P>
<P>
   In November, when organizers of the Kremlin Cup tennis
tournament thought the event would fall through, Alfa Bank,
controlled by another leading Russian businessman, Mikhail Fridman,
stepped in with $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky, now the target
of a criminal investigation for his business dealings, sponsored
the seventh annual Triumph Prize, awarded to leading cultural
figures. Five winners shared $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Culture is the prime beneficiary of Russian corporate charity.
Last year in St. Petersburg, there were 53 festivals of theater,
music, dance, film and opera, but only three were fully financed by
the city government. Financing for the rest came from private
corporations, most of them Russian.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from eight years ago, when the government was
the only source of financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich people in Russia are becoming educated and understand
that they must invest in the future of their children and
country,'' said Vladimir Yakovlev, deputy governor of St.
Petersburg and head of the city Culture Committee. ``Historically,
going back to czarist times, support of culture was always a
foremost consideration among the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   There is hardly a commercial entity in Russia, no matter how
small, that does not engage in some nonprofit activity, and if not
with donations of cash, then with goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible to give an exact picture of Russian
corporate charity because so much of it goes unaccounted for in the
shadow economy, just like business itself,'' said Eduard Fomin, a
sociologist who has been studying corporate charity in Russia since
1995, and who works at the Center of Independent Sociological
Research in St. Petersburg. According to Fomin's research, between
five-tenths of a percent and 3.5 percent of a Russian company's
income goes to a nonprofit purpose.
</P>
<P>
   This past winter, when the Moscow and St. Petersburg chapters of
the Salvation Army appealed for help, most who came forward were
midsized and small Russian companies, making donations of food,
clothing and blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Donations jumped 60 percent over last year's drive, said Capt.
Joseph Smith, regional head of the Salvation Army's social services
in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Before the revolution in 1917, giving to noble causes was common
among Russia's aristocracy and commercial elite. The Tretyakov Art
Museum in Moscow, for example, bears the name of the late 19th
century industrialist who founded and sponsored it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, many foreigners of
Russian descent have played an important role bringing charity back
to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Russian banker, Boris Jordan, is one such person. A
descendant of a long line of military officers who were forced to
leave Russia after 1917, the American-born Jordan moved to Russia
in 1992 to run Credit Suisse First Boston's Moscow office. A few
years later, he started his own company, Renaissance Capital, now
known as MFK Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Jordan's support has gone to Russia's military cadets,
and he has donated more than a half million dollars to repair their
crumbling schools, provide text books and buy new uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Assistance to children is another focus of corporate largess.
Lukoil, Russia's leading oil company, sponsors three orphanages in
the oil-rich Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug in western Siberia, a
children's hospital, and assistance to the aged, physically
impaired and refugees from the rebellious province of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russian companies acknowledge that projecting a positive
corporate image is an important consideration in their charitable
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company provides support to culture and sport because we
understand that it is necessary to help during these difficult
times in Russia,'' said Taimuraz Bolloyev, general director of
Baltika Breweries, one of Russia's most successful enterprises.
``Yet, we do not deny that such actions do improve the reputation
of Baltika.''
</P>
<P>
   Others give to charity for another reason. They would rather do
that than pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businessmen prefer giving directly to nonprofit causes because
they see where the money goes,'' Fomin said. ``If they would pay
that amount in taxes, the money only disappears into the
government's black hole.''

ALASKA SEAFOOD INDUSTRY BEGINS EDUCATION CAMPAIGN ON TYPES OF
SALMON SOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Headlines report a $400 million effort to save salmon
on the Columbia and Snake rivers. Others announce that the United
States and Canada agree on an urgent plan to rescue salmon runs in
Washington, Oregon and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Still others tell readers there are other threats to Pacific
Northwest salmon, such as Caspian terns feasting on young salmon in
Washington rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute says consumers are
confused about whether it is OK for them to eat salmon because they
fear threatening and endangering the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska salmon is different, they say, and they have begun a
$250,000 public relations campaign to carry their message to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   An in-depth research project conducted for the institute
indicates that consciencous Americans _ including many in the
Pacific Northwest _ don't know Alaska salmon isn't threatened or
endangered, said Barbara Belknap, the institute's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``How ironic it would be if Americans quit eating all-natural
salmon, thinking it was endangered _ as has happened with tuna and
swordfish _ when last year 150 million Alaska salmon were harvested
and 100 million more made it upstream to spawn,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to us that people understand we're sensitive to
the fisheries problems in the Pacific Northwest and we don't want
to come off as saying we got salmon and you don't. We are aware and
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who conducted interviews in Seattle, New York,
Atlanta and Chicago found that people, especially in Seattle, were
aware of the threats to salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   But they were lumping Alaska salmon with problems in Oregon and
Washington fisheries, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Seattle especially are very sophisticated salmon
buyers and they would go into the supermarket and see the case
filled with salmon but they were concerned,'' Belknap said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to conduct an education campaign before it began to
affect sales. We wanted to be pro-active.''
</P>
<P>
   Among information distributed by the institute are these items:
</P>
<P>
   _No salmon stock of Alaska origin is threatened or endangered.
</P>
<P>
   _Alaska has only three dams in the entire state and more than
15,000 salmon streams.
</P>
<P>
   _Alaska's seafood industry, much of it operated by owners of
small boats, is the state's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Marshall, a fisheries biologist and regional supervisor at
the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said Alaska has had
``nearly 15 years of record commercial salmon catches and last year
it declined a bit back down to a normal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has programs assuring salmon management and escapement
and balancing the catch against the escapement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's salmon rivers are pristine and free of dams, he said.
Fresh and ocean waters offer excellent habitat for salmon, and
Alaska, with a statewide population of about 600,000, is thousands
of miles away from large sources of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Smitch, Washington Gov. Gary Locke's special assistant for
natural resources, said it is accurate that the public is confused
about salmon, the differences between distinct runs and differences
in habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they (Alaska fisheries management experts) try to
do a good job and manage their escapement goals and most of their
watershed doesn't have the damage we do from hydro dams and
habitat, although they are moving in that direction in some of
their more urban areas,'' Smitch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, their (Alaska's) stocks are in pretty good
shape. But during the last round of negotiations on the U.S. and
Canada treaty, it was stated that in Southeast Alaska, the chinook
that they are fishing aren't their fish. They came from Washington
and Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Management Council is managing the harvest of fish
to better match escapement from sources in Alaska, British
Columbia, Washington and Oregon, Smitch said.

PHENICIE'S JOB IN LIMBO AT CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The status of CSUN assistant football coach Rob
Phenicie is unknown and not even head coach Ron Ponciano knows if
Phenicie will be on his staff this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, reports surfaced that Phenicie, the Matadors'
offensive coordinator, would leave the program and that Ponciano's
status at the school was in jeopardy. The program has been under
investigation for alleged rules violations.
</P>
<P>
   Phenicie, on the recommendation of his lawyer, said Tuesday he
would not comment. A school spokesmen said Phenicie was still with
the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Phenicie) will continue to be on the university's payroll and
at this moment, he is on vacation,'' said the CSUN Public
Information Office's John Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano, meanwhile, will fight for his reputation Friday when
he meets with investigators for just the second time since the
probe began more than a month ago. On May 19th, the school's
athletic program received an anonymous letter alleging infractions,
initiating an investigation by a campus board of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not anxious to talk to them, I am  &UR; !ital! &LR; excited to talk
to them,'' Ponciano said. ``I am going to go in there and fight
because I know who I am and the type of principles I have. After
they've heard all the voices, some of those that were tied to or
linked to the whole anonymous (letter), I think it's about time
that I've finally got a chance to be listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said he has not received a clear answer from the school
regarding Phenicie's status, adding the month-long investigation
has hurt the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person I talk to (about Phenicie), I get a different
answer,'' Ponciano said. ``Depending on who you talk to, I've
either lost (my) best coach, and (or) some kids want to leave (the
program).
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's a hit that not many programs can recover
from. But if there is one program (that can), it is Northridge,
because these kids are used to dealing with adversity.''

WOMAN'S SUICIDE ADDS BIZARRE LIGHT ON INSURANCE FRAUD INQUIRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Miss . )   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, a young woman named Frances Burge was found dead
in Greenwich, Conn., hanging by a rope from the deck of a luxurious
house.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the death, ruled a suicide, was a personal
tragedy, the sad end to a troubled life.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, Miss Burge's death, and the year leading up to
it, provide an unusual insight into the life of a shadowy
businessman now being sought by federal authorities. They say the
businessman, Martin R. Frankel, defrauded insurance companies in
several states of hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich police, and parents and friends of several women he
employed, also say Frankel's personal life was as complicated and
unusual as his financial dealings, involving many women and
sadomasochistic sex behind the walls of his Greenwich mansion.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Miss Burge was at the bottom of the Greenwich
pyramid. She went to work for Frankel as a gal Friday, hoping to
fulfill her dreams of money and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter was young, she made some foolish mistakes,'' her
mother, Gabriella Burge, said in an interview. ``She attracted the
wrong men. She wanted to be wanted. It makes me very sad for the
lonely girl. She was looking to better herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her experiences working for Frankel, as told by her mother,
friends and police records, offer one of the first pictures of a
life style that blended the trappings of Wall Street with the
sprawling excesses of a well-heeled commune.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Burge, 22 when she died, answered an ad in The Village
Voice placed by Frankel in summer 1996. By September she was
working at his mansion, running errands for a household of female
friends and co-workers. She told friends she was learning the stock
business.
</P>
<P>
   She does not appear to have played any role in what federal
authorities say were Frankel's intricate financial schemes. Nor,
she told her mother, was she involved in the sadomasochistic sexual
practices that the police say Frankel favored in his Greenwich
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not psychologically prepared inside for this
situation, for this life situation,'' said Vera Mirnova, Frankel's
Russian housekeeper. ``She was a very nice girl, but she got into
something she was not prepared for.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Burge, from the blue-collar village of Shirley, N.Y.,
was born in 1974 to a Jewish mother and a Mormon father and was
baptized a Mormon at 4.
</P>
<P>
   According to her mother and police records, Miss Burge's
teen-age years on Long Island were marked by a suicide attempt,
hospitalization for depression, a pregnancy (she gave up her baby
for adoption) and a period of living in a homeless shelter with her
mother after her parents separated.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Miss Burge had received a high school equivalency
diploma and was working at a Blockbuster video store in Shirley.
She was living with her father in town when she saw an ad in The
Village Voice and replied.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, a black limousine sent by Frankel appeared at her
house in Shirley and took her to Greenwich for what she told her
mother was a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Miss Burge described what happened. Her mother
said that Frankel served her dinner at a long table and then asked
her to disrobe. She complied, her mother said, but she did not get
the job.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation into the suicide, Frankel gave the
Greenwich police a different account. ``During that evening,
Frances had taken her clothes off and wanted to have sex,'' he told
police, ``but I did not want to.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Frankel decided to hire Frances Burge after
all. She told her mother she was working as an office assistant for
a millionaire independent investor.
</P>
<P>
   She moved into one of Frankel's mansions. Mrs. Mirnova said as
many as 100 people worked in a nearby mansion, including cooks,
assistants and computer workers. A phone directory for the house
from 1997 lists the numbers and beepers for 42 people.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel had 80 computers and a fiber optic line installed at the
mansion, according to court papers. But it is not clear what
business transactions, if any, he conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Burge, Frances Burge's father, told the police during
the investigation that his daughter complained of not being paid
regularly. She was occasionally given traveler's checks or cash, he
said, and had to keep receipts for everything she purchased.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who said she was hired as an office consultant said
that she saw only benign eccentricity. ``They were all kooky, and
the reason they hired me was to organize,'' she said. ``There was
no toilet paper, but there were 40 cans of tuna fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Greenwich changed Miss Burge. She returned to Shirley
for visits, and her former co-workers at Blockbuster recall that
the overweight woman who never tucked in her shirt was wearing
makeup now, her hair in a French braid, a slimmer physique visible
in a new exercise suit. She drove a Champagne-colored sedan and
carried a pager and a cell phone. She boasted of shuttling to a
Manhattan apartment, shopping without limits and deciding what
investments Frankel should make.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Mrs. Burge visited her daughter, and while Miss Burge
refused to take her inside the mansion, saying it was forbidden,
they drove by. As the months wore on, Mrs. Burge said that her
daughter said she had tried to learn more about sadomasochism,
visiting a Manhattan club, the Vault, with Frankel's girlfriends.
``She said, `Marty promised to teach me,' Mrs. Burge recalled.
``And I kept saying, `What is there to learn?'''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, on Mother's Day, Miss Burge returned home for a
final visit. She told her mother she felt empty and depressed. She
also referred to knowing that Frankel was doing ``something
wrong,'' Mrs. Burge recalled.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, one of Frankel's office workers stepped outside the
mansion and found Ms.Burge hanging by a noose from a beam of the
elevated deck.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenwich police report notes the presence of
sadomasochistic paraphernalia, including ropes, a riding crop and
videotapes. The police interviewed Frankel, his employees, Miss
Burge's psychiatrist and her parents. They did not speak to any of
Frankel's neighbors, one of whom later relayed to federal
authorities that he had heard female screams the day Miss Burge
died. It was not clear whether that information was given to
Greenwich police.
</P>
<P>
   The police defended their two-month investigation, saying they
had found out enough to rule the death a suicide. Police officials
said their inquiry confirmed Ms. Burge had a history of depression
and was on anti-depressant medication. A toxicology and autopsy
report led them to rule the cause of death as asphyxiation by
hanging.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Miss Burge's death, her parents sifted through
her belongings in her room. They found a completed application to
Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., her mother said. The bible she
had kept since childhood was missing.
</P>
<P>
   While his staff prepared a buffet meal for Miss Burge's parents,
Frankel remained elusive. Mrs. Burge said she asked Karen Timmins,
identified in Greenwich police reports as Frankel's office manager,
if she could meet her daughter's boss. According to Mrs. Burge, Ms.
Timmins said: ``Well, Marty is very busy. The market crashed the
night before.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who lived and worked at the house attended the
funeral in Shirley. Frankel did not show up.

 &HT;    Good day for Lopez's knee
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Javy Lopez breathed a small sigh of relief Tuesday,
feeling a little better about his sprained right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to make it back,'' said Lopez, who was
diagnosed with a slight ligament tear in a recent MRI exam.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez had expressed fears Monday that the injury, suffered in
Arizona on June 20 sliding into second base, might sideline him the
rest of the season. After running on it Tuesday, including some
hard sprints, cutting and quick stops, he was more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed because I thought it would hurt,'' said Lopez,
who said he felt some pain but it was minimal. ``The question is
tomorrow, to see how it feels once it quiets down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez plans to test it more today by squatting to catch for the
first time. He did some hitting for the first time Monday. He said
having his knee on his back leg injured doesn't limit him hitting
as much as it would if it were his front leg.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez expects to be out at least until after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more beneficial to me because I'd like to go out there
and play, not 100 percent healthy, but close to it,'' Lopez said.
``I don't want to go out now and the next day hurt myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Star waiting
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan and Kevin Millwood are eagerly awaiting word of
today's All-Star reserve announcements, but they're trying not to
get their hopes up. The Braves' two best All-Star candidates got a
little boost upon learning that National League manager Bruce Bochy
called Braves manager Bobby Cox Monday and talked to him about
Jordan and Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Millwood's favor are his top-10 rankings in the
National League in wins (tied for fifth with 10) and ERA (sixth
with 3.30).
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be disappointed a little (if I don't make it),''
Millwood said. ``I feel like I've got a good chance to be there.
But it's not my decision. ... I'm trying not to think about it too
much, get my hopes up. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, I don't
want to be bummed out over the All-Star break.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan finished eighth in the outfield voting with 390,795 but
is tied for fifth in the National League in RBIs with 68. Jordan
was snubbed last year by National League manager Jim Leyland
despite leading the league in hitting at the time with a .339
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even worried about it,'' said Jordan, who's ready to
cancel plans for a family trip to Disney World in exchange for a
trip to Boston. ``Whatever happens, happens. Last year I was
anxious and disappointed. No sense in getting anxious this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon to undergo MRI exam
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Randall Simon is scheduled to have an MRI exam on
his left knee today as a precautionary measure. He injured it
sliding home in the Astrodome three weeks ago and has been playing
on it since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hurts,'' Simon said. ``Every day when I wake up, it's
stiff. But I come in here, get in the whirlpool and loosen it up
and it feels better. I'll go check it out. The doctor has told me
even if something's wrong, I can still go through the season, then
after the season get (surgery).''
</P>
<P>
   Chen will start Friday
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen arrived in Atlanta on Tuesday after getting word at 1
a.m. he'd again be replacing John Smoltz, who's back on the
disabled list with an inflamed right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Chen last pitched for AAA Richmond on Sunday, which works out
well if he's to fill in for Smoltz in his turn in the rotation
Friday, which Cox indicated he planned to do.
</P>
<P>
   Chen got a no-decision in each of two May starts for Atlanta,
allowing six runs in 12 innings. He had one poor start in Richmond
after being sent back but won three starts after that. His focus
has been on keeping his pitches down and being more consistent with
his offspeed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going to be nervous,'' Chen said of his seventh
major league start. ``But it's not going to be like the first time
I came up (last September).

ALASKA SEAFOOD INDUSTRY BEGINS EDUCATION CAMPAIGN ON TYPES OF
SALMON SOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Headlines report a $400 million effort to save salmon
on the Columbia and Snake rivers. Others announce that the United
States and Canada agree on an urgent plan to rescue salmon runs in
Washington, Oregon and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Still others tell readers there are other threats to Pacific
Northwest salmon, such as Caspian terns feasting on young salmon in
Washington rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute says consumers are
confused about whether it is OK for them to eat salmon because they
fear threatening and endangering the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska salmon is different, they say, and they have begun a
$250,000 public relations campaign to carry their message to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   An in-depth research project conducted for the institute
indicates that consciencous Americans _ including many in the
Pacific Northwest _ don't know Alaska salmon isn't threatened or
endangered, said Barbara Belknap, the institute's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``How ironic it would be if Americans quit eating all-natural
salmon, thinking it was endangered _ as has happened with tuna and
swordfish _ when last year 150 million Alaska salmon were harvested
and 100 million more made it upstream to spawn,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to us that people understand we're sensitive to
the fisheries problems in the Pacific Northwest and we don't want
to come off as saying we got salmon and you don't. We are aware and
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who conducted interviews in Seattle, New York,
Atlanta and Chicago found that people, especially in Seattle, were
aware of the threats to salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   But they were lumping Alaska salmon with problems in Oregon and
Washington fisheries, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Seattle especially are very sophisticated salmon
buyers and they would go into the supermarket and see the case
filled with salmon but they were concerned,'' Belknap said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to conduct an education campaign before it began to
affect sales. We wanted to be pro-active.''
</P>
<P>
   Among information distributed by the institute are these items:
</P>
<P>
   _No salmon stock of Alaska origin is threatened or endangered.
</P>
<P>
   _Alaska has only three dams in the entire state and more than
15,000 salmon streams.
</P>
<P>
   _Alaska's seafood industry, much of it operated by owners of
small boats, is the state's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Marshall, a fisheries biologist and regional supervisor at
the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said Alaska has had
``nearly 15 years of record commercial salmon catches and last year
it declined a bit back down to a normal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has programs assuring salmon management and escapement
and balancing the catch against the escapement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's salmon rivers are pristine and free of dams, he said.
Fresh and ocean waters offer excellent habitat for salmon, and
Alaska, with a statewide population of about 600,000, is thousands
of miles away from large sources of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Smitch, Washington Gov. Gary Locke's special assistant for
natural resources, said it is accurate that the public is confused
about salmon, the differences between distinct runs and differences
in habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they (Alaska fisheries management experts) try to
do a good job and manage their escapement goals and most of their
watershed doesn't have the damage we do from hydro dams and
habitat, although they are moving in that direction in some of
their more urban areas,'' Smitch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, their (Alaska's) stocks are in pretty good
shape. But during the last round of negotiations on the U.S. and
Canada treaty, it was stated that in Southeast Alaska, the chinook
that they are fishing aren't their fish. They came from Washington
and Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Management Council is managing the harvest of fish
to better match escapement from sources in Alaska, British
Columbia, Washington and Oregon, Smitch said.

FILMMAKERS OF `BLAIR WITCH PROJECT' SAY EMOTION WAS KEY TO SCARY
MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The premise is simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, 1994, three Montgomery College film students hike
into Maryland's Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary on the
local legend, ``the Blair Witch.'' They disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, their film footage is found. It may be simple, but
it's a premise that warrants goosebumps even in the telling. It's
as chilling onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' moved critic Roger Ebert to write:
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time you went to a movie and were actually
scared? Not spooked, shocked or having fun at being scared, but
completely horrified?''
</P>
<P>
   It's also taken on a life of its own, achieving near-cult status
with a Web site and hundreds of fans tapping into the history and
mythology of the Blair Witch even before the film opens in theaters
on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   This ``virtual reality'' phenomenon and scarefest is the
brainchild of two young University of Central Florida film
graduates, Dan Myrick and Ed Sanchez, who have known each other
since 1990 and who still call Orlando home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met at film school, first semester,'' says Sanchez who,
with Myrick, recently visited Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is the more outgoing of the duo and he shoots from the
hip with his stream-of-consciousness opinions. Myrick is thoughtful
and reserved. They have a finely balanced relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best stuff comes when Ed comes to me with an idea. It's a
natural collaboration and makes the end product of what we do
individually even better,'' says Myrick.
</P>
<P>
   The two would be thrilled if their film became a regular on the
midnight movie circuit and they're also happy about the early,
positive praise after a screening shook up the Sundance Film
Festival in January. Yet they're wary of the overly lavish hype
that can kill a small film with unreal expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an experimental film,'' reminds Sanchez. ``We shot it
in October of '97. We shot it in only eight days. But we started
casting it in 1996. We thought of the idea in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a year to edit because the pair had 20 hours of footage,
all shot in real time in the forest and in a car.
</P>
<P>
   It also took a year to cast because they needed actors with
exceptionally strong improvisational skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a film where we essentially threw our actors out there
in the woods and let them make our movie for us,'' laughs Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Myrick says they were initially concerned with the big buzz at
Sundance because ``at the time we didn't want to let people down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse to build a thing up and be let down than to not
expect anything. We're just happy the hype control mechanism is in
place as much as it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he notes proudly ``The Blair Witch Project'' is one of
the few times ``where a movie is just one part of an overall
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We created a realm that people can interact with, especially
with the Web site. There's even a comic book coming out. It's
become an alternate world that the movie itself is just a part of.
It proves if something is cool, entertaining and insightful as well
as emotional, people will engage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez enthuses, ``There's even a guy at a software company who
has 1,500 employees and he's downloaded `Blair Witch' screensavers
on their computers and he's giving his employees the Friday opening
a half day off so they can go see the film.''
</P>
<P>
   All for a little movie based on old '70s TV shows like ``In
Search Of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' admits Sanchez. ``Anything with Big Foot, the Loch
Ness monster or the yeti ... scenes with UFOs. That inspired us
more than any conventional film.''
</P>
<P>
   So what, besides the fascination with being scared to death,
makes this movie so different from say, ``Scream'' or ``Nightmare
On Elm Street?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to scare people on film, the first couple movies
in a series are a trick,'' notes Sanchez. ```Blair' throws the
rules away and says you can't expect anything because you don't
know what's coming. There are no flags or triggers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done,'' explains Myrick, ``is make an emotional
film. It operates on an emotional level. A lot of films coming out
now are full of techno-wizardry and that's cool if you're an
animator, but good films, whether scary, funny or whatever, tap
into some key emotional core.''
</P>
<P>
   The star of too many Hollywood horror films is no longer the
horror, Sanchez says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a monster, the star, the effects and that's not what
scares you. It's impressive, it looks nice. But what it ultimately
means when there's so much special effect is the filmmakers don't
trust their audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a prime directive to keep it real,'' says Myrick. ``We
also discussed `what do we show if we don't show the monster'? We
built this reality process and then trusted the instincts of our
actors. We hoped that the reality-based way we shot the film would
be scary. We took a risk. In the end it was what we wanted in that
we captured the moments off-camera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear is a lot easier to capture than drama or comedy because
it's primal,'' he adds. ``I mean, what scares the hell out of you?
It's universal. We've not all been in love but we've all been
scared. I love to hear about people, after they've seen the film,
who have some sense memory about a recollection from childhood. And
that's what the movie does. There's something subtextual about
knowing what happens to these people in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez says they'll take the same approach no matter what kind
of movie they make together.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at the heart of a film?'' he asks. ``Our next movie is
a comedy. So we ask each other `what makes us laugh?' We basically
just strip away the rules. If the film winds up following
convention, it does. There's no formula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, we weren't taken seriously before `Blair' and we
didn't ever take ourselves seriously. We just wanted to prove we
aren't afraid to take chances. More than being thought of as
directors, I'd just like our production company, Haxan, to be
thought of as a place where you can't predict what's coming next.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrick adds, ``Yeah, where no matter what, if you see one of our
movies you'll know we had our hearts in what we did. It may flop,
it may not, but it'll be a ride. That's what I like about Jim
Jarmusch and John Sayles. They take chances and you have to respect
that. That's all I can ask for.''

   BOEING-RACE (Seattle) _ The U.S. Labor Department said it sued
The Boeing Co. on Tuesday, alleging the aerospace giant had denied
access to documents linked to a race discrimination complaint. As a
federal contractor, Boeing is prohibited from racial, sexual and
other forms of discrimination against employees. It is the
second-largest U.S. defense contractor, receiving $11 billion in
government contracts in fiscal 1998.

   BUS-AFTERMATH (Seattle) _ At 3 p.m. the day after Thanksgiving
1998, a gunman put a bullet in the driver of a Metro bus, sending
the bus off the Aurora Bridge and triggering a chain of events that
would test the limits of Seattle's emergency medical services. The
lessons learned in the 1 hour and 17 minutes it took to respond to
the scene, secure, treat and transport all injured passengers have
already changed some of the Seattle Fire Department's procedures.
In the emergency response community around the nation, there has
been steady interest in how the bus incident was handled and what
could be learned from it.

state-owned forest at the northeast corner of the Cascade Range has
reached $13.1 million. While it appears to have saved the Loomis
Forest from logging, the campaign hasn't made it entirely out of
the woods yet. The state must complete one final appraisal of the
remote forest before the state Board of Natural Resources can
approve the buyup of logging rights to the remote land.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. is hoping
there will be no repeat of what happened during his appearance at
last year's All-Star Game in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who received more votes than anyone this season
(2,918,055), was named an American League starting outfielder
Monday. He will be making his 10th All-Star appearance next week in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Griffey originally elected not to participate in the
home run-hitting contest. He later decided to take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Gonzalez and Sammy Sosa didn't participate last year and
they didn't get hammered like I did in the newspapers and they
didn't get booed by the fans,'' Griffey said prior to Tuesday's
game against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of friends told me what happened after I left
(Denver). The fan reaction came from one of Colorado's owners, who
called a couple of radio stations and told the fans to boo me.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey did not say on Tuesday whether he intended to
participate in this year's contest.
</P>
<P>
   __ Trade winds: Angels pitcher Chuck Finley will be making one
of the more important starts of his career Friday in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, in the thick of trade rumors, has given up 21 earned
runs in his last 112/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss to explain why,'' Finley said. ``The last three
starts, I have been brutal. I mean absolutely terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins already has prepped Finley for his start
in hitter-friendly Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get to Colorado on Friday, I told him he needs to get
ahead in the count,'' Collins said. ``As a manager, there are
things that are out of my control (such as trade talk). We want to
get Chuck back on track. We need him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Salmon swings: Outfielder Tim Salmon, out of the lineup since
May 3 with a sprained left wrist, took swings off a batting tee
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did take some dry swings, but there is no timetable,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Also: Seattle rookie Gil Meche was the 23rd Mariners pitcher
to take the mound this season, tops in the big leagues. The club
record is 25. Seattle has used 11 rookies as well. . . . The Angels
optioned left-handed pitcher Mike Holtz to Triple-A Edmonton
following Monday's loss. That opened the slot for Mike Fyhrie, who
made his debut Tuesday.

   NEW YORK _ As much of the eastern United States sagged Tuesday
under a second day of record high temperatures, officials
attributed a number of deaths to the heat, and the New York region
struggled with maddening power failures that trapped people in
stifling elevators, cut air-conditioning to thousands of homes and
commercial buildings, and knocked out some subway service.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulance crews in New York City responded Tuesday to more than
160 calls from people complaining of cramps and exhaustion from the
heat, and emergency officials said the heat may have contributed to
a number of heart attacks and at least three deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service reported that the temperature in
Central Park reached 101 degrees at 3:11 p.m. Tuesday, breaking the
record of 98 degrees for the date set in 1986. Temperatures were
expected to moderate this week with a cool front moving through the
region Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Summer school was canceled in Washington on Tuesday, the lights
were dimmed in much of the Massachusetts Statehouse and block
captains checked on the elderly in Philadelphia's row houses.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said, ``This is one of the
more difficult days the city has ever had in regard to heat.'' He
canceled a political fund-raising trip to Nantucket in
Massachusetts to deal with the heat emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's first confirmed heat-related death, an autopsy
Tuesday revealed that Julia Johnson, 79, of Manhattan had died of
hyperthermia on Monday, said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the
office of chief medical examiner. Mrs. Johnson was found
unconscious at home by a health care worker.
</P>
<P>
   Her body temperature was 108.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said two other people may have died from the heat. They
were described as a 40-year-old man whose Brooklyn home had a
temperature in excess of 108, and a 27-year-old man who died at
Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Their names were not released, but neighbors identified the
40-year-old as Samuel Mitchell, a handyman from the Park Slope
section of Brooklyn, who died early Tuesday morning at Brookdale
Hospital Medical Center. Neighbors were told that dehydration was
the cause of death. Herma Passely, 59, who shared a house with
Mitchell, said he never woke up after a back yard Fourth of July
party. ``He said he was tired, went to sleep early and that was
it,'' Mrs. Passely said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that while they expected the death toll to
climb, they were confident it would come nowhere near the hundreds
of deaths that Chicago experienced during a brutal heat wave in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``That number might grow a bit, but certainly it will not
approach what happened in the Midwest,'' said Jerome Hauer, the
director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave, combined with record demands for electricity, put
enormous pressure on the power system in the New York region and
elsewhere. Transformers overheated and burst into flames. Power
lines melted through from the heat and high use. In the dense
humidity, bolts of electricity arced across power lines, causing
short circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Utility companies first issued urgent appeals for customers to
conserve energy. Later, to ease the strain on power lines and
transformers and because of insufficient power reserves, the
companies reduced their voltage output by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, power failures were reported throughout New York City,
Long Island, Westchester County, New Jersey and Connecticut. At
least 150,000 people were affected, officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene McGrath, chairman of Con Edison, attributed the power
failures to equipment breakdowns, not the power cutback. ``Those
problems come about from the cables overheating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani scolded Con Edison officials for not giving city
officials more explicit warnings about the extent of the power
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Con Ed is its own entity unto itself, and sometimes they
notify us late and sometimes they notify us only when the problem
has already started,'' the mayor said. ``I think it's a cause of
great frustration, for me and my administration and every other
mayor that's ever had this job. They call you about 10 minutes
before there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City activated its emergency operations center Tuesday,
and Giuliani appealed for residents to avoid strenuous activity and
stay indoors near fans and air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember hotter days than the last several and
particularly hotter nights,'' he said at a news conference at City
Hall. ``We would like everyone to be very, very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, city ambulances respond to 3,000 calls a day, but
fire officials said they expected to handle more than 4,000 calls
Tuesday. ``It could be the busiest day in the department's
history,'' one fire official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great stress on our emergency system,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent cars from overheating in traffic, city officials shut
down some highway construction. To keep people from overheating,
sprinkler caps were placed on open fire hydrants, extra ambulances
were pressed into service, and cooling centers were opened in
dozens of senior citizen centers and community centers operated by
the New York City Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, officials opened 15 schools across the city where
anyone could sleep in the comfort of air-conditioning, Hauer said.
Cots, food and blankets were supplied by the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He and other city officials credited a heat plan devised in the
aftermath of the Chicago heat wave with averting a similar disaster
in New York City. Still, there were major concerns Tuesday night,
including worries about the low water pressure in some parts of the
city. The low pressure threatened to hamper firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal day, New York City consumes 1.2 billion gallons of
water. Tuesday, the city consumed about 1.8 billion gallons, much
of that additional use spilling from open fire hydrants, Hauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The high water consumption left some areas, especially in
Brooklyn, vulnerable to fire. ``There are some areas we are still
concerned about,'' Hauer said, adding that fire officials were
combating the problem by installing more sprinkler heads on
hydrants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to meteorologists, a heat wave of this size and
intensity requires three main ingredients, and all three were
present this week. The first two are clear skies and a large mass
of hot air. But the third ingredient is the most important: a wind
from the west, a wind that comes off the Catskills and the
Appalachian Mountains, compressing and heating as it descends, then
overwhelming the cooling on-shore breeze from the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of pattern that generates extreme heat across
the Northeast seaboard,'' said Todd Miner, a meteorologist for
Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tuesday was another day of unwelcome records, both
for weather observations and for power use. Though Tuesday's high
fell short of New York City's record of 106 in 1936, back-to-back
days of temperatures above 100 degrees are rare. The last time it
happened was in July 1993. On July 9 it was 101; the next day, it
was 102.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pleas to conserve energy, both Con Edison and the Long
Island Power Authority reported record demand for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, building managers embarked on ``load shedding''
_ shutting down two elevators in a bank of eight, or turning off
unneeded pumps and exhaust fans. On Long Island, officials
persuaded the Long Island Rail Road to slow the acceleration of its
electric trains, also to save power. But those actions were not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester County, 10,000 customers were without power late
Tuesday afternoon. Among the hardest hit were the towns of
Harrison, Rye, Port Chester and New Rochelle. The Westchester
Medical Center in Valhalla was forced to use backup power
generators.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, a spokesman for Public Service Electric and Gas
Co. said about 9,000 commercial and residential customers had no
power Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious incident, the spokesman said, the Englewood
Hospital was reported to be without power for a period because a
backup power generator failed. Fire officials there knew of no
deaths resulting from the power failure.
</P>
<P>
   And in Connecticut, most of the city of New London and parts of
several nearby communities _ about 20,000 residents _ were without
electricity Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only once in every five years would we see an equipment
failure that would be this significant,'' said Deborah Beauchamp, a
spokeswoman for Connecticut Light and Power.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, about 15,000
homes were without power.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, at several intersections in Washington Heights, teams
of officers were deployed with riot gear, night sticks and helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, tempers were fraying as the heat combined with
the effects of prolonged local blackouts. On Hillside Avenue, a
quiet residential street beneath one of the steep rock ridges
splitting the area, manholes popped at 11 p.m. Monday as short
circuits blew out power to several buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Two young women sat on a stoop, staring at a new Goldstar
air-conditioner still in its box. Lourdes Espinal, a 28-year-old
purchasing manager in Manhattan, laughed as she recalled how she
spent her lunch hour Tuesday hunting all over for an
air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't use it,'' she said ruefully. No electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The power failure forced sections of the subway to be closed.
Late Tuesday morning, the 1/9 train was closed from 168th Street to
242nd Street, and the A train was closed from 168th Street to 207th
Street.

EAST COAST MOBILIZES IN A BLOCK-BY-BLOCK RESISTANCE TO THE STIFLING
HEAT
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-HEAT, HEAT-ELECTRICITY) 
 (nk) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They canceled summer school here in the nation's
capital, dimmed the lights in much of the Massachusetts Statehouse
and sent block captains out to check on the elderly in
Philadelphia's row houses.
</P>
<P>
   Relief was in sight, the National Weather Service promised, but
much of the nation _ especially the mid-Atlantic region _ was still
staggering Tuesday under the unforgiving weight of a heat wave that
broke records, sent power use soaring and kept almost everybody
racing from one air-conditioned environment to another.
</P>
<P>
   Some, of course, didn't have that option, like William Gauthier,
a 27-year-old labor foreman on Boston's massive highway
construction project known as the Big Dig. He described working in
this heat as ``terrible,'' ``horrible'' and ``the most
uncomfortable feeling in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Livezey, senior research meteorologist at the Weather
Service's climate prediction center, said late Tuesday that ``it's
clear that tomorrow will not be as bad as today and conditions will
continue to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was scant solace in the here and now of a brutal
Tuesday. Jeff Moran, a spokesman for the Philadelphia Department of
Public Health, reported that there had been three heat-related
deaths there so far, all of them among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But officials there, and in Washington, said that they had
learned from the large number of heat-related deaths in the past
and were much better prepared for this heat wave. In Philadelphia,
people could call a special telephone number for advice on coping
with the heat _ and when warranted, be provided with checkups by a
nurse in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, Sam Jordan, director of the office of
emergency management, said officials were working with
organizations for the homeless to watch for dehydration among
people living on the streets. Officials also distributed fans to
residents of public housing projects without air-conditioning, and
set up cooling centers around the city where people could get water
and ice.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, including tourists, persevered despite the heat. At
Independence Hall in Philadelphia, 2,900 tourists trooped through
Tuesday, carrying their water bottles. But the Washington Monument
was deserted in late afternoon, with only two or three scattered
families wandering up the hill to its base. And, in an equally
telling indication of the effects of the heat, only three softball
games were underway in the area nearby.
</P>
<P>
   New England had already set a record of power use by early
afternoon, and the lights were turned out in the halls of the
Massachusetts Statehouse to show support for conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Blanchard, 55, who works as a security officer at a
Boston courthouse, declared: ``If I had to compare it to hell,
Boston would be hotter. The devil doesn't stand a chance in Boston
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostas Havalavatos, 55, said he had gotten used to the heat
after managing eateries in Faneuil Hall for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is 100 degrees outside, it's 103 or 104 in the
kitchens,'' he said. ``I've seen guys work here for a week and then
quit because of the heat, but it's just part of the job, and I say
if they don't like the heat, they can just get out of the
kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Ligon, a visitor to Boston from Edmond, Okla., said,
``It's not real hot to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Weather Service said information was still
coming in about records broken Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chartuk, a spokesman for the National Weather Service,
said Tuesday's highs included 99 in Atlantic City and 102 at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport. He noted that over the
past 20 years, an average of 380 people die a year because of heat.
But he added that many cities have, in fact, instituted
comprehensive plans in recent years that have managed to stem those
losses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the neighborhood organizers in such a program in
Philadelphia, Shelly Thomas, sent her daughter, Latasha, over to
check on an elderly woman across the street. She found the woman
fearful of plugging in her air-conditioner, afraid it would cause a
blowout. Latasha persuaded her that it would not.

TV SPORTS: GOODWILL GAMES HEADED FOR BOSNIA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The war in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 destroyed nearly all the
athletic sites of the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   The wooden seats from the Zetra arena were used for coffins. The
bobsled run turned into trenches. The mountain site for Nordic
skiing was transformed into a Serbian artillery position. The
Olympic stadium became a graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   But Sarajevo, which plans to bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics,
is trying to jump-start its resurrection by persuading Turner
Sports to take the Winter Goodwill Games to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of reconciliation in Bosnia needs a spur,
something to show the people that we are capable of pulling
together,'' said Muhamed Sacirbey, the ambassador to the United
Nations from Bosnia-Herzegovina. ``There have been three great
world events in Sarajevo: the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand,
the 1984 Olympics and the siege of Sarajevo. We prefer to be
remembered for what the Olympics stand for: pluralism, tolerance
and good will.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacirbey first discussed the Goodwill Games several months ago
with Harvey Schiller, the president of Turner Sports. Mostly they
discussed TNT's televising a figure skating event at the rebuilt
Zetra, but the show was canceled because of NATO's bombing in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited,'' said Schiller, who visited with Bosnian
government and Olympic officials in Sarajevo last week. ``But we've
expressed our concerns with their ability to get it done. They've
got rebuilding to do. The challenge lies with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacirbey admitted that his intense push for the 2001 Winter
Goodwill Games will depend in part on the ability of Bosnia to
attract public and private investors to build hotels and finance
the continued reconstruction of the athletic sites. A deal with
Turner, he said, may persuade private lenders and sponsors to make
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``With private partners, they hear Bosnia, you think war, and
why do you want to be there,'' he said. The athletic sites are in
various states of repair, he said. The Zetra is ready. Some skiing
has been restored. The speed-skating track is being rebuilt. Work
is about to start on the ski-jumping facility. The bobsled and luge
runs will not be resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller is uncertain if Turner will commit to Sarajevo.
Turner's first Winter Goodwill Games will take place in Lake
Placid, N.Y., next year; to run two in consecutive years may not be
plausible. Yet Schiller will consider it. A report on Sarajevo is
due in September.
</P>
<P>
   Sacirbey does not think a delay until 2002 is feasible because
of the Winter Olympics that year in Salt Lake City. And 2003 seems
too far away. ``You want to maximize the benefits of this by doing
it as soon as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller said, ``They'll need a lot of economic wherewithal to
get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacirbey would not rule out 2003. Bosnia is in no position to
force anything. ``We're looking to work as partners,'' he said.
``We've had a good dialogue. No one wants to play hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   The allure of Sarajevo to Turner Sports, which staged the
Goodwill Games in Moscow (1986) and St. Petersburg, Russia (1994),
would be to reclaim the original peaceful intent behind the event.
Ted Turner launched the games in 1986 after the United States
boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow and the Soviet Union
boycotted the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the games came to New York City, their purpose
was redefined to raising money for the Boys and Girls Clubs of
America and Unicef International.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon Bidding
</P>
<P>
   With Wimbledon over, so are NBC's and HBO's contracts to
broadcast the tennis tournament. NBC wants to continue, but HBO
does not. ABC appears to be NBC's main rival, with ESPN, Fox Sports
Net and the USA Network looking to replace HBO.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is unlikely to bring in one of its cable units, MSNBC or
CNBC, and would have to live with ESPN, Fox Sports Net or USA
selling commercial time for the same event. (HBO carries no
advertising.) NBC could team with Turner Sports, with which it is
planning a football league, but it is not considered a strong
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is not likely to be in the fray because the All England Club
would not be thrilled to have its Wimbledon jewel on the same
network that carries the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good time for Wimbledon negotiations. The past weekend's
ratings soared, because of the strong American showing and the
placement of both singles finals Sunday. The overnight Nielsen
rating on Sunday leaped 40 percent to a 5.6. For the semifinals on
Saturday, the rating jumped 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Tiger-Duval Shortfall?
</P>
<P>
   ABC might not show all 18 holes of the Aug. 2 Tiger Woods-David
Duval prime-time (8 to 11 p.m., Eastern) match-play golf
exhibition. The PGA Tour is insisting that the event begin at 7:30
p.m. Eastern (4:30 p.m. at the Sherwood Country Club in Los
Angeles) to guarantee enough time to complete a round. ABC would
join it in progress. ``The history of match play shows it takes
between 3 hours and 20 minutes and 3:40,'' said Henry Hughes, the
chief of operations for the PGA Tour. &QL;

BEVERIDGE WEBSTER, A PIANIST   AND A LONGTIME TEACHER, DIES AT 91  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Pa., Texas, Mass., Germany, France)   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beveridge Webster, a pianist and teacher who was best known for
his elegant performances of the French repertory and his commanding
accounts of contemporary American scores, died on June 30 at
Kendal-at-Hanover, a retirement community in Hanover, N.H. He was
91.
</P>
<P>
   Webster was a particularly authoritative interpreter of the
music of Ravel, whom he had met in the 1920s when he was a student
in Paris. Webster gave the first performance of Ravel's ``Tzigane''
in Paris in 1924. In 1975, he celebrated the Ravel centenary by
performing all of the composer's solo works at the Juilliard School
and by touring with the Ravel Piano Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   Debussy was also among his specialties. Webster's three-concert
series at Town Hall in 1968, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of
Debussy's death, was the first complete survey of Debussy's piano
works in New York. Reviewing the first concert in The New York
Times, Harold C. Schonberg wrote admiringly of the variety of color
Webster brought to the works, his clarity of line in the ``Suite
Bergamasque'' and his virtuosic accounts of ``L'Isle Joyeuse'' and
``Feux d'Artifice.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave premieres or made first recordings of many contemporary
works, including pieces by Louise Talma, Roger Sessions, Roy
Harris, Aaron Copland and Elliott Carter. He also championed works
by Schoenberg, Berg, Bartok and Stravinsky. He taught for five
decades, at the New England Conservatory from 1940 to 1946 and at
the Juilliard School from 1946 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Webster was born on May 13, 1908, in Pittsburgh. His first
teacher was his father, who was also named Beveridge Webster and
who founded and directed the Pittsburgh Conservatory. In 1921, at
14, he began five years of study in Europe, principally with Isidor
Philipp and Nadia Boulanger at the Paris Conservatory. He was the
first American to win the school's first prize in piano. He studied
with Artur Schnabel in Berlin and toured Europe as a soloist in the
late 20s and early 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Webster's American debut was a performance of the MacDowell
Second Concerto with the New York Philharmonic in November 1934,
followed by a recital at Carnegie Hall. By the end of the '30s, he
had performed with many major American orchestras. He had a
reputation as a sensitive chamber music performer, collaborating
with the Juilliard, Kolisch, Fine Arts and Concord Quartets.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, Webster shared the recital stage with his
son, the clarinetist Michael Webster.
</P>
<P>
   Webster is survived by his wife, Frances Brown Webster, his son,
of Houston, a daughter, Wendy Webster Ardizzone of Worcester,
Mass., and six grandchildren.

J. CURTIS COUNTS, 83, U.S. LABOR MEDIATOR UNDER NIXON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Curtis Counts, a veteran labor negotiator who directed the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for an old friend,
President Richard Nixon, died June 30 at his home in Los Angeles.
He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a lawyer, Counts had a 28-year career with Douglas
Aircraft Co., where he rose to vice president for employee
relations. He quit in 1969 when Nixon took him aboard his
administration the week after he was sworn in as president.
</P>
<P>
   Counts directed the mediation agency until 1973 and was credited
with bolstering its ability to settle big labor confrontations
before they ballooned into strikes or lockouts.
</P>
<P>
   In his day, Counts huddled with barons of organized labor,
including George Meany of the AFL-CIO, Walter Reuther of the United
Automobile Workers and James R. Hoffa of the teamsters union.
Counts' biggest test came early in 1970 when he helped end a 95-day
strike against General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   A portly man with a down-to-earth manner, he took the helm of
the mediation agency saying he wanted to make it ``so effective
that the scope of our activities is well recognized and voluntarily
sought, and the disputes of any kind, particularly those of
national significance, are minimized to the greatest degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who worked with Counts called him a quick study whose
background enabled him to analyze situations rapidly and to focus
on possible solutions.
</P>
<P>
   James Curtis Counts was born in Goldfield, Colo., the son of a
gold miner who later settled in Hollywood to build film studio
sets. He worked his way through the University of California,
studying political science and graduating in in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   He received his degree from Southwestern Law School in 1941,
when he went to work for Douglas Aircraft in Santa Monica, Calif.,
as a clerk. Rising through the ranks, he was named director of
employee relations in 1962 and added the title of vice president
two years later.
</P>
<P>
   After his government service, Counts returned to the private
sector as a management consultant. He took part in the collective
bargaining process in the construction and trucking industries.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Virginia Shugart Counts, died in 1996 after 56 years
of marriage. He is survived by two daughters, Carol Hooper of Los
Angeles and Janis Ocean of Reno; a son, Jay C., of Dallas, nine
grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Counts met Nixon when he was in law school and Counts'
girlfriend, Virginia, roomed with Nixon's girlfriend and future
wife, Thelma Patricia Ryan. The couples met at a post-Rose Bowl
party and remained fast friends.
</P>
<P>
   George Shultz, the secretary of labor at the beginning of
Nixon's first term, said he was unaware of that friendship when he
picked the new director of the Mediation and Conciliation Service
from among veterans in the field. By all accounts, Counts'
qualifications for the task were not in doubt among those who dealt
with him.
</P>
<P>
   A dedicated chef, Counts prepared breakfast for his family most
mornings for many years and loved to cook other meals as well,
particularly omelets, Mexican food and barbecued dishes. He also
liked to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell that by looking at me,'' he said.

 &HT;    Marlins halt Glavine's win streak
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tom Glavine was on the brink of some delayed
gratification Tuesday night, reaching out for his first winning
record of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He had climbed there from a humble 0-3 beginning, a long first
two months of the season and four consecutive wins in his last four
starts. But waiting for him were the Florida Marlins, the ragtag
1999 version of a team that hasn't lost to Glavine since September
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins got to Glavine for a 5-2 win with a lineup featuring
four rookies and ranked 14th in the National League in batting
average (.260) and runs scored (360). The Braves have lost to the
NL East last-place Marlins only twice this season in six meetings,
both times with Glavine pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of pitcher Alex Fernandez, whom the Braves faced for the
first time since the 1997 NLCS after he missed all of last season
with shoulder problems, and former teammate Danny Bautista, whom
the Braves cut at the end of spring training, the Marlins were
looking awfully unfamiliar.
</P>
<P>
   But those two did the most damage. Bautista gave the Marlins
their first lead with a home run in the second inning and drove in
two runs, while Fernandez held the Braves to two runs on three hits
over the first eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins raked Glavine for a career-high 15 hits, and the
five runs were the most allowed by Glavine since a disastrous
nine-run outing in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins refused to swing at Glavine's borderline pitches and
found holes all over the infield on the pitches crossing the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine surrendered eight hits to the first 13 batters he faced,
seven of them singles. He allowed four in a row in the third inning
before allowing two runs on a bases-loaded walk to Preston Wilson
and a Bautista sacrifice fly. Another run an inning later and
Glavine had allowed four runs through the first four innings, the
most he'd allowed in a start since June 4 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Glavine kept it close, holding Florida to one run on six
hits in the fifth, sixth and seventh innings.

POSSIBILITY OF DREAMWORKS MOVE HAS SAN FERNANDO VALLEY'S ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The San Fernando Valley has developed a case of
DreamWorks fever following the studio's recent decision to ditch
its ill-fated expansion into the marshes north of Los Angeles
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have started to get a lot of calls about sites,''
DreamWorks spokesman Andy Spahn said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks SKG, founded in 1994 by entertainment moguls Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, has been vague
about expansion plans since the company killed a $250 &UR;  &LR; million
studio project at Playa Vista last week. ``We're not focused on
making an immediate decision about expansion,'' Spahn said.
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt that DreamWorks will receive plenty of
proposals, although the winning offer will have to be sweet due to
the premium for snagging Spielberg, one of the world's most
successful filmmakers. The city of Los Angeles, for example,
offered more than $70 &UR;  &LR; million in incentives but that was not
enough to overcome what DreamWorks said were difficulties in
financing construction at the Playa Vista site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers are still going to be very interested in
DreamWorks,'' said Kevin Skislock, an entertainment analyst at
Laguna Research Partners.
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, DreamWorks will bulk up slightly at its
three major locations _ headquarters and film-TV operations on the
Universal Studios lot, a year-old animation campus in Glendale and
music operations in Beverly Hills _ by closing smaller offices. For
the longer term, the San Fernando Valley is far and away the most
likely site if DreamWorks decides to consolidate at a single site.
</P>
<P>
   ``All signs for DreamWorks are pointing to the San Fernando
Valley,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles
County Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks has three options in the San Fernando Valley:
</P>
<P>
   _ It could expand its 14-acre campus at Glendale, nine miles
north of downtown L.A., which has enough adjacent land for
development of another 150,000 square feet of office space, and
then develop more property in the surrounding area if it can be
obtained. Spahn called this ``an attractive option.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian-style animation campus was built with the help of
the Glendale Redevelopment Agency and Glendale City Manager James
Starbird wrote to DreamWorks last week that the city is ready to
help with further development. But finding property nearby may be
difficult partly because The Walt Disney Co. owns some of the
adjacent land, according to Assistant Redevelopment Director
Darrill Quashnik.
</P>
<P>
   _ It could expand the Universal Studios operation, where
Spielberg has been housed for the past two decades, as part of
Universal's ambitious overall expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, owned by Seagram Co., had no comment on the prospect
of an expanded DreamWorks on its lot. But its expansion plan _
which would add 3.25 million square feet for entertainment, film
production, offices and hotels _ has not yet gone through the first
round of approvals and has drawn opposition from nearby homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank City Manager Robert ``Bud'' Ovrom, who wooed DreamWorks
actively before giving up last year in the face of the Playa Vista
deal, said making DreamWorks the key component of Universal's
expansion could soften the opposition. ``Universal could be better
off with DreamWorks there instead of a resort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cody Cluff, president of the Entertainment Industry Development
Corp., noted that Universal will likely make strong efforts to keep
at least part of DreamWorks on its property. ``Universal gets a big
benefit from having Spielberg on the lot,'' he said. ``It creates a
lot of good will among a very successful group of people in the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' decision on Playa Vista also resurrected rumors,
published again in Tuesday's edition of The Hollywood Reporter,
that Seagram and DreamWorks would discuss a merger. Spahn denied
the report, calling it ``absolutely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   _ It could become the principal tenant at the North Hollywood
Studio Project, where developer J. Allen Radford has been cleared
by the Los Angeles Community Redevlopment Agency to build a $750
million project with 10 sound stages, two 20-story towers and a
business campus. Radford and the CRA are negotiating an agreement
on a development plan and construction could start as early as
2001.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Radford repeated his position that North Hollywood
would be a ``viable'' option for DreamWorks and added he has not
yet contacted studio executives since they bailed out of Playa
Vista. ``I think a period of time needs to pass first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Joel Wachs, whose district includes North
Hollywood, said DreamWorks has been silent on whether the Radford
project would be attractive but added he will push hard to convince
DreamWorks that such a move makes sense. He also said he would
support the same sort of incentives the city arranged for Playa
Vista.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd bend over backwards to get DreamWorks here,'' Wachs said.
``The motion-picture industry is one of the engines that drive our
economy and provide a lot of well-paying jobs. It also would fit
very well with that area's overall redevelopment project.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Margolis, director of communications for Mayor Richard
Riordan's office of economic development, said it was too early to
say whether Riordan would support similar incentives at the Radford
project. But he noted that executives from DreamWorks and other
studios have looked over the site and added, ``It will be the only
state-of-the-art studio in that part of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Several observors cautioned that the idea of a new DreamWorks
studio in the Valley may slip away, much like the dream of a
state-of-the-art facility at Playa Vista; in other words,
DreamWorks may stand pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could live very, very happily just as they are in the
Valley,'' said Kyser, noting that both Miramax and
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer both operate without a studio lot. ``Hollywood
is moving toward becoming a virtual industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Cluff also noted Hollywood's economics may no longer lend
themselves to building a new physical studio plant. ``Traditional
studios like Warner Bros. work only because the land was purchased
many years ago so the carrying costs are a lot lower,'' he said.
``For now, there are enough good sound stages available locally
that DreamWorks doesn't have to go into that business.''
</P>
<P>
   Skislock believes DreamWorks will take a measured approach to
expansion, citing the studio's slow-but-steady strategy in film and
TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``DreamWorks could have done a 20-film slate, so resisting that
temptation shows to me that they're great businessmen,'' he said.
``I give them great credit for hanging in as long as they did with
Playa Vista. I think they're committed to doing it right and they
don't feel as if they have to build a monument to themselves as
soon as possible.''

 ARIZONA VISIT PART OF CLINTON PUSH TO POLISH LEGACY  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 and MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's visit to Phoenix Wednes day is
tied to the legacy he hopes to leave when his term is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is personal, but there are political elements: reaching
out to the Hispanic community and trying to promote the model of a
``New Democrat'' who believes in a differ ent sort of government,
compassion ate but more scaled-down, than his party predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to arrive at Sky Harbor International
Airport at 4 p.m. His motorcade will take him to the office of
Chicanos Por La Causa, then the factory of La Canasta Mexican Food
Products, and on to an undisclosed location before he leaves for
Los Angeles at 9:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trip's message is similar to that of Clinton's
welfare reform of 1996: The federal govern ment needs to provide
limited assist ance to needy businesses and individuals, then get
out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes that such a centrist philosophy will help propel
Vice President Al Gore to the presidency in 2000. The Democratic
Party is intent on keeping Arizona in the fold, since the state
went Demo cratic in the last presidential elec tion for the first
time since Harry Truman ran in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to aides, the four-day trip, taking Clinton from
Appalachia to Watts, has been especially about his desire to try to
make his mark against poverty before he leaves office in January
2001. This is a president who was enamored as a boy with President
Kennedy and his family and their reputation for caring about under
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, the White House staff has been trying to play
down the politics and play up the an ti-poverty theme. Aides have
been emphasizing that the mission of trying to relieve economic
distress crosses party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not places (on the agenda) where there's great
political power,'' economic adviser Gene Sperling said. ``These are
not places where there's an easy politi cal message.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling termed it ``extraordi nary'' that a president would
spend four days, from Monday through Thursday, highlighting some of
the most impoverished areas in the nation while ``in the midst of
one of the strongest economies of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Clinton's focus in Phoenix on Hispanic businesses, the
trip's political benefit takes on a strong ethnic tone, local
observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton today wades into friendly territory: The areas he will
visit have voted strongly Democratic for years, and were Clinton
strongholds in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic Party shouldn't take these voters for
granted, pollster Earl de Berge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Democrats are very concerned about the efforts by
several lead Republican candidates and the Republican Party to go
after the Latino vote,'' said de Berge, who leads the Behavior
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has been courting Hispan
ics, a key constituency in his home state that helped elect him
governor twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of crossover po tential on this compassionate
con servative thing,'' de Berge said, referring to Bush's political
mantra. ``(He's) actually going to them and asking for their
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Arizona's presidential candidates, U.S. Sen. John McCain,
has always had strong Hispanic support in Arizona, de Berge said.
</P>
<P>
   A HispanicTRACK poll that de Berge conducted this spring found
that nearly four out 10 Hispanic heads of household identify them
selves as politically conservative. About 30 percent labeled them
selves liberal, and the rest classified themselves as moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Even though seven out of 10 Hispanics are registered as Demo
crats, de Berge said his poll find ings indicate that they could be
swayed by a GOP message.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Sproul, executive director of the Arizona Republican
Party, said Hispanic support for key GOP officials in the 1998
state election should have Democrats sweating about whether Arizona
will vote Democratic in next year's presiden tial race.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're certainly worried that they'll lose Arizona this
time,'' Sproul said. ``Common sense would indicate that when you
have a popular governor, and two popular (U.S.) senators and a
popular secre tary of state, a Republican is going to do well
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they're not taking Hispanics for granted. In fact,
Clinton's visit should be a reminder that the Democrats have been
with Hispanics for a long time, said Danny Ortega, a Phoenix lawyer
and Democratic activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's administration and all its success right now
will be shared by Al Gore,'' Ortega said.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Republicans' outreach to Hispanics is good for
the Latino community, Ortega said, it's just ``lip service'' at
this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the party of immigrant bashing,'' he said of the GOP.
``That's what George Bush has to work with. He still has a party to
drag along.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some of the most ardent political animals in the Val
ley said they don't see a heavy emphasis to the president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's domestic agenda has always held that small businesses
should benefit from economic suc cess, said Mary Rose Wilcox, the
lone Democrat on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. She
called the trip a ``non-partisan visit'' but acknowledged that it
nonetheless could serve to shore up the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even before it began, Clinton's trip was political fodder.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo., said Clinton's effort to
open up investment to the distressed communities was doomed to
failure. Talent said in a briefing paper that the president's
initiative is focused too narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offers these communities nothing for savings, home owner
ship and drug and alcohol abuse treatment, integral aspects of
revital ization,'' Talent said in the briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other Democratic presidential candidates before
him, Clinton considered Arizona a Re publican stronghold when he
began his 1996 candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But, after a speech in Phoenix, poll numbers indicated that he
could make a good showing in the state, especially on the issues of
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   And so Clinton ended up return ing to Arizona, and visited the
Grand Canyon before the election.
</P>
<P>
   After capturing the state's eight electoral votes, Clinton
returned to Tucson last February, partly to say thanks.
</P>
<P>
   The date for next year's Arizona Democratic presidential primary
is not yet set, which makes it difficult for Gore and challenger
Bill Brad ley to assess its relative importance. &QL;

GUNMAN'S FAST-GROWING HATE GROUP IS RECRUITING WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Fla., Ga., Ill., Ind., Mass., Md., Mich., Mont.,

 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They peddle hatred to children, with a brightly
colored Web page featuring a coloring book of white supremacist
symbols and a crossword puzzle full of racist clues.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to attract women, by talking about family issues
and preaching that rapists should get the death penalty. They
recruit aggressively on college campuses with a blizzard of
leaflets handed out by their ``missionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Its efforts to broaden its appeal have made the World Church of
the Creator perhaps the fastest-growing and one of the largest hate
groups in the country. Promulgating an anti-Jewish, anti-black,
anti-Christian doctrine, the group has increased its chapters from
13 to 41 in 17 states in the last year, experts on hate groups and
the group's leader say. Estimates of its membership range from
hundreds to several thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most active and it's the most sophisticated,'' said
Mark Weitzman, director of the Task &UR;  &LR; Force Against Hate for the
Simon Wiesenthal Center, a research and educational organization
based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And while the group says that it does not advocate violence,
some members have been linked in recent years to violent incidents
including the killing of a black sailor and the pistol-whipping of
a video store owner believed to be Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   It is the World Church of the Creator that drew the attention of
Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, the 21-year-old student who went on a
rampage over the Fourth of July weekend, shooting blacks, Jews and
Asians in Indiana and Illinois, killing two people and wounding 12,
the authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree ended Sunday night, when Smith stole a van
from a woman at gunpoint, and, while being chased by the police,
shot and killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Wednesday that Smith purchased his guns, a
.380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a .22-caliber pistol, from
an illegal gun dealer in late June. At first, he tried to buy the
guns from a licensed dealer, but was turned away because one of his
ex-girlfriends had filed an order of protection against him.
</P>
<P>
   The unlicensed gun dealer, who was not identified, could face
charges and his name was turned over to federal prosecutors, said
Jerry Singer, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Smith represented the kind of recruit that the
World Church of the Creator and groups like it are increasingly
trying to attract: young, educated, energetic, articulate.
</P>
<P>
   Hate groups once appealed primarily to older white men in mostly
rural areas with little education and blue-collar jobs, and later
attracted young ruffians called neo-Nazi skinheads. But in the last
few years, these groups have begun to broaden their constituencies
and increase their influence inside the political and legal
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a departure from the traditional rank and file of
these groups,'' said Mark Potok, who monitors hate groups for the
Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala. ``These are not
people who live in trailers. There is a concerted effort on the
part of white supremacist leaders to recruit college-bound middle-
and upper-middle-class kids.''
 &UR;  &LR; The Southern Poverty Law Center says the World Church of the
Creator is strongest in California and Florida, followed by New
York, Indiana, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The other 11 states that
the group has chapters in are: Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Texas, Washington and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Smith, the son of a doctor and a real estate agent from
an affluent Chicago suburb, attended New Trier High School, one of
the nation's most elite public schools, and had Jewish friends
growing up. As a teen-ager, there were few overt signs that he
would develop virulently racist leanings, but he later wrote in a
white supremacist newsletter that he thought that an eighth-grade
class covering the Holocaust had tried ``to instill a strong and
lasting sense of white guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   In his high school yearbook, he included the slogan ``Sic Semper
Tyrannis'' (``Thus ever to tyrants''), the words spoken by John
Wilkes Booth after he shot Lincoln and displayed on a T-shirt worn
by Timothy J. McVeigh the day he bombed the federal office building
in Oklahoma City. In college at the University of Illinois, Smith
later wrote that he thought that the foreign students and foreign
professors he met were benefiting too much from government aid.
</P>
<P>
   These were the raw ingredients Smith took to the World Church of
the Creator. His career ambitions also seemed an advantage. After
being forced to leave the university in February 1998 after being
charged with attacking his girlfriend and possessing marijuana, he
enrolled in Indiana University in Bloomington and switched his
major from computer science to criminal justice so that he could
become a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, he was following the example of several of the
movement's younger leaders, who want to be lawyers so they can be
advocates for the white race inside the nation's courtrooms. In
Bloomington, Smith was so active for the World Church of the
Creator that he was named ``creator of the year'' in 1998 because
he distributed the most leaflets and recruited the most members.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who came in contact with Smith said he appeared
calm, not excitable, another hallmark of some of the younger
leaders of groups like the World Church of the Creator, who appear
to be striving to couch their extremist views in almost
rational-sounding arguments for why Jews and minorities are
inferior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about moderating the image and trying to fit into the
mainstream,'' said Mark Hamm, a professor of criminology at Indiana
State University who has written extensively about hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew F. Hale, the leader of the World Church of the Creator
and at 27, apparently the youngest hate group leader in the
country, comes across as articulate, patient, telegenic and media
savvy. His father is a policeman and he lives with his parents in
East Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hale is credited with reviving the group in 1996 after it nearly
evaporated when its founder, Ben Klassen, a former Florida state
legislator and the man who invented the electric can opener,
committed suicide in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hale has had minor skirmishes with the law over activities like
burning an Israeli flag, and he ran unsuccessfully for the East
Peoria City Council in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hale is definitely the most articulate and upfront of this new
generation,'' said Weitzman, of the Wiesenthal Center. ``He's
trying to give his movement a veneer of respectability _ as well as
the blow-dried look.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Where then, does Benjamin Smith's violent rampage fit in?
</P>
<P>
   Hale said he did not condone Smith's actions, but he also said
that he felt no compassion for the victims, only for Smith and his
family. He said he believed Smith was ``a martyr for free speech
for white people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the group is committed to achieving its goals throughout
legal means, but that he could think of circumstances in which
violence might be acceptable under the ideology of his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``As any free people we do insist on remaining free,'' Hale
said. ``Our position is similar to that of Thomas Jefferson. If our
constitution is destroyed, if our right to free speech is denied,
then we have the right to use whatever means necessary to survive
and to advance our position. If you're cornered in an alley you
have the right to defend yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's credo is ``RAHOWA,'' which stands for racial holy
war and members have been linked to violent activities over the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   One member was convicted of killing a black sailor returning
from the Persian Gulf War in 1991 in Florida. Two members pleaded
guilty to the 1997 beating of a black man and his son in Miami,
and, last year, also in Florida, four members pleaded guilty to
robbing and pistol-whipping a video store owner they believed to be
Jewish. Potok said members of the group have also been linked to
plots to bomb a large Los Angeles African Methodist Episcopal
church and an NAACP office in Tacoma, Wash., both in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, literature from the World Church of the Creator was
found near synagogues that were burned down last month in
Sacramento, Calif., and the authorities are investigating whether
the group's followers were involved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hale believes that what might have set Smith off on his
murderous tear was a setback in Hale's drive to become a lawyer in
Illinois. Hale, who graduated from law school and passed the state
bar exam, wants to become a lawyer to advance the cause of his
group. He has been denied a license to practice law by a state
panel that ruled earlier this year that his racist activities
indicated he did not have the fitness of character to qualify as a
lawyer in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Hale appealed the ruling and Smith testified at his appeal
hearing. Last Friday, Hale's appeal was denied and hours later,
Smith began shooting Orthodox Jews walking home from Sabbath
services in a north Chicago neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said that although he told Smith he planned to appeal all
the way to the Supreme Court, Smith might have interpreted the
decision as a sign that the group's rights were being so trampled
upon that legitimate methods to advance the white racist agenda
would not succeed.

   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ How's this for serving notice?
</P>
<P>
   A 5-0 victory in the semifinals of your sport's biggest event
against the defending champion of the worldwide tournament.
</P>
<P>
   That's what China did to Norway this past weekend in the
semifinals of the 1999 Women's World Cup. If there were any doubts
about the team's ability to finish its chances and put teams away,
they were erased during 90 dominating minutes at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, anybody 5-0 against Norway, holy cow, it's a
shocker,'' said U.S. veteran midfielder Michelle Akers on her
reaction to China's victory.
</P>
<P>
   That China will face the U.S. in the final Saturday at the Rose
Bowl is less a surprise than how it has increased its level of play
as the three-week tournament has progressed.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, this seems to be a far different Chinese team
than the one eliminated in the quarterfinals of the inaugural
tournament it hosted in 1991. After that loss, China actually shut
down its women's program for two years to regroup. China rebounded
to advance to the semifinals of the '95 World Cup and the gold
medal match of the '96 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. assistant coach Lauren Gregg said the Chinese team
resembles its American counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the area they've most gained, is they have a psychological
dimension,'' Gregg said. ``I think in the past we've had the edge
there. I'm seeing a lot of confidence and a hardness not seen in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   It all starts with forward Sun Wen, a national-team veteran who
has scored seven goals in the '99 Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the areas they've improved is that they are
better at finishing their chances,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   But the formula has numerous components, including midfielder
Liu Ailing, who scored two of the tournament's most beautiful goals
against Norway. Other keys are forward Jin Yan and defender Fan
Yunjie, who jumps into the offensive half with regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Akers said China's team concept is beyond reproach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a team in every sense of the word,'' Akers said.
``They play off each other well. They play for each other. They
move and attack and defend as a unit. They have personalities that
can win the game for them and yet their attack or defense, as a
whole, can win the game for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested Akers sounded as though she were describing
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be,'' Akers said. ``Could be.''

ETHICAL CHASM OPENS IN CASE OF MENTALLY ILL DEATH ROW INMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona officials believe that Claude Maturana is ill, and they
want to make him well.
</P>
<P>
   So they can execute him.
</P>
<P>
   But state doctors are refusing to go along.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, Maturana, a death row inmate diagnosed as severely
mentally ill, sits in a special unit on the grounds of the Arizona
State Hospital _ and at the center of a clash between the demands
of the justice system and the ethics of the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
   One psychiatrist likens the practice to ``fattening the calf
before slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous ethical dilemma for the treating
psychiatrist,'' said Dr. Steven Pitt, a forensic psychiatrist
formerly on the state hospital staff. ``It's a lose, lose, lose
situation all the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Maturana, a French citizen, was sentenced to die in 1992 for
killing a teenager near Tucson. In January, however, a judge agreed
with two court-appointed doctors that Maturana suffers from
schizophrenia, meaning Maturana has lost touch with reality, and
thus cannot legally be put to death.
</P>
<P>
   State doctors are now supposed to restore him to competency,
then send him back to death row.
</P>
<P>
   By law, that responsibility rests with the state Department of
Health Services. However, DHS doctors say professional ethical
codes forbid them from taking part.
</P>
<P>
   So, Maturana remains on the grounds of the state hospital,
receiving just enough medication to maintain his mental stability
but not enough to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerry Dennis, the state hospital's chief medical officer, is
charged with treating Maturana.
</P>
<P>
   But for Dennis, ``treatment'' doesn't include preparing a
patient to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're the physician, you're there to provide care and
treatment and do no harm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been providing maintenance, not aggressively pursuing
further medication or other treatment approaches that would restore
him to competency,'' Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state health officials are scrambling to find another
doctor, or even a nurse practitioner, who can administer
medications, to try to restore Maturana to competency. None has yet
agreed to take the job.
</P>
<P>
   The search itself is also drawing controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administrator who is putting out these contracts is
basically trying to subvert the medical profession,'' said Dr.
Kenneth Iserson, director of the Arizona Bioethics Program at the
University of Arizona's College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a bedrock thing now. It's not some obscure
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maturana, 41, is a former auto mechanic with convictions in
Texas for burglary and aggravated assault. Little else is known
about him for sure, according to his attorney and court records.
</P>
<P>
   He claims to have children, any number from one to 11, and a
military background with the Air Force, French Foreign Legion, the
``Natural Navy,'' and a secret unit called the ``Veterans Force
AIPS.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas records show that Maturana was paroled from prison in
February 1990; five months later in Arizona, he killed a
16-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Maturana and Stephen Ballard lured
Glenn Estes away from home with the promise that they would party
in the desert. They drove him to a remote location west of Tucson,
where Maturana shot him at least a dozen times. Ballard then slit
the boy's neck with a machete.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard received a life sentence. Maturana was sent to death
row, where he's remained since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Maturana's attorney, Carla Ryan, says her client is so severely
mentally ill that she can't communicate with him or get his
assistance in his case. She filed a motion claiming he isn't
competent to be executed. A landmark 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling
prohibits states from executing such inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Pinal County Superior Court Judge Gilberto Figueroa
declared Maturana incompetent, based on written evaluations from
two court-appointed doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling triggered a state law that says such inmates
should be confined to the state hospital until they become
competent to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Because Maturana's case is the first to test the law, Figueroa
encouraged attorneys to seek guidance from the Arizona Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors say that is premature. They first want to hold a
competency hearing before Figueroa and have the chance to call
witnesses such as prison correctional officers to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carry on normal conversations with him, and he seems fine
to them,'' said Jon Anderson, assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few doctors say he has mental problems. Almost anybody can
be diagnosed with a mental problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson said such a person can ``still understand what they
need to understand to be competent to be executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and at least three doctors contend that Maturana is
seriously mentally ill. In reports to the court, Dennis said
Maturana suffers from chronic paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   He said Maturana is convinced he is an agent of the ``world
police'' and gets in and out of prison to conduct top secret
investigations for the ``Federal F &AMP; I'' and ``Central TBS.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dennis' report, ``He believes that his (prison)
sentence has already been commuted by `Rule 11, Margaret 3.' He
further states that the `Embassy' and `NATO TOBY' divisions are
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Dr. Michael Bayless, a Phoenix
psychologist, Maturana ``seemed to relate everything to numbers.''
He described himself as a world conductor in ``American 601'' and
said he didn't need medication because he has an ``1107 working FBI
702.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to his illness, Dennis wrote, Maturana doesn't adequately
understand that he has been convicted of murder and sentenced to
death. The doctor recommends that Maturana's sentence be commuted
to life imprisonment without parole.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant Attorney General &UR; Anderson said that would be up to
the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, which could recommend a
commutation to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Maturana's case is in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association has ethical codes that prohibit
doctors from taking part in executions. That includes restoring
inmates to competency and giving lethal injections.
</P>
<P>
   When Maturana was sent to the state hospital in February, Dennis
and others refused to try to restore him to competency, said Jack
Silver, hospital chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   So, the state began looking for another doctor or nurse
practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect them (state hospital doctors) to practice
according to their code of ethics,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not faced with an ethical dilemma. (But) I have the
dilemma of having the responsibility of upholding the state law and
a court order.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitt, the state hospital's former director of forensic
psychiatric services, sharply criticized health officials for
accepting Maturana's case. He said the state hospital should have
``drawn a &UR; line in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Instead) everyone is engaging in passive resistance,'' he
said. ``This idea of treating but not treating is really just an
effort to appease the court order, but it's not addressing the
underlying issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Potts, chief of the forensic services unit for Maricopa
County Superior Court, also criticized state health officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should just say, `We're not doing it,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Potts and Pitt advocate a change in Arizona law that would
allow a judge to commute a death sentence to life without parole in
the case of an inmate found not competent to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as Missouri and Maryland, have such laws on
the books, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death
Penalty Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based organization
that opposes how the death penalty is applied.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, governors have commuted the sentences of
incompetent inmates. In May, for instance, Virginia's governor
granted clemency to a mentally ill man four hours before his
scheduled execution and commuted his sentence to life without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt noted that there are no easy answers in cases like
Maturana's, which involve not only the inmate and doctors, but the
victim, the victim's family, judges, lawyers, state officials and
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are multiple competing interests,'' he said. ``And that
makes this issue so incredibly complex.'' &QL;

ON HILL FOR 2ND TIME IN 3 DAYS, HERSHISER BEATS EXPOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only once in a mostly superb 16-year major league
career had Orel Hershiser ever started a game on two days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1986, at the age of 28, when, according to the Elias
Sports Bureau, Hershiser pitched a complete-game, eight-hit shutout
for the Los Angeles Dodgers on the final day of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Never had Hershiser started on one day's rest, however. But on
Monday, when manager Bobby Valentine of the Mets asked the
right-hander, now 40, if he would do just that Tuesday night at
Shea Stadium, Hershiser said he could pitch whenever the Mets
needed him.
</P>
<P>
   The result was five shutout innings in a 10-0 victory over the
Montreal Expos, a wonderful twist of irony because the final score
was exactly the same as the one in the September game Hershiser
pitched 13 years ago, when he started against the San Diego Padres
on two-days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad way to rebound for a pitcher who had been driven from
the game in the third inning of a start against the Atlanta Braves
on Sunday night. But two nights later, Hershiser not only
rediscovered his sinkerball, he also had the Expos beating the
pitch into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In improving his record to 9-5, Hershiser scattered three
singles as he faced three batters over the minimum of 15 and pulled
within one victory of the 200-plateau for his career.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the Mets backed him with three runs in the first
inning on a night when Brian McRae hit a two-run homer and Edgardo
Alfonzo a two-run double to power the offense.
</P>
<P>
   There were, as general manager Steve Phillips pointed out before
the game, a number of reasons the Mets asked Hershiser to take the
mound Tuesday night. It meant they could bump rookie right-hander
Octavio Dotel back a day and allow Hershiser to start on Sunday (on
four-days' rest) against the Yankees in the last game before the
all-star game break.
</P>
<P>
   The move also allowed Masato Yoshii, who has been bothered by a
sore right quadriceps muscle, to rest an additional day before his
next start against Montreal. That could make it possible for Al
Leiter, who beat the Yankees at Yankee Stadium on June 6, to start
the weekend-series opener at Shea Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reasons being offered about why Hershiser had
struggled against the Braves on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had too much adrenaline,'' Mike Piazza, the catcher, said,
reasoning that Sunday's start was against the first-place Braves
after the Mets had dropped the first two games of an important
series. Hershiser was a little too pumped up.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets rallied to win that night, getting Hershiser off the
hook. On Monday, Hershiser was on the spot after Valentine asked
him to start Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A little arm fatigue always helps a sinkerball pitcher, Piazza
argued. ``Maybe he won't overthrow, and the ball won't be flat,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Hershiser just 59 pitches to prove Piazza right. And 45
of them (76 percent) were strikes. On Sunday, Hershiser threw 52
pitches before he was lifted with two out in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   If that outing had worried Hershiser, however, there was no way
to tell. After Edgardo Alfonzo's three-run homer had powered the
Mets to a 7-6 victory, Hershiser facetiously told Valentine,
``Without me, Fonzie wouldn't have been the hero. It would have
been a blowout.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday night's game, Hershiser was equally cool, no
matter how hot it was outside. He poked fun as his teammates argued
over a card game. Later, as he looked at films of the Montreal
hitters in their last series against Atlanta, Hershiser said in
mock anger, ``I'm really upset, because the scouting tape is of
Kevin Millwood and John Smoltz. Do I throw like either one?''
</P>
<P>
   But Hershiser didn't need to throw hard Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for five innings, he was able to mimic what he had done
in Miami on June 29, when he went 8 1/3 innings in a 5-1 victory
over the Marlins, his best outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos obviously did not watch tapes of that game. Nine of
the 15 outs Hershiser recorded Tuesday night were on grounders.
Four were on strikeouts. One was a soft liner to short. One was a
fly ball to right. With the three singles Hershiser allowed, only
four of the 18 Expos' hitters Hershiser faced hit the ball out of
the infield.
