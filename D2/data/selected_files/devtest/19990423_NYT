 &HT;    Bill wouldwould revamp Texas funeral agency
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The troubled exas Funeral Service Commission
would remain an independent agency, but would be restructured to
give public members a 2-to-1 majority as regulators of the state's
1,280 funeral homes, under a bill approved Thursday by a House
committee.
</P>
<P>
   As a backup measure, the public health committee also approved a
bill that would abolish the funeral agency and transfer its
responsibilities to the Texas Department of Health. Lawmakers said
they would push that bill only if they can't get the votes to
revamp the funeral commission.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral agency, run by a commission of five public
representatives and four industry members, has become the target of
lawmakers because of its poor performance over the years. The
agency has a backlog of complaints awaiting investigation, takes
half a year to resolve a complaint instead of the three-month time
limit set by agency, and is beset with continual staff turnover
that leaves key jobs vacant for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the confidence of the public in this
industry,'' said Rep. Dale Tillery, (D-Dallas), who helped write
the bill to revamp the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral service commission has attracted national attention
during the past year because of a controversial investigation it
launched against the largest funeral home company in the world,
Houston-based Service Corporation International. Agency
investigators said SCI used some unsupervised apprentices to embalm
bodies in unlicensed locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
</P>
<P>
   The agency denies wrongdoing, but a funeral agency panel
proposed a fine of nearly $450,000 against the company last summer.
The company has appealed the fine and complained to Gov. George W.
Bush's office that the agency used ``storm trooper'' tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral commission Chairman Dick McNeil, vice president of the
largest independently owned funeral home company in Fort Worth,
said the funeral agency had been well on its way to correcting
problems until the staff became entangled in the bitter fight with
SCI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stuff we did was dealing with SCI in the last
year,'' McNeil said. ``Everything got stalled.''
</P>
<P>
   He favors retaining the commission in its current form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got one of the most consumer-oriented
commissions we've ever had,'' McNeil said. ``I really hate to see
this board take a beating like this when they're good quality
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The new bill to restructure the funeral agency would set the
commission at six members, with four public members, including the
chairman and vice chairman, and two from the industry. The bill
would also bar the funeral agency from revealing the dollar amount
of any proposed fine against a funeral home until the case is
closed. The proposed fine against SCI, the largest ever proposed by
the agency, would have been kept secret if such a rule had been in
place last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Funeral Directors Association, which favors
restructuring the funeral agency rather than abolishing it,
supports the proposal to keep proposed fines secret.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any information like that could be used in an injurious
fashion by a competitor,'' said Hank Schmidt, president of the
Texas Funeral Directors Association. ``We want to make sure that
before it's released, that it is final and it's not just
speculative.''

TIGHTROPE FOR REPUBLICANS ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Ky., Md., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Democrats lined up on the floor of the House
last week to sign a petition that would force Republican leaders to
allow a vote on campaign finance legislation, Rep. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn., one of the bill's two authors, was among them, or
rather beside them, thanking them for their support, even shaking
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   But Shays did not grab a pen and put his name on the document. A
week later, his signature is still not there. Neither is that of a
single other House Republican, even though 30 of them are
officially co-sponsors of the bill and the petition would succeed
instantly with their support.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons reflect the tangle of strategic considerations that
lawmakers encounter whenever they venture onto politically
difficult terrain and the particular dilemma that confronts Shays
and other House Republicans who support campaign finance overhaul
but face the ardent opposition of Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, they are letting their actions be dictated in
large part by political etiquette and party loyalty. But they are
also haunted by a sense of urgency about the legislation, which
would effectively ban the unlimited and unregulated donations to
political parties that are known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's a tightrope,'' Shays said in an interview.
``I just have to be very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and other Republican leaders have
asked party members not to sign the petition and to leave in the
leaders' hands the timing of a vote on the bill, whose co-author is
Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has said that the bill would come to the floor sometime
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's supporters said they believe it must pass the
House before August, and maybe even before Memorial Day, if similar
legislation is to have any hope of success in the Senate, where it
faces the tall hurdle of a threatened filibuster by Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky. And thus far, although a crowded House calendar
for the next few months is taking shape, no debate has been
scheduled on the Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   To force such a debate, the petition needs the signatures of 218
members of the House, or a simple majority. At last count, it had
only 189. No Republican had signed it, and Democrats who support it
said that they had hit the limit on the members of their own party
willing to lend their names to the document.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 12 Republicans, including Shays, signed a similar
petition that prodded Speaker Newt Gingrich to bring the
Shays-Meehan bill to the floor, where it passed by a vote of
252-179 in August. Sixty-one Republicans voted for it; 53 of them
are still in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich had never pledged to allow a vote on the bill, and
Hastert has. Given the newness of Hastert's leadership and his
nonconfrontational style, Shays and his Republican allies are loath
to buck him without good cause.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Republicans realize that their hold on a
majority in the House is tenuous, and that party in-fighting could
jeopardize it in the elections of 2000. Signing the petition would
be the epitome of dissent, because it would take the majority's
control over the legislative calendar and hand it to the opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary measure,'' said Rep. Constance Morella,
R-Md., who signed the petition last time around. ``You're defying
the protocol of the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who signed the petition last year,
said she was willing to wait at least a little longer to see if
Hastert would accommodate her concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we owe it to him,'' Ms. Roukema said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roukema, Ms. Morella and Shays are heeding not just
diplomatic considerations but tactical ones. Some House Republicans
inclined to vote for the Shays-Meehan bill could withdraw their
support if they felt that the bill's backers unnecessarily defied
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Even though such a defection would probably not doom the bill's
passage, it would narrow the voting margin. And some of the bill's
advocates believe the size of that margin could determine whether a
similar measure musters the requisite support in the Senate, where
it takes 60 votes to break a filibuster. Last year, there were only
52 votes to bring campaign finance legislation to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Shays and his allies said that that they wanted Hastert to allow
a vote by the beginning of August. But a senior Republican aide
said that Hastert had signaled an intention to bring campaign
finance to the floor sometime around September.
</P>
<P>
   Shays acknowledged that if he and his Republican allies let that
happen without protest, they could lose credibility with
constituents. Shays has already received a drubbing from liberal
advocacy groups and editorial writers for not signing the petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it at all,'' he said of the position he was in.
But in the end, he added, what he wants is a law, and the best path
to that is not wholly clear. ``This issue is very important to me
and a lot of other people, and if I'm precipitous, I could end up
killing the bill,'' Shays said.

SWEET GEORGIA BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Monday, two days before his start against the
Atlanta Braves, Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown has a glint in his eye,
a black Sharpie marker in his right hand and a flock of fans at his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Brown pinches the cheek of a cherub in a tiny Dodgers jersey. He
flips the bill on the cap that another child is wearing so the
person next in line is left staring at the St. Louis Cardinals
logo. He gently needles a woman wearing an autographed Atlanta
Braves T-shirt before signing a baseball card.
</P>
<P>
   Then a man steps forward and hands Brown a recent ``Sports
Illustrated'' issue for him to sign. He might as well have been
handing President Clinton a copy of the Kenneth Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is on the cover of the magazine. He is not smiling.
``Kevin Brown Has Nasty Stuff, (And he's one Ornery S.O.B.),'' the
caption reads. The portrait of Brown inside wasn't much more
flattering.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's 6-foot-4 frame straightens. He smirks. Oh no, you say to
yourself, this could get ugly. You half expect him to put down the
pen and take a bat to the magazine. Brown, after all, has a
reputation to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have anything else I could sign?'' Brown asks the man.
``I don't know if I want to sign this.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, laughing, he does.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment it dawns on you that maybe Brown has gotten a bit
of a bum rap, that perhaps he's not unlike a lot of people in the
work force whose personalities are night and day depending on
whether they're on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ornery S.O.B.) is an accurate reflection of me on the day I
pitch,'' Brown concedes a little while later.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the other 325 days of the year? Brown's life is
KEVtv, but only about once a week. Except for every fifth day, the
lights and cameras and tape recorders largely leave Brown alone.
And invariably, the image the public gets of him is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   He's a hick or a hothead, arrogant or just plain rude. People
seem so sure of what they see, especially in Brown's hometown of
McIntyre, Ga., where, as one lifelong resident put it, ``You just
can't go anywhere without finding someone who knows Kevin and his
family.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre, like so many specks on the map spread out in your lap,
is much more than it seems from your car window. Take your eyes off
the two-lane road between Dublin and Milledgeville for just a
moment and you risk missing the town of 552 altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Whoosh. There it was, behind the towering pines, beside the
antebellum homes, beyond the kaolin chalk that is Wilkinson
County's lifeblood.
</P>
<P>
   You see a lot more when you park your car near the only
stoplight in the county, where Highways 441 and 57 meet, and eat
the home cooking at Maebob's Diner across the street and talk to
people hawking sacks of Vidalia onions in the name of the Lord. Ten
pounds for $10, with all the proceeds going to the local Baptist
church.
</P>
<P>
   The pride and populace rise up to meet you, and as sure as gravy
accompanies Maebob's biscuits, the hug that follows the hello is
coming from Carolyn Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, a retired schoolteacher known simply as Miss Sis, is one
of the friendly faces behind one of the meanest mugs in baseball.
She taught science to Brown's sister and brother at Wilkinson
County High before retiring the same year Kevin, the youngest child
of Carolyn and Gerald Brown, entered the ninth grade there.
</P>
<P>
   She also played softball on a team with Brown's mother and
sister, in recreational-league games that Brown's paternal
grandfather umpired. The player who can shrink teammates, reporters
and pitching coaches with a withering look was then just a toddler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd set Kevin down in the dirt with just a diaper on and give
him a softball,'' Petty says.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a little older, that tyke started climbing onto
Petty's lap to listen to Braves' games with her on a transistor
radio. He grew some more, into a sweet young man who rang Petty's
doorbell one Christmas Eve. Shyly, he thrust a box of chocolates
into her hands when she opened the door and said, ``Miss Sis, I
just want you to have this,'' before running off into the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Petty remembers the philanthropist who outfitted
a local Little League team and the prodigal son who showed up one
night last year at the Bible-study class she teaches and signed
autographs for everybody in the room.
</P>
<P>
   For free.
</P>
<P>
   The person who is kind, cuddly, cordial; that is the Kevin Brown
that Petty knows.
</P>
<P>
   The player who wears a scowl like a 5 o'clock shadow on days
that he pitches, who lashes out at teammates and toilets, who keeps
a permanent home in Macon and makes himself scarce around McIntyre?
</P>
<P>
   That Kevin Brown she doesn't recognize at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does have some little something that people here would not
admire,'' Petty says, choosing her words carefully. ``He's always
wanted the best, even when he was in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so much a perfectionist, just like his sister. I don't
know where it comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   You suspect that maybe he's that way because there's so much in
Brown's life he can't control, he's bound and determined to control
what he can. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His mother had a brain tumor. His father has a pacemaker. His
sister isn't well and neither is his mother-in-law. Can you blame
this son of a small town for wanting to win the lottery?
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Powerball pitcher, hit baseball's all-time jackpot
this past December when he won $105 million, to be paid over seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   All that money and six trips to L.A. for his family thrown in
for free? Brown's gluttony was hard to swallow. It left a bad taste
in a lot of mouths.
</P>
<P>
   It's not until you're given bits of his past to chew on that it
occurs to you maybe Brown couldn't see the forest for his family
tree, that it wasn't greed that fueled him so much as a basic need
to keep his kin close.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was in grade school when his mother underwent brain
surgery to remove a tumor that turned out to be benign. Carolyn
Brown suffered short-term paralysis after the surgery, but she's
fine now. Brown doesn't remember much from those days, except that
he virtually took up temporary residence at the hospital in Macon
where his mom was being treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty bad time,'' Brown says. ``I spent a lot of
time at the hospital. It was an eye-opener.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister Joy, who is 13 years older, juggled her own grown-up
responsibilities and looked after her kid brother. Now it's his
turn to return the favor. Health problems hastened her retirement
from the Engelhard Corporation, the kaolin-mining company that once
employed her dad. She lives in McIntyre, in the house where she and
her brothers were reared.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Brown has more pressing concerns than how to spend the
$1.25 million paychecks he receives on the 1st and 15th of every
month. He worries about his sister's well-being and his father's
heart and his mother-in-law's ongoing battle with lupus, an
autoimmune disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wish you could snap your fingers and do what it takes to
make everyone healthy,'' Brown says with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Money can't buy you peace of mind, but it will get you
plantation-size pieces of land in Macon, a city of 106,612 some 25
miles west of McIntyre, in Bibb County. Brown is building a
palatial home there, next to the two homes he and wife Candace
erected for their parents.
</P>
<P>
   There are people in McIntyre who will tell you Brown not only
has moved out of Wilkinson County, he has moved on. They feel he
has hollowed out his roots until he's just a shell of the person
they once knew.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind his pitches; some people in Wilkinson County chart
Brown's charitable offerings to see how far he is from his home
base. He has earmarked $1 million for inner-city baseball in L.A.,
bought 50 loge seats to every Dodgers Sunday home game for
charitable distribution and doled out a bundle more to his son's
private Christian school in Macon. But because he hasn't given any
money lately to his high school alma mater, there are people who
say he has fallen behind in the count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we're proud of him,'' says Jimmy Green, echoing the
sentiments of many residents. ``But he kind of left us behind.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more complicated than that, of course. If Brown learned
anything growing up it's that you can never be too close to family
or a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the big reasons I finally convinced my parents
to move to Macon,'' Brown says. ``That was me being selfish. I
wanted both sets of parents to be closer. I wanted my kids (sons
Ridge, 8, and Grayson, 4) to have a chance to see a lot of their
grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   If that makes him the poster boy for self-centered '90s
athletes, well, go ahead and stick a tack in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have McIntyre in my blood,'' he insists. ``I'm still
pretty much the same person. I still have the morals and an
appreciation of the outdoors from my days of growing up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown grows animated as he talks about his plans to build
baseball fields for the kids of McIntyre as a way of planting
dreams for future harvests. He says the fields have long been one
of his pet projects. You're inclined to believe him when you hear
the tinge of sadness in his voice, and he hastens to add, ``If
everybody down there doesn't hate me.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't always see eye-to-eye, Brown and his hometown,
maybe it's because they are so much alike.
</P>
<P>
   There is, after all, a depth to both that doesn't take much
digging to uncover. The key thing to remember is not to use an ax.

METS DEFEAT REDS, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ There is a popular saying these days: Act like
you've been there before. Still, it would have been understandable
if Al Leiter were a little more excited that he seemed here on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (1-2) had just tossed six and one-third strong innings of
five-hit ball for his first triumph of the season in the New York
Mets' 4-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Leiter forced a smile and said things like ``I'm
happy I won'' and ``Results-wise, tonight was the best game I've
thrown,'' he did not seem all that happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to finish the seventh inning,'' Leiter said.
``I'll feel better tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are hoping that Bobby Bonilla feels the same. For the
first time since last Thursday, the Mets fielded their starting
outfield of Bonilla, Brian McRae and Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   But the reunion lasted only an inning. After Bonilla, who has
been bothered by a partially torn ligament in his right knee, drove
in the Mets' first run with a first-inning groundout, he told
Manager Bobby Valentine to keep an eye on him.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla said of Valentine: ``And he said, `No, no, no. That's
all I needed. I'm just going to take you out because I need you for
the weekend.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mets will need Leiter to be more like he was last
season if they are going to challenge for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need Al,'' Valentine said. ``And the way he pitched
tonight was like a guy possessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter had said on Wednesday: ``The difference between a good
year and a great year, or a good year and a bad year, are moments
in every single game that could be called crunch time.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was talking about when it is absolutely necessary to
record an out. Leiter, who went a career-best 17-6 last season, had
not been able to nail down that key out in his last start, a 6-4
loss to the Montreal Expos. He had not been able to do so in any of
his three starts this year before Thursday night, coming in with an
0-2 record and a 5.95 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Crunch time came for Leiter on Thursday evening in the bottom of
the fourth. For the second consecutive game, the Mets had jumped
out to an early lead against the Reds, only to see their offense
disappear. On Wednesday, with Masato Yoshii pitching, the Mets had
squandered a 4-0 lead and lost by 7-4. On Thursday night, after
Bonilla's run batted in, the Mets had added two runs in the second
on Todd Pratt's second homer in as many nights and Edgardo
Alfonzo's run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Once Bonilla departed before the bottom of the second began, the
Mets' attack against a shaky Brett Tomko went on sabbatical. And
when Brian Johnson led off the Cincinnati third with a homer to
straightaway center, the Mets' lead was 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, the Reds were threatening to wipe out the rest
of Leiter's lead. With runners on first and third, up came Johnson
again, this time with two outs. Leiter quickly got ahead of the
Cincinnati catcher at 1-2. Johnson took two balls and then fouled
the next two pitches off. But Leiter did not give in. On the eighth
pitch of the at-bat, Johnson swung and missed for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds did not threaten again until the seventh. And by that
time the Mets had a 4-1 lead on a run-scoring single by John Olerud
in the top of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter departed after 117 pitches and after the Reds had put
consecutive runners on base for the first time on Johnson's single
and a walk to Pokey Reese. But Turk Wendell induced Dmitiri Young
into a pop-out to third and Mike Cameron flew out to center.
</P>
<P>
   That put Leiter in line for his first victory of the year.

   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is investigating
how a computer scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory kept his
access to U.S. nuclear secrets long after he was suspected of being
a Chinese spy, officials said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson may soon take disciplinary action against officials
who allowed the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born computer
expert at Los Alamos, to retain his access to a classified
information about America's nuclear-weapons designs for nearly
three years after he emerged as a leading suspect in China's theft
of design data related to America's most advanced nuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Lee continued to have access to U.S. nuclear secrets at Los
Alamos for more than a year after the director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Louis Freeh, told Energy Department
officials in 1997 that there was no longer any investigative reason
to keep Lee in a sensitive position.
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI investigates spy cases, it often asks employers not
to move suspects out of their jobs in order to avoid tipping them
off.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known which officials might face punishment. Los
Alamos and the nation's other nuclear-weapons laboratories are
owned by the Energy Department. Richardson's internal inquiry came
just as congressional leaders presented President Clinton with
evidence that Chinese nuclear spying has continued during his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairman and the ranking Democrat on a select
House committee that has investigated illicit transfers of American
high technology to China briefed Clinton Thursday on their
findings, including evidence of ``current and ongoing'' Chinese
espionage during the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting that lasted for more than an hour, Rep. Christopher
Cox, R-Calif., and Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., told Clinton that
Chinese efforts to steal American atomic secrets is ``not ancient
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not dispute their findings, the two lawmakers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether Beijing's espionage has continued during
the Clinton presidency is politically significant because of the
furor over the administration's handling of evidence in the Los
Alamos spy case.
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism that the White House sought to play
down the evidence in that case for fear of damaging
American-Chinese relations, Clinton and his advisers have stressed
that the loss of design data related to the W-88 warhead from Los
Alamos occurred in the 1980s, long before Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stated last month that he had never been told about
evidence of Chinese nuclear espionage during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   During a March 19 news conference, Clinton even stated that he
was not certain that the loss of the W-88 design data had been the
result of Chinese espionage. ``It is my understanding that the
investigation has not yet determined for sure that espionage
occurred,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   After the session with the congressional leaders, a spokesman
for the National Security Council, David C. Leavy, said that the
``president and the administration are under no illusions about the
fact that China and other countries are trying to acquire sensitive
technologies from the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official did not dispute the fact that the
briefing with the leaders of the Cox panel included a discussion of
possible Chinese atomic espionage during the Clinton presidency.
But the official emphasized that the information did not deal with
assertions of further espionage at one of America's nuclear-weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered in great detail a number of incidents of
espionage,'' Cox said after the meeting with the president. ``There
is no disagreement between Congress and the Executive Branch that
this is a current, ongoing problem that needs immediate and
aggressive attention.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official noted that Clinton had already been
briefed by his staff on all of the incidents of possible espionage
raised during the congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional leaders said that they were close to an
agreement with the White House on how much of their secret report
on China can be declassified and made public.

 &HT;    Dolphins' Konrad has no fear of 44
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Imagine owning a magic shirt.
</P>
<P>
   You don't even have to wear it. Just the knowledge that this
one-of-a-kind, hand-me-down item is hanging in your closet sends
everyone around you into a frenzy. It makes strangers want to get
close to you, to take your picture, to ask for your autograph, to
buy replicas of the shirt and wear them around town.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes some of them call talk radio and rip you for
failing to live up to their expectations. Makes them sit down at
their computers and post all kinds of nasty messages, most notably
that you don't deserve to own the shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that you spend four years getting used to this, fighting
it, accepting it, embracing it.
</P>
<P>
   Then you move to a new city, show up for work wearing the shirt
and ... nothing.
</P>
<P>
   No hype. No controversy. Just another shirt.
</P>
<P>
   This is what will happen today to Rob Konrad, a fullback from
Syracuse University, when he and the rest of the Miami Dolphins'
1999 draft picks trot onto a practice field in Davie for the first
workout of a three-day mini-camp.
</P>
<P>
   Konrad will the one wearing No. 44, the same number he wore in
college.
</P>
<P>
   Only it won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   A t Syracuse, 44 isn't just another number. It has become part
of the university phone prefix (443), the zip code (13244), the
nightlife (a hangout called ``44's'') and, most of all, the
tradition this upstate New York town has of cranking out running
backs.
</P>
<P>
   Three former No. 44s _ Jim Brown, Floyd Little and Ernie Davis _
went to the Hall of Fame wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for anyone who hasn't been here to really understand
what it means to wear No. 44,'' said Syracuse running backs coach
David Walker. ``Rob came in here with incredible expectations. He
was almost set up to fail. You're talking about a 17-year-old kid
who before he even stepped on campus, they're handing him the
Heisman Trophy. He handled all that. Handled it great.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the strength of this 6-foot-3, 255-pound player.
</P>
<P>
   His head.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' Class of 1999 will be known for its toughness. For
size. For power. For, in the case of third-round pick Grey
Ruegamer, the story about how he once castrated a lamb. With his
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Konrad's toughness is different. More cerebral. That's not to
say he can't be physically intimidating. When Dolphins coach Jimmy
Johnson asked running backs coach Joel Collier about Konrad,
Collier recalled his time spent in the New England area _ and what
he had heard about Konrad's hometown of North Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved to Massachusetts, I was told you don't mess with
guys in North Andover, because they'll just as soon hit you as they
would smile at you,'' Collier said. ``Meeting Rob confirmed that.
To me, he's a great kid but he looks like he could be nasty if he
gets up on the wrong side of the bed.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to be mentally tough to do what he did at Syracuse. Off
the field, he was an honor roll student. On the field, playing in
an offense famous for its complexity, he learned the plays for both
tailback and fullback _ and handled all that came with wearing the
hallowed number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I realized what the number meant to people until
I got here,'' Konrad said.
</P>
<P>
   He had been wearing No. 44 for years. He first chose it, not
because of dreams of ending up at Syracuse, but because he wanted
to be like NFL fullbacks Tom Rathman and Tommy Vardell. It was his
number at St. John's Prep, a place where they still tell stories
about No. 44.
</P>
<P>
   About how he went out for track his junior year and, seven days
after picking up the javelin for the first time, had the
third-longest throw in the nation. About how he had 103 at-bats and
never struck out. About how he arrived at St. John's wanting to be
a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day in practice, he threw a pass 62 yards in the air;
almost knocked the kid over in the end zone,'' said St. John's
football coach Jim O'Leary, chuckling at the memory. ``That's the
kind of athlete he is.''
</P>
<P>
   By his junior year of high school, he was being pursued by Notre
Dame, Southern Cal and virtually every other big-time program. But
most schools wanted him to play linebacker. He wanted to play
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse coach Paul Pasqualoni didn't just offer him a chance to
carry the ball. He walked Konrad through the school's exhibit
honoring former No. 44s _ and asked him if he wanted to become the
first fullback to wear the number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Pasqualoni sat him down, told him he had to understand
what came with it,'' O'Leary said. ``Not just the football, but
that he had to be a good citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Konrad didn't bother waiting until his senior year to make a
decision. He committed to Syracuse as a junior. And while he spent
another year growing, so did expectations.
</P>
<P>
   When he showed up for his first practice, the summer before his
freshman year of college, and drew more attention than Marvin
Harrison, a senior who would end up with the Indianapolis Colts, he
began to understand what No. 44 meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had as many people asking me for autographs as were asking
for his,'' he said. ``At that point, I realized I was an instant
celebrity just by having the number.''
</P>
<P>
   And he soon realized that being a celebrity wasn't easy. By most
standards, he had an impressive career, rushing for 1,516 yards,
catching passes for 473 yards and scoring 23 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But by No. 44 standards, it often wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   There were the injuries: a broken hand as a sophomore, a torn
hamstring as a junior, a sprained knee as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Some said he was like a skilled boxer with a glass jaw. Some
said he wasn't featured enough, often forgetting that wasn't his
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism hit home.
</P>
<P>
   This week when his mother, Betty, was asked to talk about her
only son and the youngest of two children, she called her husband
to the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say something I shouldn't when I talk to the media,''
she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Konrad took the phone and, when asked about the Rob's
personality, used the question as a chance to rebut draft analyst
Joel Buchsbaum's assertion that one of Rob's flaws is arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I never get a chance to talk to Mr. Buchsbaum,'' he
said. ``Rob has pride. Don't get me wrong. But he's not full of
himself. Mr. Buchsbaum obviously never met Rob or talked to any of
his coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Walker, his position coach for four years, scoffs at
such talk, saying that ``a lot of people would have let everything
that comes with being No. 44 go to their head, but Rob didn't ...
the Dolphins won't be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend of the draft, the consensus was that Konrad would
end up either returning home to the Boston area to play for the
Patriots or heading to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He told friends and family he was waiting until his name was
called to pick what kind of car he would buy with his signing
bonus. Durango for the north. Corvette for the south?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping I get a Corvette,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   Now Konrad, an avid outdoorsman, is talking excitedly about
coming to Florida, getting a boat and, of course, wearing a
Dolphins' jersey. With a 44 on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With No. 39 I might run into some problems,'' he joked,
referring to the number worn by Larry Csonka.
</P>
<P>
   Although he insists he loved being No. 44 at Syracuse, Konrad
also seems to be looking forward to being in a place where his
number isn't magical, where he's just wearing another shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to be someone else. I'm not trying to be Jim
Brown. I'm just trying to be Rob Konrad.''

CLOSURE TOUGH TO FIND ANYWHERE IN THIS TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The snow fell all Thursday, smudging the ink
of a thousand scrawled messages, bending the roses and the
carnations beneath its weight. Slush covered teddy bears.
Footprints tracked every which way. By midmorning, the park
bordering Columbine High School felt shrouded, more obscured than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   As does this story with each new day.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the way these things are supposed to go, of course:
Normally after 48 hours we have gained a solid purchase on the
facts, some handhold, but in Littleton the normal techniques seem
not to apply. We have an accurate body count _ 11 males, four
females _ an inventory of firepower, a chronology, videotape enough
to circle the Earth, but no real answer to the question scratched
on a greeting card now covered in slush.
</P>
<P>
   The handwriting is a teenage girl's swirl. The signature
``Jami'' is accompanied by a heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss all of you,'' she has written. ``I don't understand
why this had to happen to us. Why?''
</P>
<P>
   The question of the day, and every day hereafter. Thinking it
through is like chasing ghosts. Two, in particular: The teenagers
who stand accused here but lay dead, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   We have heard from former friends, classmates, acquaintances,
teachers. For all they have said, we seem no closer to answering
``Who?,'' let alone ``Why?'' &QL; 
Last Saturday, Dylan Klebold went to Columbine's prom. The
17-year-old was a Boy Scout. He worked at Blackjack Pizza, favored
the Boston Red Sox, drove an old four-door Bimmer. Then there's his
house: all cedar and glass, on 5 acres. It would fit fine in north
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Just as every other fact in Klebold's biography _ the swastikas,
the goose-stepping in the halls, the roll of the dead _ seems to
fit some other story altogether.
</P>
<P>
   This also holds for Harris, 18 and equally a cipher.
</P>
<P>
   His dad, Wayne, was an Air Force pilot. Eric loved computers and
bowling. He had a thing for fireworks. How much of a thing no one
knew until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even in retrospect, that knowledge doesn't help much. It gives a
little shape to the ghosts, is all. And the ghosts seem woefully
pale compared to the sentences dripping down the poster board:
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss those who are gone now. One question. Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Our response takes the form of thumbnail sketches, psychological
portraits, sleuthing in print. It seems logical: It has been done
this way for years. This is a new America, though, one with the
volume perpetually cranked high, where measurements of caliber have
replaced tests of IQ. With Columbine, the old logic fails,
especially when it tries to explain the irrational in rational
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The simple truth, with this story: There are no simple truths.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold gave off warning signs galore, say some;
precious few, say others. They were ``freaks,'' I have heard, and
``normal high school kids.'' There was an arrest for breaking into
a van; there was also an early release from the diversion program. &QL; 
Thursday, a Denver TV station got hold of the probation officer's
reports: ``Eric is a very bright young man, likely to succeed in
life,'' was the word on Harris.
</P>
<P>
   As for Klebold: ``Dylan is a bright young man who has a great
deal of potential. If he is able to tap his potential and become
self-motivated, he should do well in life.''
</P>
<P>
   More shape for the ghosts. They flutter above Littleton as snow
veils everything. A day's worth of shoes turns the white to gray.
One Columbine freshman, Joe Dreaden, now readying for two friends'
funerals, cannot stand it.
</P>
<P>
   He walks to the red Acura of his late classmate, 17-year-old
Rachel Scott, and begins to brush the snow from bouquet after
bouquet. He straightens the wet cards, moves a small wooden cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make it so the bright colors show through,'' Joe
explains. ``That's the only way maybe we can understand what
happened to our friends.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Dead children identified, missing mother sought
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer and Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After identifying two children found dead in a
creek Monday, investigators Thursday were looking for the
children's mother, Tina Marie Cornelius, a soft-spoken 22-year-old
who recently dropped the auto mechanics class she seemed intent on
completing and mysteriously disappeared from the job she held for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they want to speak with Cornelius, who until
recently lived in a North Austin apartment, about the deaths of her
children, Dominick Cornelius, 2, and Amanda Miller, 3. Police said
Dominick was killed by a blow to the head that fractured his skull;
Amanda was suffocated, police said. The children have different
fathers who live out of state, and investigators have been unable
to reach either man.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not call Cornelius a suspect but said they are
concerned for her safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the mother of these children, and we're concerned that
we have not been able to locate her,'' said Capt. Linda Bunte of
the Williamson County sheriff's office. ``She may be endangered. We
don't know. We're trying to locate her and determine what has
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius' relatives last saw her more than a week ago, Bunte
said.
</P>
<P>
   She missed a court appearance Monday, where she was supposed to
pay a $375 fine for passing a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. Thursday, investigators issued a bulletin to area
airports and bus stations asking them to be on the lookout for
Cornelius, said Sgt. Ron Gober of the Austin Airport Police.
Cornelius was last seen wearing baggy blue jeans, a pink T-shirt
and her hair in a pony tail, according to the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   An employee of Expose(accent), a South Austin adult
entertainment club, said Cornelius had worked at the club for about
three weeks, including Tuesday, the day after her children were
found dead. ``She was totally calm,'' the woman said. A manager of
the club said that police had been to club asking questions but
that Cornelius had never worked there.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's investigators would not comment whether Cornelius
worked at the club.
</P>
<P>
   Tip from a day care
</P>
<P>
   Both children were wearing Mickey Mouse diapers under their
clothing when a Round Rock couple found them lying lifeless in
Brushy Creek just south of Hutto, a small farming town about 20
miles northeast of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The diapers were a key to solving the mystery that had dogged
investigators for three days. Employees of a Austin day-care center
recognized the sketches of the children released Tuesday, and the
description of their diapers. The workers had not seen the children
since April 14.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and co-workers said Cornelius is a hard-working single
mother who worked a full day, then spent four hours in her
mechanics class. Her co-workers at a Super Wal-Mart said she showed
up on time, worked hard and hoped one day to become an auto
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Thompson, the only other woman to work in what she called
``the pit'' of the oil-changing facility, said Cornelius seldom
spoke, but when she did, the topic was usually her children or her
desire to become a mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very gentle and soft-spoken person,'' Thompson said.
``She is sweet, really just a sweet person.''
</P>
<P>
   Another co-worker said that when his baby was born a month ago,
Cornelius promised to make them a quilt.
</P>
<P>
   `Darling' children
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors at the apartment complex remembered Tina Marie
Cornelius as a caring mother, whose adorable children often peeked
out onto the world from between the blinds of their first-floor
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just darling, absolutely darling,'' said neighbor
Holly Roth. ``I wished they would come out more because I would
have loved for my own 2-year-old to be able to play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith's children did play with Amanda in the grassy
courtyard that separated their apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was pretty quiet and easy-going,'' he said of Cornelius.
``I can't believe she'd be involved with this. . . . This is
something that hits real close. Having them as neighbors and having
something like this happen is just appalling. First, it's
disbelief. Then, it's how? Why?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a similar reaction at Wal-Mart, where employees said
she sometimes brought her kids by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what happened to those kids,'' said one
employee who did not want his name used. ``I can still see them
here laughing and playing.''
</P>
<P>
   If she had to stay home with one of her kids when they were
sick, she would always call in and say so, a manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Then just before Easter, she told her colleagues she had to
leave early because she had a court appointment.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last they heard of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked a lot of people if they had heard anything from her,''
Thompson said. ``It just didn't seem right. Everyone was like,
`Nope, we haven't seen her.' And then this happened. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping for the best, or the best that can come out of
a tragedy like this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After ending work at Wal-Mart at 5 p.m., Cornelius would go to
the Capitol City Trade and Technical School, at 205 E. Riverside
Drive in Austin, where her mechanics class lasted from 6 until 10
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very interested in auto mechanics and was a good
student,'' instructor Kenneth Echols said. ``She enjoyed the class
as far as I could tell.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cornelius started at the school in January, she was dating
a 24-year-old man she identified as her fiance, a school official
said. Other acquaintances said the couple later had broken up.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, she suddenly stopped attending classes without
saying why. And mail the school sent her was returned by the post
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never find her,'' the school official said. ``As far
as I could tell, she was a single mother who was determined to make
it, provide a life for herself and her children. Otherwise, she
wouldn't have worked all day and come to school at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember those darling kids. They were precious little
angels.''

HEBERT VOWS HE'LL START TONIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ If Guy Hebert's play proves to be as sharp as his wit,
goaltending should be the least of the Mighty Ducks' problems
tonight in Game 2 of their Western Conference playoff series
against the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after being kicked in the head by the skate
of Brendan Shanahan, Hebert went through a full workout on the ice
in front of the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in here, I wasn't sure who I was,'' Hebert
joked. ``The guys told me I was (Buffalo's) Dominic Hasek, so I
feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his head, Hebert laughed and said, ``It feels
as good as it ever has.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert was knocked out midway through the second period of
Wednesday's series opener, which forced backup Tom Askey to finish
up the 5-3 loss to the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt horrible (for Tommy),'' Hebert said. ``It's an old
goaltender's creed that you never come out of the game unless
you're dead, so I guess I thought I was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   On a serious note, Hebert said he never lost consciousness and
would be ready to play tonight despite waking up Thursday with a
slight headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come too far to get back in the playoffs,'' he said. ``I
think it would take wild horses to keep me out of the starting
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan went head-over-heels into Hebert after being upended by
defenseman Ruslan Salei. The Anaheim goalie was on the ice for
several anxious minutes as the Ducks' medical staff attended to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me pretty hard . . . I felt the vibrations all the way
down my body,'' he said. ``I haven't seen it and really don't want
to.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting back to his feet, Hebert felt there was no way he
could, or should, stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been effective for 10-15 minutes,'' said
Hebert, who later resisted the urge to return. ``Tom was settling
in and I knew the guys would play hard in front of him. I didn't
want to unsettle things.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim is hoping Hebert's return in goal will help settle them
down after the young Ducks were rattled by Detroit's early
pressure. They fell behind 3-1 less than a minute into the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody was a little nervous,'' Hebert said. ``But
the first five minutes got some things out of our system. A lot of
young guys came up today and said, `I'll be a lot better tomorrow.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne scored a goal at 13:03 of the third period to pull
Anaheim within 4-3, but the NHL's leading goal scorer was held
without a shot in the first 40 minutes and was not his usual
dominating self.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teemu knows he can play better and he will,'' Ducks coach
Craig Hartsburg said of his standout winger, who struggled down the
stretch with only two goals in the last eight regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, rather than dwell on the negative, tried to put a
positive spin on things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Game 2 is going to be totally different,'' he said.
``That was our first playoff game in two years. I know we will only
get better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard, however, to imagine Paul Kariya performing at a
higher level. Anaheim's captain had seven shots, scored on a wicked
slap shot, assisted on the Ducks' other two goals and more than
held his own against the physical Detroit defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was great,'' Hartsburg said. ``His game rose to another
level. Everybody else has to raise their game, too.''

GIULIANI BUILDS SCHOOL VOUCHERS AND TAX CUTS INTO CITY BUDGET
PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proposed a $35.3 billion
spending plan for New York City on Thursday, emphasizing tax cuts,
school vouchers and other initiatives favored by the national
Republican Party at a time when he has all but declared himself a
candidate for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But as Giuliani proclaimed that the city had a record surplus of
$2.1 billion, Peter Vallone, the speaker of the City Council,
questioned why the mayor had proposed cutting more than $110
million for libraries, cultural groups, youth services and other
programs. He also complained that Giuliani's tax cuts were
insufficient and his voucher plan inappropriate, setting the stage
for a battle over how to spend an unusually large pot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see is a great economy, but a budget that does not go
far enough,'' Vallone said on Thursday. ``These are not good cuts.
These are not good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for $157 million in new tax cuts, Giuliani's budget plan
was almost identical to the one he proposed in January, which
called for accelerating a class of 1,500 police recruits and
building new schools with the city's anticipated share of the
settlement with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   But while Giuliani proposed putting $6.15 billion toward school
construction in his preliminary budget, he vowed on Thursday to
withhold the money until the Board of Education presented him with
a detailed plan for spending it.
</P>
<P>
   ``By law, they were supposed to present us with a plan by March
1,'' Giuliani said. ``We really need to hold them to a very strict
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the education proposal that drew the most scrutiny on
Thursday was Giuliani's plan for an experimental voucher program,
which would use millions of tax dollars to send poor children from
a single school district to private and parochial schools. The
mayor had originally proposed administering the program through the
Board of Education, but Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew protested and
even threatened to quit.
</P>
<P>
   So in his budget presentation on Thursday, Giuliani proposed
running the program out of City Hall instead, using $12 million
from the general budget as ``incentive money'' for whichever school
district volunteers. But Crew said later in the day that he was
still adamantly opposed to the voucher proposal, and he also
expressed frustration with the mayor's plan to withhold the capital
funds.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done in recent speeches to Republican audiences around
the nation, the mayor spoke passionately about the need for
vouchers, saying the competition they created would force failing
schools to improve. ``This is where America is going to be five
years from now,'' Giuliani said. ``We've got to open up our
thinking and get out of almost the inquisitional mindset that we're
in, the box that we're in, and understand this and embrace it.'' /

INTIL PLANNING BIG MOVE INTO INTERNET SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Intel Corp., the leading maker of microchips,
said on Thursday that it was planning a big move into the Internet
services business by building and running data centers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a striking departure for the big microprocessor
producer, known for pumping out millions of silicon Pentium chips
that serve as the electronic brains of most personal computers.
Analysts say the Intel announcement reflects just how far the
company is willing to go in seeking new ways to grow as it
recognizes the Internet as both a challenge and an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a stretch, but you have to give Intel's management
credit for recognizing that the world is rapidly changing around
them and trying to do something about it,'' said Drew Peck, a
managing director of S.G. Cowen &AMP; Co., a securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawling installations filled with powerful small computers,
known as server farms, are used to handle electronic commerce and
host the World Wide Web sites for other companies. Intel presented
its plans for the data farms at a meeting with securities analysts
Thursday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Though Intel's profits have held up well so far, many analysts
believe that the rise of the Internet will inevitably erode its
margins. Consumers are increasingly expected to use simpler,
lower-cost devices _ from handheld machines to television set-top
boxes _ to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of these so-called Internet appliances, they
note, will not replace personal computers by any means. But the
Internet will fuel more diverse computing technologies and other
access devices. This in turn will undermine the profits of the
technology standardbearers in the PC-centric era, that is, Intel
and the Microsoft Corporation, whose Windows operating system runs
most PC's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel has to look for other opportunities for future growth
and server farms could be a reasonably good hybrid,'' Peck said.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are quite skeptical. They note that Intel is a
late entrant into the fast-growing market for server farms,
trailing established computer services powerhouses like the
International Business Machines Corp. and Web hosting specialists
like Exodus Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   These analysts also doubt that Intel's skills as a chipmaker
give it any edge in running huge data centers. ``This is not a
business for Intel to be in,'' said Howard Anderson, managing
director of the Yankee Group, a research company in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Intel insists that the server-farm plan fits neatly with its
long-term strategy. ``We want to be the building block supplier to
the Internet economy,'' said Craig R. Barrett, the president of
Intel. ``And as part of that plan, we are going to make substantial
investments to set up server farms around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel already has a pilot operation in Santa Clara, Calif.,
equipped with a few hundred server computers, powered by Intel
microprocessors. By the third quarter of this year, Intel intends
to have its first data center with more than 2,000 Intel-based PC
servers running, catering to customers including Excite, the Web
directory service.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the company plans to begin a network of data centers
worldwide to host Web sites and handle electronic commerce for
businesses. These massive computer farms, Intel says, are expected
to cost more than $100 million each and be crammed with more than
5,000 servers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel views the server farms as ``bit factories,'' said Gerry
Parker, an executive vice president. The expertise the company has
developed in planning, building and managing chip factories, he
said, should translate well. ``A lot of the same skills are
involved,'' he said.

DEVILS BEAT PENGUINS, 3-1, IN PLAYOFF OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils accomplished just
about everything they could imagine in the regular season. One of
their disappointments, however, was the inability of either Petr
Sykora or Bobby Holik to become the first New Jersey players in six
years to reach the 30-goal plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora finished with 29 goals. Holik ended up with 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get my 30th in the playoffs,'' Sykora said Monday after
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, true to his word, Sykora did better than one
goal in the opening game of the playoff series against the
Pittsburgh Penguins. The 22-year-old wing from the Czech Republic
scored twice to lead the Devils to a 3-1 triumph before a crowd of
16,209 at Continental Arena, about 3,000 short of a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   The second game of the four-of-seven-game series will be played
here Saturday afternoon before the series moves to Pittsburgh for
two games, starting with a game Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora's goals were his first career playoff points. Last season
he played only two games against Ottawa as the Devils chose to go
with veterans rather than youth and the Senators eliminated the
Devils in that opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Sykora played and scored, and when Jay Pandolfo
added an empty-net goal, it sealed the victory for the Devils with
30.2 seconds left. Sharing the credit for the effort were the
players who collectively worked to limit Jaromir Jagr's
effectiveness and enrich Martin Brodeur's goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur made 24 saves, including a glove save on Kip Miller with
3 minutes 27 seconds left and another on Jagr with 2:07 left, that
earned a standing ovation. ``Marty's the reason we won the game,''
Sheldon Souray said. ``That's the kind of goalie he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur's only blemish was the goal by Jan Hrdina that opened
the scoring. His saves were more timely than those of Pittsburgh's
Tom Barrasso, who faced 21 shots and stopped all but the two from
Sykora that got the Devils off on the right foot and got Sykora to
the 30-goal plateau one game late.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have been the conference's best team in the regular
season the past three seasons, but they were eliminated in the
first round last season and in the second round by the Rangers two
seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   While coach Robbie Ftorek of the Devils used all four of his
line combinations, coach Kevin Constantine of the Penguins went
primarily with three lines.
</P>
<P>
   Rotating four lines has been one of the Devils' strengths all
season and it was one of the reasons they set a record for most
victories on the road with 28, breaking Montreal's mark of 27 set
in the 1976-77 season and again a season later.
</P>
<P>
   Using four lines was also the Devils' strength in winning the
Stanley Cup under the direction of Jacques Lemaire in 1995, when
they eliminated the Penguins in five games in the Eastern
Conference semifinals en route to their first title.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr's first speedy trip through the Devils' defense set up the
first goal. He moved from left to right when he got near Brodeur
and took a shot that rebounded out in the slot, where Hrdina jumped
on it to open the scoring 7:20 into the game, beating a fallen
Brodeur over the glove.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora tied it for the Devils just 15 seconds later. Standing in
the right circle, he one-timed Patrik Elias' pass from the other
side past Barrasso for the first playoff point in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora's second goal of the night came with 5:05 left in the
second, when he poked in a loose puck from the low slot over
Barrasso's stick. The goal came during confusion in Pittsburgh's
zone after Sheldon Souray entered with the puck down the right
flank.
</P>
<P>
   In the first playoff game here in which two referees were used,
a penalty to a player playing with a broken stick was called. It
occurred at 5:19 of the first period when Elias was penalized.

ROOKIE ZIMMERMAN SHINES IN RELIEF FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates asks that pitching
coach Dick Bosman serve as the ``guardian angel'' for right-hander
Jeff Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, all the available evidence suggests that Zimmerman serves
as the Rangers' guardian angel.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman rode to the Rangers' rescue again with 1 2/3 innings
of scoreless relief during last night's 6-4 victory against the
Minnesota Twins at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked Dick Bosman to be his guardian angel,'' Oates said.
``You get tempted to let him pitch every night. I really didn't
want to take him out tonight, but he threw 20-plus pitches
\RWednesday\S night in New York and 20-plus pitches again tonight.
I've asked Boz to make sure I don't hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers continue to place Zimmerman in meaningful situations
because of the results the former TCU pitcher produces. That
includes 10 scoreless innings since being promoted April 13 from
Triple-A Oklahoma, and opponents are hitting only .065 (2-for-31)
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Another meaningful situation presented itself against the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Oates summoned Zimmerman from the bullpen to protect a one-run,
sixth-inning lead for right-hander Aaron Sele (3-1) with runners
aboard first and second. Zimmerman wisely pitched around veteran
catcher Terry Steinbach and issued a four-pitch walk to load the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to give him anything to hit there,'' said
Zimmerman, who threw Steinbach sliders on the first three pitches
of the at-bat before issuing the walk on a 3-0 fastball off the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, though, stepped forward and met the intended
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Cristian Guzman stepped to the plate with an
opportunity to deliver two runs with a base hit, but the Rangers'
26-year-old rookie abused the Twins' 21-year-old rookie during the
evening's most significant at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman placed Guzman at a distinct disadvantage after the
shortstop took a 1-1 slider for a second strike and then induced a
weak ground ball with another slider on the ensuing pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile fielded the ball cleanly and _ despite
apparently losing track of the number of outs in the inning _
retired first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz at the plate with an
accurate throw to catcher Gregg Zaun.
</P>
<P>
   Threat over.
</P>
<P>
   Another meaningful situation, and yet none of them appears to
faze Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get so focused on the catcher that I don't even see the
hitter up there,'' he said. ``I think I've really prepared myself
for this moment. I've dedicated myself to baseball. I've done
everything I could do to be here, and that gives me peace of
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers failed to make the evening easy by continuing to
struggle at the plate, this time against Twins left-hander Eric
Milton. The Rangers, who scored only twice during their two-game
series with the Yankees and entered last night's contest hitting
.205 for the past five games, managed only two runs against Milton
through the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro, who entered the game 0-for-14
this season against left-handers, put an end to that streak with a
mammoth, 412-foot home run to center field off Milton during the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Lee Stevens also continued his more-than-adequate
job against left-handers by hitting his team-best fifth home run
against Milton during the third inning that gave the Rangers a 2-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sele made that stand until running into trouble during the sixth
inning, but Zimmerman gave the Rangers an opportunity to break the
game open with their four-run eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive two-run, eighth-inning doubles by center Roberto
Kelly and left fielder Rusty Greer snapped the Rangers' 0-for-25
drought with runners in scoring position and gave the Rangers an
insurmountable 6-1 lead.

CHANGE SOUGHT IN LISTING ALL THOSE ACCUSED OF CHILD ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, a stranger approached Michael Divon in a grocery
store. How, she asked, did his 6-year-old son get that ugly bruise
on his face? Divon explained that Jonathan had fallen against a
sandbox in the school playground.
</P>
<P>
   Divon thought it a little odd when the woman followed him home
in her car.
</P>
<P>
   A few nights later a state child abuse investigator knocked at
his door. The woman from the store, it turned out, had reported
Divon's license plate number, along with her suspicion that Divon
was a child abuser.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation soon was debunked; Jonathan Divon's schoolyard
accident was witnessed by two teachers. But Michael and Donna
Divon, of Hastings, N.Y., have not been able to put the incident
behind them. Try as they might, they cannot get their names off a
state registry of people accused of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the scarlet letter they kind of erase, but they
don't get it all off,'' Mrs. Divon said. ``I have this scarlet
letter on my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1973, the registry, which is open to child abuse
investigators but not the public, contains about a million names,
of alleged abusers and their victims. For more than two decades,
names had been taken off the list whenever investigators determined
the allegations were unfounded _ that is, that there wasn't enough
evidence to substantiate the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1995, Elisa Izquierdo, 6, was killed in by her mother
though she had repeatedly come to the attention of child welfare
workers in New York City. In response to a public outcry, state
legislators changed the registry rules to prevent unfounded cases
from being expunged until 10 years after the 18th birthday of the
youngest child in the alleged abuser's family.
</P>
<P>
   The Divons are among those supporting a proposed amendment to
state law that would allow the wrongfully accused to get their
names removed from the list sooner. Under the proposal, sponsored
by State Sen.r Nick Spano, a Republican, and State Assemblyman
Richard Brodsky, a Democrat, both of Westchester County, people
seeking to have their names removed would have to provide ``clear
and convincing evidence'' of their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous attempts to change the law failed over
disagreements about how much proof would be required. Spano and
Brodsky said they were optimistic about getting the law changed
this year, but the amendment's chances are unclear. Gov. George
Pataki has been noncommittal on supporting such an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky said the abuse registry should balance investigators'
needs for complete records against the privacy concerns of the
wrongfully accused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the law isn't doing that when you have people who were
the victims of a terrible tragedy and then they have to come back
and face a lifetime of inquiries,'' he said. ``I suspect the number
of people who ought not be on this list is in the hundreds or the
thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrance McGrath, a spokesman for the State Office of Children
and Family Services, said his agency has not yet analyzed the
proposed change.
</P>
<P>
   ``But remember,'' he said, ``this is not a list available to
everyone. It's simply an investigative tool for future
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Divon, a florist, and her husband, a psychiatric nurse,
worry that their continued existence in the registry will somehow
come back to haunt them. ``What happens later on?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Months after the schoolyard mishap, Jonathan Divon fell again at
summer camp and scratched his face. His parents demanded a written
report about the accident, which they carried with them for weeks,
just in case another stranger approached in another grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have it in my wallet,'' Divon said. ``You never
know.''  &QL;

USC'S DURLEY TRIES PLAIN HARD WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGLES _ Many athletes cringe at the thought of their coach
yelling at them, even though the coach's main objective is probably
to motivate or make them better.
</P>
<P>
   Not Jennifer Durley.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me, `Please don't stop. Keep criticizing me. I know
it's in my best interest,' '' USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic said
of his sophomore two-meter player. ``That tells you about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Durley has developed into the third-leading scorer on the No.
1-ranked team in the nation. The Trojans begin play today in the
Southern California regional tournament at UC San Diego, with a
berth in next month's national tournament going to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Her 28 goals this season helped her earn All-Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation and All-MPSF Tournament First-Team honors. But
Durley's success wasn't a sure thing when Vavic recruited her out
of Thousand Oaks High. She played just two seasons in high school
and received a scholarship because Vavic liked her potential.
</P>
<P>
   The coach knew Durley was right for the program. She had the
height (6-feet-2), and she had the background.
</P>
<P>
   Durley's father, Brick, who is 6-5, is a former assistant
football coach at Tulsa, New Mexico and Hawaii. There was
discipline in the Durley house, so Vavic knew Jennifer could handle
his demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad taught me you can tell a coach, when he stops talking
to you, that's when you worry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Brick would ever stop talking to his oldest daughter.
As with many athletically inclined parents, Brick coached Jennifer
through softball, basketball and soccer, telling her whatever she
did, ``Do it at full speed, try to be the best fundamentally and go
all out. Coaches will appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was her father who led Durley into aquatics. A friend of
Brick's was involved in a junior-lifeguard program, and Jennifer
thought it would be fun because the family often made trips to Zuma
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Brick knew a junior lifeguard had to be able to swim long
distances. So one day he and 9-year-old Jennifer swam the 150 yards
from the beach to a buoy and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when she got the confidence she could do it like the
big boys,'' Brick said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only could Durley swim, she could swim fast and for
distance. She regularly won lifeguard contests that included
swimming 1,000 yards or paddling on a board 800 yards in the open
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   At USC, Durley has impressed her teammates with her desire to
improve and her ability to handle a coach's criticism. She often
comes to practice early to ride a stationary bicycle for an hour,
or will stay afterward to work on her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think highly of her,'' said roommate and teammate Kim
Camacho. ``I'd like to be like her. She gives everything 100
percent. That's the way I should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The work, coupled with Vavic's demanding style, has toughened
Durley to the point that she laughs at other players who
occasionally try to advise her in practice or after a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She won't let anyone do that,'' said senior goalie Bernice
Orwig, who often tries to order Durley around but gets nowhere.
``People tell her what to do, and she says, `No, I'm a senior
member of this team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her development has caused pride all around, from coach, father
and herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants it more,'' Vavic said. ``There's nothing worse
than a talented player who's not utilizing their talent.'' &QL;

WOMEN'S WATER POLO &QL; 
__ What: Southern California Western Regional &QL; 
__ Where: UC San Diego &QL; 
__ Who: Seven teams, incuding top-seeded USC and second-seeded
UCLA &QL; 
__ When: Today through Sunday &QL; 
__ At stake: Four berths in the NCAA National Tournament &QL; 
__ Analysis: They really make it easy for the top teams to advance
to the May 7-9 nationals. All USC or UCLA have to do is win their
first two matches and they're in. USC opens today at 2 p.m. against
third-seeded San Diego State, then plays UCLA Saturday at 2 p.m.
UCLA plays twice Saturday, starting with San Diego State at 9 a.m.
If the teams have defeated San Diego State when they meet, then the
loser will have to win just one of two matches Sunday to secure a
berth.
</P>
<P>
   __ USC: The Trojans (24-2) have the advantage, having beaten
three-time national champion UCLA four times but never by more than
two goals. Goalies Bernice Orwig (USC) and Erin Golaboski (UCLA)
are among the nation's best. Freshman Aniko Pelle leads the Trojans
with 42 goals, followed by Nina Wengst with 32 goals and Thousand
Oaks graduate Jennifer Durley with 28 goals. &QL; 
__ UCLA: The Bruins (18-8) are without three players who are
redshirting the season to compete on the U.S. national team. The
Bruins' coach, Guy Baker, is coaching the national team, so Adam
Krikorian is the interim head coach. Freshman Elaine Zivich scored
a team-high 48 goals.

4 MEN IN N.J. TURNPIKE SHOOTING FILE SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A year ago, a seemingly random traffic stop placed
them at the center of a public outcry over racial profiling,
triggering numerous investigations into its practice, and if the
pronouncements of public officials hold true, its end.
</P>
<P>
   But when Leroy Jarmaine Grant, one of three young black and
Hispanic men shot by state troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike a
year ago, spoke about his experience Thursday, he did so not as a
symbol of a civil rights crusade but as a young man in pain. ``I
just want to tell you all it has been a hard-fought year for all
four of us,'' Grant said, after lawyers for him and his companions
announced that they were filing a civil suit against the state, the
New Jersey State Police, the troopers and their supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future's just been snatched, for no reason,'' he said, so
overcome by emotion that he could barely speak. ``To this day, I
still don't know why we got shot. It's been mentally, physically
hard for us. The bullets are still lodged in our bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 23, 1998, Grant, who is black, and three friends,
Daniel Reyes, Rayshawn Brown and Keshon Moore, were driving in a
van to a basketball tryout at North Carolina Central University.
Two troopers, James Kenna and John Hogan, pulled them over,
although they say they were not speeding, and fired 11 shots into
the van after it began to roll backward. Grant and Brown, who is
black, and Reyes, who is Hispanic, were wounded. Moore, who is
black, was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout since has seen the dismissal of the superintendent
of the state troopers, the convening of two grand juries and the
start of investigations by federal and state authorities into the
practice of racial profiling _ making stops and searches based on
the race or ethnicity of motorists _ which civil rights lawyers and
even many troopers have long maintained is practiced on the New
Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a grand jury indicted the troopers, both of
whom are white, on charges of falsely reporting the race of black
motorists as white to disguise racial profiling. And on Tuesday,
Gov. Christie Whitman conceded that an investigation showed that
racial profiling was indeed being practiced on the turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   For Grant, that admission did not come soon enough. ``Christie
Whitman, the governor, as a parent, I want to know why couldn't she
acknowledge us, as a parent, not as a political leader, but as a
parent,'' he said. ``Why didn't she come forward and give an
apology about what happened, and that racial profiling did exist
all these years and was ignored?''
</P>
<P>
   One of Grant's lawyers, Johnnie Cochran Jr., was more blunt. He
called racial profiling a ``cancer'' and said, ``If we don't get
public officials who are responsive to these problems, they should
be voted out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran's colleague, Peter Neufeld, said that there had been
``overwhelming evidence'' of racial profiling for a decade and that
he believed state officials were aware of it. ``All of this could
have been changed long ago, and if it had been changed long ago the
bottom line is, that these four men wouldn't be standing here today
with their lives cut short by this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who was the only one of the four men to speak at a news
conference Thursday at his lawyers' offices in lower Manhattan,
described months of therapy and operations. ``The injuries will
prevent us from playing the game we love the most, and that's
basketball,'' he said. ``That's all we want to do _ just have a
future, provide for our family and friends. We're good kids.
There's no criminal record for any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was filed in Superior Court of New Jersey but
also includes some claims under federal law, seeks unspecified
damages, saying that the young men all had the potential for
athletic scholarships and promising basketball careers. It also
seeks injunctive relief to end racial profiling and any practices
that encourage it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the suit's claims are that racial profiling was a
well-known practice among troopers and that it was encouraged by
supervisors and ignored by state officials for years. The suit
asserts that troopers Hogan and Kenna denied the young men medical
care after they were shot, strip-searching them instead.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also asserts that the stop itself was illegal and
discriminatory because it was made solely on the grounds of race.
Linda Kenney, the lawyer for Keshon Moore, noted that the
indictment charging the two troopers with falsely recording the
race of motorists indicates that they filed one such false report
just 50 minutes before the four young men were stopped and shot.

ANGELS SLIDE AT FIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Mo Vaughn returned with a bang, but the Angels
finished their three-game series against the Toronto Blue Jays with
a thud.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the previous 14 games with a sprained left ankle,
Vaughn hit the first pitch he saw Thursday an estimated 451 feet to
center field for a two-run homer in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to inspire the Angels, who built a five-run lead. But
the Blue Jays, the hottest team in baseball, rallied for an 8-7 win
before 28,212 at SkyDome to complete a three-game sweep and extend
their winning streak to eight games.
</P>
<P>
   After his homer, Vaughn flied to center, grounded to second and
struck out. The game ended when Matt Walbeck struck out with Vaughn
on deck.
</P>
<P>
   For the Angels, the loss was their fifth in a row and was
something even Vaughn couldn't stop. But if there was a positive
for the Angels, it's that Vaughn's ankle was fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tweak the ankle so it's another day of progress,''
Vaughn said. ``It's a gradual process. I know my game and what I
have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn also said he felt comfortable at the plate despite not
hitting in a live game since April 6. The home run hit a window of
the restaurant ``Windows'' about 50 feet above the center-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is I had a decent approach,'' Vaughn said.
``You try to swing at strikes. I'm an aggressive hitter. I believe
in three strikes _ you use all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad and Garret Anderson each followed Vaughn's lead
with two-run homers, Erstad's coming in the second inning and
Anderson's in the fifth. But the Blue Jays rallied against Angels
starter Tim Belcher with long balls of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green and Darrin Fletcher each hit two-run homers in the
fifth inning, and Pat Kelly hit two homers, the second tying the
game at 7 in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one's clearly on me,'' said Belcher, who gave up six runs
and 10 hits in 42/3 innings but didn't get the loss. ``If your
starter can't hold a 7-2 lead, there's trouble. You can't expect
the bullpen to do miracles for you. You can't expect the offense to
keep pounding out runs. Seven runs in four innings is clearly
enough. . . . I got killed. I got my (rear) beat. What else can you
say?''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored the winning run with a bloop single and
three walks. Tony Fernandez, who reached base five times (three
singles, two walks), walked on a 3-2 pitch from Troy Percival with
two out in the eighth inning to drive in Kelly with what turned out
to be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in trying to throw fastballs as hard as I can,''
Percival said. ``He fouled off some good pitches. It was a good
at-bat by him. With the last pitch I got too fancy, I should have
thrown the ball down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival hadn't pitched in a game since April 17 and has had
only one save opportunity all season, which came on opening night.
But he wouldn't use his lack of activity as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be ready in that situation,'' he said. ``I don't
need any excuses made for me. I didn't do the job. I should have
done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fun situation for me. Bases loaded in a tie ballgame.
You have to relish that. You win or you lose. Today we lost. I had
a chance to get us back in the dugout and I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough loss for the Angels, especially considering the
importance manager Terry Collins placed on it before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night right now is big, very big. We need to break it
(losing streak) and get it going,'' Collins said. ``Tonight's the
biggest game we've played thus far this season.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Vaughn said there's no reason to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team's going to be fine,'' he said. ``We just need to
make sure we stay together and have a strong attitude. It'll turn
for us. When it does, it'll be like wildfire. When you're in a
slump for four or five games, the first one is always the toughest
to get.''

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ It was just 11 weeks ago that a court officer
released Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold early from a juvenile
diversion program, saying they had learned the intended lessons in
the months since their arrest and had promising futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in
life,'' the officer wrote in a report made public here on Thursday.
``He is intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he
stays on task and remains motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Klebold, the officer said, ``He is intelligent enough to make
any dream a reality, but he needs to understand hard work is part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could predict that the two high school seniors would move
from minor charges of criminal mischief, theft and trespass to
masterminding one of the worst school massacres in the nation's
history, killing a dozen schoolmates and a teacher before turning
the guns on themselves?
</P>
<P>
   As more bombs were discovered at Columbine High School and names
of the dead were made public on Thursday, the families and closest
friends of the two responsible for the carnage remained in
seclusion. But a fuller portrait of the two perpetrators and their
families is beginning to emerge, and it is filled with
contradictions and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The killers, who targeted athletes, both had done well in Little
League, teammates said; Harris was fond of wearing a Colorado
Rockies cap before he moved to this Denver suburb from Plattsburgh,
N.Y. They were said to hate minorities, but in Plattsburgh, Harris'
best friends were black and Asian.
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, their only scrape with the law was the March 1998
arrest that resulted in the juvenile diversion program. They held
jobs at a local pizza place, and a Saturday night out was likely to
be at the Rock `N' Bowl at Belleview Lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Many students recalled nasty interactions in which the young men
insulted and threatened classmates or even flashed weapons; many
others, though, recalled quiet, shy teen-agers who played cards in
the lunchroom and offered to help others make videos or use
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Any warning signs seemed hidden under the black trench coats
they wore, regardless of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they dressed a little differently, maybe they dressed in
black, but so, what do priests dress in?'' asked John Adams, whose
daughter was friends with Klebold and often had him over to watch
movies or play computer games. ``Are priests anarchists, do they
blow up things? It's just people trying to set other people apart
because they're different. That's why we have so many of the
problems in this world, because we try to set ourselves apart or
set ourselves above.''
</P>
<P>
   The court officer, whose name was blacked out in the documents,
said Harris ``excelled in school'' and enjoyed an anger management
program that seemed to dovetail with his individual counseling; for
Klebold, the officer said, the 45 hours of community service were
the most effective, as ``he learned a lot from having to give up
free time to work for no money.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys tested negative for drugs, and paid their fees on time.
They wrote letters of apology, and took an ethics class. Harris was
described as ``very articulate and intelligent,'' Klebold as
someone ``with a great deal of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny La Plante, a senior who took an early morning bowling
class with both young men, recalled Klebold's tiny gesture of
rebellion: tossing the ball shotput-style from his chest down the
lanes, which annoyed the teacher and the alley management. Harris,
she said, was a star last semester in Composition for the College
Bound. ``He was one of the smartest kids in our class,'' she said.
``He always knew the answers, whether it was a passage from
Shakespeare or a prepositional phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be evidence of something scarier. The FBI issued a
subpoena Thursday to America Online pertaining ``to a Web site
associated with the individuals involved in the shooting at
Columbine High School,'' said Special Agent Gary Gomez. Gomez
declined to offer details of the Web site, but material circulating
on the Internet attributed to Harris shows eerie drawings of
shotgun-toting monsters and skulls and instructions for making pipe
bombs like those that blew up at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Post reported Thursday that the two young men had
made a video in a production class that showed people in trench
coats gunning down athletes in the school hallways and were upset
when they were not allowed to screen it for classmates. School
officials declined to discuss the video.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Breed and Peter Maher, 17-year-old juniors at Columbine,
said they, too, glimpsed the darker side.
</P>
<P>
   Last July 4th, Breed and Maher said they ran into the two young
men as well as others in the Trenchcoat Mafia at a 7-Eleven.
Someone tossed a donut and some biting insults at the crowd with
Harris and Klebold. As they drove away, Maher said he saw someone
in a trench coat waving a pistol-grip shotgun in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the two groups met again at a nearby
fireworks stand, Breed and Maher said, and the youths in trench
coats were shouting at them in German. Maher said that Harris held
a foot-long lead pipe by his side and another student, who was
questioned after Tuesday's massacre but released, pulled out a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people at the school get into fights, they throw a few
punches and it's broken up, but no, they wanted to put us in the
hospital,'' Breed recalled. ``I was going to beat the crap out of
him, but then I'm glad I didn't because I would have probably been
the target. They would probably have been looking for me on this
day, so I'm glad I didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Breed said he has known Klebold since they were on the same
baseball team in first grade. But this year, Breed said, if someone
bumped into Klebold in the hallway, he would say, ``I'll kill
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a normal kid,'' Breed said. ``I don't know what
happened. He turned into a nut case.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Harris and Klebold come from middle-class, two-parent
families. Klebold's father, Thomas, is a retired geologist who runs
Fountain Real Estate Management from his home. His mother, Susan,
has worked for years in the local community college system,
counseling disabled students, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado vehicle registration records show that the Klebold
family owns at least seven cars, including four BMWs that date from
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly
normal,'' Michael Briand, a colleague of Klebold's mother, told The
Associated Press. ``They did everything right. But somehow the pain
and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't reach
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris' father, Wayne, is a decorated Air Force pilot who
retired as a major after 20 years of service in 1993, and now works
in the administration at Flight Safety Services, a pilot training
school in Englewood, not far from here.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Katherine, works at a catering service in town and
his older brother, Kevin, is a student at the University of
Colorado in Boulder. Scott Berg, a sophomore at the university who
also attended Columbine, said Kevin Harris is ``just the sort of
guy his brother was gunning for.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Harris was an honor student and played tight end for the
Columbine Rebels, Berg said, and Harris' mother went to all the
games, even when their son was only on junior varsity. Berg's
younger brother Steve, an athlete at Columbine, said he recently
confronted Harris during bowling class.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother's Jewish, and this whole Naziism thing really
bothered him,'' Scott Berg said. ``So he went up to these guys and
said, what's with all this German stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It is those allegations of racism that are most baffling to
friends and neighbors that Harris left behind in Plattsburgh, a
small town about an hour south of Montreal, in 1993, when the Air
Force base where his father was stationed closed.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the portrait of an awkward outsider that has been
drawn since the shooting, his friends in Plattsburgh say that
although Harris was more reserved than many of his peers, he was
well-liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all these little cliques, and he was right along with
all of us,'' said Nora Bordeau, 17, a former classmate. ``He was a
quiet kid, but he had a lot of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his closest friends, they said, were two boys from the
base who have also moved away; one was black, the other Asian.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his good friends was this Asian kid who was also a very
good athlete, so I don't think anyone would say he had a problem
with either athletes or minorities when he was here,'' said Mike
Condo, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Harris became an avid Rockies fan even before his family moved
West, and often wore a baseball cap in Plattsburgh. His father
urged him to join Little League to meet other kids, and people here
said his parents came to every game as well as some practices.
Whenever a boy went up to bat, recalled Brendan LaPier, 17, a
former teammate, Harris' father offered ``a pat on the back and a
little confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was an average player who didn't mind being alone and
spent a lot of time in the dugout. When the shy right-fielder came
up to bat, he would stare at the pitcher and ready his stance, then
let the balls zoom past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to kind of egg him on to swing, to hit the pitch
sometimes,'' said Terry Condo, his former coach. ``It wasn't that
he was afraid of the ball, just that he didn't want to miss. He
didn't want to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   During a sixth-grade field trip to Boston, Harris and his
classmates visited a pizza restaurant, where he ate scrambled egg
pizza and then played video games. One game, called Lethal
Enforcer, in which a plastic gun is fired at the screen, seemed to
really capture his fascination, his friends recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Pasti, 17, said Harris left an inscrutable message on his
middle-school yearbook: ``You've been a good friend. Have a great
summer. I'll send you a shirt from Denver. I'm going to miss all of
you. Mochenderrystinckypoo, Eric Harris.''
</P>
<P>
   Though schools in Plattsburgh have been closed this week for
spring break, many former classmates have been gathering in each
other's homes to watch the news with horror. At first, some were
concerned about his safety and tried to contact him, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Like their counterparts in Colorado, most in Plattsburgh
remember Harris as a student who got A's and B's and loved computer
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the one thing I can remember him talking about, the
games he played and the levels he would get,'' said LaPier. ``He
would just come up and tell you about it, while, otherwise, he was
the kind of person you would have to approach if you wanted to
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The love of computers may be connected to the killing spree as
investigators searching for clues about the gunmen turn to the
recesses of cyberspace, where documents attributed to the two
killers talk of their darker interests and inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brown, a classmate, said Harris had sent him threatening
messages over the Internet after a disagreement last year. His
father, Randy Brown, said he had found some of the Internet
writings by Harris so frightening that he turned over 15 pages to a
deputy. Harris wrote that he couldn't wait to start killing people
and that he would feel no remorse, Randy Brown said. ``I live in
Denver, and I would love to kill almost all of its residents,'' he
was quoted as writing. ``You all better hide in your houses because
I'm coming for everyone and I will shoot to kill and I will kill
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online said it had removed postings apparently
pertaining to the case, but material posted on the Internet
Thursday appeared to replicate Harris' previous Web sites and
postings, said several people who say they viewed and copied the
pages before they were removed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Web material attributed to Harris included instructions on how
to build pipe bombs like those used in the Columbine attack and an
illustration of a creature toting a shotgun and a knife, standing
on a pile of skulls.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the site were the song lyrics: ``What I don't say I
don't do. What I don't do I don't like. What I don't like I
Waste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebdomine'' was one of several America Online user names
attributed to Harris; others were ``rebldomakr'' and ``RebDoomer,''
apparently a reference to his interest in the computer video game
called Doom, in which the object is to roam a maze toting various
high-powered weapons and blowing away everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the piece of Internet evidence most clearly tied to
Harris is a document discussing weapons of destruction. ``Shrapnel
is very important if you want to kill and injure a lot of people,''
it reads. ``Almost anything small and metal will work. From paper
clips cut into pieces to two-inch nails.''
</P>
<P>
   Two young men said they made an electronic copy of the document
before it was removed by AOL on Tuesday. Embedded in it was a
reference to Wayne N. Harris, Eric's father, implying that it was
written on a computer in the Harris home, using software registered
by the father, thus validating its origin, computer programming
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Web site was an illustration of a man shooting
automatic pistols, a large monster with horns, and a boy, eyes
wide, pointing two pistols. In big red letters, it says: ``I hate
you. Eric Harris owns every single one of you: The fireworks will
be set in the four twenty one!! Doom will become reality!''
</P>
<P>
   Also circulating widely in Internet discussion groups is a
profile of Mr. Harris said to have been used for his America Online
account. The profile lists the author as Eric Harris, and states
his hobbies as: ``Professional doom and doom2, creator. Meeting
beautiful females, being cool.''
</P>
<P>
   For a personal quotation, the profile states, ``Quit whining,
it's just a flesh wound _ Kill Em AALLL!!!''

   OJAI, Calif. _ Another year, another early exit for UCLA's
Jean-Noel Grinda in the Pacific-10 singles championship at the 99th
annual Ojai Valley tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an injured elbow and inexperience derailed Grinda in
the first round. On Thursday, it was a sloppy net game and the
tenacity of unseeded Michel Stopa of Arizona that knocked the
second-seeded Grinda, ranked fourth in the country, out in the
opening round, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year he doesn't have an excuse,'' said UCLA coach Billy
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Grinda quickly left Libbey Park after the loss and wasn't around
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   It was a surprisingly bad day for the No. 1 Bruins, whose four
players were eliminated on the first day. In fact, only Calabasas
graduate Jason Cook made it to the second round after beating
Oregon's Thomas Schneiter 7-6, 7-5 to open play Thursday. But Cook
later fell to Arizona State's Gustavo Marcaccio 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a little break now before the NCAA tournament (in
May,) and we've been going pretty hard the last month so we can use
it,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It was a better day for the USC men's team with Patrick
Gottesleben advancing to today's quarterfinals with wins over
Washington's Christopher Kull, 6-4, 7-5, and Stanford's K.J.
Hippensteel, 6-3, 6-3. Teammate Andrew Park made it to the second
round but lost 6-4, 6-3 to Stanford's Ryan Wolters.
</P>
<P>
   In women's play, USC's Kara Warkentin and Jacqui Boyd and UCLA's
Annic Cooper, the defending champion, all advanced to today's
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Grinda rallied in the third set to force the tiebreaker, staving
off four match points to break Stopa and tie the set 5-5. Grinda
held serve to go up 6-5, but Stopa dominated on serve to tie it
6-6. He overpowered Grinda 6-2 in the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you miss four match points, it gets to you and it's
pretty easy to get frustrated and let up,'' Stopa said. ``But I
told myself that I'd been out there for three hours already,
another 10 minutes wasn't going to hurt me in a match this big. I
got some lucky shots and I hit some good shots in the tiebreaker
and things worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who watched nervously as Grinda fought off elimination
to pull even in the third set, was impressed with the way Stopa
rebounded to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Grinda broke serve), I thought he was in good shape, but
(Stopa) kept his head and did a good job,'' Martin said. ``I
thought (Jean-Noel) hit some bad forehands in the tiebreaker, I
thought he shot himself in the foot a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopa went up 4-0 in the tiebreaker, then easily closed out the
win.
</P>
<P>
   With the NCAA tournament starting in May, Grinda had hoped to
use Ojai as a final tuneup. Now he has to put the loss behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a tournament like this, with 32 top players, I'm not sure
anything is an upset,'' Martin said. ``But hopefully this shows
(Jean-Noel) that he has to be ready to play everytime he steps on
the court.''

   PODGORICA _ Montenegro is a country of breathtaking vistas.
Massive black mountains, streaked with snow, falling into endless
blue chasms, fade into the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been a swashbuckling, Byronesque sort of place,
home to princes, smugglers, poets and, latterly, to a stalwart band
of down-to-earth democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For, amazingly, Montenegro _ poorest, smallest and most feudal
of the six republics that once made up federal Yugoslavia, and now
the only one left in it beside Serbia _ is the last oasis of sanity
in the war-torn Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it too may soon be dragged into the quagmire. Threats of a
bloody coup hang in the air. Air-raid sirens pierce the nocturnal
quiet. Each time, as the NATO bombers pass over, a little more of
President Milo Djukanovic's political life force ebbs away. Which
is exactly what Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic wants.
</P>
<P>
   For Djukanovic's statelet stands for everything Milosevic hates.
It wants him out. It refuses to declare war on countries in NATO.
It opposes Yugoslavia's heralded union with Russia. It upholds a
fragile, pro-western democracy and a free press, offering
devolution and amity to its own ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's fall would almost certainly make blood flow. And it
would end the democracy Montenegrins have nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   But the republic is already bitterly divided. Most of its
southerners still back Djukanovic and dream of independence. The
north is for Milosevic. Any civil war would be fratricidal and
ideological as well as regional.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Neno Lopicic and Nikola Bogdanovic. Playing
frisbee in the rain outside the old royal palace in Cetinje, they
are best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Both are 19, speak passable English, sport American baseball
caps. But Neno is for Milosevic, a Greater Serbia and a Slav union
with Russia. Nikola, named for Montenegro's last king, is for Bill
Clinton and Montenegrin independence.
</P>
<P>
   Neno would like to see the whites of an American soldier's eyes;
Nikola boasts how his father went to prison for seeking
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Both lads say they would never take up arms against each other,
yet both say they would happily die for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Such passion scares most of the country's politicians stiff.
``Independence is not worth the life of a single Montenegrin,''
says Branko Perovic, its foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has other ideas _ but is too chastened, for now, to
put them into practice. ``He cannot afford two fronts,'' says a
hopeful Montenegrin minister. ``But as soon as Kosovo quiets down,
he will turn his guns on us.''
</P>
<P>
   A dissident Montenegro is bad enough for Milosevic; an
independent one, home to Yugoslavia's navy, would be unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   So he has put a tough general in charge of the 10,000 or so
federal troops stationed in the republic, muzzled its voice in the
federal parliament, and tried (so far in vain) to silence its
annoyingly lively press.
</P>
<P>
   If it came to a fight, Djukanovic might well go down with guns
blazing. He controls 8,000 well-trained special police, who have so
far fended off a coup by Milosevic's friends.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiar stalemate _ a kind of dual sovereignty _ prevails.
While foreign journalists are safe on Djukanovic's turf, once in
federal army territory they risk being beaten up.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian nationalism has already cost Montenegro dearly. Tourism
and legal commerce are dead, the republic's merchant fleet stuck in
port. This year's planned budget of $300 million is but a pipe
dream. No tax is being collected. The war is said to cost an extra
$18 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, 22,000 people lived in Ulcinj, a beach resort. Now
45,000 do. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of destitute Kosovar
Albanians line the promenade. Nearby, scores of refugees bed down
in a tiny whitewashed mosque. The air is fetid. They have just one
open latrine, one tap.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro now hosts 55,000 Kosovo refugees, along with another
25,000 from the wars in Croatia and Bosnia _ some 15 percent of its
current population.
</P>
<P>
   Without outside help, they, or Milosevic, may sink Djukanovic _
and Montenegro. &QL;

<P>
   It is not quite the birthday party they planned. Whether NATO's
leaders issue a lot of grand policy statements at this weekend's
50th-anniversary summit (as the American hosts would like), or only
a few (as some Europeans hope), they are in danger of making fools
of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Such documents will be consigned to history's proverbial scrap
heap unless the allies can convince themselves, their adversaries
and the rest of the world that some dignified conclusion to their
Balkan entanglement is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are not wrong to step back briefly from their large,
and growing, local difficulties and ask themselves what the war
with Serbia means in the light of NATO's 50-year history, its
declared aims and its future, if indeed it has one.
</P>
<P>
   Those last five words are, unfortunately, a necessary
qualification. If it is true that NATO's relative success in Bosnia
boosted its morale and affirmed its usefulness after the Soviet
collapse, then it is necessary at least to ask what a failure now
in Kosovo would mean.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, such a failure would have ominous implications for the
alliance. Perhaps it would not mean outright death, given that the
allies would still presumably want to defend each other's soil.
</P>
<P>
   But limping home from Kosovo would certainly oblige NATO to
rethink its post-Cold-War aims of intervention not just for its
members' defense but also for the broader interests of
humanitarianism and international order. NATO might even go into
terminal decline.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget, the perverse fragility of the defense pact
that faced down the mighty Soviet empire has already been exposed,
and not so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the summer of 1995, when Britain and France, as
leaders of a hard-pressed U.N. mission in Bosnia, demanded _ and
only just got _ an American guarantee that they would not be left
alone to cope with an escalating war.
</P>
<P>
   None of the western diplomats who struggled through that crisis
has any doubt that NATO came within a hair's breadth of total
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   What was at stake then, and is again, was NATO's continuing
ability to live up to the lofty ideals laid out by the alliance's
founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington treaty that gave birth to NATO proclaimed, first,
a community of values in the founders' common heritage, based ``on
the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the signatories established a community of fate, by
pledging to consider ``an armed attack on one...as an attack on
all.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that community of fate which would have failed if America
had deserted its allies in Bosnia _ and will be put to a severe
test if land operations begin in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In different ways, the tragedy in Kosovo has also been a
challenge to the allies' declared common values, which have always
been viewed with a certain skepticism in places beyond Europe and
North America.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO had simply shrugged and done nothing as the Serbs
evicted tens of thousands of people in Kosovo, forcing at least
some of them to seek refuge in neighboring countries, NATO would
have looked cynical, irrelevant to security and stability in
Europe, and possibly for that reason doomed.
</P>
<P>
   And now, having tried _ so far with disastrous results _ to stop
the Serb atrocities by launching an air war, the alliance faces
widespread criticism around the world for failing to get a license
from the United Nations and thus breaking international law.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the countries that would have excoriated NATO for
indifference to the fate of persecuted Muslims are now deploring
the alliance as an international scofflaw and bully.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's hope of surviving the Kosovo crisis with head
held high will depend, among other things, on securing an outcome
which salvages some of the values it is built on.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it needs a settlement that guarantees the right
of as many as possible of the province's prewar residents to go
home and live there safely; and since this is inconceivable under
Slobodan Milosevic or the Kosovo Liberation Army, some sort of
international protectorate will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal results of NATO's bombing campaign have made this
harder to bring about. Even if America were to decide that NATO
must impose such a protectorate unilaterally by mounting a land
invasion of Kosovo, it is far from certain that its European allies
would agree.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, hard diplomatic, as well as military, work will be
needed to prepare the way for a ground presence in the killing
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious, but equally important, is the need for the
Washington summit to persist in explaining to other countries the
principles that guided NATO's decision to intervene in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The necessity is not so much to prove that this was a ``just
cause'' _ countries will form their own conclusions about that _
but to reassure a suspicious world that NATO has not given itself
the right to attack sovereign nations at whim.
</P>
<P>
   However absurd that suspicion may seem to countries within NATO,
it has taken hold in places as far apart as China, India and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, there is nowhere else in Europe (leaving aside
ever-feuding Greece and Turkey) which has the same potential as
Kosovo to draw NATO into war.
</P>
<P>
   There is no other place in the continent which combines that
province's explosive ingredients: a population of at least 1.5
million, which has been ruled without consent by what it regards as
an alien and intolerably cruel authority _ plus an ample supply of
cheap weaponry, in a region whose terrain and weak institutions
make it almost impossible to police the flow of guns.
</P>
<P>
   So if the Kosovo conflict were solved, there would be a decent
chance of it being Europe's last war for a long time. Would it
therefore be NATO's last nondefensive war?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would, if the world can agree on how to take
collective action against despots, genocidal regimes and others who
commit intolerable atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Some kind of military force, maybe under the U.N., will surely
be needed if the sort of events seen in Rwanda five years ago are
in future to be prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Better, certainly, that this should not be NATO. But better
perhaps, in some circumstances, even outside NATO's traditional
area, that it should be NATO than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other tasks await. Most of the original plans for the
summit to redirect and reinvigorate NATO _ new members, new
partnerships, new missions, and so on _ will have to be put aside
until the Balkan fires have been doused.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the new jobs that America envisages for the alliance
has suddenly become more urgent than ever: stemming the
proliferation of nonconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As they watch the punishment being meted out to Serbia, many a
tinpot dictator will be wondering whether the secret acquisition of
ballistic missiles, tipped with chemicals, germs or even nuclear
weapons, would not be the best way to avoid a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   It is far too soon for NATO to go out of business. &QL;

<P>
   It is not quite the birthday party they planned. Whether NATO's
leaders issue a lot of grand policy statements at this weekend's
50th-anniversary summit (as the American hosts would like), or only
a few (as some Europeans hope), they are in danger of making fools
of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Such documents will be consigned to history's proverbial scrap
heap unless the allies can convince themselves, their adversaries
and the rest of the world that some dignified conclusion to their
Balkan entanglement is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are not wrong to step back briefly from their large,
and growing, local difficulties and ask themselves what the war
with Serbia means in the light of NATO's 50-year history, its
declared aims and its future, if indeed it has one.
</P>
<P>
   Those last five words are, unfortunately, a necessary
qualification. If it is true that NATO's relative success in Bosnia
boosted its morale and affirmed its usefulness after the Soviet
collapse, then it is necessary at least to ask what a failure now
in Kosovo would mean.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, such a failure would have ominous implications for the
alliance. Perhaps it would not mean outright death, given that the
allies would still presumably want to defend each other's soil.

RANGERS MAY GO TO FOUR-MAN ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Manager Johnny Oates says the Rangers might use a
four-man rotation beginning May 1.
</P>
<P>
   The concept emerged after the injury to starter John Burkett,
whom the Rangers placed on the 15-day disabled list with stiffness
in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers recalled left-handed reliever Mike Venafro from
Triple-A Oklahoma to replace Burkett on the roster. Right-hander
Rick Helling is scheduled to assume Burkett's turn in the rotation
Sunday with three days rest, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers prefer that Esteban Loaiza remain in his role as a
long reliever, where he has flourished of late, Oates said. The
Rangers also prefer another left-handed reliever for the bullpen
with the number of quality left-handed hitters the Rangers will see
against the Minnesota Twins, New York Yankees and Cleveland Indians
during the next week, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need another starter until \RMay 1\S, if then,'' Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starting pitchers entered last night's game averaging
only 87.5 pitches per appearance, which increases the likelihood of
the four-man rotation becoming a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it'll work, but I'm willing to try anything,''
Oates said. ``Maybe it'll never get past'' May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Oates spoke to Helling about the possibility Wednesday, and the
pitcher responded favorably. Mike Morgan and Aaron Sele also
reacted positively to the idea, Helling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that hasn't been tried before,'' Oates
said. ``I'm not inventing the egg. We could be back in a five-man
rotation \RMay 1\S. Loaiza could be starting.''
RODRIGUEZ EXAMINED
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers sent catcher Ivan Rodriguez for X-rays after a
first-inning collision at the plate with Twins right-fielder Matt
Lawton forced him to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Steubs, the Twins' physician, examined Rodriguez, who
complained of dizziness after Lawton's forearm hit him in the left
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton, who was trying to score from second base on an infield
single, left the game after the second inning with a bruised right
shoulder.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Burkett is scheduled to be examined Monday by Dr. James Andrews
in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Simms (torn left Achilles' tendon) suffered another setback
in his attempt to rejoin the Rangers by Tuesday. Simms did not play
in Oklahoma's 7-2 victory yesterday against Tacoma. The Rangers
expect Simms to start tonight at first base for his first
appearance in the field since beginning his medical rehabilitation
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   A rash of injuries forced the Rangers to promote outfielders
Corey Wright and Ernise Baez from their extended spring program to
Class-A Savannah. The Sand Gnats placed three players _ shortstop
David Meliah (fracture in right wrist), outfielder Antwon Rollins
(fracture bone outside right wrist) and pitcher Carlos Figueroa
(strained left shoulder) _ on the disabled list.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Masked men in strange uniforms moved methodically through the
school, firing semiautomatic weapons at students and teachers as
they went. They showed no mercy. When a student begged for her
life, one of the gunmen laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Such horrible scenes have been repeated over and over again
recently. But this particular atrocity was occurring not in Kosovo,
but in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Mass-shootings in American schools are becoming a grotesque rite
of spring. Last March four girls and a teacher were shot to death
and ten people wounded when two boys, 11 and 13, opened fire at
their school in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   This week's two teenage murderers easily surpassed that toll.
The final number killed at the high school in Littleton remains to
be seen: 15 died on the spot, including the two murderers who took
their own lives, and many others are injured.
</P>
<P>
   What is most bizarre about America's spate of school shootings _
which have claimed 30 lives and scores of wounded over the past 18
months _ is not that they have occurred, but America's reaction to
them.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the response to Littleton has been pretty much what it
was last year to the Jonesboro massacre: plenty of public
hand-wringing about moral decay and media violence.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last year, Bill Clinton has promised to fly in teams
of ``grief counsellors'' and has warned that there are plenty of
other potentially violent kids who are not being ``reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there have been further calls to beef up security at
schools. But these are all side issues, which have nothing to do
with what really distinguishes America from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Young people everywhere, like many of their elders, have violent
fantasies. Teaching teenagers to curb their angry impulses is a
challenge for every parent on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   If America is in moral decline, then so is most of the rest of
the world, which just as avidly consumes violent films and rock
videos. Mentally disturbed people anywhere can sometimes pose a
threat to others. And all schools, not just those in America,
remain vulnerable to someone looking for innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
   But, of all rich countries, only America makes it possible for
teenage misfits, those nursing a grudge, the insane or anyone else
determined to cause mayhem to get their hands so easily on such a
terrifying array of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After a disgruntled Scoutmaster killed 16 nursery pupils and
their teacher at a school in Dunblane, Scotland, in 1996, Britain
banned all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   After one man wielding a semiautomatic rifle murdered 35 people
in Tasmania the month after the Dunblane massacre, Australia
drastically tightened its gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Such a response in America seems inconceivable. Years of bitter
debate about gun control have left America with ludicrously lax gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Firearm violence which dwarfs the rate in other countries, and
repeated mass-shootings, have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ferocious, well-financed lobbying by the National Rifle
Association (NRA) and other pro-gun groups has stymied efforts to
introduce any but the mildest of restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In his response to the Littleton shootings, Clinton can almost
be forgiven for not mentioning gun control. Most Americans are
weary of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   And yet America stands little chance of avoiding more
mass-shootings, or reducing its shocking level of lethal violence,
until it finds some way to agree on stricter gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Outright bans may not be on the American agenda, but there
should be some way to restrict the circulation of at least the
automatic and semiautomatic weapons which feature so prominently in
massacres such as Littleton, and the increasingly powerful handguns
coming on to the market.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of hope. Gun-control advocates have switched
their attention from fruitless arguments about the Second Amendment
and personal choice, and are concentrating instead on guns as a
threat to public health.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they have chosen the wrong way to present this
argument _ through lawsuits against gun makers. But deployed in the
public arena and in legislatures, where the gun debate belongs,
such arguments might yet lower the political temperature far enough
to produce reasonable compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, against expectations, the tragedy at Littleton may also
mark a turning-point.
</P>
<P>
   Fortuitously, the NRA is scheduled to hold its annual convention
next week in Denver, a few miles from the school massacre. The
sight of NRA activists facing Littleton's angry and grieving people
to explain their unrelenting opposition to gun control of any kind
should make Americans pause.
</P>
<P>
   Such fundamentalism on guns is unreasonable, and has already
taken too high a toll. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Masked men in strange uniforms moved methodically through the
school, firing semiautomatic weapons at students and teachers as
they went. They showed no mercy. When a student begged for her
life, one of the gunmen laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Such horrible scenes have been repeated over and over again
recently. But this particular atrocity was occurring not in Kosovo,
but in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Mass-shootings in American schools are becoming a grotesque rite
of spring. Last March four girls and a teacher were shot to death
and ten people wounded when two boys, 11 and 13, opened fire at
their school in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   This week's two teenage murderers easily surpassed that toll.
The final number killed at the high school in Littleton remains to
be seen: 15 died on the spot, including the two murderers who took
their own lives, and many others are injured.
</P>
<P>
   What is most bizarre about America's spate of school shootings _
which have claimed 30 lives and scores of wounded over the past 18
months _ is not that they have occurred, but America's reaction to
them.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the response to Littleton has been pretty much what it
was last year to the Jonesboro massacre: plenty of public
hand-wringing about moral decay and media violence.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last year, Bill Clinton has promised to fly in teams
of ``grief counsellors'' and has warned that there are plenty of
other potentially violent kids who are not being ``reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there have been further calls to beef up security at
schools. But these are all side issues, which have nothing to do
with what really distinguishes America from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Young people everywhere, like many of their elders, have violent
fantasies. Teaching teenagers to curb their angry impulses is a
challenge for every parent on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   If America is in moral decline, then so is most of the rest of
the world, which just as avidly consumes violent films and rock
videos. Mentally disturbed people anywhere can sometimes pose a
threat to others. And all schools, not just those in America,
remain vulnerable to someone looking for innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
   But, of all rich countries, only America makes it possible for
teenage misfits, those nursing a grudge, the insane or anyone else
determined to cause mayhem to get their hands so easily on such a
terrifying array of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After a disgruntled Scoutmaster killed 16 nursery pupils and
their teacher at a school in Dunblane, Scotland, in 1996, Britain
banned all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   After one man wielding a semiautomatic rifle murdered 35 people
in Tasmania the month after the Dunblane massacre, Australia
drastically tightened its gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Such a response in America seems inconceivable. Years of bitter
debate about gun control have left America with ludicrously lax gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Firearm violence which dwarfs the rate in other countries, and
repeated mass-shootings, have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ferocious, well-financed lobbying by the National Rifle
Association (NRA) and other pro-gun groups has stymied efforts to
introduce any but the mildest of restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In his response to the Littleton shootings, Clinton can almost
be forgiven for not mentioning gun control. Most Americans are
weary of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   And yet America stands little chance of avoiding more
mass-shootings, or reducing its shocking level of lethal violence,
until it finds some way to agree on stricter gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Outright bans may not be on the American agenda, but there
should be some way to restrict the circulation of at least the
automatic and semiautomatic weapons which feature so prominently in
massacres such as Littleton, and the increasingly powerful handguns
coming on to the market.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of hope. Gun-control advocates have switched
their attention from fruitless arguments about the Second Amendment
and personal choice, and are concentrating instead on guns as a
threat to public health.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they have chosen the wrong way to present this
argument _ through lawsuits against gun makers. But deployed in the
public arena and in legislatures, where the gun debate belongs,
such arguments might yet lower the political temperature far enough
to produce reasonable compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, against expectations, the tragedy at Littleton may also
mark a turning-point.
</P>
<P>
   Fortuitously, the NRA is scheduled to hold its annual convention
next week in Denver, a few miles from the school massacre. The
sight of NRA activists facing Littleton's angry and grieving people
to explain their unrelenting opposition to gun control of any kind
should make Americans pause.
</P>
<P>
   Such fundamentalism on guns is unreasonable, and has already
taken too high a toll. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ For sure, the (ex-communist) Serbian Socialist Party
is still overwhelmingly the main political force that bolsters
Slobodan Milosevic's rule.
</P>
<P>
   He has run the party, whose headquarters was in flaming ruins
after a NATO raid on April 21, for 11 years. But the Socialists do
not rule alone.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, with his wife Mira Markovic and her small orthodox
communist party (known as the Yugoslav Left) beside him, sits at
the peak of a complex pyramid of power, amid an array of personal
interests, business groups, security organs and other political
parties, all vying for bigger slices of the cake but united, for
the moment, in the face of a common threat.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, however, the grip of Milosevic and his Socialists
could weaken if the two main parties currently with them in
coalitions (one in the federal Yugoslav parliament, the other in
Serbia's) were to backslide.
</P>
<P>
   In the Serbian parliament, the more powerful of the two
chambers, the Socialists have linked up with the
extreme-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, led by Vojislav Seselj.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal parliament, the Socialists have also managed to
team up at the other end of the spectrum with the Serbian Renewal
Movement, a monarchist party headed by Vuk Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj was a paramilitary leader during the wars in Bosnia and
Croatia. Now a deputy prime minister in Serbia's government, he
declared, shortly before NATO's campaign began, that if Serbia were
bombed not a single ethnic Albanian would be left in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   No foreign peacekeeping troops, not even Russian ones, he says,
should be let into Kosovo. His party wants a Greater Serbia,
embracing Montenegro, Macedonia and swathes of Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia's last presidential election, in 1997, Seselj very
nearly beat Milosevic's placeman. (Milosevic is himself president
only of federal Yugoslavia, which includes little Montenegro as
well as Serbia, a job with little constitutional clout: his real
power is sustained by other, less formal, means.)
</P>
<P>
   Seselj and Draskovic were once close friends who jointly founded
a (now defunct) political party; each was best man at the other's
wedding. Now they are at loggerheads.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj wants Yugoslavia to make parliamentary and military pacts
with Russia and Belarus, while Draskovic says Serbia must still
seek amity with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign peacekeepers, says Draskovic, should be allowed
into Kosovo, but none from NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   He also claims credit for countermanding an order from Serbia's
information minister, who belongs to Seselj's Radicals, expelling
all foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, the Radicals have won more influence
than Draskovic's lot over the press and the security services.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Milosevic plays the two parties off against
each other. For the moment, unity is all. But Milosevic is probably
keeping his options open.
</P>
<P>
   If he felt he had to negotiate with NATO, he might use
Draskovic; if the war goes on, Seselj would be his man.
</P>
<P>
   But party politics is not what determines power in today's
Serbia. Milosevic depends for his grip on an inner circle of a
score or so of cronies. Some have top jobs in government, others
are businessmen or run economic agencies; some combine both roles.
</P>
<P>
   Mirko Marjanovic, for instance, is both Serbia's prime minister
and head of the state gas industry, which gives him a hot line to
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's ex-prime minister who long headed the
Russian gas behemoth, Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Tomic, speaker of the Serbian parliament, also runs the
state oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many such rich politicos are in the same quandary as Milosevic.
They must be worried about NATO's destruction of Serbia's
infrastructure, but they want a deal that will keep their hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   Important, but less controllable or predictable, are the shadowy
paramilitary forces which emerge in times of strife and which did
much dirty work for the Yugoslav army during the war in Croatia and
Bosnia in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Zeljko Raznatovic, whose better-known nom de guerre is Arkan, is
back in the limelight, warning NATO that his ``Tigers'' will be out
in force against any invading ground force.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has always been adept at co-opting potential
troublemakers _ hence his induction of Draskovic and Seselj into
government. Those who rebuff him run risks.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Panic, a former prime minister and head of a big
Californian pharmaceuticals company, had his plant in Belgrade
nationalized.
</P>
<P>
   Slavko Curuvija, an independent-minded newspaper owner, was shot
dead earlier this month by unknown gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's fragmented and powerless opposition has gone nervously
quiet. The Alliance for Change, a liberal group, recently refused
to discuss a suggestion that the government should resign.
</P>
<P>
   The West has been hoping that, as the NATO pounding goes on, the
diverse strands within Serbia's establishment will snarl up and
pull against each other.
</P>
<P>
   So far, if anything, the opposite has happened. &QL;

 Bill MULLER and  
 CONNIE CONE SEXTON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was a gentle, quiet girl with long hair and a wry sense of
humor. A people-pleaser who wanted to be remembered for her
writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember some students over your lifetime; she was one of
them,'' said Judy Dolan, a mathematics teacher at Desert Sky Middle
School. ``Kelly was a gentle soul, just a lovely person.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Fleming, 16, who was killed in the Littleton, Colo.,
school massacre, was mourned Thursday by former classmates and
teachers in the northwest Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, her eyes moist, described Kelly as a naturally quiet and
reserved student who sat at the front of the class.
</P>
<P>
   ``She liked to show her work,'' Dolan said. ``She was careful
and meticulous. She wanted to please you.''
</P>
<P>
   In her memory, trees will be planted next Friday on Arbor Day at
three campuses in the Deer Valley Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was gunned down at Columbine High School, where she was a
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   The Flemings' middle-class neighborhood in Littleton is one of
winding streets lined with split-level homes. Manicured lawns were
covered with snow Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The family left Arizona in 1997 when Donald Fleming's job
transfered him to Colorado. Kelly didn't take it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a teenager,'' the father said Thursday night. ``Not very
good. She had some really good friends down there. Who wants to get
up and leave at that age?''
</P>
<P>
   Although it's been 18 months since Kelly and her family left,
her death resounded through both Desert Sky and Bellair Elementary
School.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly liked to write stories based on her life experiences, said
Joy Carrell, 15, a Deer Valley High School sophomore who had been
close with Kelly since sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was learning to play the guitar. She said Kelly was eager
to get a driver's license and a part-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me in a letter that she wanted to be remembered for
her writing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her short stories offered a glimpse of a sensitive soul full of
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   In one short story, she wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt there was nowhere to turn, no place to run to. Right
then and there, it felt like I forgot where I was, I forgot who I
was. I didn't feel whole anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the story she finds happiness at the end: ``I felt happy
and safe. From that moment on, I knew that I wasn't going to feel
sad or alone anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrell's heart was in her throat as she scanned TV news
accounts of the shooting, hoping for happy news about her friend.
</P>
<P>
   Her worst fears began to be realized when she telephoned Kelly's
parents that evening and learned that her friend was among the
missing students.
</P>
<P>
   Carrell said that despite the bad news, she tried to keep up
hope that Kelly somehow still was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I realize that she is really gone and I won't get phone
calls from her and I can't write her and she can't write me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's father, tense with waiting for word on his daughter's
whereabouts, didn't need formal notification.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew by 4 o'clock in the afternoon, not by notification,''
he said. ``Kelly was always in the library at that time of the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said he also got a phone call from a friend of Kelly who
said she had seen Kelly on her way to the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``So obviously, when the last of the students were out and there
was still no Kelly, it didn't take much to figure it out,'' he
said. ``The official notification came late last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming was still in a state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I feel, I really don't,'' he said. ``We're
hanging in there. Acceptance-wise, I don't know if we have. Maybe
we have. I really don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Kelly was close to her sister, liked music and
poetry, and had gone to the prom Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kelly was happy in Colorado, Carrell said her friend
dreamed of returning to Arizona. During a phone call April 16,
their last conversation, Kelly talked of making a summer visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was kind of shy, but she was very nice,'' Carrell said.
</P>
<P>
   People who took the opportunity to get to know Kelly soon found
a sweet, loving and caring personality, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't mean or hateful in any way,'' Carrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, who has 11 brothers and sisters, said the outpouring of
support has been unbelievable. He said United Airlines has given
the family free round-trip airfare. At last count, Best Western had
donated 15 or 16 free rooms. Pizza Hut is giving them free pizza
when they call, and the funeral costs _ casket and transportation _
no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said he doesn't second-guess moving his family to
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scoured the whole city looking for the right community. In
fact, our Realtor was a retired principal and he even recommended
this community. It's still a great community. It's still a great
school. We didn't make a mistake moving here.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Since Muammar Qaddafi, Libya's rich and restless leader, handed
over for trial two Libyans accused of blowing up an airliner over
Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988, it has been one shindig after
another in his desert tents.
</P>
<P>
   With the United Nations' ban on travel to Libya and other
sanctions suspended, visitor after visitor has come to pay homage
to the ``Philosopher of the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Some look for contracts, others for handouts and all to guess
what he's up to: munificence or mischief? It felt like the good old
days, when the flamboyant Colonel Qaddafi was a major figure in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   First in Tripoli to welcome Libya back into the international
fold was the Italian foreign minister, Lamberto Dini. Before last
year's fall in the oil price, Italy imported about $4.5
billion-worth of oil from Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Agip, Italy's big oil company, is licking its lips at lucrative
deals. A stream of businessmen followed, mainly from the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has only 5.3 million people but earned some $5 billion
last year from oil. Libya's reserves (30 billion barrels) match
those of Britain and Norway combined. Its oil is high-quality
stuff, near European markets and cheap to extract (costing as
little as $1 a barrel in some places).
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva this week, Libyan officials met bankers, oil and gas
executives and other foreign businessmen to see how Libya's economy
might be opened up.
</P>
<P>
   If they were worried that the United States was maintaining its
own sanctions against Libya, they did not show it, though the
American threat to penalize any company investing over $40 million
in Libya's oil industry may make some European companies pause
before plunging in.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines, however, are falling over each other to compete for
the Tripoli route. Air Malta boasted it was first in; Royal Air
Maroc claims the first scheduled flight for April 26; Alitalia,
Lufthansa and British Airways expect regular flights to begin
shortly. Contractors are scrambling to revamp Libya's airports and
its own airline.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's political resurrection is even more dramatic. Colonel
Qaddafi may have given up the Lockerbie suspects and told his
secret service not to plant more bombs on American or European
aircraft, but his revolutionary rhetoric is as bold as ever and
still driven by a passion for poking the Americans in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches he has attacked the United States for
``thuggery'' and ``racism,'' and he has called for American
companies to be ejected from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants the abolition of nation-states, which he claims
are an instrument by which the rich world, led by the United
States, divides and rules the poor world.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arab leaders, though they have heaped praise on their
pan-Arab brother, have stayed away. Only Yasser Arafat and Jordan's
King Abdullah have turned up in person.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Qaddafi still burns with resentment at the halfhearted
support given him by Arab states in the Lockerbie affair.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of African Unity (OAU), on the other hand,
decided last year not to observe the U.N.'s air embargo, and
several African leaders have flown defiantly to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   Though he came by land, Nelson Mandela gave Colonel Qaddafi a
big fillip in 1997 by dropping in to thank him for help given to
the anti-apartheid struggle. Best of all, it upset the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So Africa is to be the colonel's new playground. He has changed
the name of the national radio station from Voice of the Greater
Arab Homeland to the Voice of Africa and declared pan-Arabism ``a
mirage.'' He has given up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he wants to unite Africa, beginning by rewriting the
charter of the OAU and eliminating references to colonial
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   He has already asked the secretariat to arrange a special summit
later this year in Tripoli to coincide with the 30th anniversary of
his coming to power.
</P>
<P>
   Africans are queuing up. Nine presidents and a stream of
officials from other African countries have visited Tripoli since
April 5. The chief lure is the Libyan president's wallet. Those who
do not benefit from it fear their enemies might, so they are
prepared to do obeisance in the Qaddafi tent.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's attempts in the mid-1980s to seize a slice of land known
as the Aozou strip from its neighbor, Chad, are forgotten. Now the
colonel appears to be trying to play the international statesman,
calling himself a peace-broker.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he got Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Laurent Kabila of
Congo to sign a peace accord and offered to send troops to monitor
it. As past beneficiaries of his largesse, they no doubt felt they
had to sign, though the deal is unlikely to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan leader also sent an envoy to the peace talks on
Sierra Leone in Togo. Sudan's civil war has not been neglected,
either. Having met government and opposition representatives, he
declared that he would bring them together in Tripoli and make
peace.
</P>
<P>
   This hardly fits with what the colonel has actually been doing:
quietly channelling funds to rebels in West Africa, such as Charles
Taylor, now president of Liberia, Foday Sankoh, the leader of the
Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone and anti-government
groups in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   The rulers of the Gambia and Burkina Faso have also received
gifts from Colonel Qaddafi and are now allies _ at least in words _
in his radical cause.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan diplomatic representation has increased dramatically in
West Africa (while falling in the Arab world), as has financial
support for radical newspapers and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   But the money is not endless. The colonel has expensive hobbies:
he is building a river through the Sahara, and wants to start work
on a railway connecting the country's coastal towns.
</P>
<P>
   America claims he maintains a costly chemical-weapons program,
as well as helping to pay for Palestinian terrorist groups. And his
inefficient, socialist state and corrupt bureaucracy eat up much of
his oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, his diplomatic troubles are not over. America,
Britain, France and Germany all have outstanding complaints about
Libyan terrorism. America's sanctions remain.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, ordinary Libyans harbor impossibly high
hopes for the post-sanctions era. For years they have heard the
government blame sanctions for all that is wrong in Libya.
</P>
<P>
   If Colonel Qaddafi does not want to disappoint them, he will
need to concentrate a little more on domestic affairs. &QL;

ALARMS RAISED THAT SOME ONLINE SHOPPING MAY NOT BE SAFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Some of the little guys who sell on the Internet may
have just dealt e-commerce a setback.
</P>
<P>
   A computer technician at a Bellevue, Wash., Internet service
provider says he found evidence that consumers who give private
information such as credit card numbers to small, online stores
can't count on the information being kept safe from theft.
</P>
<P>
   The technician for Blarg! Online Services discovered that
``shopping cart'' software used by small online retailers often may
be improperly installed, making private consumer data accessible to
anyone on the Web who might misuse it. One Blarg! executive said
the problem could have a chilling effect on e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   While no one knows how many retail sites on the Worldwide Web
are not secure, Blarg! executive Marc Lewis said when technician
Joe Harris checked Monday, ``We were shocked; there were literally
thousands'' of sites that use shopping cart software and thus pose
a potential problem. Harris checked just a sample of the
approximately 4,250 sites using the software and found about 300
that were not secure.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Blarg! posted a warning on Bugtraq, an e-mail
security advisory that goes out to about 22,000 computer
professionals. The report was picked up by the Los Angeles Times on
Thursday and received wide national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also tried to contact Visa and MasterCard fraud protection
and they didn't seem very interested,'' said Lewis. ``Then we tried
contacting a few of the software providers for shopping cart
services and most of them did not return our calls or passed it off
to the Web site developer.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is with the Web site developer, said Lewis. Often
small companies will hire a solo, free-lance developer to put
together a retail Web site. These Web developers may choose not to
follow the proper protocols for installing the software ``because
they want to get the site online and get their check,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amateur Web developers are not experienced enough to put
together a secure system,'' Lewis said. ``They are doing a great
disservice to their clients as well as the Internet community at
large. People won't buy things (online) anymore if they don't trust
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he knows of at least one large Internet service
provider that also provides shopping cart software that is
reviewing the security of all its sites. ``Now that people know
that the problem exists, they are working toward fixing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone else had gotten the data earlier, they could have
done bad things,'' said Lewis. ``They could have imprinted credit
cards and used them... and unfortunately, there wouldn't be too
many people to protect consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the giant Seattle-based online bookseller, on
Thursday pronounced its site ``absolutely safe. There have been no
breaches of security at Amazon and we would expect none,'' said
spokesman Bill Curry. ``Customer privacy and security is of
paramount importance to us and we have multiple layers of
protection to ensure the trust of our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   While Curry would not reveal specifics about Amazon security, he
said the company does not use off-the-shelf shopping cart software.
</P>
<P>
   But Curry agreed that it is important that people feel
comfortable and safe when they shop online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of where people shop on the Web, we want people to
have a good experience because it builds confidence in e-commerce
for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns about security, consumers spent $9 billion on
online purchases last year, according to figures cited by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Blarg! technician Harris discovered the problem during a
conference call with a Blarg! client and a shopping cart vendor,
said Lewis. When they asked Harris to perform an improper technical
step that would have made the consumer data easily available to
anyone, it ``alarmed him and he would not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harris checked the Web to see how many other sites were out
there with improper security, he found thousands using the
software. Then, when he started sifting through some, he was able
to call up ``about 300 actual order files with customers' phone
numbers, home addresses and credit card numbers as well as what
they ordered,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris believes ``it's only the tip of the iceberg'' and there
are hundreds more out there with with improperly installed shopping
cart software. ``There are so many would-be Web site developers out
there who don't know how to set up an online store safely, but they
don't tell their clients,'' Harris said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing anyone wants to do is kill the golden goose of
Internet commerce. But this isn't good,'' he said. ``Full
disclosure is the best policy. If the site doesn't have a privacy
statement or if it doesn't clearly spell out how they secure their
data, then shop elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   So called shopping cart programs that are vulnerable to Web
thieves if improperly installed include those from Order Form,
Seaside Enterprises, QuikStore, PDGSoft and Mercantec.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sites didn't follow their guidelines. The (software)
vendors shouldn't be blamed,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Beach, S.C.-based QuikStore spokesman Dwight Vietzke said
only two of its estimated 700 users have reported problems with
shopping cart installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case when human error comes into play,'' Vietzke said.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping cart software, if installed incorrectly, saves
customer order information in an unsecured file, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers can download files containing customer names,
addresses, telephone and credit card numbers, expiration dates and
order data simply by using a search engine like Hotbot or AltaVista
and punching in a few simple search words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those files aren't meant to be accessed by a Web browser.
There is no reason for it to be listed there in the Web site
tree,'' Harris said. ``If it's not encrypted, it shouldn't be
there.
</P>
<P>
   Online stores usually retrieve order information using
encryption and other security measures, but the orders are
sometimes placed in a file on the Web site's computer system that
is easily accessible to an outside Web surfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most companies see the magnitude of this. They
have to take action very quickly,'' said Tara Lemmey, president of
San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit
group that promotes online privacy.
</P>
<P>
   When correctly installed, shopping cart software creates a file
for confidential information that is inaccessible to outsiders.

TOP FUEL DRAG CHAMPION STRUGGLING IN THE CLUTCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNIS, Texas _ The five-disc clutch is turning the National Hot
Rod Association's Top Fuel points chase absolutely topsy-turvy.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers Mike Dunn, Doug Herbert and Larry Dixon _ whose tuners
have mastered the vagaries of drag racing's hottest innovation _
have bolted to the top of the standings after four of 22 Winston
Drag Racing Series national events.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, two-time and reigning Top Fuel champion Gary Scelzi
began the season with three first-round losses. And then it got
worse for Team Winston. Scelzi and owner/tuner Alan Johnson failed
to qualify for the 16-car ladder at the O'Reilly Nationals at
Houston Raceway Park on April 10, the first DNQ in their heretofore
storybook, 48-race Top Fuel careers.
</P>
<P>
   The common thread to these performances traces to the ``clutch
can'' area of the drivetrain. The nitromethane-burning,
500-cubic-inch engines seated in the back of a Top Fuel dragster
typically produce 6,000 horsepower. The trick is to transfer all
that power through the drivetrain to the rear tires. That is the
job of the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   What started as an experiment by some Top Fuel and Funny Car
teams in 1998 _ the addition of an extra, 3-pound composite clutch
disc to the four in use _ has developed into a must-have
performance part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we needed the five-disc clutch this season, because
the four-disc was at its limit,'' said Dunn, who has forged a
32-point lead over Herbert heading into first-round qualifications
for the Castrol Nationals at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes these things run is fuel system and clutch,'' said
Dunn, driver of the Team Mopar Dragster owned by Darrell Gwynn and
tuned by Ken Veney. ``The more fuel you burn, the more power you
make and the faster you run. The five-disc clutch has been a little
more forgiving, and it's making all the cars more consistent. Our
car, if we can get it 80 or 100 feet down the track, we feel it's
going to run good numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn was wallowing in a winless streak stretching to 1996 when
he defeated Dixon in the final of the season opener at Pomona,
Calif., on Feb. 8. Dunn also won Round 3 at Gainesville, Fla.
Despite a first-round loss against Texan Eddie Hill at Baytown on
April 11, Dunn is scheduled to roll into the staging lanes at the
all-concrete Motorplex with the combination to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert and Dick LaHaie, the 1987 NHRA Top Fuel champion and
tuner of the Snap-On Tools Dragster, used their five-disc system at
Baytown to end a series winless streak that dated to June 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the five-disc has helped consistency with our
car, but not the speed so much,'' said Herbert, who also cashed in
the $100,000 Winston No Bull Challenge bonus with his victory over
Tony Schumacher. ``The five-disc is definitely making it easy to
apply all this extra power.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher and crew chief Dan Olson applied enough power to the
Exide Batteries car to record the first quarter-mile pass in excess
of 330 mph at Phoenix on Feb. 28. Schumacher's first-round pass at
300.23 mph is the fastest speed in NHRA history.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dixon attacked the elapsed-time half of the
performance equation at Baytown, where he became the first driver
to crack the 4.5-second barrier. Dixon ran 4.486 seconds in the
Miller Lite Dragster owned by former Funny Car champion Don ``The
Snake'' Prudhomme and tuned by Dale Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys that are running well and setting the speed and
elapsed-time records, 80 percent of it can be attributed to the
five-disc,'' said Cory McClenathan, driver of the MBNA Dragster
tuned by Mike Green and the winner of six races in 1998. ``There is
so much more parity in the class this year. I highly doubt that
anybody is going to win six races, whether it's me or Scelzi or
anybody. If a guy wins four races, he's going to be pretty proud.''

`COUNTRY LIVING' BECOMING THE BIBLE FOR Y2K HOME PREPAREDNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Y2K bug may or may not bite, but worries about
massive computer problems when 1999 turns 2000 are already spinning
a web of profits for Sasquatch Books of Seattle, due to the sudden
popularity of one reprint paperback.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Emery's ``The Encyclopedia of Country Living'' (Sasquatch,
864 pages, $27.95) is apparently becoming the Bible for those
concerned about having to rely on their wits and skills should
there be a computer nightmare. Her massive tome is a folksy, but
authoritative do-it-yourself guide to just about everything, from
buying land to slaughtering a pig to cooking on a wood stove to
delivering a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Sasquatch purchased reprint rights and had enjoyed steady sales
ever since its first edition in 1994, with 8,000 copies sold in
1995 and 8,700 sold in 1996. But suddenly last summer, sales
started to take off, from 2,500 copies sold last August, then 7,000
last October and finally 10,600 copies last month.
</P>
<P>
   The spike in sales at first mystified folks at Sasquatch, until
sales director Linda Stark started to question some of those
ordering the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious that worries about Y2K were definitely
propelling the sales,'' Stark said this week.
</P>
<P>
   So staggering has been the growth in sales that ``The
Encyclopedia of Country Living'' has just become the first single
edition of a title to earn Sasquatch more than $1 million. And the
profits from this one book, Stark added, have played a significant
role in Sasquatch's recent expansions into Northern California and
Alaska, as well as the doubling of its annual number of titles to
25.
</P>
<P>
   Emery's guide to self-sufficiency is a homespun success itself,
first self-published with 875 mimeographed copies in 1974 and
distributed to friends by subscription only. The author lived on a
three-acre farm in Lewiston, Idaho, during the years of initial
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Emery, 60, has continually expanded her landmark book ever
since, while also driving herself around the country to spread its
gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Encyclopedia of Country Living'' is now in its ninth
edition, with 350,000 copies sold.
</P>
<P>
   Writers honored
</P>
<P>
   Michael Byers of Seattle, who won a Whiting Writers Award last
year, has won the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction presented by
the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Byers' marvelous
short-story collection, ``The Coast of Good Intentions,'' was
chosen over all other first books of fiction and poetry for the
prize, which carries a $2,500 award.
</P>
<P>
   Byers, now working on his first novel, expects to attend the May
19 awards ceremony in New York. ``How often is this kind of thing
going to happen?'' the Seattle native said.
</P>
<P>
   Also being honored at the same ceremony will be Jon Krakauer,
the former Seattle resident who now lives in Colorado. Krakauer,
author of ``Into Thin Air'' (now 2 million copies in print), will
be one of eight writers receiving Academy Awards in Literature for
exceptional accomplishment (which includes $7,500).
</P>
<P>
   Krakauer said Wednesday that he was surprised by the honor:
``The academy is the type of high-brow organization that doesn't
seem as though it would be disposed to my work, so that makes this
award even more meaningful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer added that he is ``waiting to be struck by
inspiration for my next book,'' while also serving as guest editor
of a series of reissued adventure classics being published by the
Modern Library.
</P>
<P>
   Poet Heather McHugh of Seattle was recently among nine poets
named to the board of chancellors of the Academy of American Poets.
Last fall, the much-honored professor at the University of
Washington received the O.B Hardison Poetry Prize (honoring a poet
who excels at teaching) from the Folger Shakespeare Library in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Wells' ``Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' is the
favorite book sold last year by independent booksellers. The
popular Seattle writer will receive the 1999 ABBY Award of the
American Booksellers Association at next weekend's BookExpo America
in Los Angeles.

ACTING FAMILY SHINES ON HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They may be among the least-known actors ever to
get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame but the 11 members of the
Watson family who collectively appeared in more than 1,000 films
since 1912 scored a first Thursday _ they were honored with a
plaque on Hollywood Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The Watsons appeared in small roles in a number of Hollywood
classics _ from ``Keystone Kops'' movies to ``Boys Town,'' ``Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington'' and ``Heidi.''
</P>
<P>
   They are considered the first family of Hollywood, said Johnny
Grant, honorary mayor of Hollywood and chairman of the Walk of Fame
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1912 to the present, the Watson family has left an
indelible mark on the moviegoing public,'' he told a crowd of more
than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at the event wearing name tags stuck to their
foreheads were Harry, Garry, Billy, Coy Jr. and Delmar Watson and
their sister Louise Watson Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nine children, Vivian and Gloria, have died. Bobs
Watson is ailing and listened to the proceedings from his Laguna
Beach home via a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Delmar, acting as the family spokesman, choked up while thanking
the crowd. ``From all the Watson family,'' he said, ``God bless.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as inveterate pranksters, the Watsons refrained from
shenanigans during the ceremony in front of 6674 Hollywood Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hit anybody with a pie at the drop of a hat,'' said
Billy Watson, mentioning the late Sheriff Eugene Biscailuz and the
late Police Chief William Parker as two noteworthy victims.
</P>
<P>
   The nine Watson children grew up in Los Angeles' Edendale
neighborhood across the street from the Mack Sennett Studio. Their
father, Coy Sr., started out in Hollywood breaking horses for Buck
Jones, then began appearing in films. He also designed some of the
first movie special effects, such as Douglas Fairbanks' midair
rope-climbing scene in 1924's ``The Thief of Bagdad.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, Grant told the crowd that Coy Sr. would go
to work dressed as a cowboy and gallop over a hill, take a lunch
break and then dress up as an Indian ``and chase himself over the
same hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the family lived near the studio, casting directors
would come over and ask to use one or more of the children in
films. Most of the Watson children got their start in movies before
they were even a year old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going Hollywood before Hollywood was even going,''
said Delmar, who played Peter the Goat Boy opposite Shirley Temple
in ``Heidi'' and who hands Jimmy Stewart a new briefcase in ``Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Coy Sr. wasn't thrilled about his three daughters getting too
involved in the business ``because he had been a casting
director,'' Delmar said.
</P>
<P>
   All the boys later became news photographers. Bobs, who last
year had a role in a movie called ``Deadly Delusions,'' due to be
released this year, is the one who really loved the movie business,
said Delmar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is a fantastic place but it has a tendency to chew
people up and spit them out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The star for the Watsons was special for fans as well as family.
Kim Bowness and her father, Bill, came from Tempe, Ariz., to see
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated by child actors, Kim founded Watson Watchers
International about 10 years ago after meeting Delmar. Now it has
about 60 members and her family visits the Watson family regularly,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another fan, Rick Matzner of Los Angeles, nominated the family
to Grant's Walk of Fame committee, which approved the star.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bowness: ``We've been praying it would happen.''

UW'S NEUHEISEL TAKES CONTROL WITH AUTHORITY, EASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ We are walking out the tunnel, the famous one at Husky
Stadium, and we are walking fast toward sunlight. Rick Neuheisel
has a little post-practice business to take care of with two of his
football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a reminder,'' the new Husky coach said Thursday,
keeping the pace brisk.
</P>
<P>
   A ``reminder'' is another way of saying Neuheisel was about to
make offensive tackle Joe Collier and nose tackle Toalei
Mulitauaopele run penalty sprints while the rest of the team
showered and discussed what's for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe here missed a class today,'' Neuheisel announces.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like your parents to read about that in the
paper?''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Collier doesn't look too thrilled, even though he is
attempting a brave smile to quash any hint of embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there is little room for errors, blown assignments or
missed classes in Neuheisel's football program.
</P>
<P>
   If the perception of laid-back sloppiness has accompanied the
38-year-old coach to Montlake from Colorado, it does not seem
entirely fair, just as knocks against his coaching acumen seem
hollow in the face of Neuheisel's .702 winning percentage (33-14)
as a college head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The former UCLA quarterback and boy-wonder Buffaloes head coach
has eased away from the cowboy hats and guitar-strumming image.
Accountability is a major issue for Neuheisel, which explains why
Husky players have been dropping to the ground for ``reminder''
push-ups and various other minor punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Spring practice ends Saturday, meaning Neuheisel has had time to
evaluate his players _ whom he refused to watch on film before
spring camp in order to give each player a fresh look.
</P>
<P>
   Upperclassmen like receiver Joe Jarzynka and inside linebacker
Marques Hairston said Thursday they thought Neuheisel's approach
was more than fair and Neuheisel said his first priority was to win
the confidence of his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though kids are pretty resilient, it's pretty traumatic
to lose the coaches you know, the coaches who recruited you,''
Neuheisel said. ``There is always going to be a little bit of a
`Show Me' attitude ... but it is important to open really strong
lines of communication.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to how things ran in the past, the door to
Neuheisel's office is always open. He encourages his players to
stop by, to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   Some players have actually gone up to the office just because
under Jim Lambright they never saw the inside of the head coach's
office _ unless there was a serious problem. The atmosphere, the
relationships, the comfort level is entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   As for he and his family, Neuheisel is settling in. Well, sort
of.
</P>
<P>
   While he was lavished with a $1 million-a-year contract,
Neuheisel, his wife and three sons have yet to come up with a house
to buy. Seattle real estate being so hard to come by, no matter
what price, Neuheisel has not found what he is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could buy a house that was just to come home to after
work, OK. But I need a place where I can do what my job requires;
entertain players, so they can come over now and then, a place to
have the opportunity to bring new recruits _ when it's legal,'' he
said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   As billed by Barbara Hedges, the UW athletic director who went
after Neuheisel hard with a (her words) ``blockbuster deal,''
Neuheisel is extremely bright, extremely confident, extremely easy
to deal with and apparently not below making a joke of his own
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his take on what people thought of him after his inital
recruiting gaffe just weeks into his new job, Neuheisel came right
to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were thinking, `He better be good,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when out in public, Neuheisel said reaction to him has been
good. What do people say when they see him?
</P>
<P>
   ```Go Dawgs,''' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you read things in the newspaper and you go, `God,
people must think I'm just the worst thing in the whole world.' But
the truth of the matter is, people are very supportive,'' he said.
``The main thing is how much they love the program and are excited
to see what can become of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also learning about Seattle, a place where overnight he
became one of the most visible, most scrutinized, most recognizable
citizens. His first lesson was a powerful one.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Seattle) is infatuated with the university. I guess I knew
that, seeing as how there are 68,000 season-ticket holders,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a complete love affair with this place. People
don't just like it because it's a country club of sorts and a
gathering spot on Saturday afternoons. They really have a deep
commitment to it. I've not been around a program like it, so that's
why I'm so excited.''
</P>
<P>
   While it might cause people to question whether Neuheisel is too
glib or too slick, it no doubt helps Neuheisel immeasurably that he
is such a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is much for him to prove, this is not a man who
flinches under such pressure. Now drop and give him 10. Later,
he'll have you over for a barbecue.

MEDIA'S INFLUENCE ON SCHOOL KILLERS OPEN TO DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Talking with teen-agers about the Colorado high
school massacre, President Clinton posed the question Thursday that
everyone is asking: Who's to blame?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ask ourselves some pretty hard questions here,''
Clinton told a group of two dozen students at T.C. Williams High
School in Alexandria, Va. ``What is the role of the larger culture
here?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you are exposed to much higher levels of violence
through television, through video games ... you can actually find
out how to make bombs on the Internet. Does that make a difference?
Does it make these things more likely to happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Across the entertainment industry, many responded defensively,
suggesting that officials should look within the homes of the two
outcasts who massacred their classmates this week in Littleton,
Colo., before placing the blame on TV, movies and other forms of
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really easy to blame everybody else _ especially movies,
TV, the Internet and video games _ but you can blame guns, too,''
said John Carpenter, director of many horror films, such as
``Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wanted to be safe, we should disarm the public, ban
violence on TV and the movies, put metal detectors and guards in
schools and become a police state. But we'd lose all our freedoms.
None of this stuff intends to get people to commit crimes. Its
intent is to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about people with serious psychological
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the industry acknowledged a connection between
portrayals of violence and a small percentage of people who act it
out. But it was also mentioned that Europe and Asia import the same
films, TV shows and music while their levels of violence were far
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Author-songwriter Steve Allen, who has become increasingly
concerned about the issue, said films and TV should be more closely
examined because of the impact they are having on society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The percentage of emotionally unstable people in our society
is at an all-time high today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, an adviser to the Parent Television Council, a national
organization that studies offensive imagery in the media, said
violence has been far too prevalent in America from its earliest
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has something to do with the way in which this country was
constructed region by region. One reason why we are violent in this
country today is because we were violent from the very beginning,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   KABC-AM (790) talk show host Larry Elder said he was sure
graphic violence in the media influences some percentage of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is arguing movies have zero effect, but the question
is, what can we do?'' Elder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a role for more government regulation? No. The top
reason for something like this is (the killers) have poor moral
foundations _ and it can come from all sorts of factors. We have to
explain how it is that much of Europe and Asia can see the same
films yet their rate of violence is far lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simplistic to point the finger at Hollywood, we've
always had negative cultural influences. Where do we decide the
good stuff and the bad stuff? How do you know what piece of work is
going to trigger what in whom?''
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of
Popular Television at Syracuse University, said there was nothing
new about today's death culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at the great books,'' he said. ``That culture of
death is part of pop culture and it has been for a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem with what Clinton said is, you're making the
argument that because of a tiny percentage of people who might take
movies as inspiration to do crazy things _ and they could also take
a Pepsi commercial the wrong way _ you're going to harness the most
powerful communications industry of all time so these people won't
be set off? You can't run a modern civilization that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with this culture of death is this culture of anger. We
have totally lost any kind of respect with people in power _ from
our bosses right up to the presidency.''

ANALYSTS EXPECT BRIGHT FIRST QUARTER AT DOLE AFTER FARM DISASTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dole Food Co., the international fruits,
vegetables and flower retailer, is expected to release an improved
earnings report today for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A First Call survey of five analysts pegs Dole's quarterly
earnings at 52 cents per share, up from 37 cents in the year-ago
period.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a big improvement from the way the Westlake
Village-based company ended the year.
</P>
<P>
   Dole lost $7.8 million or 13 cents a share in the 1998 fourth
quarter as inclement weather pounded the balance sheet. The company
earned $23.3 million, or 38 cents, in the prior year's last
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   During the last three months of 1998, the company recorded a
one-time charge of $120 million. Of that, $100 million was
attributed to Hurricane Mitch, which ravaged 30,000 acres of Dole's
Central American operations.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during December, unseasonably cold weather in California
caused about $20 million damage to the company's 6,500 acres of
citrus orchards.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts surveyed by First Call rate the company's stock a
hold.
</P>
<P>
   They estimate that Dole will earn $2.24 a share for all of 1999,
up from $1.86 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dole treasurer Beth Potillo said the earnings report will be
released before the market opens today. For the first quarter, the
company will not record any big charges like those that ate up 1998
fourth-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has been hovering in the $30-to-$35 range
since October. Its 52-week high was $52.5625, set in July.
</P>
<P>
   Dole closed Thursday at $33.375, down 43.75 cents.

RELIGIOUS BROADCASTER EMBARKS ON ROAD TOWARD IPO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Salem Communications Corp., the nation's largest
radio broadcaster of religious and family programming, has filed to
go public.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of KKLA-FM (99.5) in Glendale and 44 other radio
stations across the country hopes to tap the equity market to pay
down debt and expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the next step for us in terms of being flexible in our
financing,'' Dirk Gastaldo, chief financial officer of Salem, said
Thursday. ``We'd like to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Salem filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission this
week to go public. BT Alex Brown is the lead underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   If the IPO is funded, the company would trade under the symbol
``SLC.'' The number of shares being offered and the IPO price and
date have not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Salem intends to use the money it raises to repay $55million in
corporate debt, pay back its credit facility, make more
acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
</P>
<P>
   According to its SEC filings, the broadcasting company had sales
of $78million last year, up from $68million in 1997 and $59million
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But while sales have grown, the company had suffered net losses
in recent years, mainly due to huge interest payments. Salem had a
net loss of $1.6million in 1998, which included a $16million
interest payment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's loss was smaller than the one in 1997, when the
company was in the red by $2.4million due to a $13million interest
expense. In 1996, Salem recorded a net income of $12.75million, but
it included a gain from the sale of two radio stations for
$16million. Without the gain, Salem would have lost money.
</P>
<P>
   However, Salem's cash flow grew at a compound annual rate of
21.2percent from 1994 to 1998, according to IPO Monitor, a
Calabasas IPO tracking service.

HAWKS BEAT CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cosmetically speaking, Rick Pitino knew of no make-up
artist alive who was capable of pulling off a miracle makeover of
his injury-riddled Celtics, who were playing their second game in
as many nights, minus three starters, and against a well-rested
Atlanta Hawks squad that had played only one game in the previous
five nights.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much explained why, as he stood in the bowels of
Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum before Thursday night's
106-94 loss to the Hawks, Pitino took a realistic look at the
matchups and intoned, ``This one has `ugliness' written all over it
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That it did.
</P>
<P>
   The ugliness, however, was deferred until the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Celtics had all their blotches, blemishes,
scars, and cosmetic flaws exposed. After rebounding from a 23-20
first-quarter deficit to streak to a 41-30 lead in the second, the
Celtics wound up squandering their advantage and barely held on to
a 49-47 lead at intermission after the Hawks put on a 17-8 surge at
the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a shot,'' Pitino surmised afterward. ``They took us a
little lightly, and they came out really hard and made it very
difficult for us to score. We turned it over too much and didn't
get shots.''
</P>
<P>
   After hitting 21 of 47 shots and committing just six turnovers
in the first half, the Celtics wound up collapsing in the third
when they missed their first six field goal attempts of the second
half and committed six turnovers in the first 6:15. To make matters
worse, Boston went almost eight minutes between Tony Battie's
rim-bending reverse alley-oop dunk with 1:07 left in the first half
and Vitaly Potapenko's driving lane hook off a nice spin move at
5:23 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime I just kind of reminded them why we're here,''
said Atlanta coach Lenny Wilkens, whose Hawks remained in
contention for the Central Division title by winning their fourth
in a row. ``I thought we came out all about business in the third
quarter _ and that's what we have to do. You can't allow yourself
to get complacent, or get a team to get you complacent. I don't
think we took them for granted, but I thought we just let up after
the first few minutes of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith, who led the Hawks with 26 points on 9-for-17
shooting, broke the game open when he stole a lazy Battie inbounds
pass and converted it into an easy layup underneath. It gave
Atlanta its first double-digit lead of the game, 61-51, with 5:41
remaining. Chris Crawford chipped in 16 points on 5-for-9 shooting,
which helped make up for the limited output of Dikembe Mutombo (8
points, 8 rebounds) in 28 foul-plagued minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going out and playing hard,'' said Celtics rookie Paul
Pierce, who led the team with 23 points on 8-for-17 shooting. ``We
aren't playing as smart as we should, but the effort is there, the
intensity is there and we're getting the pace that we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Potapenko, who was acquired in a trade with Cleveland in
Boston's last visit to Atlanta during the trading deadline March
11, got the Celtics off the schneid with his nice lane move.
Potapenko, who had 14 points on 6-for-15 shooting, added a lane
jumper that pulled Boston within 63-57 with 4:06 remaining, but
that would be as close as the Celtics would get.
</P>
<P>
   All this, after Boston outscored the Hawks in the fourth, 32-29,
tying a season high for Atlanta opponents in that period. Although
the Hawks twice led by as much as 19 (84-65 and 91-72) in the
fourth, the Celtics came back to pull within 101-94 when Dana
Barros (14 points) drilled a 16-foot jumper with one minute to go.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the temporary blush it gave Team Green, it did little to
alter the unappealing cosmetic nature of Boston's 27th loss of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no complaints,'' Pitino said afterward. ``This group
was playing really hard. We're really shorthanded, and we played
very, very hard.''

BRUINS BEAT HURRICANES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The rule of thumb in the playoffs is that the
best players cancel each other out, and a series comes down to how
the role players produce.
</P>
<P>
   So it was fitting that right wing Rob DiMaio, a lunchpail player
of the first rank, and rough-and-tumble forward Ken Belanger came
to the rescue in the third period, giving the Bruins a 2-0 victory
over the Carolina Hurricanes Thursday night in Game 1 of their
best-of-seven, first-round Eastern Conference series.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio is the quintessential blood-and-guts forward, assigned to
check the opposing team's best. Belanger is a
do-what-you-can-with-the-little-bit-of-ice-time-you-receive winger
who alternates with Ken Baumgartner in the enforcer's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason we won tonight was Rob DiMaio,'' said goalie Byron
Dafoe, who stopped 19 shots and earned his second career postseason
shutout. ``He played unbelievable and that's a prime example of how
role players can dictate a series. Rob, Tim Taylor, and P.J.
Axelsson are probably the three guys who can really help swing this
series one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio gave Boston all the offense it would need at the 1:50
mark of the third on an unassisted strike. DiMaio was in the right
place at the right time when center Jeff O'Neill coughed up the
puck in the right circle of the Hurricanes' zone and then fell
down. DiMaio teed up a slapper from the top of the circle and it
blew past goalie Arturs Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to get into a defensive posture to protect the puck
and down he went,'' said Hartford coach Paul Maurice. ``It wasn't
the prettiest of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   For DiMaio, pretty didn't matter. It was merely the result of
doing what was expected of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to pick up their game,'' he said. ``We have to
do our job against their top lines. Nothing has changed in that
respect but if we get an opportunity to score, we're going to take
it and make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina forward Kevin Dineen had a chance to pull his team
even, but he hit the post at 2:43. ``I got lucky,'' said Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger cashed in at 7:37. He took a pass from Jason Allison
and fired in a wraparound at the right post. The score was reviewed
because Dmitri Khristich was in the crease, but the video clearly
showed Keith Primeau holding him in there.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, the Bruins and 'Canes split their
series (2-2-1). Thursday night, the hitting was ferocious, the
checking suffocating, and the goaltending excellent, though Dafoe
had to come up with some much bigger stops than Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina, which was hurt by losing forward Ron Francis to an
ankle sprain early in the game, came out very strong at the start
and kept the Bruins from generating a shot until nine minutes in.
They wound up with seven for the period, the two best by defenseman
Darren Van Impe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no surprise to us whatsoever,'' said coach Pat Burns of
the Hurricanes' early pressure. ``They're an aggressive,
forechecking team. We circled the wagons early and then got
stronger as the game went on. A lot of teams try to run us out out
of the building and it hasn't worked all year long. This isn't the
first team that's tried that. They've all tried it with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Primeau had a monster game, hitting every black-and-gold shirt
in sight. Carolina did an excellent job of preventing Boston from
establishing any kind of a forecheck early on.
</P>
<P>
   The situation heated up in the middle period with each team
being called for three penalties after a penalty-free first.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side's power play could break through.
</P>
<P>
   Among Boston's best scoring chances on Irbe were a couple of
bids midway through the period by Shawn Bates. Anson Carter set up
another decent opportunity when he fed Steve Heinze at 14:59. With
the Bruins killing a penalty to defenseman Don Sweeney, Dafoe came
up big on a shot by former Bruins defenseman Glen Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe staved off a big flurry by Carolina in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half-minute of the third, Dafoe again was called on
when Gary Roberts, who had a terrific game, blasted a shot from
point-blank range. But the goalie turned it back, setting up
DiMaio's heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they'd come flying and we had to weather that storm
early,'' said Dafoe. ``I don't think we can get away with that in
every game of this series.''
</P>
<P>
   For a night, they did.

WHEN GOING GETS TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Touch really isn't Ken Belanger's game. The
terms ``hands'' and ``Belanger'' go together, most of the time,
like a right-left combination, the Bruins' strapping forward
slotted firmly into the role of enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I love about playoff hockey,'' said Belanger, who
swapped sweet science for a luscious goal Thursday night in the
Bruins' 2-0 win over the Hurricanes in Game 1 of the playoff
series. ``It's just good, hard contact hockey. You don't have to
worry about the fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The knuckles, hooks, and right crosses stripped out of the game
_ all of it swapped for some fierce, often ferocious hitting on
both sides _ Belanger suddenly became an important role player of a
different kind in Game 1. Coach Pat Burns rolled him over the
boards for 14 shifts, about double or triple his typical workload,
and he responded every time by slamming every red-and-white shirt
that came his way.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger finished with a team-high eight hits, but in the end,
as usual, it was his goal that drew the most attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen guys do that on TV,'' said Belanger, who circled out
from behind the right post with a Jason Allison feed and stuffed it
inside the right post with 7:37 gone in the third period. ``That
wraparound part . . . I've seen guys do that, so I figured, what
the heck, I'd try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Touch. Hands. Maybe it wasn't a Denis Savard spin-o-rama or a
Paul Kariya deke-and-shoot, but it had some style, some grace to
it. It also held up to the scrutiny of the replay judge, who had to
make sure that Dmitri Khristich was pushed into the crease and
didn't commit the ultimate postseason boo-boo, the dreaded foot
encroachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked with Kenny before the series,'' said Burns. ``We
told him we'd need some size players.''
</P>
<P>
   Size players. Guys with brawn and the brains not to take stupid
penalties. Guys with the kind of gumption to keep delivering
checks, answer body blow for body blow, jump off the bench full of
spit and hiss and take a bite out of the Zamboni if that's what it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to get in that kind of game,'' said Belanger.
``The best part is the big hits _ getting the big hits. I love it.
That's hockey. It's what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were faced with a torrent in the opening 6-8 minutes.
The Canes, led by Keith Primeau, stormed out with a pounding
forecheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those first few minutes,'' said Boston goalie Byron Dafoe,
``it felt like there were 25,000 people in here. The fans fed off
it, and their players fed off the fans. We stood around in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were retaliating, and returning with their share of
slams, but the Canes dominated in the early going. Burns soon saw
that he wouldn't be able to survive without getting something out
of Belanger. He needed that size player, and he needed him before
his club was looking at a 3-0 deficit and a series gone wrong from
the first ring of the bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny showed right off the start that he wanted to get
involved in the game,'' said Rob DiMaio, who scored Boston's first
goal, collecting a Jeff O'Neill giveaway and slapping it home from
the right faceoff circle. ``Pat sees that in a guy. He's smart. He
saw the intensity, and Kenny responded to that. I was really
impressed with the way he played.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger kept pounding. His most impressive work came when he
slammed his 225 pounds into Keith Primeau's 220, the two colliding
on the icy track as if sent down the rail by Uncle Fester from the
Addams Family days.
</P>
<P>
   No series can go on like that forever. Both sides were racing
for the ice packs when it was over. Belanger had a pile of cubes
mounted on his neck as he read the scoresheet, taking some of the
sting out of his night's work. He didn't have to tend to his hands,
but that goal scoring thing can be such a pain in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years I've been waiting for this,'' said Belanger,
thinking back to his brief trials with the Leafs and Islanders,
clubs that didn't make it to the postseason. ``Funny, I was
watching TV (Wednesday) night, and the announcers kept saying,
`(Tommy) Salo, (Marty) McInnis, (Travis) Green . . . these guys
haven't been in the playoffs much.'''
</P>
<P>
   All of them were on the Island with Belanger, but all are
working elsewhere now, different chances in different cities. And
for some, different results.

D-BACKS HEAD OUT ON ROAD  
 TRIP CAN EXORCISE DEMONS OF 1-5 START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO - The five losses in the first six games, four of them
excruciatingly painful for the Diamondbacks, remain emblazoned in
the minds of the players. Most members of the club quietly think
about where they could be right now if not for the four losses in
the last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   While the Diamondbacks try to push the nightmare finishes to the
far recesses of their brain, they set out on the longest trip of
the season, a 13-game stretch that will see the Diamondbacks set
down in four cities.
</P>
<P>
   This, for all practical purposes, will be a major test for a
club that finished its first homestand in impressive fashion,
sweeping a three-game series from Philadelphia to win eight of the
10 games played at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't just 1-5 on that trip, it was more the way we were
losing games in the last at-bats,'' reliever Brian Anderson said.
``We have to wash those away. Hopefully, we got them all out of our
system. Good teams win no matter where they play. If we can only
win at home, then we're not a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way for the Diamondbacks to show the rest of
the National League, and themselves, that they are a good club than
by having a successful road trip as they play in San Diego,
Houston, Milwaukee and Cincinnati over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting they must win 10 of the 13 or any such
thing. But even a simple winning record on this trip, say 7-6,
would represent a tremendous move forward for a club that strongly
believes it can win a division title this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone in here knows that if we get to where we want
to be, we have to be able to win on the road,'' Manager Buck
Showalter said. ``I'm not sure anyone ever looks forward to playing
on the road, but we know we must be successful on the road. These
are some tough cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, playing anywhere on the road is difficult. The San
Diego Padres, who will host the Diamondbacks over the next three
days, managed a 44-37 record away from Qualcomm Stadium while
winning 98 games and the NL West title last season.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 clubs that finished with losing records last season,
only the Kansas City Royals had a winning road record. Of the 14
clubs that had winning records, six had losing records away from
their home stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we go that deep intellectually,'' said third
baseman Matt Williams, who is off to a torrid start. ``At least I
know I don't. We have enough veteran guys on this club who know
what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with winning tight games on the road was clearly
evidenced during those first six games in Los Angeles and Atlanta.
The home club always has the final at-bat, and giving up a lead in
the last inning means taking the slow walk off the field knowing
your club has no more at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, this trip might be viewed as one where the
Diamondbacks can exorcise the evil spirits that overtook their
bullpen in so many last-inning situations while losing four of
those first six games in the opponents' final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should all be behind us,'' said Randy Johnson, who is
scheduled to start three games on this trip. ``As soon as we took
three out of four from LA, we knew we could compete with the club
everyone is picking to win the division. No matter what, I still
think it will take until the All-Star break for us to make
believers out of the fickle people who don't believe in us. Right
now, they just think we had a hot streak during this homestand.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one player is truly being consumed by the disastrous first
trip, and his name is Gregg Olson, the club's closer who was on the
mound to watch three ninth-inning leads evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club didn't do anything bad on that first trip,'' Olson
said. ``These are my demons I have to confront, not the rest of the
club.'' &QL;

ARIZONA FORWARD EDGERSON MULLING SITTING OUT SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eugene Edgerson, Arizona's last link to its 1997 NCAA
championship basketball team, realizes that playing pro basketball
is a longshot for him.
</P>
<P>
   His coaches understand that Edgerson, a backup power forward,
wants to stay on track to complete his degree in elementary
education next spring. That requires a semester of student
teaching, which Edgerson said would make it difficult _ if not
impossible _ for him to play his senior season for the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Edgerson told a Tucson newspaper that he has
decided to sit out next season, which would leave the Wildcats with
no seniors on their roster and only two experienced inside players.
But on Thursday, Edgerson said through a UA spokesman that he had
not made a final decision. Edgerson met with Coach Lute Olson on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long way to go before anything is decided,'' UA
associate coach Jim Rosborough said. ``Everybody wants what's best
for Gene. We recognize that graduating in four years is a very
worthy goal, and we support him. But there are ways to work out the
conflict, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosborough said that the UA coaching staff and the UA College of
Education were trying to work out a schedule that would allow
Edgerson to complete his degree on time while playing his senior
season _ ``if that's what Gene wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgerson told the`` Arizona Daily Star'' on Wednesday that he
would sit out next season, possibly returning in 2000-2001 after
completing degree requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Mike Bibby. I'm not Jason Terry, where basketball is
guaranteed for me,'' he said. ``What's guaranteed for me is I'm
going to be somebody, whether it's as a teacher or as a basketball
player, and I think my chances are better as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I spend eight hours a day in class and be 100 percent for
practices? That's not possible, man. The only way I could do it is
if I took (expletive) kinds of classes, and I'm not a (expletive)
kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does sit out, Arizona's only experienced inside players
would be 6-foot-7 power forward Michael Wright, the Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year, and 7-foot-1 center Loren Woods, a transfer from Wake
Forest who becomes eligible next season.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has been recruiting another big body, 6-foot-10 Robertas
Javtokas, a Lithuanian who attends Akron (Ohio) St. Vincent's High
School. Javtokas has agreed to make a campus visit to Tucson next
month, although he has not yet attained a qualifying test score
that would allow him to be eligible to play NCAA Division 1
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, North Carolina-Charlotte and Louisville also are
recruiting Javtokas, who must pass a Ohio proficiency exam before
May 10 in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, UA also has come into contention for Luke Recker, a
6-6 swingman who is transferring out of Coach Bob Knight's Indiana
program after leading the Hoosiers in scoring last season. Recker
will visit UA next month. He would be ineligible next season
because of the transfer. Recker also is considering North Carolina,
Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have had an in-home visit with Jason Kapono, a 6-8
All-America forward at Lakewood (Calif.) High. He also is
considering Kentucky and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has two scholarships available. &QL;

MOORE TO SKIP MINICAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Unsigned wide receiver &UR; Rob Moore will not be at
Cardinals minicamp next week, his agent,  &UR; Gary Wichard, confirmed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wichard said the club didn't expect Moore to be there because he
is unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Vice President &UR; Bill Bidwill Jr. said he hadn't planned
on Moore attending.
</P>
<P>
   The team and Moore failed to reach agreement on a new contract
in February, and the team placed the franchise tag on him,
guaranteeing he would be paid the average of the top-five
receivers. The franchise tag also allows the Cardinals to match any
offer for him.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, the franchise figure for wide receivers is $3.531
million.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials hope to sign Moore to longer than a one-year
deal. They likely will offer him a multiyear contract in July.
</P>
<P>
   If he signs a multiyear deal after July 15, the Cardinals will
get their franchise designation back for next season. &QL; 
Funds available &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team has been given a rookie pool of $4.6 million to sign
its 11 draft picks, including two first-round choices, Ohio State
wide receiver &UR; David Boston and Eastern Michigan offensive tackl &UR; e
L.J.
 &UR; Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a little tight,'' said Bill Bidwill Jr., who
oversees contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.6 million rookie pool was the second to the expansion
Cleveland Browns' $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans, which had only one draft pick, has $1.74 million to
spend on getting first-round pick  &UR; Ricky Williams, Texas running
back, signed. &QL; 
Public workout &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team will hold an open practice on May 1 at Sun Devil
Stadium as part of its annual Select-A-Seat Block Party.
</P>
<P>
   The workout will be during the second day of the three-day
minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium gates open at 8 a.m. A children's autograph session is
scheduled for 10 a.m. to 10:30, followed by practice until noon. &QL; 
Short shots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A four-day veterans camp is scheduled for May 10-13.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies and selected first- and second-year players will
participate in a two-week camp June 7-11 and June 14-18.

BLUES, FUHR STOP COYOTES  
 ST. LOUIS STOPS 4 POWER PLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - They said all the right things. Believed them, too. No
more excuses. They've got something to prove. Second round or bust!
</P>
<P>
   It all seemed like a distant memory, at least for a night, after
the Coyotes lost their collective edge Thursday night, suffering a
3-1 setback in Game 1 of their Western Conference quarterfinal
series against the St. Louis BLues.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a costly lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if they can't get their awful power play untracked.
The Coyotes went 0-for-6 and wasted four first-period chances,
including a pivotal two-man advantage that was the story of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made terrible decisions with the puck,'' Coyotes Coach Jim
Schoenfeld said. ``I'm not going to stand here and point out who or
when, but it's something we've been working on, we have the plays
that we run, and we were completely brain dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to keep working on it. There's only so many
things you can do. You can watch video, which we've done. You can
practice it, which we've done. You can discuss it, which we've
done. But it still boils down to the execution on the ice and
people making split-second decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes seemingly had everything going for them, except
having to play without injured star center Jeremy Roenick. They had
motivation to prove they could undo past sins both here and in
Winnipeg and actually win a first-round playoff series. They had
home-ice advantage. They had the Whiteout, a supercharged, ominous
sight that nearly tore off the roof at sold-out America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But on this night, it was Bluesville in the land of white.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes couldn't solve Grant Fuhr. They couldn't stop Al
MacInnis. And they couldn't score on the power play to save their
souls.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for a late goal by Robert Reichel, there would
be almost nothing positive for the Coyotes to take into Game 2 here
Saturday at noon in what looms as a must-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lose the series tonight,'' right wing Shane Doan
said. ``We lost one game. We just have to bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues got a goal and two assists from MacInnis and scores
from Jamie Rivers and an empty-netter from left wing Scott Pellerin
after Reichel's goal. They also received a 26-save performance from
the ageless but acrobatic Fuhr, who now is a staggering 16-1
lifetime in the playoffs against the Winnipeg Jets/Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a strong game tonight,'' Coyotes right wing Rick
Tocchet said. ``He made at least four big saves that were Grant
Fuhr-type saves. He was out of the net, came flying in, and made
the save. They expect that from Grant Fuhr and he did the job for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The only shot he couldn't stop was a too-little, too-late goal
by the newest Coyote. Dallas Drake dug out the puck along the
boards, fed it down low to Tocchet, and he centered a pass out to
the slot that Reichel quickly jammed past Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   The goal briefly gave the Coyotes some life and brought the
crowd back into the game. But there was only 1:52 remaining in
regulation, and not enough punch to force overtime. Especially
after a Fuhr outlet pass to MacInnis paved the way for Pellerin's
empty-net goal with 42 seconds left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Any momentum the Coyotes thought they had from the hyped-up
crowd vanished just 22 seconds after faceoff when Juha Ylonen was
whistled for a hooking minor. But just as the penalty expired,
MacInnis, who had dashed from blue line to blue line untouched,
unleashed one of his rocket slap shots. It sailed inside the post
just past Nikolai Khabibulin's glove hand and hit the back of the
net.
</P>
<P>
   But that was nothing. How problematic were the four punchless
Phoenix power players in the first period?
</P>
<P>
   It only got worse after that. The Coyotes had an apparent
game-tying goal by Ylonen wiped away with 6:52 left in the second.
Referees Paul DeVorski and Paul Stewart said the puck never crossed
the line, although replays made it look afully close.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Doan got whistled for tripping and the
Blues made it 2-0 on the ensuing power play, just their third of
the game up to that point. With 2:36 left in the period, Rivers
deflected Terry Yake's shot with his stick while camping outside
the crease to Khabibulin's right.

WARNING SIGNAL COMES VERY EARLY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - It didn't take long for Jim Schoenfeld to blend in
with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   It could've been just 22 seconds, the time it took for a Coyote
to land in the penalty box. Or maybe it was the moment he learned
that Tverdovsky is Russian for turnover. Or when a blue-line
special whizzed by his goalie, turning a night of anticipation into
a futile, brutal game of catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   No, it didn't take long before the color drained from the
Coyotes coach. And just like that, Schoenfeld's face joined the
Whiteout.
</P>
<P>
   Stop if you've read this before, but it didn't take long for the
Coyotes to put down their shovels and jump in a hole, a team facing
an 0-1 deficit. A team facing a must-win situation on Saturday, the
same old postseason nausea, the same old ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Deja Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a sleepless night (on Thursday),'' Coyotes
warrior Rick Tocchet said. ``We'd like to have that one back.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason for panic, not when home-ice advantage means
very little in hockey, and even the most raucous building in the
NHL can be silenced with a quick goal and a hot goalie. But the
frustration is understandable, especially for a hockey team
desperately in need of a good start. And the concern is real. Very,
very real.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of dissection, there are some inevitable
conclusions. Oleg Turnover-dovsky was terrible. The power play set
a new standard for impotence, enough to encourage the Blues to
ignore the risks and take a few aggressive chances in the near
future. And that first goal . . .
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much Nikolai Khabibulin freezing in awe. It was a
pair of defenders shying away from Al MacInnis as he approached the
blue line, afraid of his sizzling slap shot, treating the puck as
if it were a live grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, whatever happened to paying the price?
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the real concern is the offense and whether the
Coyotes can score enough goals to win a game, much less a series.
All night long, they seemed to be a man short on the ice. Even on
the power play. And this condition might not disappear.
</P>
<P>
   A shame, too, because Grant Fuhr looked shaky. Ready to be
conquered. But too often, centering passes found an empty crease,
rebounds were flailed at with stone hands, opportunities came and
went without a red light in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a 5-on-3,'' Schoenfeld said. ``And we went out there
like we were brain-dead.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the most flagrant offense. That belonged to the
power play resulting in a 2-on-nothing break for the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play just demoralized us,'' Tocchet said.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, even with Jeremy Roenick, this team barely had enough
offense to cling to the fringes of the elite. Without him, they're
struggling. More than anyone wants to admit.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was a total loss. The Coyotes want to overpower the
Blues, force a softer opponent to wilt. A good strategy, but at the
same time, they must stay out of the penalty box, especially with
an additional referee on the ice. This is the dilemma of balance
facing the Coyotes, and for the most part, they handled it
wonderfully on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But they're going to have to mount some offense, and it won't be
easy. Not without pinching defenders, taking chances, risking the
odd-man rush that has been so damaging in the past.
</P>
<P>
   It is also clear that this series will be miserable for Keith
Tkachuk. On Thursday, he was slashed, chopped, diced and sliced. He
is the ultimate power forward confronting the ultimate power
defenseman in Chris Pronger. But Pronger got a lot of help from
MacInnis, and no matter how determined Tkachuk may be to erase the
stigma of first-round loser, something else is clear:
</P>
<P>
   He's going to need some help. From somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what type of team we have on Saturday,'' Tocchet
said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, while the crowd was still alive, a
band in the third deck broke into song, and the lyrics were
striking:
</P>
<P>
   This is our last chance &QL; 
This is our last dance &QL; 
Under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is. And yes, they are. &QL;

   PHOENIX - Actor  &UR; Tom Arnold is used to attracting attention, but
when he arrived at America West Arena Thursday night, he had no
idea what was in store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize everyone was going to wear white,'' said
Arnold, who was dressed in black. ``They didn't tell us in LA. I
walked in and went, `Oh my God. I feel like such a jerk.' But it's
a great place to play and a great place to watch a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold is a longtime Blues and longtime NHL fan. He said he has
never seen passion from a crowd like the passion Coyotes fans
showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've ever been to and I've been to a lot,''
he said. ``The crowd is great. They're almost organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could never get fans to do this in LA. One, they'd leave
after the first period. Two, they'd never all dress the same
because they're too conceited.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Saved teeth &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No matter how big a save &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin or  &UR; Grant Fuhr make
in the first-round playoff series between the Coyotes and the
Blues, it won't match the save  &UR; Dr. Reed Day made, according to the
Coyotes' injured &UR; Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   When it was learned that Roenick's jaw was dislocated and broken
in three places after the jarring hit thrown by  &UR; Derian Hatcher of
Dallas last week, it was also feared that the Coyotes center would
loose eight teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Not so.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they're all going to be all right,'' Roenick said before
Thursday's playoff opener. ``I feel fortunate and lucky. Actually,
I feel fortunate and lucky to have a great doctor like Dr. Day. If
anybody out there needs oral surgery, I'd recommend him highly.
There's nobody better.'' &QL; 
Niki all the way &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goaltending coach &UR; Benoit Allaire ended speculation that the
Coyotes might split duties between  &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin and  &UR; Mikhail
Shtalenkov Saturday and Sunday, when the Coyotes and Blues play
back-to-back games inside of 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it will be Niki,'' Allaire said on Thursday. ``He's got to
be in there for us. He's our guy.'' &QL; 
Staying together &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes center &UR; Robert Reichel, obtained from the New York
Islanders at the trading deadline, credits  &UR; Keith Tkachuk with
willingly moving to center on the No. 1 line to keep the second
line intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a positive thing when you can keep your lines
together, and our line has been working hard and playing well,''
Reichel said of wingers  &UR; Greg Adams and  &UR; Rick Tocchet. ``Hopefully,
we'll stay together.'' &QL; 
Daigneault questionable &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; J.J. Daigneault's injured hip flexor kept him out of
the series opener Thursday night. Assistant General Manager  &UR; Taylor
Burke said Daigneault is questionable for Saturday's Game No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to skate for 20 to 25 minutes hard (today), and
we'll see how it is,'' Daigneault said. ``If I skate hard for 15
minutes or so, it gets sore. I don't know if it's part of the hip
bruise I had or not. But I want to play on Saturday if I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman &UR; Brad Tiley was recalled from Springfield on Wednesday
and took Daigneault's place in the lineup, partly because veteran
defenseman &UR; Jamie Huscroft is nursing a minor injury.
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen  &UR; Deron Quint and &UR; Gerald Diduck each took part in the
team's morning skate Thursday. It was the second straight skate for
Quint, who has been out since April 1 because of a concussion.
Diduck still is listed as being two weeks away from playing. &QL; 
Cup arriveth &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether &UR; Tkachuk, Tocchet or  &UR; Dallas Drake will get to skate
around the rink holding it above their heads is one thing, but
Phoenix is assured of receiving the Stanley Cup nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey's Holy Grail will visit the Valley on Tuesday and
Wednesday to promote the Coyotes' quest for sport's most historic
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Three special Stanley Cup events will be held Wednesday: at
Supai Middle School in Scottsdale from 10 to 11 a.m., at Phoenix
Children's Hospital from 12:30-2 p.m. and at the Scottsdale Boys
and Girls Club, 4-5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Cup will be on display for Coyotes fans from 4-8 p.m.
Tuesday at Alice Cooper's Town during Game 4 of the Coyotes-Blues
playoff series at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup will be accompanied by its caretaker,  &UR; Paul Oke,
who will be on hand to discuss facts and trivia regarding the
trophy. &QL;

THE SOUND AND THE FUHR-Y 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It was a lock. A given. A Fuhr-thing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the cold, hard truth, Coyotes fans: Grant Fuhr has this
franchise's number. And it's 16.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old goalie's playoff record against Winnipeg/Phoenix
improved to 16-1 following St. Louis' 3-1 victory over the Coyotes
Thursday night at America West Arena. The man his teammates call
``Father Time'' and ``Grandpa'' demonstrated what 18 years of NHL
experience can do for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Time was definitely ticking tonight for us,''
defenseman Jamie Rivers said. ``He was awesome. He had his game
face on, and he'll wear it for the rest of the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fuhr, ``I know I only have a few years left, so anytime you
get into the playoffs, you want to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr had several key stops, including a barrage in the second
period when the Coyotes outshot the Blues, 9-7. He even stopped one
with his neck with 13:34 remaining in the first period and had the
welt to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I did that,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   He was instrumental in stopping the Coyotes' 5-on-3 advantage in
the first period, and it seemed to take some life out of the hosts.
Throughout the game, he came up big: high shots, low shots,
rebounds. He stopped nearly all of them and finished the night with
26 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Only one got by him: Robert Reichel's tap with 1:52 remaining in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   For years, critics have tried to write off Fuhr, but he
continues to silence them in his own quiet way.
</P>
<P>
   Before undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery earlier this season,
he was 7-7-5 with a 2.70 goals-against average and an .876 save
percentage. The Blues went so far as to audition replacements after
the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Since his return, he has appeared in St. Louis' last 18 games
and posted a 9-4-3 record, a 2.10 goals-against average and a .912
save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a remarkable recovery from his surgery,'' St. Louis
Coach Joel Quenneville said. ``He's the type of guy that relishes
the situation he's in now, and he gives us some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr's quiet demeanor might have kept others from knowing just
how much his injured knee bothered him and how much it affected his
play.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Fuhr played like a man who has been a member of five
Stanley Cup championship teams and is a six-time NHL All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good right now,'' Fuhr said. ``The body's healthy. I
had a week off to rest. I'm just out there having a good time.
Things are bouncing off in the right spots, so I just need to enjoy
it while I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Much to the rest of the league's dismay, he may not be ready to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   He said in January that next season would be his last. But in
March, after feeling strong because of his successful third knee
surgery, he suggested he would like to play in 1,000 career games.
But that would likely mean he would have to play for another three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr, who joined St. Louis in 1995, has a two-year, $6 million
deal. Who knows how long he'll go?
</P>
<P>
   Based on the opinions of those on the ice Thursday night, Fuhr
has a lot of hockey left in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a strong game tonight,'' the Coyotes' Rick Tocchet
said. ``He made four saves that are Grant Fuhr-type saves. He was
out of the net, then would come flying in and make the save. They
expect that from Fuhr, and he did the job for them.'' &QL;

NO PUNCH TO POWER PLAY HURTS COYOTES  
 WASTED OPPORTUNITIES IRK TEAM

<P>
   PHOENIX - ``It will be there when we need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pick a member of the Coyotes' power play _ any player _ and each
uttered those words at one point during a season in which the power
play converted only 12 percent of its opportunities _ 41 of 342, to
be exact.
</P>
<P>
   Never was it needed more than in Thursday night's 3-1
playoff-opening loss to the St. Louis Blues in the best-of-seven
first-round Western Conference series at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And never was it more missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play, like it has all year, really killed us
tonight,'' Keith Tkachuk said. ``It was absolutely miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Added defenseman Jyrki Lumme: ``We got better traffic in front
of the net tonight 5-on-5 than we did on the power play. Guess
we're going to have to check the video and see what we did wrong
and what we did well, and do those things and correct the
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Special teams figured to be the Achilles' heel of the Coyotes
coming into the series. The Blues' power play ranked third in the
NHL during the regular season and its penalty-killing unit was
second, while the Coyotes ranked 26th out of 27 teams and its
penalty-killing unit ranked fifth.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis showed the Coyotes the value of its power play last
week in Phoenix, when it cashed in four goals with a man edge,
including three straight in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Blues gave the Coyotes six power-play
opportunities, including a 5-on-3 for 1:29 in the first on which
Phoenix failed to put a shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
   And, when the 5-on-3 became a 5-on-4, they nearly compounded the
misery by allowing St. Louis to fly down the ice on a two-man
breakaway. Fortunately, goalie Nikolai Khabibulin stonewalled Craig
Conroy and Scott Pellerin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 5-on-3 was disheartening,'' said Phoenix's Rick Tocchet.
``We were making plays that veteran players shouldn't make. We had
five veterans out there and we're making dumb cross-ice passes. If
we don't get it straightened out quick, we're going to be in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Schoenfeld was even more specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play, especially that 5-on-3, cost us the game,'' he
said. ``We have our plays that we run with a two-man edge and we've
been working on them, but we were completely brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the difference in the hockey game. They got one on
theirs and we got none on ours. We need better execution. That
2-on-0 on our own power play was totally of out line.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix gave the Blues just three power-play opportunities and
they responded with two goals. Granted, as Schoenfeld alluded, Al
MacInnis' first goal of the game technically was not a power-play
goal. It only looked, tasted and smelled like one.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis' hard slap shot from the blue line flew past a stunned
and screened Khabibulin at 2:22, exactly two-minutes after Juha
Ylonen was penalized for hooking 22 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy comes out and scores on a big shot like that early in
the game it takes some of the wind out of you,'' Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues cashed in a second power-play goal with 2:36 remaining
in the second period when defenseman Jamie Rivers beat Khabibulin,
screened again, on his stickside on a slap shot from the slot after
Shane Doan was called for hooking in front of the Coyotes' net.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at their two goals, there was no diagram or
anything,'' Tocchet said. ``They just blasted them and had a guy at
the net. We had a lot of chances, they just didn't go in.'' &QL;

 HOMINID FOSSILS MAY REVEAL LINK BETWEEN MAN, APE  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists sifting the rubble of a desert hillside in Ethiopia
have discovered a trove of fossil bones 21/2 million years old that
may reveal the first direct link between the apelike creatures of
ancient Africa and the earliest members of our true human lineage.
</P>
<P>
   This newfound hominid species, still far more ape than human,
could include the very first beings on Earth to use stone tools to
butcher their meat and crack the juicy bones. That entirely new
technology in diet marked a major turning point on the long
evolutionary path toward modern Homo sapiens, the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, a team of 40 researchers from 13 countries has
been collecting and analyzing countless fossil fragments from an
arid site near Ethiopia's Awash River. At the African site, the
scientists pieced together some of the most remarkable evidence of
the ancient past that has yet to come from Ethiopia's fossil-rich
Afar Triangle, where the skeleton of the early hominid ``Lucy,''
about 3.2 million years old, was discovered 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the latest expedition were Tim D. White, an
anthropologist at the University of California at Berkeley, and
Berhani Asfaw, a leading Ethiopian anthropologist who has
frequently worked with White at Berkeley. Together with J. Desmond
Clark of UC Berkeley, who at 83 is a famed pioneer in the study of
human evolution, and their colleagues, they are publishing two
detailed reports on the new finds Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Their extraordinary discoveries include fragmented fossils of
eight creatures known as hominids, including bits and pieces of one
with a thigh bone long enough to foreshadow the legs of later
humans and thereby adopt a more humanlike gait. Less than 300 yards
away they found a skull with a small brain case not much larger
than an ape's and a very primitive face with unusually large back
teeth, characteristics never seen before in any fossil hominids,
the scientists say. The creature It  &LR; stood only about 4 feet 9
inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that cranium's size and shape, the scientists have
determined that it represents a new hominid species and have named
it Australopithecus garhi. The first word, meaning ``southern
ape-man'' indicates the genus line that includes ``Lucy'' whose kin
first emerged nearly a million years earlier, while ``garhi'' is
Ethiopian for ``surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid their perplexing collection of ancient material, the
scientists are still uncertain whether all the humanlike fossils
were members of the same new Australopithecus species, or which
ones actually did the revolutionary act of butchering their meat.
</P>
<P>
   One antelope leg bone, for example, clearly shows the marks of
deliberate cutting and a cracked area that could only have been
made by pounding it with a rock, according to White, And a fragment
of the animal's skull showed where a sharp tool had obviously cut
away the tongue _ presumably a delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the evidence for deliberate tool use on the animal
bones is clear, White and Clark said in interviews this week that
the past three years of tedious searching and excavating at the
site near the village of Bouri have yielded none of the actual
stone tools.
</P>
<P>
   The site is largely composed of the sedimentary remains of
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that have disrupted all of
Africa's great Rift Valley for more than 5 million years, and there
are no cobbles anywhere near the newfound hominid remains.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier expeditions at a site near the village of Gona, 35
miles to the north, have found abundant rocks showing clearly that
creatures there knew how to chip away sharp flakes into knives and
use rounded stones for pounding meat and bashing bones, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The new site near Bouri was not always a harsh desert, and when
the fossils found there were alive 21/2 million years ago, the land
was a pleasant grassy meadow where antelope and primitive horses
grazed, saber-toothed cats hunted prey, and a lush lake provided
water and campsites with a view.
</P>
<P>
   White and his colleagues, in the respected tradition of
anthropology, are being ultra-cautious. While while they have
placed their new Australopithecus species on a direct evolutionary
line midway between Lucy, called A. afarensis, and Homo habilis,
the earliest known members of the truly human race, they concede
that their own A. garhi species might _ just might _ have been an
offshoot of the line rather than directly on it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that caution, however, White showed far more excitement
in discussing the implications of the discovery:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major breakthrough because it tells us about a new
species previously unknown to science,'' White said, `'and it tells
us about the early, early _ 21/2 million years early _ acquisition
of meat and marrow eating among our human ancestors, revolutionary
technological and dietary steps in the human career. This is the
first time we have anatomical evidence and behavioral evidence
right together''
</P>
<P>
   To White and Clark the revolution in diet was a key step toward
nourishing the hominid brain that was then still small. It was, as
White put it, ``the next major revolution in human evolution''
because it allowed the hominid brain to evolve into a larger and
larger organ, eventually toward human brain size.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of humanlike human-like  &LR; creatures remains
shrouded in mystery, however. Anthropologists believe that the
hominid line must have separated from the lineage of the great apes
_ chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos _ sometime between 5 five  &LR; and
6 six  &LR; million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even the various hominid lineages known as Australopithecenes
must have evolved from earlier species that began to walk on two
legs and separated from the four-legged early apes. And today that
earliest change is attributed to a bipedal hominid that lived some
4.4 million years ago and whose fossils were discovered in the
Awash region by Berkeley's White and his Ethiopian colleagues in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   White named that species Ardipithecus ramidus, meaning ``ground
ape,'' while ``ramidus'' is the Ethiopian word for ``root.'' Today
Ardipithecus is the earliest known hominid, while we humans are _
until now, of course _ the last in the hominid line of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The latest discovery of what may well be the long-sought link
between the australopithecenes and Homo is certain to meet with
skepticism by rival anthropologists.
</P>
<P>
   But in Berkeley Thursday F. Clark Howell, one of the world's
foremost specialists in the evolution of early humans, called the
new report ``a real coup and a fine piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``White and his colleagues are highly conservative, and they
have much more than merely fragmentary material to back them up,''
Howell said. ``They have cranial remains and arms and legs _ an
entire assemblage. And while we can't definitely link the arms and
legs with the cranial parts, they do show evidence that places them
more definitively toward the Homo lineage.''

 AS BOMBS FLY, NATO MULLS ITS FUTURE  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's 50th anniversary summit opens Friday in
Washington with a three-hour council of war dealing with Kosovo _
rather than a gala with flyby jets _ as the alliance grapples with
a conflict that will determine, unexpectedly, the course of
European-American relations into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo _ now in its fifth week, with no sign that
NATO will scale back its bombings _ has crystallized fundamental
questions about the future of what many call the most successful
alliance in the history of the world: Where should it fight? For
what end? Who should join and who should lead?
</P>
<P>
   Should NATO evolve from a security pact between Europe and the
United States against the Soviet threat to a sort of global
policeman that intervenes in ethnic conflicts and battles
terrorism, rogue states and the spread of chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons, as the Clinton administration would like?
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, how will NATO avoid the humiliation of a
belligerent Balkan dictator defeating the entire Western military
alliance and its high-tech war machine right in its own back yard?
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is spoiling the party,'' said Simon Serfaty, director
of European Studies at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. ``Clearly, it is not even a quagmire we face. It's a dead
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Will NATO commit ground forces to Kosovo, to battle an
entrenched Yugoslav army, village by village, most of them now
emptied of the people NATO sought to protect? Or will it seek
Russia's aid in brokering a truce with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, whom some NATO leaders say should be indicted as a war
criminal rather than negotiated with.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the alliance's 19 members, along with 23 of the
25 ``partner'' nations _ Russia and Belarus will skip the event to
protest the bombings in Yugoslavia _ will face those questions in
the largest summit ever held in the United States. The three-day
summit will shut down much of the city. The federal government will
close, along with schools. Downtown law firms have already packed
up and moved to temporary quarters in Virginia. The heart of the
city is now what NATO calls ``Prohibited Area 56.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington now has its own no-fly zone. Pilots are forbidden to
fly lower than 18,000 feet within a 10-nautical-mile radius of
Reagan National Airport. Access to a 100-block area running from
the Capitol to the White House to the U.S. Naval Observatory will
be heavily restricted. Bus routes are being canceled and visitors
told to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Washington on April 4, 1949 on the rubble of World
War II, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization bound the United
States and Europe in mutual protection. Like many postwar
international institutions created under U.S. auspices, NATO
succeeded and endured. For the next 50 years, the alliance secured
peace and prosperity in Europe after two devastating world wars
and, without firing a shot, held off the threat of another world
war.
</P>
<P>
   Today, NATO finds itself enmeshed in its first live war,
confronted by basic questions about its purpose and its credibility
in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly and inconveniently we've got a test case ... and so
far we're not doing well,'' said Jeffrey Gedmin, a foreign policy
analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ``If
Kosovo ends up being a fiasco and the general conventional wisdom
is that we lost, it's going to do more than mar the summit this
weekend. It's going to damage NATO's credibility, and it's going to
damage the relationship between the United States and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But if NATO wins _ and much depends on the definition of victory
_ the alliance could emerge stronger.
</P>
<P>
   It is no small irony that NATO plans to reveal at this summit a
new ``strategic concept'' defining its core mission, and to welcome
three new members admitted only last month _ Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary, which now finds itself a frontline state in
NATO's first war.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's original mission was crystal clear: ``to keep the
Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down,'' as NATO's
first secretary-general, Lord Ismay, memorably put it.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Clinton
administration has pushed for NATO to address broad new areas from
terrorism to nuclear proliferation. More worrisome to the European
allies, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has also outlined a
vision of a kind of ``global NATO'' that would call on the alliance
to police not just Europe, but the Persian Gulf and even Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo has clearly answered the question about whether NATO
would engage in so-called out-of-area operations beyond its own
borders. Whether it succeeds may well determine if it ever tries
again.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' internationalist wing, a bipartisan bloc that includes
Republican Senators John McCain and Richard Lugar and Democrats
Joseph Biden and Joseph Lieberman, fully supports NATO and believes
that if anything, the Clinton administration should have committed
itself fully to the possible use of ground forces at the outset of
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at stake today is order and stability in Europe as a
whole, and that is why American interests are involved,'' Lugar
said in a speech this week, where he introduced a resolution ``to
use all necessary force'' to accomplish NATO aims in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo has also made it painfully clear that NATO's military
power rests almost solely with the Pentagon. While contributing
planes, European nations have proven unable _ in military parlance
_ to ``project power'' beyond their borders.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 90 percent of NATO's ``power-projection''
capability lies with the United States, according to the European
Institute, a Washington think tank. The United States is fielding
roughly 80 percent of the Kosovo military operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the Europeans don't spend the money,'' said
Serfaty of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
``They do spend actually quite a bit of money on defense, but
instead of spending it as one, they spend it as 15, so they don't
spend it well. They have maybe 7,000 combat aircraft. That's a lot
of planes. But those planes cannot lead missions. They have 2.5
million troops under arms, but very few of those people are able or
willing to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans contend they want a more equal role in the
alliance, a ``European pillar'' within NATO or even a separate
``European security and defense identity.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Kosovo makes clear, said Gedmin of the American
Enterprise Institute, ``the reality is that the Europeans are
neither politically nor institutionally nor infrastructurally ready
_ whether we like it or not, this is just the reality _ they're not
positioned in any foreseeable future to deal with any military
conflict of consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason for Europe and the United States to part
ways, some NATO critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should realize that it was a mistake to try to enlarge
NATO's membership and mission because it's not an appropriate
vehicle for dealing with security issues in the 21st century,''
said Lawrence Korb of the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Serfaty counters that, despite complaints about U.S. leadership,
European leaders ``know quite well that they cannot do without
it,'' and have acknowledged ``the centrality of American power and
the indispensability of American leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the U.S. also needs Europe as a political and
economic ally, he contends. ``Their institutions are comparable to
ours, their values are comparable to ours, it's a complete
relationship,'' Serfaty said. ``There's a security relationship
related to Russia, related to the Balkans, and therefore the case
for the U.S. in and with Europe is based not only on issues of
principles _ in this case to get the Kosovars back to their home
and stop ethnic cleansing _ but it is also based on interest, and
it is the convergence of principles and values on the one hand and
self-interest on the other that motivate this action, unlike say,
action in Rwanda.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is indeed the test case.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ We stood on the well-groomed lawns beneath the plain
trees of Novi Beograd Wednesday afternoon and looked at what
British Defense Minister George Robertson called ``the very heart
of Milosevic's bloodstained regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra-large blackbirds and magpies fluttered around the great
smoldering ruin of the Usce Business Center, a curtain of pale blue
smoke drifting from the upper stories where two of three cruise
missiles had smashed into the building before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   But striding the lawn, the waistcoated Yugoslav minister without
portfolio, Goran Matic, begged to differ. The 23-story pile with
its 100-ft. television transmitter, he told us, was nothing less
than ``the symbol of Yugoslavia's existence.''
</P>
<P>
   No one disputed that the ``Black Building,'' as it was
disrespectfully called by the people of Belgrade, had been _ as
NATO might put it _ very seriously degraded.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of concrete and glass had been blasted from the upper
floors into the park lot while up all four outer walls crept the
dark stain of a huge internal fire.
</P>
<P>
   Three television channels had been blasted off the air _ hence
Matic's reference to Yugoslavia's ``existence'' _ while two
solitary flags, one red for socialism, the other the tricolor of
Serbia, hung limply from the offices of President Slobodan
Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. Hence Robertson's reference
to the ``bloodstained regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that the president's SPS headquarters were struck
_ along with smaller offices of the Yugoslav Left Wing party of
Mrs. Mira Markovic (better known as Mrs. Milosevic) _ there's one
conclusion that anyone in Yugoslavia could make: NATO's war is
getting personal.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO had chosen to DHL a message to the Serbian leader, it
couldn't have done it more effectively. But the target also allowed
the Serbs to claim that NATO was trying to drive Yugoslavia's
television services off the air.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's sports channel SOS _ with no political content _
vanished in a millisecond, along with transmission facilities for
the punk-rock Pink Channel of Zeljko Mitrovic (a Markovic protege)
and the Kosava Television and the nominally independent but
pro-Milosevic BK channel.
</P>
<P>
   Had not Pink TV been playing a diet of Hollywood movies these
past weeks, Matic asked rhetorically? Had not BK been showing
American and West European serials?
</P>
<P>
   `How could we name these attacks as anything but `Monty Python's
Flying Circus'? You only have to see this image of our television
stations to understand that for NATO our media is more dangerous
than our military. I don't need to spend as much time as Jamie Shea
to explain this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Matic watches NATO's cockney spokesman _ extracts
from Shea's briefings often appear on Serb television if they suit
Yugoslavia's purposes _ says a lot about the Balkans information
war.
</P>
<P>
   So does the diet of western movies shown on Serb television.
``JFK'' and ``Nixon'' led off the first week of war, ``The Wizard
of Oz'' the second.
</P>
<P>
   But RTS, Radio Television Serbia _ whose pro-Milosevic news
broadcasts now run to two hours (without, of course, any mention of
``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo) _ has not been touched.
</P>
<P>
   Its directors invited the foreign press to visit the station
only two nights earlier, warning pointedly that NATO was due to
attack the channel's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Yugoslavs, the attack on the ``black building'' has
less to do with television broadcasts or the regime's ``nerve
center'' _ as Robertson also exotically described it _ than the
steady broadening of NATO targets across Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   From the strictly military targets attacked in the first week,
NATO's assaults have increased each week to embrace more and more
civilian buildings and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   From barracks and anti-aircraft defenses, NATO has moved on to
destroy road and rail bridges, oil refineries, car and plastics
factories, chemical facilities, a cotton yarn factory, television
relay transmitters, electrical power grids and cigarette factories.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, precisely the same pattern followed in the
bombardment of Iraq in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   So what next? If NATO continues the same pattern, electricity
and water supplies will soon be targeted, along with telephone
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Novi Beograd received contaminated water after its oil heating
plant was hit two weeks ago. Parts of Belgrade lost water for 24
hours this week.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has insisted that it targets only military infrastructure.
But as the targets are more promiscuously chosen, so greater and
greater civilian casualties are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, a NATO jet destroyed a passenger train. Two days'
later, an attack supposedly intended to destroy Serb paramlitary
forces in southern Kosovo slaughtered 74 Albanian refugees.
Wednesday the Serbs claimed a NATO jet had killed 10 Serb civilians
in Djakovaica, again in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can call the road out there a military supply line if
they want,'' my Belgrade hotel receptionist said acidly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, a long queue had formed for cigarettes now
that the tobacco factories at Nis and Vranje have been attacked.
Soldiers smoke cigarettes. Another military target. &QL;

Matic's reference to Yugoslavia's ``existence'' _ while two
solitary flags, one red for socialism, the other the tricolor of
Serbia, hung limply from the offices of President Slobodan
Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. Hence Robertson's reference
to the ``bloodstained regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that the president's SPS headquarters were struck
_ along with smaller offices of the Yugoslav Left Wing party of
Mrs. Mira Markovic (better known as Mrs. Milosevic) _ there's one
conclusion that anyone in Yugoslavia could make: NATO's war is
getting personal.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO had chosen to DHL a message to the Serbian leader, it
couldn't have done it more effectively. But the target also allowed
the Serbs to claim that NATO was trying to drive Yugoslavia's
television services off the air.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's sports channel SOS _ with no political content _
vanished in a millisecond, along with transmission facilities for
the punk-rock Pink Channel of Zeljko Mitrovic (a Markovic protege)
and the Kosava Television and the nominally independent but
pro-Milosevic BK channel.
</P>
<P>
   Had not Pink TV been playing a diet of Hollywood movies these
past weeks, Matic asked rhetorically? Had not BK been showing
American and West European serials?
</P>
<P>
   `How could we name these attacks as anything but `Monty Python's
Flying Circus'? You only have to see this image of our television
stations to understand that for NATO our media is more dangerous
than our military. I don't need to spend as much time as Jamie Shea
to explain this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Matic watches NATO's cockney spokesman _ extracts
from Shea's briefings often appear on Serb television if they suit
Yugoslavia's purposes _ says a lot about the Balkans information
war.
</P>
<P>
   So does the diet of western movies shown on Serb television.
``JFK'' and ``Nixon'' led off the first week of war, ``The Wizard
of Oz'' the second.
</P>
<P>
   But RTS, Radio Television Serbia _ whose pro-Milosevic news
broadcasts now run to two hours (without, of course, any mention of
``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo) _ has not been touched.
</P>
<P>
   Its directors invited the foreign press to visit the station
only two nights earlier, warning pointedly that NATO was due to
attack the channel's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Yugoslavs, the attack on the ``black building'' has
less to do with television broadcasts or the regime's ``nerve
center'' _ as Robertson also exotically described it _ than the
steady broadening of NATO targets across Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   From the strictly military targets attacked in the first week,
NATO's assaults have increased each week to embrace more and more
civilian buildings and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   From barracks and anti-aircraft defenses, NATO has moved on to
destroy road and rail bridges, oil refineries, car and plastics
factories, chemical facilities, a cotton yarn factory, television
relay transmitters, electrical power grids and cigarette factories.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, precisely the same pattern followed in the
bombardment of Iraq in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   So what next? If NATO continues the same pattern, electricity
and water supplies will soon be targeted, along with telephone
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Novi Beograd received contaminated water after its oil heating
plant was hit two weeks ago. Parts of Belgrade lost water for 24
hours this week.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has insisted that it targets only military infrastructure.
But as the targets are more promiscuously chosen, so greater and
greater civilian casualties are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, a NATO jet destroyed a passenger train. Two days'
later, an attack supposedly intended to destroy Serb paramilitary
forces in southern Kosovo slaughtered 74 Albanian refugees.
Wednesday the Serbs claimed a NATO jet had killed 10 Serb civilians
in Djakovaica, again in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can call the road out there a military supply line if
they want,'' my Belgrade hotel receptionist said acidly Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, a long queue had formed for cigarettes now
that the tobacco factories at Nis and Vranje have been attacked.
Soldiers smoke cigarettes. Another military target. &QL;

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They put their trust in us and we can't let them down,''
President Bill Clinton told the American people less than three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks later, General Wesley Clark pulled the rug from
Clinton's promise to the Kosovo Albanians. NATO's air campaign, he
declared, ``couldn't stop `ethnic cleansing.'''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Air Chief Marshal Sir John Day told us, with
breathtaking lack of precision, that ``this campaign has some way
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely we didn't believe, NATO's spokesman James Shea admonished
journalists in Brussels, that this was going to be over in just a
few days?
</P>
<P>
   Well, they didn't tell us that four weeks ago, did they? Back
then, we were informed that although President Slobodan Milosevic's
vicious security police were expelling tens of thousands of Kosovo
Albanians wholesale from their homes, it would have been ``even
worse'' if NATO hadn't bombed Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And now we must forget _ or ignore _ the terrible statistics of
death: 2,000 Kosovo Albanians killed in the 12 months up to the
start of the NATO bombardment; 3,200 in the past month alone.
</P>
<P>
   And now the whole policy is being subtly shifted once again. We
cannot stop Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing,'' but at least he can't
do it ``with impunity.'' Half his MiGs have been destroyed, and 100
percent of his oil-refining capacity (or so we are told).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are knocking the stuffing out of Milosevic,'' Shea
proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   So that is what the NATO mission has become _ a punishment
campaign. Goodbye autonomy for the Kosovo Albanians. Goodbye
Rambouillet. Goodbye NATO protection. Goodbye the dream of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Serbs believe they are winning. On Belgrade TV,
the crude, almost pornographic anti-NATO documentaries are
achieving their effect.
</P>
<P>
   Wrecked hospital wards and screaming civilians are spliced into
authentic color footage of Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Eva Braun jokes
with the Fuhrer. ``Monica!'' shouts a voice. And an unseen audience
roars with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   A skull glows red-hot and the words ``NATO U BLATU'' appear on
the screen: ``Nato into the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish, of course. But then I remember the skull of the Kosovo
Albanian refugee smoldering in the back of a tractor trailor bombed
by U.S. F-16s in southern Kosovo, with its white teeth, and the
backbone and just one fleshy leg hanging over the back of the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   NATO didn't confess to that until we found the codings on
shrapnel from the American bombs.
</P>
<P>
   And the 14-year-old boy dying in a Belgrade hospital with half
his stomach torn out by a NATO bomb in Pristina; and the young
woman cancer patient who asked me how I'd feel if my neck had been
cut open by a NATO bomb blast the day after a tumor operation.
</P>
<P>
   Or the old woman dragged from the NATO-bombed train at Grdelica,
who said that the coach roof had crushed her face and blinded her
for life.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt very much whether these scenes are going to force the
Serb people to undertake the ``democratic transition'' in Serbia
that President Clinton fondly requested this week.
</P>
<P>
   You can see, living among the Serbs as I have been doing this
past month, how this insidious propaganda works. They are not told
of the ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo. They do not see the tens of
thousands of Kosovo Albanians, or hear their stories of terror.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs are doing bad things, goes the refrain, it is
because of what has been done to them. And the Albanians are to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again here, I am having the same kind of awful
conversations with Serbs that I have had with Israelis. Serbia
cannot afford to be overrun, to lose its Jerusalem in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If injustice has been done to the Albanians/Palestinians, it is
because the Serbs/Israelis must never allow themselves to be
crushed and persecuted again.
</P>
<P>
   And how can the Serbs/Israelis deal with Albanian/Palestinian
``terrorism'' except with terror and retaliation?
</P>
<P>
   There is, indeed, an awful parallel between the dispossession of
the Palestinians, the massacre at Deir Yassin, the destruction of
Palestinian villages in 1948 and the Serb slaughters in Kosovo and
the destruction of Albanian villages.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Ariel Sharon _ of Sabra-Chatilla massacres fame - was
quick to see the parallels, arguing that autonomy for the Kosovo
Albanians might lead to a demand for autonomy or independence from
Israeli Arabs, and that an autonomous Kosovo might become ``a
center of Islamic terror.''
</P>
<P>
   But the parallels do not end there. Nor does hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Listen now to President Clinton, speaking a couple of weeks ago
about the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We...can't forget about their rights to go home,'' he said.
``The refugees belong in their own homes in their own land...(they
have) the right to return.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't that exactly _ the very words _ what every Palestinian
has been demanding since 1948? Isn't that what every surviving
Palestinian in Sabra and Chatilla wants?
</P>
<P>
   The words ``right of return'' are inscribed on every Palestinian
refugee's heart, printed in every Arab document on Palestinian
dispossession. For Pristina, read Haifa.
</P>
<P>
   And when, back in the Cold War, the Soviets realized that they
could not commit ground troops to fight for the Palestinians, they
supported their guerrillas, and funded and armed the rebel
movements of the Palestinian diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what the U.S. and NATO _ too frightened to
commit their soldiers to a land campaign _ are doing now with the
Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA are being given weapons, trained _
by Americans in Albania _ and supported by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Soviet leaders would once shake the hands of Nayef
Hawatmeh and George Habash and Yasser Arafat (in his previous
incarnation), so Madeleine Albright can shake the hand of Hisham
``the Snake'' Thaqi of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Soviet military commanders once praised the guerrilla
attacks of the PLO on Israel, so now British officers in Brussels
and London and the Pentagon's spokesman Ken Baker in Washington
praise the KLA's attacks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to see more NATO support for the KLA in the coming
days and weeks and months. No one will mention the Contras, of
course, or the Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   We can bomb from Aviano in Italy, feel good about hurting Serbs
and then go home and leave the Kosovo Albanians to their own
devices.
</P>
<P>
   That was pretty much the message on a bomb dropped near the
village of Ribinca, close to Vranje in southern Serbia, last week,
in a raid that injured two civilians.
</P>
<P>
   A handwritten message on the bomb casing read: ``Bad times.
Isn't it lovely? See you guys. I'm going home. Eric N, Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric, I fear, represents all of us. And in case NATO claims that
he doesn't exist, Shea may like to check the munitions code found
by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug: 30003 70 4 AS 4829 MFP 96214. &QL;

<P>
   At this moment, as I write this, some idiot will be penning a
letter, article or speech about how the NATO bombing of Serbia is
in some way related to Tuesday's Colorado school massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Violence, they will argue, begets violence. Others will blame
guns. Had Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold been armed with machetes or
knives, they could never have killed and wounded so many of their
fellow students. So they probably wouldn't have tried.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, but Eric and Dylan also had homemade pipe bombs. Where
did those come from? Almost certainly from the pages of the
Internet, where Randy from Idaho, or the Urban Terrorist's
homepage, will give any teenager all the information he needs to
blow up his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And this marketplace for the anonymous exchange and barter of
murderous information also sells fantasies of death and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   It was on this noticeboard that the boys posted their warning:
``Preparing for the big April 20th!! You'll all be sorry that
day!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they were rendered immune to the reality of what they
were planning to do as a consequence of long, crepuscular hours
spent at the keyboard, blasting punks and decapitating jerks to
earn record scores.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, real flesh may become confused with pixellated
gore and guts in the adolescent mind. And in computer games, of
course, when you're killed, you always come back.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures of the parents arriving, chalk-white and staring,
at Columbine High, also caught the great white limousines, and the
imagination supplied where they had been driven from: the large
houses, with lawns running down to the wide avenues.
</P>
<P>
   School massacres are a suburban phenomenon; a white phenomenon;
an illness of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine High (``a liberalish school with conservative
parents,'' says a friend of mine) is very competitive. Its motto is
``Stretch for Excellence,'' and its students, as it boasts, get
higher-than-Colorado-average grades in SATs and college entrance
exams.
</P>
<P>
   There are 35 clubs for students, five separate musical bands,
and the school won the state baseball championships in `87 and `91,
the soccer championship in `86 and `93, and were the 1997
basketball champs.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the school's social failures: the geeks, dweebs, weirdos
and nerds, who don't measure up or fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, classless America abounds with classless hierarchies.
Teachers may prefer the brainy kids, but socially it is still the
pretty ones and the athletic ones who are the most envied.
</P>
<P>
   Then come the bulk of the students, who get by. Then there are
the outcasts. They do not get voted ``Most Likely To Succeed,''
they will not become prom queens, they are not elected to, or
selected for, anything.
</P>
<P>
   And, when they graduate, they can anticipate this rejection
being repeated every time there is a class reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Here, with there being no material hardship, no money to fight
over, the emphasis is placed on difference. There isn't, therefore,
the solidarity that one might find among the students in an
inner-city school.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of glaring defiantly at the institutions that fail to
represent them or that repress them, the suburban school rebel's
target for hatred is the fellow student.
</P>
<P>
   And how might you best express this hatred? In the film
``Heathers,'' a decidedly Gothic Winona Ryder and her black-coated
sidekick Christian Slater do indeed take on the other kids.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they kill the preppy girls who have oppressed the
loners and the dweebs, and then they force two of the school jocks
to strip naked under a tree, and execute them, making it look like
a gay suicide pact. What a revenge that is!
</P>
<P>
   What it comes down to is this. Many of these kids have ceased to
have respect for others as human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In a sentimentalized culture, empathy actually means self-pity,
and to talk about the ``problems'' of others is, in reality, to
construct a box _ like the one on the bottom of ``The Jerry
Springer Show,'' into which to drop other people.
</P>
<P>
   Our difficulties are genuine and we demand help; those of
others, however, are simply risible, zoological, weird.
</P>
<P>
   And it must all start in relatively rich homes.
</P>
<P>
   I know that the desperation of my children for my time
represents the most terrible deficit in my life. I also learned a
long time ago that mental cruelty and neglect are not related to
the size of someone's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   The most wretched children that I have ever encountered were the
loveless kids of wealthy and competitive parents who were
disappointed in them.
</P>
<P>
   In America, it's worse. Many middle-class families never eat
together. A kid has a suite of rooms and every gadget, but
communicates with his mum by intercom. Many of the parents have no
idea what the kids want or who they are.
</P>
<P>
   You go to work, you earn the money, you come home late, and your
kid kills people. Or gets killed.
</P>
<P>
   Guns don't help, and Americans should do something about it, but
won't. Filmmakers who allow violence to seem cool and attractive
should examine their consciences. And we should criticize them much
more.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations like CNN, who offered ``uninterrupted live
coverage'' of events at Columbine High School, should consider
whether that isn't exactly what avenging dweebs want. They, too,
should be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers need to keep an eye on who is having a bad time, and be
ready to offer help.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, parents who have enough should ask how much more
they really need. Kids are kids once. That's it. They take their
values from us and what we do, not from what we preach.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the Internet we cannot prevent them from having
knowledge that we do not like, but we can help them to understand
what should be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   At a guess, I'd say understanding and discussion was what Eric
and Dylan didn't get enough of. &QL;

<P>
   At this moment, as I write this, some idiot will be penning a
letter, article or speech about how the NATO bombing of Serbia is
in some way related to Tuesday's Colorado school massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Violence, they will argue, begets violence. Others will blame
guns. Had Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold been armed with machetes or
knives, they could never have killed and wounded so many of their
fellow students. So they probably wouldn't have tried.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, but Eric and Dylan also had homemade pipe bombs. Where
did those come from? Almost certainly from the pages of the
Internet, where Randy from Idaho, or the Urban Terrorist's
homepage, will give any teenager all the information he needs to
blow up his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And this marketplace for the anonymous exchange and barter of
murderous information also sells fantasies of death and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   It was on this noticeboard that the boys posted their warning:
``Preparing for the big April 20th!! You'll all be sorry that
day!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they were rendered immune to the reality of what they
were planning to do as a consequence of long, crepuscular hours
spent at the keyboard, blasting punks and decapitating jerks to
earn record scores.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, real flesh may become confused with pixellated
gore and guts in the adolescent mind. And in computer games, of

   BELGRADE _ So now it's a ``command and control center'' is it?
</P>
<P>
   When I last walked through the door of No. 15 Uzicka Street _
targeted by NATO in the early hours of Thursday morning _ it
contained a large desk, 14,000 books, some fine paintings by Sava
Jovanovic and a brace of Persian carpets.
</P>
<P>
   It must have looked much the same when Her Majesty the Queen
visited President Tito here. And as it did when Winston Churchill
and his son Randolph dropped by to see the Grand Old Man of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Or when Nixon came to visit. And Lord Mountbatten. And U Thant
and Nehru and Indira Ghandi and the Queens of Holland, Belgium and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing which they assuredly were not shown _ and to
which even The Independent's correspondent was refused admission
seven years ago _ was Tito's ``Room of Ladies,'' containing a
series of nude statues and portraits of reclining girls which
reflected the interests of the priapic old dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Into this extraordinary shrine, we are now told, the Yugoslav
regime had installed a ``command and control center.''
</P>
<P>
   Was this computerized ``nerve center'' in the bedroom of the
two-story colonnaded villa? Or next to the library where the works
of Hegel nestled beside volumes of partisan-brigade history?
</P>
<P>
   Or in the old cinema where Tito enjoyed watching Richard Burton
playing the role of _ yes _ Marshal Tito? Or near the flocks of
wild birds shot by Tito and religiously stuffed for posterity?
</P>
<P>
   Or in the ``Room of Ladies?'' Or alongside the old boy's desk,
left as it was when Yugoslavia's Titan left work for the last time
for hospital and death?
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, President Slobodan Milosevic and his family had
moved into Tito's former residence a couple of years ago. And
equally inevitably, NATO attacked it Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The laser-guided bomb, dropped from a lone aircraft high over
Belgrade, exploded in the bedroom. And a few hours later, there was
Ken Bacon in the Pentagon, wearing his familiar spokesman's
bow-tie, telling us it was ``a command and control center.''
</P>
<P>
   I can believe almost anything of this war. I have no doubt that
NATO hates Milosevic. I can see why. But this looked to me very
much like an assassination attempt on a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Normally both Milosevic and his wife, Mira Markovic _ the
professor of Marxism who wrote a very angry letter to the British
Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, on Sunday _ and their children,
Marija and Marko, lived here, along with a one-and-a-half-year-old
grandson, also Marko.
</P>
<P>
   But they were wise enough to stay away on Wednesday night; after
all, NATO had fired Cruise missiles into the headquarters of both
Milosevic's and Mrs. Markovic's political parties a few hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It clearly wasn't a good night to spend in the old Tito villa,
renovated in somewhat spectacular style by the president and his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   No one I spoke to Thursday knew what Milosevic did with Tito's
desk or with the massive volume of snapshots I found in the house
seven years ago with the soporific title ``National Liberation Army
and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the couple's admiration for Tito, they must have been
kept. But where? In the basement? And what happened to Sava
Jovanovic's ``Portrait of a Girl'' which once stared wistfully down
on the library? Was it shredded by the bomb?
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange, pompous old house, built in the fashionable
middle-class 1930s suburb of Dedinje, with big square lawns and
straight military paths through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   You could see how it appealed to General Lohr, commanding
officer of the Wehrmacht's Army Group E, who moved in during
Germany's wartime occupation (one of Lohr's aides being a priggish
young intelligence officer from Austria, a certain Oberlieutenant
K. Waldheim.)
</P>
<P>
   And how it must have appealed to Tito when he moved in after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   One of his former secretaries had shown me around No 15. Uzicka
Street. By his desk, the hands of a clock were stopped at the
minute of his death.
</P>
<P>
   But already, the government had been deconstructing the Tito
myth, turning his ``25th of May Museum'' into an exhibition of
Serbian military history with frightful photographs of old Serbian
women being hanged by a grinning rabble of Austrian and Bulgarian
soldiery.
</P>
<P>
   Dust sheets half covered the junk of admiration which Tito had
collected: the hunting rifles from Churchill, Brezhnev and Zhukov,
the diamond-studded ashtray from Nasser, the coffee service from
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting rid of things so fast these days,'' the plump
and elderly retainer had puffed as we entered the residence seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what they will close next? We don't even know how
long this place will last. If Tito was alive today, he would not
have believed what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Too true, I muttered to myself Thursday as I puffed my own way
up the rainy hill towards the old Tito museum that lies behind No.
15.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens were overgrown. The wet grass was conquering the
concrete floor of the fountain. Graffiti was splashed over park
benches and walls.
</P>
<P>
   At the door of the museum, I was met by a Serb policeman. ``I am
sorry, the museum is closed,'' he said. And he shook his head in a
weary, amused way when I asked if there was any chance of taking a
look at what was left of No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   If I wanted to find the secretary who had shown me around all
those years ago, he added, I would have to remember her name and
apply in writing to the authorities. Raincaped, khaki figures
watched me from the trees.
</P>
<P>
   The only head of state to be wounded in action during the Second
World War was buried close to his residence and I asked the Serb
cop if I could take a peak at Tito's tomb, just in case the plain
concrete slab had cracked as the dictator _ 19 years dead _ turned
in his grave. The policeman shook his head with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could I find out if another tomb, the grave of Tito's young
Partisan mistress that lay in the garden of No. 15, survived the
NATO bombing. For Thursday the old man's home was as broken as his
dreams of Brotherhood and Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows what happened to Nasser's ashtray. Or Saddam
Hussein's coffee service. What on earth would Tito have made of Ken
Bacon's revelation of a ``command and control centre?''
</P>
<P>
   Best not to imagine. Another army, half a century past, had
tried to assassinate Tito. And the clock stopped here a long time
ago. &QL;

   I can believe almost anything of this war. I have no doubt that
NATO hates Milosevic. I can see why. But this looked to me very
much like an assassination attempt on a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Normally both Milosevic and his wife, Mira Markovic _ the
professor of Marxism who wrote a very angry letter to the British
Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, on Sunday _ and their children,
Marija and Marko, lived here, along with a one-and-a-half-year-old
grandson, also Marko.
</P>
<P>
   But they were wise enough to stay away on Wednesday night; after
all, NATO had fired Cruise missiles into the headquarters of both
Milosevic's and Mrs. Markovic's political parties a few hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It clearly wasn't a good night to spend in the old Tito villa,
renovated in somewhat spectacular style by the president and his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   No one I spoke to Thursday knew what Milosevic did with Tito's
desk or with the massive volume of snapshots I found in the house
seven years ago with the soporific title ``National Liberation Army
and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the couple's admiration for Tito, they must have been
kept. But where? In the basement? And what happened to Sava
Jovanovic's ``Portrait of a Girl'' which once stared wistfully down
on the library? Was it shredded by the bomb?
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange, pompous old house, built in the fashionable
middle-class 1930s suburb of Dedinje, with big square lawns and
straight military paths through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   You could see how it appealed to General Lohr, commanding
officer of the Wehrmacht's Army Group E, who moved in during
Germany's wartime occupation (one of Lohr's aides being a priggish
young intelligence officer from Austria, a certain Oberlieutenant
K. Waldheim.)
</P>
<P>
   And how it must have appealed to Tito when he moved in after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   One of his former secretaries had shown me around No 15. Uzicka
Street. By his desk, the hands of a clock were stopped at the
minute of his death.
</P>
<P>
   But already, the government had been deconstructing the Tito
myth, turning his ``25th of May Museum'' into an exhibition of
Serbian military history with frightful photographs of old Serbian
women being hanged by a grinning rabble of Austrian and Bulgarian
soldiery.
</P>
<P>
   Dust sheets half covered the junk of admiration which Tito had
collected: the hunting rifles from Churchill, Brezhnev and Zhukov,
the diamond-studded ashtray from Nasser, the coffee service from
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting rid of things so fast these days,'' the plump
and elderly retainer had puffed as we entered the residence seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what they will close next? We don't even know how
long this place will last. If Tito was alive today, he would not
have believed what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Too true, I muttered to myself Thursday as I puffed my own way
up the rainy hill towards the old Tito museum that lies behind No.
15.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens were overgrown. The wet grass was conquering the
concrete floor of the fountain. Graffiti was splashed over park
benches and walls.
</P>
<P>
   At the door of the museum, I was met by a Serb policeman. ``I am
sorry, the museum is closed,'' he said. And he shook his head in a
weary, amused way when I asked if there was any chance of taking a
look at what was left of No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   If I wanted to find the secretary who had shown me around all
those years ago, he added, I would have to remember her name and
apply in writing to the authorities. Raincaped, khaki figures
watched me from the trees.
</P>
<P>
   The only head of state to be wounded in action during the Second
World War was buried close to his residence and I asked the Serb
cop if I could take a peak at Tito's tomb, just in case the plain
concrete slab had cracked as the dictator _ 19 years dead _ turned
in his grave. The policeman shook his head with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could I find out if another tomb, the grave of Tito's young
Partisan mistress that lay in the garden of No. 15, survived the
NATO bombing. For Thursday the old man's home was as broken as his
dreams of Brotherhood and Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows what happened to Nasser's ashtray. Or Saddam
Hussein's coffee service. What on earth would Tito have made of Ken
Bacon's revelation of a ``command and control centre?''
</P>
<P>
   Best not to imagine. Another army, half a century past, had
tried to assassinate Tito. And the clock stopped here a long time
ago. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this ``mission creep?'' The famous phrase from the Vietnam
War has come back to haunt the leaders of the post-Vietnam
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Are we witnessing a gradual, irresistible extension of the war
aims in the Balkans, the kind of ratchet mechanism that drew the
U.S. into a massive land war which no one intended?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it bluff? Is British Prime Minister Tony Blair's
incremental but definite tightening of the terms of engagement in
Kosovo designed to frighten Serb President Slobodan Milosevic into
suing for peace?
</P>
<P>
   Or _ a third possibility _ is a ground war what Tony Blair
intended all along, but could not admit to because the NATO
partners would not wear it?
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that, as Thomas Sutcliffe, our parliamentary
observer, put it this week, the British government is engaged in a
game of Grandmother's footsteps. Every time Grandmother turns
around, the prospect of ground troops being deployed against the
Serbian army seems to have crept closer, and yet nobody will admit
to having moved.
</P>
<P>
   But moved they have. Blair began the war by promising that
``there is no question of NATO ground forces being sent in unless
it is to police an agreed political settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, he said that forces could go in with the
refugees in order to ``lead them back into their homes in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday this week, the wording became more active: ``There
will be an international military force that will go in to secure
the land for the people to whom it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the House of Commons on Wednesday he said: ``The
difficulties of a land force invasion of Kosovo against an
undegraded Serb military machine are formidable.''
</P>
<P>
   So, while NATO troops will not fight their way into Kosovo, they
may yet drive in against a degraded military machine.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons for this slow, much-denied shift in
British, American and _ by next week probably _ NATO policy, it is
to be welcomed. The deployment of ground forces should have been
planned and threatened a year ago, but it is nonetheless essential
now.
</P>
<P>
   However, our leaders should be taking Britain and its NATO
allies into this thing without creeping around the point.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguity is hardly the right way to mobilize public opinion.
Nor should the peoples of NATO countries be soft-soaped about the
consequences of setting up a protectorate in Kosovo against
Serbia's will.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions from NATO that troops will be able to drive into
Kosovo without opposition from a bombed-out and demoralized Serb
army are wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, in his propaganda counterstrike Thursday, said:
``When our soldiers are dying, they know why they are dying. They
are dying for their homeland, for their fatherland. And for what
will your soldiers die, 5,000 miles from home?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they will be dying to put an end to ``ethnic cleansing,''
for a democratic, peaceful Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But to defeat Serbs fighting for their fatherland will require
leadership. Fighting a war by multinational committee, which is
what NATO is, requiring a consensus among 19 nations, demands tact
and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   But, just as Blair has insisted that Milosevic does not have a
veto on NATO action, nor should Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks may be NATO's weakest link, sympathetic to the cause
of their traditional ally, orthodox Christian Serbia, but they will
not leave NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Milosevic has so far acted in such a way as to keep
NATO together, while Russia is unwilling to move beyond its stance
of bellicose neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's leaders must give a lead to their peoples this weekend.
Public opinion is less of a constraint on Blair than on any of his
fellow leaders, and he is under more of an obligation to come
clean.
</P>
<P>
   He should prepare us for a ground war not by stealth, but by
saying clearly that British lives will have to be risked at some
time soon. And he should come to Parliament and win a vote for it. &QL;

   BUDAPEST _ Blocked by rubble and its bridges destroyed by NATO
jets, Serbia's stretch of the Blue Danube is no longer the romantic
waterway immortalized by Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   International shipping through Europe's main waterway has
halted, as boats are unable to navigate past the river bed at the
Serbian town of Novi Sad. Piles of debris lie underwater after NATO
air strikes destroyed the city's three Danube bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Even if NATO strikes against Serbia stop in the near future,
international river traffic on the Danube is unlikely to resume
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal year about 10 millions tons of freight travel the
river through Yugoslavia, but nothing is moving now.
</P>
<P>
   The blocked Danube is an economic disaster for Europe's shipping
freight companies, and could cause knock-on effects on the
countries it flows through if the conflict continues. Some are
already preparing to fire workers now that the river is
unnavigable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts estimate that even if the conflict is settled soon,
shipping on the Danube could not be revived this year,'' said Peter
Balas, deputy state secretary at the Hungarian Economics Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   NATO destroyed the first bridge at Novi Sad, 45 miles north of
Belgrade, on April 1, early in its campaign against Serbia. The
last bridge was hit on Wednesday. Earlier NATO hit the bridge at
Smederevo, east of Belgrade. NATO jets have hit a total of six
bridges on the river.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the bridges at Novi Sad has left dozens of
ships and tons of freight trapped on the river, causing a
regional-wide blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In Hungary, goods have been loaded onto trains instead, but in
Romania 60 ships bound for Austria, Germany and Hungary remain
blocked at ports on the Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time there are fears that the NATO bombardment of
petrochemical factories in Serbia could trigger an environmental
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials claimed that the bombing of the Pancevo refinery,
northeast of Belgrade, was causing a cross-border environmental
hazard that could spread along the length of the Danube.
</P>
<P>
   But the blocking of the Danube has more than economic and
environmental implications.
</P>
<P>
   The Danube is a living symbol of the continent, predating and
outlasting the empires, ideologies and ruling armies that have
stomped across its banks, whether Roman, Magyar, Turkish, Nazi or
Communist.
</P>
<P>
   At 1,767 miles long, the Danube is second only to the Volga
among European rivers. Eulogized in countless songs and poems, it
starts in Germany, and then cuts through Austria, Slovakia, Hungary
down to Serbia, and Romania to the Black Sea, binding the continent
together and linking western and central Europe with the Balkans. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In Vienna it is tucked away in a drab suburb, but in the Slovak
capital, Bratislava, it widens out, thundering underneath the ugly
Communist-era bridge commemorating the anti-Nazi Slovak National
Uprising in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps in Budapest, a city built on its banks, that it
reaches its most panoramic sweep, highlighted by the series of
graceful bridges that arch over its rushing waters.
</P>
<P>
   Novi Sad, the northern Serbian city that has now become one of
NATO's main targets, was once an important Hapsburg river post and
is still retains the architectural grandeur of the Hapsburg era.
</P>
<P>
   Capital of the region known as Vojvodina, the multi-ethnic,
cosmopolitan city is home to many ethnic minorities such as
Hungarians, Czechs and Romanians. Its bridges symbolize the city,
as Catholic central Europe's gateway to the Orthodox lands of the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges have a special resonance in these lands. The Nobel-prize
winning Yugoslav novelist Ivo Andric's best-known work is entitled
``Bridge on the Drina,'' a hymn to the multi-ethnic tolerance that
once characterized Bosnia, and whose last vestiges live on _ just _
in Vojvodina.
</P>
<P>
   In Novi Sad they recite an old poem about the city's former
glory days: ``The glorious town, it lies by hill and valley, The
bridge divides the Danube, boats float down.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will be a long time now before the boats float down the
Danube through Novi Sad again. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ When 24-year-old construction worker Gilberto Gonzalez
moved to Tucson from Mexico five years ago, it was difficult
staying in touch with his mother, who lives in a small village near
Guadalajara. She did not own a telephone and had to walk two blocks
to her sister's house to receive his calls.
 &HT;    So last September, when he heard at a swap meet about a service
that places telephones in the homes of Mexican relatives, he jumped
at it. It only took about a month for his mother to get the phone
line in Mexico and Gonzalez pays the bill back in the United
States. ``It's much cheaper,'' he says. ``I can talk to my mother
three or four times a month and it only costs as a pleasant ring
for Telmex-Sprint Communications. The joint venture between the two
telecommunications giants has been offering the novel plan to
Mexican-Americans since winning Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) approval to start operations last August. Victory came with a
price. Competitors AT&AMP;T and MCI/Worldcom were partially successful
in arguing that their attems to break into the Mexican
long-distance market had been hindered by Telefonos de Mexico
(Telmex), the country's very dominant carrier. The FCC gave a
provisional green light to the partners based on the condition that
AT&AMP;T and MCI/Worldcom be granted the same level of access to the
market in Mexico. ``This isn't about not having competition,'' says
AT&AMP;T's Dianne Bernez, the company's point guard on the issue.
``It's about insuring level playing fields.''
 &HT;    All players are jockeying for a share of the world's
second-biggest binational telephone market. Callers chat up 1.8
billion minutes a year between Mexico and the United States, more
talking between any two countries except Canada and the United
States. These figures are more impressive Mexico's low telephone
penetration is taken into account. Despite modernization efforts,
fewer than one in 10 Mexicans have a telephone _ nearly all of them
wired to Telmex. By tapping Mexican-Americans to cover the costs of
providing a line to their family members in M big piece of the
business in the process.
 &HT;    The twosome is off to a fast start. The cross-border alliance
has spent $7 million on a flashy Spanish-language advertising
campaign, promotional booths in Mexican grocery stores, even
`fotonovelas,' or short picture books describing the service,
distributed at fairs, rodeos and soccer tournaments. ``Mexico en
Linea'' launched in Tucson in August and Phoenix in September. The
calling plan then rolled out in El Paso; San Anton and Fresno,
California, in October; and Houston; Dallas; and Los Angeles in
February. Marketing chief Javier Palomarez won't reveal the exact
number of customers he's been able to capture, but he claims the
figure is in the tens of thousands of paying clients. ``We've
surpassed every one of our sales goals,'' he says. Next stop: New
Mexico, Illinois and possibly the Northeast. The company plans to
move its headquarters to San Diego to be closer to its largest
customer base.
 &HT;    New products are on the way, too. First up: personal toll-free
numbers that reverse calling charges at rates significantly lower
than calling collect. Then comes ``Dial One,'' which will charge
lower rates for calls to the telephone numbers the consumer uses
most (similar to MCI's ``Friends and Family'' promotion in the
U.S.).
 &HT;    The cross-border, cross-company span has created problems
typical to two big companies wng together _ like getting computer
systems to communicate _ as well as atypical obstacles: locating
relatives' homes in remote Mexican villages and explaining the
reversed billing system to customers.
 &HT;    The biggest hitch has been melding two wildly different
corporate cultures. Telmex, the 50-year-old, former state monopoly,
is renowned for deplorable customer treatment; Sprint, the scrappy
upstart that has become the third-biggest provider of U.S.
long-distance calls, won its success on the strength of ser, with
four straight customer relations awards from JD Power &AMP; Associates
to prove it. The marriage of unequals has caused friction.
``There's a lot of dialogue, a lot of playing intermediary,'' says
Palomarez, a Mexican-American from south Texas who left U.S. brewer
Adolph Coors Co. to join the telecom. ``I log a lot of airplane
time to Mexico City.''
 &HT;    The duo's regulatory problems, however, are not over. Last
November, the FCC filed a show-cause order demanding that Telmex
prove it was complying with conditions that allowed its ethe United
States. The main sticking point is the high price the Mexican phone
company charges to complete calls from the United States to Mexico
and U.S. regulators are signaling that they are not happy with
progress to date. ``Telmex has to explain why it has not taken
certain actions,'' says Sherille Ismail, a senior attorney at the
FCC. ``We let them in here and held up our end of the bargain. Now
they have to hold up their end.'' The FCC is expectto come back
with its final decision sometime this spring.
 &HT;    Could the FCC eventually boot Telmex-Sprint out? Fred Voit, a
senior analyst at the Yankee Group, doubts it. ``How are they going
to de-subscribe all these people?'' he asks. ``Once they're in,
they're in.''

   HOUSTON _ Cuando Gilberto Gonzalez, obrero de la construccion de
24 anos, se mudo a Tucson hace cinco anos procedente de Mexico, le
era dificil mantenerse en contacto con su madre, que vive en un
pequeno pueblo cerca de Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   De modo que sado septiembre, cuando Gilberto oyo hablar de un
servicio que coloca telefonos en las casas de los parientes
mexicanos, aprovecho la ocasion. Solo un mes despues le instalaron
el telefono en Mexico. Gonzalez paga la cuenta en Estados Unidos.
``Es mucho mas barato,'' afirma. ``Puedo hablar con mi madre tres o
cuatro al mes y solo me cuesta US$12.''
</P>
<P>
   Eso es lo que quiere escuchar Telmex-Sprint Communications. La
empresa conjunta entre los dos gigantes de las telecomunicaciones
ofrece desde agosto el novedoso plan. Pero la victoria tuvo un
precio. AT&AMP;T y MCI/Worldcom alcanzaron un exito parcial al alegar
que Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), que domina el sector en ese pais,
habia obstaculizado la entrada de las dos empresas en el mercado
mexicano de larga distancia. La Comision Federal de Comunicaciones
(FCC) de Estados Unidos dio una luz verde provisional a los socios
con la condicion de que AT&AMP;T y MCI/Worldcom tuvieran el mismo grado
de acceso al mercado mexicano. ``No se trata de que no haya
competencia,'' dice Dianne Bernez, especialista de la compania en
el asunto. ``Se trata de establecer una equidad en las reglas del
juego.''
</P>
<P>
   Todos los jugadores buscan una participacion en el segundo
mercado telefonico binacional del mundo: 1.800 millones de minutos
al ano entre Mexico y Estados Unidos, cifra que solo supera el
volumen de llamadas entre Canada y Estados Unidos. Estas cifras son
mas impresionantes si se tiene en cuenta la baja penetracion
telefonica en Mexico. A pesar de los esfuerzos de modernizacion,
menos de uno de cada diez mexicanos tiene telefono, y casi todos
estan conectados a Telmex. Con su plan, Telmex-Sprint espera
incrementar el volumen de llamadas y quedarse con una gran porcion
del negocio.
</P>
<P>
   La empresa ha tenido un inicio espectacular. La alianza ha
invertido US$7 millones en una llamativa campana publicitaria en
espanol, con espacios promocionales en los mercados mexicanos e
incluso fotonovelas que describen el servicio y que se distribuyen
en ferias, rodeos y partidos de futbol. ``Mexico en Linea''se
inauguro en Tucnix en septiembre. El plan de llamadas se extendio
en octubre a El Paso, San Antonio y Fresno, en California; y a
Houston, Dallas y Los Angeles en febrero. Javier Palomarez,
director de mercadeo, afirma que ha captado decenas de miles de
clientes. ``Hemos superado todos nuestros oos de venta,'' apunta.
Los proximos territorios: Nuevo Mexico, Illinois y posiblemente el
Noreste. La compania planea trasladar su sede a San Diego para
estar mas cerca de su enorme clientela.
</P>
<P>
   Tambien se lanzaran nuevos productos. Primero: numeros
personales sin costo que revierten los cargos por llamadas a
tarifas mucho mas bajas que las de cobro revertido. Luego viene
Dial One''' que cobrara tarifas mas bajas por las llamadas a los
numeros telefonicos a el consumidor llama con mas frecuencia.
</P>
<P>
   La expansion de la alianza a ambos lados de la frontera ha
creado problemas propios de dos grandes companias que trabajan
juntas, como la obtencion de sistemas de computadoras para
comunicarse, asi como obstaculos atipicos: localizar los domicilios
de los parientes en remotos pueblos mexicanos y explicarles el
sistema de facturacion revertida a los clientes.
</P>
<P>
   La dificultad mayor ha sido unir dos culturas empresariales
completamente e su servicio, y para probarlo exhibe cuatro premios
consecutivos en la categoria de relaciones con clientes, otorgados
por JD Power &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Pero este desigual matrimonio ha causado fricciones. ``Hay
muchas conversaciones, muchas mediaciones,'' senala Palomarez, un
mexicanoamericano del sur de Texas que paso de la cervecera
estadounidense Adolph Coors Co. a las telecomunicaciones. ``Vuelo
mucho a la Ciudad de Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Sin embargo, los problemas del binomio con las regulaciones
estan lejos de haber concluido. El pasado noviembre, la FCC exigio
que Telmex probara que estaba cumpliendo las condiciones que le
permitieron su entrada en Estados Unidos.
</P>
<P>
   El punto mas cuestionable es el alto precio que la telefonica
mexicana cobra para realizar llamadas de Estados Unidos a Mexico, y
los reguladores estadounidenses no estan contentos con lo que se ha
progresado hastaecha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telmex tiene que explicar por que no ha dado ciertos pasos,''
dice Sherille Ismail, abogada de la FCC ``Los dejamos entrar y
cumplimos nuestra parte del acuerdo. Ahora ellos tienen que cumplir
la suya.'' La FCC debe emitir su decision final muy pronto.
</P>
<P>
   Podria la FCC romper la alianza Telmex-Sprint? Fred Voit,
analista del Yankee Group, lo duda. ``Como van a quitar de la lista
a tantos suscriptores?'' comenta. ``Cuando entran, es para
quedarse.''

LITTLETON AND KOSOVO WILL LEAVE INDELIBLE WOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all seen photographs and videotape of the bedraggled,
bewildered refugees being bulldozed out of Kosovo like toxic waste
and the startled Littleton high school students fleeing the fierce
incoherence of death's booted march through the routine of a
Colorado spring morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And we have tried to imagine so much pain, heartache and panic,
coagulated like the blood of hunted animals. We have tried to
envisage how both Kosovars and Coloradans _ though facing different
disasters _ can reclaim uprooted, terrified, untethered lives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine what that will be like. I know only that even
the common griefs of lives lived in relative peace never fully go
away, that even isolated from war and unpredictable, run-amok
violence, we can experience wounds so profound that they change us
forever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I recently rediscovered the breath-taking nature of this truth
in the midst of e-mail conversation with my three sisters. We are,
except geographically, very close. One sister lives in California,
one in Illinois, one in North Carolina. So we talk almost daily
through cyberspace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recently my oldest sister mentioned that the day before had been
the birthday of her first baby. The doomed little girl lasted less
than an hour in New York City in 1961 before succumbing to
appalling birth defects that later research showed a prescription
drug had caused. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was a high school sophomore then. I have only a foggy
remembrance of the birth and death. Somehow it happened outside my
physical and (apparently) emotional space, so I have no details in
memory from which to reconstruct it. But our recent e-mail suddenly
brought back vibrantly hurtful, piercingly clear memories from my
two older sisters, one the mother of that dead child, the other now
a registered nurse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I want to share with you some of what they wrote, not because
their story is unique or that you should feel any vicarious grief
about the loss of my first niece. Rather, I want you to notice how
deeply this fairly common kind of bereavement has marked these two
women. Then, by contrast, imagine how indelibly the refugees in the
Balkans and the students in Littleton will be scarred. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My nurse sister says she ``came home for lunch from school and
Mom told me that the baby had died. I don't remember Mom crying. I
knew that I could not cry. I just didn't understand the message
`the baby was dead.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After lunch she walked the half a block back to school and
``wished I had somewhere else to go.'' But she went to her first
afternoon class, biology, and ``as I sat at the lab table in the
back of the room I contemplated the birth and death of the little
girl. . . I began to cry. I had no clue where the tears came from,
who they were for, what I was doing in class.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The teacher ``came to the back of the class, put his hands on my
shoulders and asked me if I were OK. No one in the whole world had
ever done that. It mattered to him that I was OK. I told him what
was wrong. He rubbed my shoulders a little and asked if I'd like to
leave the room for awhile. I said, `No.' I could not leave the only
place on earth that anyone had ever acknowledged my sadness.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The clarity of her memory stuns me. As do the equally distinct
memories of our sister: ``When I awoke after the breach birth _
when I knew several times I was going to die _ I could hear them
screaming at me. A nurse was sitting beside me. She told me the
baby lived for 45 minutes and it was better that she was gone. I
will always remember the eerie purple light and her kindness when
she held my hand.'' When my sister's once-bearded husband appeared
in her distressed vision he had shaved and ``I did not know who he
was.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks my sister was back at the Juilliard School of
Music, where she was a pipe organ major, for final exams and a
juried recital. She received a high grade ``but I was a zombie and
devastated. I could not make the enormous black hole in my heart go
away.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If one death can mark two women so irrevocably, what I'm forced
to conclude is that the Balkans and Littleton are full of people
who can never make the black holes in their own hearts vanish. It's
not that they can never know joy. It's that even in times of
elation they will carry, as permanent legacies, memories of these
evil, abhorrent days of unrequited bleeding. &QL;

NEUROLOGISTS LOOK AT 'ALTERNATIVE' MIGRAINE REMEDIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most neurologists are skeptical about alternative therapies for
migraines, but a careful review of the literature and clinical
evidence might convince them otherwise, a headache specialist
reported at a recent conference on headaches in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it is not widely known, there is evidence supporting
the use of magnesium and riboflavin (vitamin B2) for migraine,''
said Dr. Alexander Mauskop, associate professor of clinical
neurology at the State University of New York/Downstate Medical
Center in Brooklyn and director of the New York Headache Center in
New York. ``These therapies are worth trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnesium deficiency has long been suspected to play a part in
migraine, with studies showing that between 30 percent to 50
percent of sufferers are deficient in this element, according to
Mauskop, who spoke at the 11th Annual Symposium on the Treatment of
Headaches and Facial Pain sponsored by the New York Headache
Foundation and the Eastern Pain Association.
</P>
<P>
   Magnesium deficiency can cause blood-vessel spasm, leading to
migraine, he explained. The element also helps block pain messages
from being sent and received along the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Migraine sufferers may be deficient in magnesium because they
don't eat enough dark green, leafy vegetables, or they may also be
depleted because of stress, according to the New York specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say that stress contributes to their migraines,
this is one possible mechanism for that, because stress depletes
magnesium, which then leads to more headaches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mauskop said that daily supplements of 400 milligrams of of
magnesium, given orally or by injection, can lead to a decrease in
the frequency of migraine headaches after three to four weeks, and,
in some cases, can actually relieve a migraine in progress.
Injecting the element is often more effective because it is not
easily absorbed into the body, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism by which riboflavin, or vitamin B2 supplements,
relieve migraine is not well understood, but a daily megadose of
400 milligrams may bring some relief after two to four months,
according to Mauskop.
</P>
<P>
   A herbal supplement of 100 milligrams of feverfew has also been
proven effective in two small, double-blind studies, he added.
Injections of botulism toxin, which are primarily used to treat
wrinkles, have also been shown to reduce headache because they
cause muscle paralysis, Mauskop added.
</P>
<P>
   He said he recognizes that alternative therapies are sometimes
criticized for diverting attention from conventional treatments.
``Some people argue that it will divert people's effort toward
something that may not be effective, and costs time and money,'' he
said. ``I don't really think that's the case, because most people
would rather spend a little time and money rather than taking drugs
that can have serious side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients should know that magnesium taken on an empty stomach
can sometimes cause diarrhea, and patients with kidney problems
should not take large amounts of magnesium, Mauskop warned.
</P>
<P>
   Another headache specialist agreed that alternative therapies
have a role in treating migraines. ``I'm a firm believer that many
of the alternative therapies for migraine have a place, and are
time-honored because they work,'' said Dr. Roger Cady, director of
the Headache Care Center in Springfield, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Cady said that alternative therapies, particularly dietary
supplements and lifestyle changes, are a part of migraine
management in which patients can take an active role _ and should
not be turned to as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, that is what often happens, which means that
alternative therapies are often tried only on a very recalcitrant
population,'' he said. Cady said that he has had success in
treating migraines both with magnesium and riboflavin supplements,
and urged physicians to look at alternative therapies as
complementary to other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two approaches are not incompatible,'' Cady said. ``You
can achieve a lot of success with daily supplements, but if a
patient then gets a bad headache, most of them would welcome a
prescription medicine to get them out of it,'' he added.

   I'm too long in the tooth to have been impressed by the concept
of the doctor's mystique. I remember once being asked by a mother
whether, in general, Tylenol or aspirin was safer for children. I
discussed the pros and cons and ended with my opinion that Tylenol
was better. Next time the mother was in my office with a feverish
child, she said she was there because the illness hadn't responded
to aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were talking about this last month,'' I said,
``and agreed Tylenol was safer?'' She sniffed and said, ``You said
that but I asked my cleaning lady and she said aspirin was
better.''
</P>
<P>
   We may be losing our hold on the public, this beneficent hold
that has allowed some doctors to work near-miracles over the last
few centuries. It's good that we're off the pedestal and can deal
with patients with the trappings removed.
</P>
<P>
   But the American public seems to be going too far _ not just in
its rejection of things medical but in its renunciation of common
sense, too.
</P>
<P>
   So we hear a number _ I believe I read somewhere 60 percent _ of
Americans believe that something weird happened at Roswell, N.M.,
and that UFOs really landed there; and we're told by the Associated
Press that nearly three of four Americans believe a conspiracy was
definitely or probably behind the assassination of President
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, junk science is espoused by the legal profession and
medical use of marijuana is embraced by five more states following
the wacky lead two years ago by my state, California. On
reflection, maybe it's not doctors who are losing their clout; it's
the public losing its marbles.
</P>
<P>
   And as I walk down the aisle at our supermarket I pass bottles
on the shelf that apparently allow weight loss without any effort.
The labels read Ultra Burn, Fat Burners, Pounds Off, Metabolift,
Thinz, PhenSafe, ZeroFat and Chroma Slim.
</P>
<P>
   It would be bad enough if this array of bottles was in a
pharmacy, but it's in a supermarket and, beyond, with shelves
groaning, is the herbal medicine department at hand for all age
groups from ``baby boomers obsessed with hormones and hair loss''
to ``malady-rich matrons.''
</P>
<P>
   All those weight-loss bottles confirm the clarion call of
today's America: ``Something For Nothing! Results Without Effort!
Perfection Makes Perfect!'' And they make it more understandable
why our patients don't listen to us as much as they used to _ the
alternatives are so much more attractive. Indeed, we're losing our
way with many patients because we don't meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is our fault. We don't listen enough. We address what
we think is important without necessarily considering what the
patient is concerned with. We set bad examples, ourselves, by being
overweight and not exercising, sometimes even smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly we're at fault for not recognizing many of our
patients have changed -- and we haven't.

BON VOYAGE, INTERNET STOCKS!  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif. Mass.)   (Eds: The (star) in the word E(star)Trade should be replaced with
the symbol)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines the phrase
``miss the boat'' as ``to blunder badly by failing to grasp an
opportunity in time.'' A 1999 edition of that dictionary might add,
``e.g., to have missed buying certain Internet stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Real or possible losses in those stocks are no longer what keep
many middle-aged investors on edge. Rather, it is the huge gains we
could have had.
</P>
<P>
   All the more aggravating, some of us have friends who helped
found those Internet companies and told us about them early on.
Volatile weeks like the one just past, rather than scaring us away,
merely draw more of our attention to those shares.
</P>
<P>
   Market chatter has grown, turning simple social gatherings in my
neighborhood into local versions of ``Wall Street Week.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the chatter extends to poolside among members of the
Westminster Whales Masters Swim Team. They include Charles Brewer,
chief executive of Mindspring Enterprises, an Internet service
provider, who has been in the club since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, when he was getting the company off the
ground, Brewer would often join other members for breakfast after
practice on Saturdays and talk about the great idea he had. Some
club members were impressed enough that when the company eventually
went public in 1996 _ for $2.66 a share, adjusted for splits _ they
dove in.
</P>
<P>
   But many other members, fearful of betting on technology
ventures they didn't understand, held back. Now the stock is
trading in the $90s, and those who didn't buy are having second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Wetta, 43, said Mindspring hadn't fit in with his
conservative strategy. Chuck Courtois, 36, steered clear because he
didn't know much about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Maslia, 37, said she had thought the investment was too
risky. ``I didn't completely understand what it was about,'' she
said. ``It just didn't seem like a real thing. I kept saying that I
should do it, I should do it, but I always felt it was as high as
it would go. But it kept going up and up and I keep regretting that
I didn't buy any.''
</P>
<P>
   In my own recent experience, at a neighborhood Christmas party
last year, a man who runs an initial-public-offering fund suggested
that I invest in E(star)Trade, the on-line brokerage firm. I
ignored the advice and the stock has since shot up fivefold.
</P>
<P>
   Or there was the time in January, when I was standing in the
checkout line at an electronics store and everyone around me had
boxes for cable Internet service under their arms. I looked into
the company providing that service _ the At Home Corp. _ but didn't
buy. The stock of the company doubled in three months.
</P>
<P>
   I feel like a dope. But when I recently bemoaned my slow
investment reflexes to William Gartner, a professor of
entrepreneurship at the University of Southern California, he said
I should instead feel fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in the Internet is nothing more than a gamble, he
said. ``A company rarely went public before it turned a profit, but
now we have companies who are going public without profits or any
prospects of having profits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet scramble reminds him of the 1980s frenzy for disk
drive makers, fed by venture capitalists and by analysts who
predicted stunning rates of profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   William A. Sahlman, a Harvard Business School professor, said
that at its peak, about 120 companies were in the business. Of
these, 12 went public, with a market capitalization of $5.4 billion
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many producers, prices for the drives tumbled, and
the profit projections became jokes. By 1985, the market
capitalization of those 12 companies had fallen to $1.4 billion.
Today, only a handful of the 120 companies still exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise that competitive pressure will make it difficult for
all these Internet companies to succeed, and, like the disk drive
industry, there will be a high mortality rate,'' he said. ``I think
it's a sucker's bet. In a poker game, if after 30 minutes you don't
know who the sucker is, then it's probably you.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong words, but warnings usually are. And if you think you
really missed the boat on the Internet, then you have the luxury of
sitting back and seeing just how seaworthy the new ship will be.
</P>

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Shigeru Miyamoto can hardly walk through the
streets of this city unnoticed. Entering a restaurant here last
month with a group of other executives, he was immediately
recognized by a waitress and asked for his autograph, one of 50 he
would give that day.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those autographs were even given to employees at the
United States offices of Nintendo in Redmond, Wash., where he had
visited earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Miyamoto, 46, remains surprised by his American celebrity. Back
home at Nintendo's headquarters in Kyoto, Japan, he enjoys greater
anonymity. ``They do not ask me for my autograph,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Are you over 40 and unfamiliar with Miyamoto? Ask your children.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Miyamoto is general manager of entertainment
analysis and development at the Nintendo Co., the $4.5 billion
Japanese giant. Unofficially, to most video game software
developers and aficionados, he is a deity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the god of gaming,'' said Jennifer Pahlka, director of
the Game Developers Conference, an industry trade show, which gave
Miyamoto its first lifetime achievement award in March, the
occasion of his visit to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, he is the creator of more than 60 Nintendo
game titles that have brought the company billions in sales. During
his 22-year tenure with the company, which began around the turn of
the century as a maker of playing cards, he has almost
single-handedly made Nintendo the largest seller of video games in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   His games, like the Zelda series, Super Mario Brothers and
Donkey Kong, are known as much for their complexity as for their
artistry. In his vivid, three-dimensional settings, ocean waves
swell and background sunset colors unfurl, making other developers'
scenes appear static.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry full of 20-something geniuses with day-glo orange
hair, earrings and ponytails, Miyamoto's creative longevity is
unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   By Japanese corporate standards, Miyamoto is a nonconformist.
His hair falls below his shirt collar, and he often works in a
sports jacket, jeans, comfortable suede shoes and a Mickey Mouse
tie.
</P>
<P>
   He says he likes to play the guitar and keeps a banjo near his
desk. The desk, he adds, is piled with video games and other toys,
in a space separated only by a low partition from the rest of his
design team. He has no thoughts of ever working for another
company.
</P>
<P>
   And in an industry where sales growth is traditionally driven by
new consoles, the popularity of his games has helped Nintendo,
which has not introduced a new console since 1996, remain the
second-largest console maker, behind Sony.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Nintendo can afford to watch its rivals slug it out.
Last year, half of the 10 best-selling video games were Nintendo's.
Two were based on characters initially developed by Miyamoto,
including, the Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time, which was released
in late November.
</P>
<P>
   The game, a prequel to a Zelda title released in 1997, has
already sold 2.6 million copies in the United States. Sales of
100,000 are considered a success by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Miyamoto's presence at the game developers conference, however,
signals that Nintendo is not relaxing. Lacking the buzz a new game
system creates, Nintendo is using Miyamoto and his designs, both
regularly featured in video game players' magazines, to its
advantage. He also helps lure the best and brightest game
developers to put their talents at Nintendo's disposal.
</P>
<P>
   While Miyamoto, who has been hitting home runs for almost 20
years, shows no signs of stopping or changing his style, Nintendo
is looking to other developers for the faster-paced games necessary
to counter rivals. ``We do have Miyamoto, but we do need some of
those edgier games to fill out the library,'' said Jim Merrick, a
top executive at Nintendo of America.
</P>
<P>
   Miyamoto regards game design as an artistic endeavor in which
each project takes years, not as a way of delivering cheap thrills.
And though many video game players scream for gory shoot-em ups,
crashing meteors and body-slamming wrestling, Miyamoto refuses to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Kyoto as one of three children of a homemaker and
an English teacher (Miyamoto understands English but prefers to
speak in Japanese), he loved to sketch cartoon characters and
wander about. He still likes visiting new places, buying a map at a
local bookstore and then exploring. And he cannot pass by a museum
without having a look, even on business trips.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating with a degree in industrial design from the
Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts and Crafts, he was
hired in 1977 as Nintendo's first staff artist, and initially
designed posters and arcade games. In 1981, he created the Donkey
Kong arcade game, and later the video game, and in 1985, the first
Super Mario game, featuring an Italian plumber with a droopy
mustache. That character alone has generated more than $5 billion
in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Miyamoto, however, receives no royalties from his characters or
the other products they inspire. He says he lives modestly in
Kyoto, with his wife, Yasuko, and their two children, a 13-year-old
boy and 11-year old girl. He rides a bicycle to work.
</P>
<P>
   His children play video games, he says, but are not avid fans.
They are perhaps unique in having a father who plays the games
better than they do. And Miyamoto does not use them as a test
market. ``I am always making efforts to create something that I
want to play myself,'' he said. So far, his inner child has not
missed.
</P>
<P>
   His inspiration comes from life itself: the landscapes he sees
in museums, the sliding doors of his parents' home, a cave he
explored as a child. And Miyamoto exudes a childlike fascination
with a new sight or experience, be it art or the fried calamari he
tried at the restaurant here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his huge success, he shows no sign of losing his humble
perspective. Asked by a parent at the developers conference to
offer video game advice to his 11-year old son, he signs this
message instead: ``Play outside on sunny days.''

TARRED AND FEATHERED, WITH HUMOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Thank goodness for humor. Sometimes when life on the
job is at its most tense, when a situation is at its bleakest, a
witty word and a good laugh come along to save the day. Readers
offered so many cases in point that a second serving of their
stories became obligatory.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 years ago, early in the public relations career of
Sanford Teller of New York City, he worked as a junior account
executive in the Manhattan office of a large out-of-town
advertising and marketing company.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to impress, he usually arrived before 8 a.m. and remained
until well after 6 in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``One morning, after breakfast with a client, I got to the
office at 9:30,'' he writes. ``As I passed the desk, the
receptionist wished me a good morning and informed that I had to
sign `the book.'''
</P>
<P>
   Teller was told that the office supervisor had decreed that
beginning immediately, all account executives had to sign in each
morning, giving their time of arrival. There was also a heading
called ``reason for being late,'' and the receptionist said company
business was the only acceptable excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was appalled that my creativity and professionalism were
being judged by the clock,'' Teller writes. ``And if the company
was so interested in the time I arrived, why didn't it care about
my time of departure?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that an angry response would not go down well. Which is
why, after some deliberation, I wrote that I was late because `My
parakeet developed a hernia, and I had trouble finding a pet shop
that sold a tiny truss.'''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 30 minutes later, Teller was summoned to the office of
the boss, who told him to close the door and take a seat. Teller
could see the book, with its offending entry, open on the desk.
</P>
<P>
   The boss asked him to explain, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   The boss listened carefully, thought for a moment, then broke
into a smile. ``I think you're right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, the book was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Teller adds two postscripts:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``I've used humor in business whenever appropriate ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   2. ``I must admit that I've never owned a parakeet.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a job seeker's nightmare,'' writes Peg Mancuso of
Hicksville, N.Y. Two university vice presidents and two directors
were taking turns questioning her about how she would handle the
role of alumni relations director for the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university had lost track of many of the alumni and needed
to regain contact,'' Mrs. Mancuso says. ``I had some ideas and
answered all the questions with the confidence that I could do the
job for my alma mater.''
</P>
<P>
   But then one of the vice presidents asked, ``So, do you think
you could find all of the lost alumni?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mancuso hesitated. The tension built.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that if I answered `yes,' I would be showing
overconfidence and a lack of knowledge about the challenges of the
job,'' she recalled. ``But to answer `no' would be to admit to the
possibility of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mancuso repeated the question and, with a smile, gave her
reply: ``No, I don't think that I'll find all the alumni, at least
not those in the Witness Protection Program.''
</P>
<P>
   She got the job. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   When George A. Cohon, now senior chairman of both McDonald's
Russia and McDonald's Restaurants of Canada, was negotiating in the
early 1980s to introduce the fast-food chain to the Soviet Union,
he often met with Vsevolod Shimansky, an official of the Russian
Federation's Trade Ministry. Shimansky often wanted to continue
their talks over dinner, especially at restaurants with live
balalaika music.
</P>
<P>
   One night during this period, on a trip to Australia, Cohon
found himself in a restaurant where the owner went from table to
table, playing a guitar in what seemed to be a very accomplished
fashion. ``But when he stopped strumming, the guitar kept playing;
he had a tape deck inside the guitar,'' Cohon writes with David
Macfarlane in ``To Russia With Fries'' (McClelland &AMP; Stewart). ``As
soon as I saw it, I thought: Shimansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a tape deck. I got a balalaika. I carefully inserted the
tape deck into the body of the balalaika.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Cohon came to Russia, he wasted no time telling
Shimansky that he had been studying the balalaika, a guitar-like
instrument. Shimansky wasted no time telling Cohon that he wanted
to hear him play.
</P>
<P>
   Cohon stalled until the last night of his visit, when they went
to Valdai, not only one of Shimansky's favorite restaurants but
also a place that featured balalaika music.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, over coffee, Cohon said, ``Well, it is now time for me
to play the balalaika.''
</P>
<P>
   The instrument had been planted in a corner. With his back to
the table, Cohon switched on the tape, turned around and began
strumming a classic balalaika tune, ``Moscow Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Shimansky was astonished. ``He stood there in amazement, moved
almost to tears,'' Cohon writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How beautiful!'' Shimansky exclaimed. How he wished he could
play such a song.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can,'' Cohon said, still strumming.
</P>
<P>
   Shimansky said: ``No, I have not the gift of music. Not like
you.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Cohon replied, ``No, really, you can learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohon passed the instrument to Shimansky. ``And, of course, when
I handed it to him, it continued playing,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Shimansky almost fell over his chair. And then his laughter
boomed through the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gift,'' Cohon said. ``For you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohon writes, ``Shimansky turned out to be a good ally for us to
have.''

TOO PERSONAL AT THE INTERVIEW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I am just beginning a job search, and I've already
been asked twice in interviews whether I am married, have children
or plan to have children. While my answers to the first two
questions are yes and no, I have dodged the third, for fear that
any child-bearing plans might cost me a new job. Is it true that
employers aren't supposed to ask? How should I handle it when they
do?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A job hunt is tough enough without having to dance around
uncomfortable _ and, yes, illegal _ interview questions.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, it is illegal even to ask about a candidate's
marital status, said Mark A. Jacoby, an employment lawyer at Weil,
Gotshal &AMP; Manges in Manhattan. And regardless of where you live,
interview questions about pregnancy or plans for becoming pregnant
are forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, he explained, ``The issue would be tied to a
possible disability as a result of pregnancy _ in effect,
discriminating against someone who plans to get pregnant and
therefore be disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, however, boldly asserting your legal
rights may not be the best way to get what you want. ``You can say,
`Those are illegal questions,' and refuse to answer,'' said Caryl
Rae Krannich, co-author of ``Interview for Success'' (Impact
Publications, 1998). ``That may make you feel good at the moment,
but it is sure to kill your chances of getting the job.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the interviewer is just trying to make small talk
and isn't thinking about the legal consequences of his questions,
Jacoby said. If you make a big deal out of a question, you're
likely only to increase the interviewer's interest in it.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is to finesse the issue by playing it ``honest but
smart,'' Ms. Krannich said. If you deny any plans to have children,
but then show up pregnant shortly thereafter, she said, you could
hurt your relationship with your new employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' Ms. Krannich cautioned, ``you want to put
the best face on the situation.'' Offering too much information _
how many children you're hoping for, or just when you plan to have
them _ falls into the ``honest and stupid'' category, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your responses brief and to the point, she advised. ``A lot
of people talk too much when asked about things that make them
uncomfortable,'' she said. ``Just answer the question and move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   A long, rambling response will alert an observant interviewer to
your discomfort and can make the interviewer wonder, ``If she
responds this way to this question, what will she be like to work
with?''
</P>
<P>
   If you object on principle to the questions, you can make the
subtle point that they are inappropriate, Ms. Krannich said. ``Say
something like: ``Gee, that's interesting. I've not been asked that
question before in a job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in some cases an interviewer's motives may not be
so innocent. If you sense that your questioner knows that his line
of inquiry is inappropriate but is pursuing it anyhow, you may want
to seriously reconsider whether you want to work for that company.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25)  
 (af)  
 By LEONARD M. APCAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My 40-something neighbor cut to the chase: ``What are you doing
with that old-folks car in your driveway?''
</P>
<P>
   I stammered and muttered something about how this new Buick, the
2000-model LeSabre, had a totally different feel. But I could tell
he wasn't buying it. His mind was made up, like those of many Baby
Boomers. He was thinking that Buicks have mushy rides, imprecise
handling and styling that shouts, ``Hey, Mom, Grandpa is here!''
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him? Buick has long catered to the senior set that
loves big American cars. With a preponderance of models that were
conservative on the outside, unexciting on the inside, Buick long
ago lost the high-style appeal it had in the '50s and '60s with
snazzy Skylarks, sporty Wildcats and elegant Electra 225s.
</P>
<P>
   As younger Americans discovered cool, crisp-handling European
sedans, Buick was left selling cars to the Sun City crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest full-size Buick has been completely rethought.
Following on the successful redesign of the plush, V8-powered Park
Avenue, Buick engineers have recast the LeSabre, their big-selling,
V6-powered front-drive sedan, from the suspension up.
</P>
<P>
   The LeSabre's biggest surprise is the way it rides and handles.
It rivals and in some ways improves on the smooth competence of the
Toyota Avalon and Chrysler Concorde, two competing cars I drove for
comparison purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In this Buick, taking a high speed turn doesn't feel as if you
are trying to steer a bag of water, as it does with another LeSabre
rival, the Mercury Grand Marquis. The Buick's body has been
considerably stiffened, the handling is as crisp as any large car I
know selling for less than $30,000 and the acceleration and road
feel are pleasant surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, I tested a car with the optional Gran Touring
package, which includes 16-inch aluminum wheels and a tighter
suspension. But even that is a sharp improvement over a 1999 model
similarly equipped. At $185, it is small price to pay for excellent
handling.
</P>
<P>
   A week before, I had driven a $50,000 BMW wagon through the
twisties, and when I got in the Buick I reminded myself that I was
now judging a car costing $20,000 less. But while the LeSabre is
hardly at the level of a rear-drive German sports sedan or wagon, I
was surprised by how well it held the road, took the turns,
accelerated onto freeways and isolated its occupants.
</P>
<P>
   The LeSabre's biggest disappointment is its looks. While the
car's fresh and flowing curves improve on the frumpy lines of the
'99 model, it is still conservative and undistinctive. It borrows
heavily from both the Park Avenue and the midsize Century and
Regal; while that gives Buick a ``family look,'' it is still pretty
dull.
</P>
<P>
   Buick and some other General Motors divisions face a dilemma;
because they sell lots of cars to a fiercely loyal older crowd,
they tend to be cautious about making changes that might alienate
their best customers. After all, my neighbor may turn up his nose
at the LeSabre, but it has been the nation's best-selling
full-sized car for seven years. Even a gutsy product planner
tinkers very carefully with such a sales machine.
</P>
<P>
   For a little extra room, the LeSabre's wheelbase was stretched
almost 1.5 inches and the front and rear wheels were moved out a
hair to improve ride and stability. The engine and transaxle have
hardly changed. GM's 3.8-liter V6 has its roots in the early 60s,
but it is one of the company's most widely used engines. In the
LeSabre, it cranks out 205 horsepower and gets up to 30 highway
miles to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the old dashboard was junked in favor of bigger gauges
and a swooping, horizontal design that is a nice change from the
conventional layout _with stereo, climate controls and ashtray
stacked in a center chimney _ of the Avalon and Concorde. Another
nice touch: The window and lock switches are well lighted at night.
</P>
<P>
   I disliked the center console, though. In a clumsy effort to
entice younger buyers, Buick is offering the LeSabre for the first
time with a bucket seat-and-console configuration as an alternative
to the three-person bench. The seats are comfortable, but the
console looks like a he-man design ripped from a Suburban. It is
way too large for this car and its folding cup holder mechanism is
so big it blocks access to the center of the dash.
</P>
<P>
   The LeSabre and the Avalon have four air bags, two in the dash
and one side-impact bag in each of the front seats. For a better
fit, Buick's shoulder belts are attached to the seat instead of to
the door pillars, and the front seats have headrests that
automatically sense when a front occupant is pushed backwards in a
crash and adjust to cradle the back of the head. In the rear, three
passengers get shoulder and lap belts, though they do not have
adjustable headrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde has neither adjustable rear headrests nor side air
bags, but it is anything but dull on the outside. I loved its
design from the moment it was introduced as a 1998 model.
Unfortunately, driving the car dampened my excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's design moves occupants forward, and the hood's sharp
slope lets the driver see little between the windshield and the
front end of the car. In fact, you have the perception of steering
the car from just behind the front bumper. Some people love this;
some don't. In any case, it takes an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   For all the luxury touches of the Concorde in LXi trim, it does
not give as smooth or quiet a ride as the Buick or Toyota. While
Chrysler says it tried to reduce noise and harshness, the Concorde
remains unduly harsh and its 3.2-liter V6 is downright noisy.
</P>
<P>
   Stiffness is important in a large car _ it contributes to the
Concorde's fine cornering ability _ but Chrysler has not hit the
sensitive balance that delivers both precise handling and a supple,
comfortable ride.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Avalon was probably the ride and handling leader
in this segment, and it remains an impressive American-built family
sedan even with a four-year-old design. While it has the smallest
engine _ a 3-liter V6 _ its horsepower rivals that of its bigger
competitiors and it holds its own in interior roominess.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can boast a better reputation for quality than
Toyota. Still, the top-line Avalon is $29,128, the priciest car of
this bunch.
</P>
<P>
   With a LeSabre Custom starting at just $23,505, this new,
much-improved Buick seems a compelling value. It also shows that
Detroit can offer a big family car that delivers not just ample
room and a pleasing ride, but also impressive handling.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: A big Buick that doesn't drive like one.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: ENTERING AN ERA OF CHEAP DIGITAL EATS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- You can sense that a seismic shift is uprooting the
computing world when fully loaded machines are being sold on the
World Wide Web for $599. Each of these units is more powerful than
the $80 million behemoth that ran the North American Air Defense
Command a few decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those $599 computers ship with Windows 98. But Seattle-based
Microworkz Computer could perhaps knock another $50 or so off its
price if its customers chose to load Linux, which is in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the spring Comdex trade show in Chicago snapped up
tens of thousands of free CDs that were imprinted with a new
release of the Linux operating system. This version can be dressed
up to have the look and feel of Microsoft Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, an IBM subsidiary is shipping Star Office, a full
suite of applications, including a neat integrated Internet
browser. Star Office holds its own against Microsoft Office, which
sells for hundreds of dollars. A single-copy Linux version of Star
Office is available for free for non-commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Microsoft just reported record fiscal third-quarter
earnings, and its short-term prospects look bright. After all, even
a bare-bones $299 computer, the Webzter Jr., another Microworkz
Computer offering, requires a suite of applications to do serious
work. And, for most folks, Microsoft remains still best suited to
fill their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, a $599 package based on Linux and Star Office would
appeal mainly to the kind of savvy insiders that frequent Comdex.
But how long before Microworkz Computer or another bargain-priced
supplier starts to sell machines with Linux-based Windows-like
systems? (Dell Computer, which is to Microworkz Computer as
Microsoft is to Linux, has began to ship powerful units installed
with Linux, which has 15 million users.)
</P>
<P>
   Some computer gurus who came to Comdex see computer usage
reaching saturation levels in the workplace early in the new
millennium. But, they say, hard-core home non-users will remain
unplugged forever.
</P>
<P>
   This anti-rodent minority will never know what it's like to roll
a computer mouse through the Internet, even if computers come to be
available for free. (A few marketeers have begun to give them away,
seeking to recapture their costs through pricey Internet sign-ups.)
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need a computer to compute. Bright programmers at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have written a
conversational interface for online weather information. For
example, a user can call up and ask, ``What's the forecast for
today in Dayton?'' or ``Will it rain tomorrow in London?'' (During
the MIT test period, you can try it by a toll-free call to
1-888-573-8255.) (CQ)
</P>
<P>
   Many of MIT's networking computers run on Linux. That makes
Linus Torvalds, Linux's 29-year-old creator, quite happy at a time
that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is giving the university $20
million to build a new computer lab, to be named after Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds came to Comdex to taunt Goliath by predicting his
fledgling operating system will crush Microsoft. Some people who
heard Torvalds speak thought he was joking. But Gates, who was at
Comdex while the taunt was hurled, did not. Even on a digital
battlefield, paranoids can have real enemies.

 &HT;    The $5 miracle that made a difference
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I am here to tell of a miracle _ or at least
it was a miracle to me _ and, what's more, a miracle with a
message. Miracles do not come along every day. Certainly, I've only
had one in my life.
</P>
<P>
   If you have chosen not to believe in miracles, I have no desire
to shatter your lack of faith. Call it a coincidence, call it a
scientific anomaly. Call it pure, dumb luck. I know what it was.
</P>
<P>
   A miracle. Though lightening did not flash in the sky and no one
but me noticed it. I tend to believe that most all miracles are
tiny ones, so small that they are not seen by anyone but the one
who receives the blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Such is my story.
</P>
<P>
   It happened when I was a boy, maybe 8 years old. It was a
Saturday morning and my parents were fighting.
</P>
<P>
   My parents did not fight often, at least not where the children
could hear them. But this Saturday was different, both my mother
and my father were raising their voices. The situation was made all
the more unpleasant because I so rarely had heard them fight.
</P>
<P>
   If parents knew the feeling of fear and helplessness that enters
young hearts when Mom and Dad argue in front of children, they
would do it far less often.
</P>
<P>
   On this day the disagreement was such that any restraint they
might have ordinarily felt had melted away.
</P>
<P>
   And what was the argument about? Simple. Money, or, more
accurately, the lack of it. I have a theory that money is the root
of almost all arguments among married couples and it certainly was
that day. I heard it over and over and over. No money. No money. No
money.
</P>
<P>
   Though the day was cold and I did not really want to go outside,
the fighting finally drove me from the house. I grabbed the
football and began playing ``solo football.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who grew up with many friends or siblings may not
recognize the game. Solo football is played by one person, who is
both the passer and the receiver. The trick is to throw the ball up
high enough so that you can
</P>
<P>
   catch it as a receiver. If you think this isn't much fun you are
right, but it is still better than listening to your parents fight.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the yard I threw and I caught, threw and caught. One
particular pass I threw high, but far too deep. I missed it by 10
yards.
</P>
<P>
   I trotted over to pick up the ball and, when I did, I found a
crisp, new $5 bill underneath. I reacted as if I'd found a chest of
gold. I ran into the house waving that $5 bill. ``I have money!'' I
said. ``I have money! Now you can stop fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   And, by golly, they did.
</P>
<P>
   My father took that $5 bill and examined it as if it were an
artifact from Pluto. It seemed to me that he rubbed his eyes to
make sure they were seeing properly.
</P>
<P>
   Then he handed the $5 bill back to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to all the neighbors,'' he said. ``Ask every one of them if
they have lost $5. If they say that they have, give the money to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   (I'm sure some of you remember a time when you could do that and
count on all your neighbors to tell you the truth. I'd like to
think that is still possible in a town like Marshall.)
</P>
<P>
   I went to every neighbor within two blocks of our house and
asked if they had lost that $5 bill, but I already knew the answer
would be ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   I believed then, and believe now, that as that ball went
skyward, God _ who, I'll admit doesn't often use money to provide
miracles _ slapped that $5 bill on the ball so it would land on the
bottom for me to find.
</P>
<P>
   When I got back home with the $5 still in my hand, I gave it to
my father who promptly announced we were going out to see a movie.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, I didn't have much concept of what a movie would cost,
but it surprised me you could get a family of five into a theater
for $5, but maybe so.
</P>
<P>
   Then my father told us we were also going out to eat. What? You
could really go to the movies and eat out for $5?
</P>
<P>
   But I was a kid and I didn't question it. That $5 bill, simple
as it was, turned the mood of the day. We ate at a nearby
cafeteria, then went to the Gateway Theater, most probably to watch
a war film or a Western.
</P>
<P>
   After the movie my mother mentioned ice cream and we went to the
original Ashburn's ice cream store on Fort Worth's East Side. My
mom had a banana split and the rest of us had double-dip cones.
</P>
<P>
   I remember watching as the server rang up the total on one of
those cash registers where numbers pop up instead of an electronic
display.
</P>
<P>
   The total was $5.27.
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   That was more than I had found. How had my father paid for the
movie, the dinner and ice cream?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that things are almost never as bad as they seem.
I've no doubt my parents were having money problems, my father was
a cop and money was always tight.
</P>
<P>
   But the night we shared as a family was worth whatever money it
cost and my parents understood that. We made it through whatever
difficulty hounded my parents that day and dozens more
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story is this: When things get so bad that you
believe they can't get worse, you need to find a reason to believe
in miracles again.
</P>
<P>
   You need to eat ice cream and hug your children _ not
necessarily in that order.

 &HT;    Do you own a gun? If so, like Dixie says, `We have to talk'
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was one of those spring nights when the
neighbors come out after the long hibernation of winter, greeting
each other for the first time in months, when folks find any excuse
to be in their front yard for the sheer joy of being there.
</P>
<P>
   This neighbor I'd never met couldn't resist talking to my little
girl in the stroller. ``How old are you, sweetheart?'' he said, and
I answered, ``Three,'' when Queen Veronica didn't deign a reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a new little boy,'' my neighbor said, offering the
cigar of his irrepressible smile. ``He's five days old.''
</P>
<P>
   A shadow falls over my neighbor's face. ``I hope I can bring him
up in a better world than the one I'm living in.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need to say it: Columbine High School. The image
pushed itself into my mind: The children running out of the school
with their hands over their heads. A girl sobbing, ``This isn't
supposed to happen at school. School is the place where you're
supposed to be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we tell our children?'' the TV anchorperson
breathlessly intones, previewing one of those ever-helpful
how-to-parent segments. ``How do we assure them they're safe?''
</P>
<P>
   We could tell them the murdered students are statistically
insignificant, as columnist Vincent Schiraldi opined last year. ``I
have been on television news following every one of the recent
school killings, answering basically the same question: `How do you
explain the trend of shootings by kids in rural schools?'''
Schiraldi wrote. ``My answer is always the same: I cannot explain
it, because no such trend exists.'' Many more people, he explained,
are killed by lightning every year.
</P>
<P>
   No need to mourn, then, as another statistically insignificant
town buries its statistically insignificant children. There is no
trend here.
</P>
<P>
   What do we tell our children?
</P>
<P>
   We could tell them that no right is more sacred than free
enterprise, the right of Hollywood and Madison Avenue and the music
industry to fill kids' heads with violent fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   We could tell them that no right is more important than the
right to bear arms. The Second Amendment is the alpha and omega of
rights, the one right that should come without restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Pay no attention to Dixie Kirkland, who has given away 1,900 gun
locks as part of a gun-safety program, one of the first of its kind
in the country, at Grandview Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``These teens are children, still kids, not yet adults,''
Kirkland said. ``We as adults have to be responsible for children's
actions, and we have failed.'' We have failed, she said, by the
very fact that these children have gotten their hands on these
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland knows how parents can close their eyes to the danger.
She goes to festivals, schools, anywhere they'll take her,
spreading the gospel of gun safety. At a recent safety fair in
Washington Twp., ``People walked by me and shrugged _ `Oh, that,
it's just gun safety,''' she said. ``I put up with that for about
10 seconds.'' Then she starting calling out to passers-by: ``Do you
have a gun?'' If the answer is yes, she beckons with her strong,
grandmotherly arms, the kind you never say no to: ``We have to
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   What gives her such passion? Friends lost their son, a shooting
victim. ``If I can save just one life . . .'' she said, her face
turning red, ``it would be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   What do we tell our children?
</P>
<P>
   We can listen to Dixie Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   Or we can tell them that every right takes precedence over their
right to grow up safe, to go to school without fear.

 &HT;    Let me tick off the ways the clock runs my day
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ One of the burdens of being semi-retired
is being asked: ``What do you do with all your time?'' It's hard to
explain where time goes when you aren't punching in 8 to 5. I'm
tempted to give people the answer they expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sleep until about 9:30, get up, put on my robe, eat
breakfast, read the newspaper, and watch television. Then I shower,
go to my club for a leisurely lunch, play a round of golf, enjoy a
couple of beers with my cronies, and get home in time for the
cocktail hour. After dinner I light my pipe, read a book until the
11 o'clock news.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not quite true. The Moose Club doesn't serve lunch, and I
haven't played golf since 1964. My wife and my doctors have nagged
my pipe away, and when I read or watch television, I nod off within
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I spend most of my time waiting for somebody to come fix
something. My golden years are complicated by having married a
child bride who continues in the work force. I'm the one who has to
be home when repairmen come to fix the air conditioning, the
dishwasher, the microwave, the freezer, the stove, the garbage
disposal and our other modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   My typical day: When the alarm goes off at 6:15, I dash to the
kitchen and start breakfast before she gets out of the shower.
Otherwise there won't be butter in the grits, and I'll get
Eggbeaters cooked in Pam rather than real eggs fried in bacon
grease.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do today?'' she inquires before I have a
chance to finish the sports section.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I haven't decided,'' I reply. ``I'll probably go back to
bed for a nap and then call George Patton to see if he wants to go
to lunch. Then we may go fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to be here when Gene Walker comes to measure for
carpet,'' she said. ``And you need to call Chuck Watkins about the
irrigation system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to go to the hardware store for light bulbs and you
can go by the laundry and pick up the dry cleaning I dropped off
last week.''
</P>
<P>
   After spraying the roses for blackspot, opening the house for
Gene Walker and calling Chuck Watkins about the irrigation system,
I drove to town, picked up the light bulbs and the dry cleaning.
One of our new neighbors was parked in the driveway when I got
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have about a dozen cows and a great big bull?'' he
wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in my yard eating my flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually they're my semi-farmer son's cows,'' I explain. Two
hours later the cows are back in their pasture and my neighbor is
no longer threatening to call the police.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted and brier-scratched from chasing cows through the
woods, I check the refrigerator to see if my wife was thoughtful
enough to fix a sandwich for my lunch. Before I can eat, the phone
rings. A fabulous offer to switch to a new telephone company! I
decline. I hang up and check the answering service.
</P>
<P>
   I receive a spousal suggestion that since I have to go town to
get light bulbs I can stop by the grocery and pick up a carton of
Eggbeaters, a quart of skim milk and a jar of low-fat mayonnaise.
And since Alex and Judy Moye are coming for dinner Friday night,
can I find somebody to dispose of limbs almost blocking the
driveway where the tree fell last month?
</P>
<P>
   I've already been to the hardware store and anybody who thinks I
can produce somebody to dispose of a fallen tree in less than three
weeks is out of touch with reality. I called my wife at her office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we need to get the tree out of the driveway?'' I ask.
``Alex is a former airline pilot. Anybody who can fly a jet from
Atlanta to San Franciso can guide an automobile around a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look in the Yellow Pages and call a tree service,'' she
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   I get an answering service. ``We're sorry, we're not available
at this time. Please leave your name and number and we'll call you
back as soon as possible.'' Same thing with two other calls. I go
to the shop and dig out my chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   The blade is dull. I go back to the hardware store to get a
file. The saw needs gas. After paying for the file, the Eggbeaters,
the skim milk and the fat-free mayonnaise, I am out of money. I go
to the bank and cash a check. Since I haven't had time to eat my
sandwich, I stop at the Quickie for a Diet Coke and cheese
crackers. It is suppertime when I finish with the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you do with your day?'' she asks when we sit down for
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, nothing much. Just fooled around the house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to find yourself something to do with your
time,'' she said.

Journal-Contitution.

 &HT;    Ghosts of past can haunt even most routine events
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUREKA SPRINGS, Ark. _ Contact with the planet is limited to a
few square inches of rubber humming on asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-present wind roars in your ears and buffets your body.
You concentrate on the road _ brake, lean, accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   Miles pile upon miles. I think of my father, how in his grave he
has decided to talk.
</P>
<P>
   We never talked until years after the rifle salute made me jump
and the bugler playing taps made my mother cry.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what happened to the flag that the uniformed men folded
so smartly and handed to my mother so respectfully. Maybe my
brother has it.
</P>
<P>
   Brake, lean, accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   We come up behind a slow moving truck. The road hum and wind
roar drops in volume and pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The lead rider studies his passing opportunities on this narrow
mountain road. Each rider, in turn, will do the same. We know the
drill.
</P>
<P>
   Brake, lean, accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   As I wait my turn, I wonder why we have been drawn together in
an activity that precludes talk.
</P>
<P>
   Some motorcycle riders rig up small transmitters and microphones
so they can talk as they travel. No one in our group likes that
idea. We have a few hand signals. That's talk enough.
</P>
<P>
   We pass the truck, regroup and get back into our rhythm. Here's
a left-hand sweeper. Next is a right-hand switchback. We pick our
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Brake, lean, accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   My companions listen to the same road sounds, see the same
sights, smell the same pine trees and feel the same wind gusts. I
wonder if they also talk to their fathers while they maneuver their
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Brake, lean, accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   The men of our fathers' generation were seldom disposed to talk.
They saw a lot and did a lot. But they kept it to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Our fathers were men who survived the Great Depression and World
War II. They knew the hardships of keeping a family together during
the years of America's deepest deprivations.
</P>
<P>
   Their hard-earned experience taught them the importance of work.
Any task undertaken must be completed with utmost diligence.
</P>
<P>
   My father, and the fathers of my companions, knew the sacrifices
of fighting a brutal world war that lasted for years with no hope
for relief except in victory, death or incapacitation.
</P>
<P>
   The men of our fathers' generation returned home from World War
II and went to work. They rejected sympathy. They refused to
complain. They improved themselves with the GI Bill. They got jobs.
They did not talk about their privations or their feelings. They
raised their families. Us.
</P>
<P>
   Brake, lean, accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   My father never asked me how I felt about anything or told me
how he felt. For him, feelings were irrelevant _ a waste of breath.
</P>
<P>
   When you survive the Great Depression and World War II, you
learn that feelings don't put beans in a pot or turn back an enemy
attack. Everyone felt desperate. Actions count, not words. You have
to be strong to survive, and sometimes lucky as well. But you make
your own luck.
</P>
<P>
   We stop for gas, exchange a few comments, tighten our helmet
straps, blip the throttles and take off again enveloped in our
noise and thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if my companions chase the same ghosts. I wonder if
they also have conversations with their fathers that never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   One time I thought my father was getting ready to tell me
something that had been on his mind, something important. He
started to say something but stopped. Then he just punched me
lightly on the shoulder. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Brake, lean, accelerate.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Playing doves and hawks
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Jefferson Clinton, as he's called when he's in trouble,
gave his fullest _ and best _ explanation of the war in Yugoslavia
to newspaper editors in San Francisco. We were there, he said, to
prevent a slaughter in a part of the world that, additionally,
tends to self-destruct periodically. It will be difficult now for
opponents to claim they just can't get it.
</P>
<P>
   The political landscape is like the surface of the moon,
fragmented, barren, hard to read. Both sides claim moral high
ground. Stop the slaughter. Stop the bombing. Send in ground troops
and bring the boys back home all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   After a period of bemusement, the public has found Yugoslavia on
the map. The Serbs, playing on the Vietnam analogy, have made a
poor case for themselves as victims. Americans seem to understand
the difference between war and premeditated slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to be emerging is a need for any administration to
define what slaughters we are likely to oppose in the future. Many
African Americans, for instance, wonder if we'd do the same if the
victims were of color. Barring our involvement in all world
atrocities, what seems to be emerging is the need for a clear
demonstration of the national interest. That's cold-blooded, but
fairer than any alternative offered.

 &HT;    Weighing the pros and cons of woodworking magazines
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anyone who has visited this space for very long knows
of the soft spot that lurks in my heart for Fine Woodworking
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the magazine, and its publisher, The Taunton Press, I
wouldn't be writing this. The magazine, and Taunton Press's books,
published the first widely available information on how proper
woodworking is done, and as far as I'm concerned, launched the
woodworking revolution that continues apace today.
</P>
<P>
   I've had some differences _ on occasion fairly loud ones _ with
the magazine, and for a time it fell somewhat behind its burgeoning
competition, but by and large it remains the best woodworking
publication on the market for my money.
</P>
<P>
   Fine Woodworking pioneered woodworking how-to videos, but was
rather late to jump into the Internet. However, it now has a
remarkably good Web site which, even more remarkably, offers a lot
of free information.
</P>
<P>
   Most magazines don't give away much of their content on the
Internet; after all, they're in business to get subscriptions which
help them to charge more for their advertising. But Fine
Woodworking's site is generous.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among the free stuff are videos. I looked at a slick
video clip of Mario Rodriguez demonstrating how to properly tune a
hand plane, beginning with flattening the sole. To view these
online videos, you need a little program called RealPlayer. There's
a free version of it, and Fine Woodworking's site will lead you to
a place where you can download it if you don't have it.
</P>
<P>
   The free version isn't anything great. It presents the video in
fits and starts, although the audio flows pretty well. However, it
was adequate for this purpose. The clip is not one of those
30-second teases you so often see in situations like this. It lasts
for several minutes and provides a good demonstration on flattening
the sole, truing the blade and all the other elements of plane
tuning.
</P>
<P>
   There are also featured videos of Richard Raffan turning a bowl
and another expert carving linenfold panels. These are, the site
says, tied into articles in the current issue. This raises some
confusion; the current issue, according to the site, is the April
issue, which does not have those articles. Presumably they'll be
forthcoming in the May-June issue.
</P>
<P>
   The quick-loading site also includes useful excerpts from past
tool reviews, technique and material advice, and a lot of other
good stuff. It will take you a while to absorb it all. There is a
veritable gold mine of links to other woodcentric sites. The
address, predictably, is www.finewoodworking.com.
</P>
<P>
   American Woodworker, FWW's chief competition, was sold earlier
this year by Rodale Prerss to Reader's Digest. American Woodworker
has a good site, too, although it is considerably less ambitious
than Fine Woodworking's.
</P>
<P>
   Its chief attraction is reprints of many, if not all, of its
major tool reviews, a rather obvious kind of article that FWW
refused to do until American Woodworker gobbled up serious amounts
of its territory.

   COXNET SCIHEALTH 0423 CHILD ALIENATION _ The American teen-ager:
yearning to stand out, and desperate to fit in. Struggling to be a
rebel, yet terrified of losing status with the cool group. It is an
age of alienation. A sense of being on the outside looking in is
``typical in adolescence, from 12 to 18,'' say experts who deal
with teens. Such alienation breeds feelings of rejection. What

   CREDIT _ The debate over health care costs almost always focuses
on hospital costs, doctors fees and the supposed evils of managed
care. But health care costs burn holes in the pockets of millions
of Americans who incur a hidden expense caring for a loved one at
home. As our population ages, more and more families find
themselves in this caretaking situation _ often at great, even
crippling expense. Mary Bennett is one of those people. With more
than $2 million in health care bills for her son, Bennett is one of
those people who say they could use the $1,000 tax credit proposed
by President Clinton for families who care for loved ones at home.
But is this something government should be doing? And where do we
draw the line? As more and more families incur added burden of
caring for a loved one at home, this is a debate that will continue
for some time. (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News). 30.

   FAITH-PSYCHIATRY _ DAYTON, Ohio _ People don't expect to see a
yarmulke on their psychiatrist's head, but Dr. David Rube says
they're often reassured at the sight of his. It tells them they are
welcome to talk about God here, even if they don't share his
Orthodox Jewish faith. That's not true in every psychiatrist's
office, Rube (pronounced ``Ruby'') says. Many of his colleagues
prefer to keep spirituality as far from their practices as palm
reading or spoon bending. ``The history of psychiatry has been
extremely secular,'' he says, ``taking the view that religion is
something to be interpreted and is a neurotic defense mechanism.''
As a result, Rube says psychiatrists often shut out their patients'
spiritual sides at a time when they're most likely to surface.
That's one reason he developed the course for residents at that
Wright State University School of Medicine that was awarded
nationally last week for incorporating spirituality into medicine.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like bargaining at open-air markets, using a credit card for
purchases in foreign countries has long been a financial given for
seasoned travelers. That's because the exchange rates offered by
credit cards have generally been better than those at local
currency exchange counters.
</P>
<P>
   But some travelers are finding their credit-card shopping a
little more expensive than it used to be, as some card issuers are
adding fees on transactions in foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, while it still may pay for travelers to use their
credit cards overseas, it may pay even more for them to choose
their card carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, Citibank, the second-biggest credit card issuer
after Bank One, has been adding a 2 percent surcharge to purchases
in foreign currencies. Providian Financial of San Francisco,
another big issuer, has been charging about half its customers _
those with higher credit limits _ a 4 percent fee for foreign
exchanges since July.
</P>
<P>
   The fees are assessed per transaction, after a currency is
converted to dollars based on various exchange rates. And they come
on top of a 1 percent charge that Visa and, Mastercard have long
added to cover the costs of a currency exchange. (American Express
will increase its transaction fee to 2 percent in mid-June, from 1
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Linda Sherry, the editorial director at Consumer Action, an
advocacy group based in San Francisco that researches
personal-finance issues, says using a credit card is still
advantageous, though less so than before. ``We have always told
people to use credit cards overseas to avoid rates at change
facilities, Ms. Sherry said. ``It is still a bargain, but we think
that banks adding on a percentage is going to become a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for card users, Ms. Sherry explained, is that the
charges on foreign transactions are not obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``A consumer would probably not go back and check the foreign
exchange rate and realize there is a percentage added on top of the
rate,'' she said. ``The fee is rolled in, instead of being shown on
the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   First USA, the credit card subsidiary of Bank One, recently
informed customers that it would charge an additional 2 percent fee
over the Mastercard and Visa fee, but now says it has decided not
to assess the charge at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Banks defend the charges, saying they are reasonable and
necessary to cover costs. David Webster, first vice president for
corporate affairs at Bank One, said fees offered a way to make sure
that consumers are charged only for services they use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use your card to make a purchase in a foreign
country,'' he said, ``you pay a fee that is not borne by other card
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and consumer groups that follow the credit card
industry see such charges as part of a broader trend toward more
banking fees. Robert B. McKinley, the president of CardWeb.com,
which tracks the payment card industry for consumers and issuers,
listed several examples _ over-limit fees, late fees, cash advance
fees, balance-transfer fees and even an inactivity fee for
consumers who do not use their cards for six months _ as evidence
of banks' ``looking for any source of revenue'' in a tight market.
</P>
<P>
   Because of competition, many issuers no longer charge annual
fees on their cards, and some have lowered their interest rates to
attract customers. Transaction fees help compensate banks for such
changes, McKinley said, as well as for the loss of interest income
from a growing number of so-called convenience customers, those who
pay their balances monthly.
</P>
<P>
   While banks are more willing to raise foreign-transaction fees,
Ms. Sherry said, consumers are becoming more conscious of
credit-card costs in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before anyone takes out a card they should think about how
they'll be using it,'' she said. ``They should ask questions first
to see where they could run into trouble with fees.''

SINGLE-COUNTRY FUNDS SEEKING NEW HORIZONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Fla.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE LEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the closed-end country fund becoming a thing of the past?
Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Several closed-end stock funds have changed their charters to
broaden the geographic areas in which they can invest. And since
mid-1997, a half-dozen country funds have decided to either convert
to open-end status or liquidate altogether, among them the Scudder
Spain and Portugal, New South Africa and Emerging Mexico funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a declining relative importance and a real argument,
particularly among the pan-European funds, that they're obsolete,''
said Michael T. Porter, a managing partner at Salomon Smith Barney,
who specializes in closed-end funds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds issue a fixed
number of shares that trade like those of ordinary companies. As
such, they may trade at a premium or a discount to the value of the
assets they hold.
</P>
<P>
   As of February, $6.6 billion was invested in 46 single-country
closed-end equity funds, which were once a preferred way to invest
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   For European offerings, one problem for country funds was the
launch of the European Monetary Community in January. Analysts
expect that with one currency, European markets will move more in
tandem, dampening demand for funds that limit themselves to one
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a number of country funds are looking farther
afield from the geographic areas in their names. Both the Future
Germany fund, rechristened the Central European Equity fund, and
the Emerging Germany fund, now the Dresdner RCM Europe fund, have
asked their shareholders for approval to change their charters to
allow them to invest more of their assets outside Germany. The
Dresdner fund will also convert to an open-end structure next
month.
</P>
<P>
   France Growth, meanwhile, has formed a committee to consider
changing its charter, although the fund remains 100 percent
invested in France.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem for some funds seems to be a lack of
distinguishing characteristics. There is little difference, for
example, in the portfolios of two closed-end funds managed by
Deutsche Bank _ the Germany Fund and the Central European Equity
fund _ Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the euro is by no means the only force
behind the changes. Shareholder activists, irate that closed-end
funds of all kinds are trading at discounts, have been pressing to
liquidate such funds or convert them to open-ended structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single-country funds are under the most attack by the
dissidents,'' said Thomas J. Herzfeld, a closed-end fund specialist
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian market meltdowns of 1997 and 1998 did not help the
region's closed-end funds. As investors fled, managers sought the
greater flexibility offered by a regional approach.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, for example, the Templeton Vietnam Opportunity fund
changed its name and expanded its charter to focus more on
Southeast Asia. (Schroder Asian Growth changed its name to Schroder
All-Asia and converted to an open-end fund last month and Fidelity
Advisor Asia plans a conversion in June.)
</P>
<P>
   Also sapping demand for country funds has been the growing
popularity of World Equity Benchmark Shares or Webs. These unit
investment trusts closely track the Morgan Stanley Capital
International index for particular countries, and are now available
for 17 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts say they are not yet ready to write the
funds, even if some of them are now facing tough times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everything else in the market, this, too, is cyclical,''
said Douglas Beck, a senior international equity fund analyst at
Merrill Lynch.

   Leveraged Buyouts For the Middling Wealthy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leveraged-buyout funds for individuals are here. Or at least
buyout funds for pretty rich individuals.
</P>
<P>
   With a minimum investment of just $250,000 _ a pittance for its
type _ a fund introduced by Independence Holdings Partners LLC, a
New York investment firm, has given investors a chance to partake
of leveraged buyouts. Though that fund has already closed, another
is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The first fund, Independence Private Equity Select, closed in
March after a subscription period that netted more than $50
million. A fund of funds, Independence Private Equity is invested
in three leveraged buyout funds, all of which are managed by
leading investment firms: Apollo Advisors; Clayton, Dubilier &AMP;
Rice, and Hicks, Muse Tate, &AMP; Furst.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a need for a relatively budget-priced leveraged buyout
fund? Absolutely, said Mark Klein, managing member of Independence
Holdings. ``Wealthy individuals don't have access to private equity
markets,'' he said, noting that institutions were the primary
beneficiaries of earlier buyouts. That means individuals have
missed out on returns of more than 40 percent a year from past
funds managed by three other firms, according to Klein's research.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pay Independence Holdings a 1 percent annual advisory
fee, as well as a so-called incentive allocation of 5 percent of
all profits after their initial investment is returned to them over
the funds' life. That is in addition to the fees paid to the
underlying funds. Klein expects the fund to return all capital and
proceeds to investors in less than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Holdings, which Klein describes as an ``alternative
investment company for high-net-worth individuals,'' expects to
offer its second leveraged-buyout fund later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The funds, which are treated as private equity placements, have
stringent requirements for assets and income. Investors may contact
their private bankers or financial advisers to see if they
qualify. &QL;

   A Bill to Increase Bond Transparency &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investors frustrated by the dearth of bond price data may soon
be getting some help from Washington. The House of Representatives
is expected to consider a bill this week that would require
corporate bond traders to disclose the same kind of price, volume
and other data as stock traders do.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the Bond Price Competition Improvement Act of 1999,
instructs the Securities and Exchange Commission to insure that
transaction information is made public. The SEC would decide how to
disseminate the data.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., who is chairman of the
commerce committee, the bill also asks the SEC to study price
competition in municipal bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Bliley cited the wide price differences that
investors face when buying. ``In the equity markets there is a
mechanism for distributing price information to the public to make
sure that does not occur,'' he said. ``No such system exists in the
corporate debt markets, and that needs to be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is endorsed by the Bond Marketing Association and the
National Association of Securities Dealers.

   Fidelity Is Seeking A Higher On-Line Profile &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the world's biggest mutual fund company,
will try to increase the visibility of its Internet brokerage
business with a new advertising campaign. The ads, starting Monday,
are aimed at attracting on-line investors who don't already own
Fidelity funds.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will emphasize the speed and reliability of
Fidelity.com with the theme ``every second counts,'' said Stephen
Cone, president of Fidelity's personal investing and brokerage
group. He added that Fidelity would spend 20 percent to 30 percent
of its roughly $200 million 1999 advertising budget on building its
brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has rejected the idea of selling some stock in the
brokerage business to the public as a way to raise its profile,
Cone said. ``We don't need the capital,'' he said, adding that
Edward C. Johnson, Fidelity's chief executive, ``feels very
strongly about remaining private.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the story out more,'' Cone said. ``Not many
people know that we are the second-largest on-line broker'' in
terms of the number of accounts, behind Charles Schwab. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: The case against cliques
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We'll always have psychotics among us, often never knowing it
until they explode with mass violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some psychotics are born that way. Some are made that way.
</P>
<P>
   Some learn it in school.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine put it best:
</P>
<P>
   The recent school massacre, the worst ever, was another revenge
of the nerds.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't said lightly. Truth should never be taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
   It's this simple:
</P>
<P>
   Friends don't kill friends.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every case of school shootings, the killers were kids
who couldn't fit in.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't be like everyone else, then they'll be different.
They'll wear black leather jackets, or black trenchcoats.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't be an all-American kid, they'll be a Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't be a part of the school, they'll blow it apart.
</P>
<P>
   You remember what it was like in school. If you didn't run with
the crowd, the crowd ran over you. And there was always the odd guy
out.
</P>
<P>
   How did we deal with him? We avoided him, as if whatever he
lacked would somehow rub off on us.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't surprising that a few of the shunned ones, constantly
picked on in the pecking order, end up gunning down their
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising is that there aren't more.
</P>
<P>
   Schools worry about gangs. They should worry about cliques.
</P>
<P>
   There's no crueler society than school cliques.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if the adult world were the same, if individuals were
singled out to be shunned or ridiculed by adult groups, in the work
place, in religious gatherings, in social and civic clubs, as they
so often are in school.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an outrage, something akin to racial prejudice. Yet
it's an attitude common among our children, more so in their teen
years.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that all changes once we've graduated into real life.
It's class dismissed for the class system of jocks and nerds.
</P>
<P>
   Decency, civility, good manners and common courtesy become a
second nature that comes with maturity. Snobs are a joke. Only the
worst of people think they're better than someone else.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson in life that we eventually learn for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's the lesson we should be teaching and stressing to our
children in our homes and our schools, demanding it no less than we
do racial tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Be kind to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Accept people as they are.
</P>
<P>
   Be a friend to the friendless.
</P>
<P>
   Cliques are for jerks.
</P>
<P>
   Nerd is an n-word.

<P>
   KANI SHAITAN REFUGEE CAMP, Iraqi Kurdistan _ They don't have
electricity or television in this camp between grassy mountains, so
they can't follow events in Kosovo. But, the Kurdish refugees
huddled around these tents and mud outhouses know all about death
and displacement -- at the hands of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, Kurds are forced from their homes in Iraq and
trucked to this semi-autonomous area in northernmost Iraq. About
the size of Austria, it is protected now by U.S. air cover and has
been run for the last seven years by a provisional Kurdish
government.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that, since 1991, more than 150,000
Kurds have been forced to the Kurdish zone from homes in other
parts of Iraq. In this tent village of 103 families and the
hallways of the grimy, fetid and crumbling hotel where many others
end up for years, refugees tell of being jailed until they agree to
leave the country, then having an hour to pack and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish leaders see an almost eerie similarity between their
peoples' plight and events in Kosovo. They say their current
``safe-haven'' in northern Iraq could provide a model for a
solution in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parallels are quite striking,'' said Shafiq Qazzaz(CQ), a
Kurdish cabinet minister in Iraqi Kurdistan. ``I have a satellite
television. I sit there and watch. It is mesmerizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish leaders favor the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia's Serb
military forces -- just as fervently as Iraqi leaders have sided
with the Yugoslavian Serbs -- and say the world should not be cowed
by the scenes of refugees in flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end result is what's important,'' said Sami Abdel Rahman,
a top leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party in an interview this
month with Cox Newspapers. He expects the refugees to be returned
to Kosovo in a safe-haven arrangement similar to Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was NATO -- the U.S. and Britain -- that saved us,'' Rahman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Kosovars, Kurds throughout the region have sought their
independence for decades. In southeastern Turkey, a civil war has
killed 35,000 Turks and Kurds since 1984 with little intervention
from the West.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, drawn by Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, the West has
intervened. But, before it did, the Kurds already faced brutality
and persecution that continues, though to a lesser extent, today.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1970s, Hussein has destroyed more than 4,000
Kurdish villages. In the late 1980s, Iraq's campaign of ``Anfal,''
or ``Plunder,'' killed tens of thousands of Kurds. When Kurds and
Iranian troops briefly took over the Iraqi town of Halabja, Iraq
used nerve gas to kill more than 5,000 civilians in one horrible
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Kurds answered the call of
then-U.S. President George Bush to rise against Hussein. But his
army, thought to be reeling from its defeat in Kuwait, mustered an
overwhelming counter-attack that the U.S. did little to impede.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown thousands of Kurds died and an estimated 1 million fled
to the neighboring mountains near Turkey and Iran. The pathetic
scenes of refugees streaming for cover in the rugged, frigid
landscape, prompted the United States and Britain to use their air
power and establish the so-called ``safe-haven'' now in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi representatives deny they mistreat the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish Najdid Abdel Majid, member of a council of Kurds in
Baghdad who support Hussein's regime, calls the notion of chemical
attacks, though widely confirmed, ``propaganda.'' He notes that
more than a million Kurds live in Iraqi controlled-areas and they
own hotels, stores and factories. He says only criminals are forced
from their lands.
</P>
<P>
   But those in strategic and oil-rich Kirkuk, just outside the
autonomous area, still face what Amnesty International calls Iraq's
``Arabization'' of the important city.
</P>
<P>
   Their first stop is often this refugee camp Kani Shaitan, or
``Devil's Spring, ``a refugee camp near the Kurdish city of
Suleimaniyah in northeastern Iraq. Many of the several hundred
people there have been there more than a year and say they were
forced to leave Kirkuk after refusing to change their official
identity from Kurdish to Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, one mother was trying to get her family of six
set up in the small tent that was now their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army came to our house. My husband was away, so they held
me in jail (two days) until my husband came back,'' recounts Saydan
Ali, 27. Then, they were given an hour to pack, and dropped off at
the border of the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The children always ask why we left the house and always ask
about the bathroom. In Kirkuk, we had a good bathroom, here we
can't even wash,'' said Ali, gesturing to an open latrine. ``I tell
them this is our fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish minister Qazzaz said it is the kind of treatment the
world will no longer ignore, whether it occurs in Iraq or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have that kind of treatment toward people, then the
international community has an obligation to intervene,'' he said.

   SCHOOL-SHOOTING-GUNS (Littleton, Colo.) _ Other than the
victims' families and friends, nobody has been more devastated by
the Columbine High School massacre than Doug Dean, the state
legislature's House majority leader, say his friends and fervent
opponents. Dean sponsored two anti-gun-control bills that failed
after triggering one of the most heated debates in Colorado's
history. By MICHAEL DOUGAN.

<P>
   SCHOOL-SHOOTING-INTERNET _ While the murders were still under
way in Columbine High School, the Internet was becoming a magnet
for entrepreneurs, wackos and a gullible media anxious to find a
teenage massacre-World Wide Web connection. Almost as soon as news
of Tuesday's horror was being broadcast, the domain name
``Trenchcoat Mafia'' was being registered on the World Wide Web. By
MATT BEER.

<P>
   ANCIENT-BUTCHERS (San Francisco) _ The primeval equivalent of
your neighborhood meat market has been found near the village of
Bouri in the Afar desert of Ethiopia, scientists have reported. The
discovery of prehistoric antelope bones covered with scratches
caused by knife-like rocks means that a primitive version of the
butcher shop has been part of humans' ancestry for 2.5 million
years, at least a half million years longer than previously
thought. By KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   HEART-TRANSPLANTS (San Francisco) _ Survival rates for patients
who received heart transplants from people infected with hepatitis
C are not much different than for similar patients who got
uninfected hearts _ lending support to the trend of using such
organs in the face of a nationwide shortage, according to two new
studies. By ULYSSES TORASSA.
</P>
<P>
   ROJAS-DALLAS (San Francisco) _ This city's school chief Bill
Rojas has accepted an offer to run Dallas' school system and will
leave here by August, sending a jolt through a district already
shaken by allegations of fiscal recklessness and questionable
testing practices. By JULIAN GUTHRIE.
</P>

   DEEP-SEA-PROBE (San Francisco) _ Secretary of Commerce William
M. Daley, in announcing the launch of a five-year, $12 million
underwater research project here, says, ``What this means is divers

   REFUGEES-CHURCH (Albany, N.Y.) _ The Rev. James Kenyon of the
Christ and St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Troy, N.Y., has in the

zeal. By MICHAEL LOPEZ. (For release Sunday release.)

<P>
   COCKFIGHT-RAID (San Antonio) _ The fruits of a police raid on an
illegal cockfight are now in the custody of a Texas veterinarian.
Dr. David Darter of Crystal City says timid owners are slowly
claiming their gamecocks. Although illegal in the state, cockfights
remain popular. By JOHN MacCORMACK.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-DURANGO (Undated) _ With a movie named ``Durango,'' you knew
there had to be a cattle drive. You just figured it would have been
in 1880s America, not 1939 Ireland. But even with the brogues and
lush dells, ``Durango,'' based on the autobiographical novel by
Irish writer John B. Keane, still has a Western feel. And it is
worthy as the 201st installment of the Hallmark Hall of Fame
series. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   MASEKELA (Houston) _ South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela has
moved around a lot over the years. Since he has returned to his
homeland, he has become something of a national institution. By
RICK MITCHELL.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-GETREAL (Undated) _ With the American high school
sex comedy of late being in more desperate shape than a girl
without a prom date, it's odd that ``Get Real,'' the coolest, most
sophisticated entrant in this dubious sweepstakes would come from
England and would feature being young, gay and conflicted as its
subject. By WESLEY MORRIS.

   STANFORD-MUSEUM (San Francisco) _ The new Cantor Center for
Visual Arts at Stanford University has an impressive exhibition,
``Pacific Arcadia: Images of California, 1600-1915,'' which
continues through June 27. By DAVID BONETTI.
</P>
<P>
   BBC-MUSIC (Undated) _ It's more than a bit humbling to sit down
with the first batch of ``Great Performers of the Twentieth
Century,'' the exceptional new historical series of compact discs
published on the new BBC Legends label and distributed stateside by
Koch International. By ALLAN ULRICH.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS-BLUES (Albany, N.Y.) _ The Great One has quit hockey for
good. John Elway is still contemplating whether or not to join
Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan in retirement. Cal Ripken isn't a
man of steel after all. Depressing times call for desperate
measures, like watching a movie. By STEVE CAMPBELL.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-SHOOTING-LESSONS (San Francisco) _ You'd pray that after
Littleton, the growing national revulsion against firearms would
achieve a critical mass, making radical political measures
possible. You'd hope that people in power would stand up on their
hind legs and shout, ``Melt the damn things down! Never make them
again!'' It won't happen. By SCOTT WINOKUR.

WHAT ABOUT PEER ABUSE AT SCHOOL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've been hearing all the appropriate questions about that
horrifying murder spree at a Colorado high school:
</P>
<P>
   How did a pair of psychopathic teen-agers get their hands on
such a deadly arsenal of guns and explosives?
</P>
<P>
   How did the killers' parents, friends and teachers fail to see
that these young men were walking time bombs who posed a lethal
threat to themselves and to everyone around them?
</P>
<P>
   Why did officials at Columbine High School in Littleton fail to
provide sufficient security to prevent such a rampage?
</P>
<P>
   Why can't society do something to stop the epidemic of ambush
violence that has plagued American schools in recent years?
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and on. In the end, though, every question is
just another way of asking the one question that no one seems able
to answer:
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   When Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris began their mindless, random
assault at Columbine High School the other day, Colorado joined a
growing list of states where schools have suffered such terror:
Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Oregon ...
</P>
<P>
   And the question is always the same: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Too many guns? Too much violence in the media? Too little
discipline at school? Not enough parental involvement at home?
</P>
<P>
   Well, sure, all those factors play a role in such tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another factor, a common thread that seems to run
through these events, and it raises yet another question: How in
the world did these young people become so alienated, so full of
rage, that they would even contemplate such a cataclysmic act of
violence, much less carry it out?
</P>
<P>
   Friends and acquaintances of the two students who shot and
bombed their way through the school have been saying that Klebold,
Harris and their cohorts in the so-called Trenchcoat Mafia were
angry about their treatment by other students, especially athletes.
</P>
<P>
   News reports suggest that there were racist and Nazi overtones
to the Littleton murders. But it is clear that the killers' primary
source of fury was that they were ``picked on'' by kids who
disliked the small band of trenchcoat-wearing misfits.
</P>
<P>
   TV talk-show host Larry King interviewed a girl who had been
friendly with one of the killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would he kill people just because they were athletes?''
asked King, an ardent sports fan and unabashed admirer of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really mean to him,'' the girl replied.
</P>
<P>
   Most kids don't resort to mass murder as retaliation for being
picked on at school, of course, and it goes without saying that no
amount of verbal humiliation can justify violence. No one is
looking to mitigate the horror of what Klebold and Harris did; no
one is looking to minimize their culpability.
</P>
<P>
   If the perpetrators hadn't preempted the judicial process by
taking their own lives, the people of Colorado no doubt would have
and should have demanded the maximum penalty available under the
law.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no mercy for these coldblooded assassins. There can
be no excuses for what they did.
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to understand why such things occur, we must not
overlook the torment they endured at the hands of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Kids who aren't ``cool'' and aren't part of the ``in'' crowd are
all too often treated with disdain by those who are. The ``nerds''
and outsiders who don't wear the right clothes, join the right
clubs or frequent the right hangouts are all too often subjected to
a level of public and private humiliation that can destroy a young
person's already shaky confidence and sense of self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   When the victims of derision complain, they are usually told
that they will just have to live with it; that it's part of growing
up; that life isn't fair.
</P>
<P>
   And those who inflict the humiliation?
</P>
<P>
   Are they ever reprimanded, or even called aside and told that
they have an obligation to show a reasonable amount of respect
toward fellow students _ including those who might seem
``different''?
</P>
<P>
   It seems like a fair question to ask. As long as we're asking
questions.

CBS OFFERS A GOOD RIDE IN `DURANGO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a movie named ``Durango,'' you knew there had to be a
cattle drive. It's a law or something. You just figured it would
have been in 1880s Colorado, not 1939 Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the brogues and lush dells, ``Durango,'' based on
the autobiographical novel by Irish writer John B. Keane, still has
a Western feel. You half expect John Wayne in his ``Quiet Man''
garb to amble in with a ``Wagon ... Ho-oh.''
</P>
<P>
   Sight unseen, you know ``Durango'' (Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern,
CBS) is going to be good. Forget the alphabet networks, the HBOs,
all the other cable outlets. If you want a quality movie on
television, go with anything stamped ``Hallmark.'' And ``Durango''
is worthy as the 201st installment of the Hallmark Hall of Fame
series.
</P>
<P>
   Set in County Kerry just prior to the outset of World War II, it
is the story of Mark Doran (Matt Keeslar, ``The Last Days of
Disco''), who tires of the monopolistic cattle-buying practices in
his hometown and decides to drive his and his neighbors' cattle
over 40 miles of terrain to get a better price in another town. Of
course, the rough Irish countryside and the cattle barons seek to
thwart the young Doran, leading to fires, stampedes, fisticuffs,
you know, everything short of Apaches waiting to attack from the
cliffs. In the end, everyone rides off, not into the sunset, but a
saloon.
</P>
<P>
   Predictable? A bit, but so were some of those great old
Westerns. Kick back for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bergin (``Sleeping with the Enemy,'' ``Patriot Games''),
Brenda Fricker, George Hearn, Nancy St. Alban, Dermot Martin and
Paul Ronan co-star.

</P>
<P>
   ``The Patty Duke Show'' began about four months before the
Beatles landed in New York City, and ended as acid rock was
arriving on the scene. It was a fun little sitcom about cousins,
identical cousins, two of a kind, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patty Duke Show'' ran from September 1963 to August 1966
at 8 p.m. Wednesdays on ABC. Duke, the teen-ager who won the
Academy Award for her spellbinding performance as Helen Keller in
``The Miracle Worker,'' comes back Tuesday night at 9 Eastern (CBS)
in ``The Patty Duke Show: Still Rockin' in Brooklyn Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Patty Lane the wild one grew up to be the drama teacher at good
old Brooklyn Heights High School. Cathy, the proper cousin, returns
from her native Scotland after the death of her husband. The two
re-unite to fight a morally corrupt developer _ their high school
foe _ from closing the school so a new mall can open.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the old cast, even Patty Lane's parents (William
Schallert and Jean Byron) return, although old nemesis Sue Ellen is
played in the telemovie by Cindy Williams (``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'').
</P>
<P>
   The value here is purely nostalgic. This is a so-so movie. Then
again, it was a so-so series.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After an initial report, CBS was very late in cutting back from
regular programming Tuesday to update the high school shooting
situation in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, WRGB, Channel 6 in Albany, N.Y., was forced to stick
with Sally Jesse Raphael while other networks were going to
extended live reports.
</P>
<P>
   It probably didn't matter much, since the best coverage of the
tragedy was on CNN and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Sally's topic: ``I was locked up for punishing my
teen.''

COCKFIGHT RAID IS NO FEAST FOR VETERINARIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Dr. David Darter of the Crystal Veterinary Medical
Center is still waiting for the owners of about 20 fighting cocks
to show up and claim their birds, days after 270 roosters were
seized in a police raid of a huge cockfight.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous owners have been calling his Crystal City office since
the raid Sunday and asking about the confiscated gamecocks. Some
may go unclaimed, but Darter said he was not about to start heating
up the soup kettle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't eat these roosters,'' Darter said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're full of steroids and hormones. Some cockfighters even
used strychnine to keep them all fired up. Chicken soup is out of
the question,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Rooster boarding rates at the clinic are $5 for the first day
and $3 for each subsequent day, and owners will have to pay the
charges to retrieve their birds. The unclaimed birds may soon be
put up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a handful that the sheriff has to give away. Some
people are afraid to claim them for fear they'll be arrested, but
he's not even giving out tickets,'' said the only veterinarian in
Crystal City, a town of 8,200 people southwest of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The raid happened Sunday morning when state troopers, sheriff's
deputies and constables descended upon a crowd of more than 300
people drawn by the blood sport.
</P>
<P>
   The event involved 400 to 500 birds. In addition to the 270
roosters seized, dozens more vanished into the brush in their
owner's hands and more than a 100 were found dead, victims of the
sport for which they are raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was running every which way, and there were just
eight officers at the most,'' said Zavala County Sheriff Eusevio
Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   While dozens of people scrambled into the brush, Salinas said,
the authorities have more than four hours of videotape of cars and
faces of those who were there.
</P>
<P>
   He said charges may be filed against two men thought to have
organized the event.
</P>
<P>
   Cockfighting, although illegal in Texas, is still very popular,
as the guest list revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a county commissioner _ not from my county _ some other
local politicians from surrounding counties, and some school
teachers,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know cockfighting is a culture, and those guys, the
cockfighters, are the real macho type, the tough hombres,'' Darter
said. ``They don't put up with any lip from their wives or anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But when their roosters were impounded, they'd send their
mothers, their wives, their sisters and their daughters to get
them. Like they are afraid to come out and face the music. So the
macho image kind of dissolves,'' he said.

mostly, for bad.

   The National Basketball Association is plodding listlessly
through a season that has as much meaning as an episode of ``Just

   Depressing times call for desperate measures. The only sensible,

   Go into a dark room and shut out the real world. See a movie.
Now showing at a theater _ or coming to a video store _ near you:
</P>

   ``Life'' _ Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence play Ray and Claude,
two men who are wrongfully convicted of murder in Mississippi in
the 1940s. Ray and Claude manage to keep their sense of humor and a

</P>
<P>
   ``Life is Beautiful'' _ Roberto Benigni stars in this Academy
Award-winning film about an overprotective father who convinces his

day when synchronized swimming, snowboarding and softball are
Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' _ Steven Spielberg directs this wringing
drama about Ryan Leaf, whose childishness and churlishness get him
demoted from field general.
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' _ The year is 1957, and the Russians have just
launched Sputnik, and America appears to be losing the space race,
and the only thing that can prevent global destruction is the
Chicago Cubs winning the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' _ Bill Murray gives a deftly subtle portrayal of a
man tormented by how much the New York Knicks have begun to
resemble stone monuments carved into a mountain in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``True Crime'' _ Clint Eastwood directs, produces and stars in
this story about a reporter sent to interview a death-row inmate.
The reporter works frantically to reverse the conviction until he
discovers that the inmate used to be a sports agent.

two evil doctors who are convinced that baby talk holds some of the

O'Neal, and he starts doing movies and making rap records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' _ Adam Sandler stars in a coming-of-age story

   ``Cruel Intentions'' _ Sarah Michelle Gellar portrays Augusta
National and Ryan Phillippe portrays Greg Norman in this trashy
update of ``Dangerous Liaisons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The King and I'' _ Darrell Hammond stars in this Shakespearean

outcome of a fight in advance. Miranda Richardson does a convincing
turn as a boxing judge without a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``10 Things I Hate About You'' _ Philadelphia fans give a warm
welcome to Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb when the Eagles take
him with the No. 2 pick of the NFL draft.
</P>

   ``Hideous Kinky'' _ Kate Winslet stars in one of those English
countryside mood pieces that takes a dramatic twist when a
gum-chomping football coach _ played by Mike Ditka _ tries to trade
all his earthly possessions for a set of dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go'' _ Doug Liman directs this surprising gem of a picture
about an assortment of Los Angeles troublemakers who go out into
the night in search of ways to feel alive. A strange series of
coincidences draws the characters to a Clippers game, compelling
them to buy Nikes and monitor the Hale-Bopp comet.
</P>
<P>

old men who learn the sobering lesson that winning the lottery can
mean ending up with Derrick Coleman on your team.

   With the American high school sex comedy of late being in more

simpler for Steven to maintain a Gremlin farm than the secrecy of
this relationship. He can't tell his best girlfriend, the great
Charlotte Brittain).
</P>
<P>
   When the film's poised tone and occasional staginess threaten to
intrude on the moving, sincere, recognizably true drama, the fact
that the source material comes from a recent work, not some
400-year-old play, keeps it real.

LESSON FROM COLUMBINE HIGH: OUTLAW GUNS

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You would pray that after Littleton, the growing
national revulsion against firearms would make radical political
measures possible.
</P>
<P>
   You would hope the people in power would stand up on their hind
legs and shout, ``Melt the damn things down! Never make them
again!''
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Face it: Littleton was business as usual in America; these
campus bloodbaths are a thing with us, like assassinations in the
1960s. That's the awful truth, and it should stick in every
citizen's craw like a jagged turkey bone.
</P>
<P>
   Before Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold ran amok at Columbine High
School, other crazed boys armed to the teeth behaved with similar
brutality toward students and teachers in Springfield, Ore.;
Fayetteville, Tenn.; Edinboro, Pa.; Jonesboro, Ark.; West Paducah,
Ky.; and Pearl, Miss. You could organize a tour of the nation's
blood-soaked schoolyards, like tours of Civil War battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the laugh Slobodan Milosevic had when he saw the
children fleeing the Colorado high school on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Redemption lies in one direction and one only, but we don't have
the will to go there. This is as contemptible as it is tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie Becker, director of the Legal Community Against Violence
in San Francisco, took the nation's pulse after Littleton and found
it lamentably weak in political resolve to ban firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that this happened in Colorado,'' Becker said,
``at a time when its new governor, Bill Owens, has been very
friendly to the gun lobby and has promised to expand legislation
that would expand the state's concealed-weapon permit law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colorado leaves the question of who should have a concealed
weapon to the sole discretion of police chiefs and sheriffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker said the gun lobby is pushing hard in favor of concealed-
weapon permits in every state without a right-to-carry law.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby is also fine-tuning its vigilance on the issue of
``pre-emption.''
</P>
<P>
   This is legal jargon for the federal law _ specifically, the
purported right to bear arms _ that pre-empts state gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the gun nuts claim, at least. Denver has tough
controls, Becker said. Not so Littleton, a suburb of 35,000 to the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owens also has been encouraging a bill that would pre-empt
places like Denver from regulating guns beyond what the rest of the
state decides to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Becker if there is any chance to enact a national
handgun ban.
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about banning guns altogether. I don't see that,''
Becker said, with the impatience of someone who understands a
problem too well.
</P>
<P>
   What about piecemeal measures? Say you were a fence-sitter
before Littleton and you're a gun-control proponent today. What can
you do?
</P>
<P>
   Call your lawmakers, Becker said. Make it clear to your
representative that he or she should back measures that would make
the widespread illegal trafficking in guns harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get closer to a sane gun policy,'' Becker said, ``with
every shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker also wants to see schools pony up as much as $20,000 each
to buy safety assessment programs. There are plenty of experts out
there who can analyze a school situation, both the physical plant
and the site's collective mentality, and identify the points of
vulnerability. Metal detectors? Maybe. Mental health counselors?
Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   But many schools are hard-pressed for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the philanthropic and business communities should offer
the resources,'' Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   There was urgency in her voice.

 &HT;    Despite top actors, trilogy is a lightweight
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Showtime's promising-looking ``Love Songs'' doesn't stay
promising for long: It arranges its cliches early and often and
never looks back.
</P>
<P>
   It should've been a contender, as one of these characters would
just love to say. A trilogy of interlocking tales scripted by
Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Charles Fuller (``A Soldier's
Story'') and starring a rotating cast that includes Andre Braugher,
Louis Gossett Jr., Lynn Whitfield and Robert Townsend (Braugher,
Gossett and Townsend also take directing turns), ``Love Songs''
looks like the kind of quality black-themed drama TV almost never
makes.
</P>
<P>
   The three stories unfold on and off ``the Avenue,'' a commercial
strip that runs through a working class African-American
neighborhood. It's a leafy, urban Anywhere, a kind of
postcard-imperfect place where everyone walks, talks and squawks.
</P>
<P>
   That point is driven home _ then underscored, then underlined,
then italicized _ in the opening tale. Otis (Townsend), a club
boxer hoping for a break into the big time, jogs down the street
during his morning run. Everyone calls out to him, ``Hey, champ!''
A grocer tosses him an apple. A kid playfully spars with him, after
which Otis admonishes, ``Get to school, youngblood.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this story of a boxer looking for a break in a dirty
business so he can raise a family and live happily ever after is
more like an after-school special for adults. Wisdom is mouthed as
if read straight from workplace Post-It notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel like you're sailing alone, you're usually in the
same boat as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got each other and the baby and that's all that
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not all that matters when you have two hours of TV to
fill. The two other stories don't offer much more than the first:
One follows an obnoxious truck-stand grocer (Braugher) trying to
woo a beautiful regular (Whitfield), whose brutal assault helps
bring the two together; the other centers on the domestic violence
that challenges the woman's brother-in-law (Gossett).
</P>
<P>
   The pieces are all here for some worthy melodrama, and Whitfield
brings glory to every scene she's in. But anything that begins to
resonate, like the women's assaults, is so quickly turned trivial
that the melodrama devolves into soap opera. ``Love Songs''
promised more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Songs''
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m. Sunday on Showtime.

CALIFORNIA REVISITED AT STANFORD MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A season doesn't go by without an exhibition
dealing with some aspect of California art in regional museums. The
Oakland Museum, which bills itself as ``The Museum of California,''
usually takes the prize for such shows.
</P>
<P>
   It has both a focused agenda and an unsurpassed collection of
California art on its side. Last year's ``Art of the Gold Rush,''
organized on the 150th anniversary of the event that launched the
Golden State, was the exemplary Oakland Museum event.
</P>
<P>
   But Oakland is not alone in mounting California shows. The new
Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University (the former
Stanford University Art Museum) has followed its inaugural
exhibitions with an impressive entry in Californiana. ``Pacific
Arcadia: Images of California, 1600-1915,'' which continues through
June 27, is not only the most ambitious exhibition ever to
originate at Stanford, it is also one of the most critical
exhibitions to address the California experience through art ever
to appear in regional museums.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Stanford's new American art curator, Claire Perry,
the show and catalog (Oxford University Press, $25 paper) are
generally fine but univocal examples of the new analytic art
history. Applied to a subject _ historical California art _ that
has largely escaped such scrutiny, probably because it has been
seen as too marginal to merit such investigation, the exhibition
and catalog demonstrate that no subject is too minor to be run
through the deconstructionist's mill.
</P>
<P>
   The full force of Perry's thesis is more evident in the catalog
than in the exhibition, but even from the show's succinct text
panels you can easily tell that images usually used for
celebratory, boosterish or nostalgic purposes are being looked at
freshly for the political, economic, cultural and racial biases
they carry, whether consciously or not.
</P>
<P>
   In Perry's view, no image is innocent or free of the values of
the dominant class that makes, commissions, buys or uses it.
</P>
<P>
   Every image, even the most innocuous, serves as propaganda for
the elite in power at the time of its making. Perry and her
colleagues in the new art history believe that it is the task of
the art historian to unlock the unexamined bias behind images to
expose their hidden ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Such a process is largely healthy _ Americans particularly have
enjoyed a false sense of their own historical innocence _ but its
application to individual images sometimes borders on the
ludicrous. In Perry's relentless reading of the first 315 years of
California history, there is hardly a painting, print or photograph
created that doesn't bear propaganda's stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Artists frequently have ideas of their own that contradict
prevailing master narratives. What is interesting, especially in
art from the 19th century to the present, is how artists undercut
the official line with their own subversive takes on events and
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Perry suggests that artists are either dupes or willing
collaborators with the power elite. Granted, none of the artists in
the Stanford show were rebels. Most of them knew who paid their
bills and they gave their patrons what they wanted. But perhaps
some of them were legitimately thrilled with the spectacular
California landscape and endeavored to capture a sense of it for
audiences while at the same time they served the Southern Pacific
Railroad, which benefited from both permanent settlers and
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Perry's scrutiny is largely welcome. From the start, in
her view, California was a promoter's scam, a series of sites _
gold field, bonanza ranch, tourist destination, urban center _
exploited for the profit of mine owners, growers, railroad tycoons
and developers who dominated the Golden State's politics and
economy, then as now.
</P>
<P>
   Her work is most valuable when it addresses how imagery changes
over time _ for instance, that of California's original Spanish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Perry contrasts early images of Monterey made by Spanish, French
and English observers. The 1791 watercolor by the Spaniard Jose
Cardero shows a well-organized and smoothly functioning frontier
settlement dominated by the strong walls of the Monterey Presidio.
Another 1791 drawing, commemorating the 1786 visit of the Comte de
La Perouse to Monterey, tells another story entirely. The rude
village is populated exclusively by monks and cowed Indians, shown
as only partly civilized, i.e., Europeanized.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Monterey is depicted as a frontier outpost
almost asking to be taken over. Two English watercolors show it
even more ripe for the plucking, a tiny village unlikely to resist
superior force.
</P>
<P>
   The bias that the Spanish were decadent, lazy and fanatical and
that the mixed-breed Mexicans who descended from them were
incapable of achieving a state of civilization only accelerated
after the discovery of gold brought thousands of Anglo-Saxons over
the Rockies to seek their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Between then and now there was a period when California's
Spanish heritage was valorized. Starting in the 1870s and
continuing through the 1930s, California tourism was inextricably
caught up with the myth of Old California. Missions, ranchos,
tempestuous vaqueros and sultry (but chaste) senoritas became the
key to the tourist dollar, and interest in Spanish California, by
then safely dead, sparked the production of images of the colorful
past.
</P>
<P>
   The section of the show devoted to the rediscovered Spanish
heritage is one of the most interesting. Paintings such as Charles
Christian Nahl's ``The Fandango'' (1873), which luridly depicts a
fiesta on the old hacienda, is a veritable encyclopedia of
stereotypes. Such pictures parallel the orientalizing tendencies of
European art of the period, with Spanish and Californios
substituted for Arabs. Paintings and photographs of missions in
ruin, including a handsome selection by Carleton Watkins, function
as romantic readymades for late 19th-century Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens with maps dating back to the 17th century that
represent California as an island, suggesting that from the start
California was a mythic land apart. It moves swiftly through five
sections featuring images of the Gold Rush, California as the
``Cornucopia of the World,'' a reappreciation of the wilderness as
spiritual antidote to the modern city, the rediscovery of the
Spanish heritage, and San Francisco, Pacific metropolis.

 FOR RELEASE: APRIL 25 or thereafter  
 By PETER GODWIN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It has become a televisual cliche. The 45-second parade of
refugees' vignettes, followed by the reporters' brow-creased
displays of concern. Then the question from the anchor, in response
to which reporters soften their voices to tell us how the personal
dimension of the tragedy pierced their professional husks.
 &HT;    Except it really isn't so. The backstage truth is that no matter
how tenderhearted reporters may be at the outset, any capacity for
empathy is all but drowned by the sheer flow of suffering during
wartime.
 &HT;    Most war reporters must cultivate a controlled schizophrenia to
survive. We develop a sangfroid, a mordant humor and a studied
machismo, much the same way that cops and ER doctors do.
 &HT;    As we interview dozens of victims, usually through interpreters,
the barbarities start to merge, to become prosaic even, especially
as deadlines loom. Garnish this with the logistics of filing the
story and the fierce competition with other channels, and soon the
individual plights we witness flash by like passing traffic.
 &HT;    I learned this in my years as a foreign correspondent in Africa.
It was my job to try to get you involved in the conflicts there, to
engage you in the way that you have now become so engaged in
Kosovo. Mostly, I failed.
 &HT;    The wars I covered were obscure. They were in places that did
not affect ``vital interests.'' The conflicts were devoid of the
high-tech footage taken by missile-mounted cameras; to outsiders
the people involved looked and sounded confusingly alike. Their
courage _ the kind of courage presented by a life with nothing left
to lose but itself _ was often mistaken for the myth of Third World
fatalism. Worst of all, in the atrocity ratings war, both the
casualties and the perpetrators were black.
 &HT;    And so I found you weren't particularly interested in an old
chief in Matabeleland, standing against a blood-orange sun and
defying a squad of murderous soldiers. ``I must speak the truth and
shame the devil,'' he pronounced.
 &HT;    Nor were you interested in Bongali Dube, a thin young man who
led me up a small hill to a pile of bones. ``This is my father,''
he said, as if introducing me to a living man. He had been warned
by soldiers not to bury the body, and it had been eaten by dogs.
 &HT;    Nor were you even interested in the Ugandan town of Mbale,
nestled beneath the towering green cone of Mount Elgon, where the
old Edwardian clock tower had been used as a backdrop for a firing
squad; corpses were still sprawled against it. When the clock
struck noon they shivered with each chime.
 &HT;    The hospital there was empty, except for those too ill to flee.
A rivulet of blood still flowing from under a door led us to a
white-coated mound of executed doctors. But the restless
searchlight of international attention had flicked elsewhere.
 &HT;    How can anyone decide what, in this parade of Hogarthian horrors
all clamoring for attention, to zoom in on? Whose suffering do we
broadcast as representative? The family whose father was dispatched
in a particularly gory way? The one that speaks English? Of course,
the most telegenic win the audition.
 &HT;    The ``victims'' instinctively understand this. They are not
interested in hand-holding or in our bogus words of small comfort;
they have no use for our threadbare empathy. They know that come
nightfall we will be back in the Hotel Splendide, while they still
sleep in the open. They understand that we are simply there to
amplify their suffering to a far wider audience. I remember a man
in Matabeleland.
 &HT;    ``We hope you put our problems on the World Service,'' he said
in halting English. ``Otherwise our future will run out. Surely,
surely.'' He gave a solemn bow and shook my hand.
 &HT;    But this faith is often misplaced. What light we can shed on
refugees' plight usually falls too late. The slow and deliberate
shuffle toward the ethnic endgame in Kosovo, so obvious to all of
us who had been there, elbowed its way to the top of the evening
lineup only when it was already too late to prevent.
 &HT;    And the attention span of war correspondents is only as long as
that of our viewers. When your finger hits the remote, we must
leave and seek out a more entertaining tragedy.
 &HT;    The terrible reality is that the more visible the suffering, the
more we get on the air. We grow with the story. So we end up as
practitioners of the ``something must be done'' school of
journalism, automatic advocates of intervention _ as much out of
professional self-interest as genuine humanitarian concern.
 &HT;    Most of us are attracted to this job by the glamour of it. But
in the end, protracted exposure to violence and tragedy can be
highly corrosive. Even those who no longer deeply feel other
people's suffering become prisoners of their own harrowing
anecdotes. Like Scheherazade in ``The Arabian Nights,'' we live for
only as long as our stories engage you.
 &HT;    So is Kosovo a ``good'' war for the media? The viewing

 FOR RELEASE: APRIL 25 or thereafter  
 By PETER GODWIN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It has become a televisual cliche. The 45-second parade of
refugees' vignettes, followed by the reporters' brow-creased
displays of concern. Then the question from the anchor, in response
to which reporters soften their voices to tell us how the personal
dimension of the tragedy pierced their professional husks.
 &HT;    Except it really isn't so. The backstage truth is that no matter
how tenderhearted reporters may be at the outset, any capacity for
empathy is all but drowned by the sheer flow of suffering during
wartime.
 &HT;    Most war reporters must cultivate a controlled schizophrenia to
survive. We develop a sangfroid, a mordant humor and a studied
machismo, much the same way that cops and ER doctors do.
 &HT;    As we interview dozens of victims, usually through interpreters,
the barbarities start to merge, to become prosaic even, especially
as deadlines loom. Garnish this with the logistics of filing the
story and the fierce competition with other channels, and soon the
individual plights we witness flash by like passing traffic.
 &HT;    I learned this in my years as a foreign correspondent in Africa.
It was my job to try to get you involved in the conflicts there, to
engage you in the way that you have now become so engaged in
Kosovo. Mostly, I failed.
 &HT;    The wars I covered were obscure. They were in places that did
not affect ``vital interests.'' The conflicts were devoid of the
high-tech footage taken by missile-mounted cameras; to outsiders
the people involved looked and sounded confusingly alike. Their
courage _ the kind of courage presented by a life with nothing left
to lose but itself _ was often mistaken for the myth of Third World
fatalism. Worst of all, in the atrocity ratings war, both the
casualties and the perpetrators were black.
 &HT;    And so I found you weren't particularly interested in an old
chief in Matabeleland, standing against a blood-orange sun and
defying a squad of murderous soldiers. ``I must speak the truth and
shame the devil,'' he pronounced.
 &HT;    Nor were you interested in Bongali Dube, a thin young man who
led me up a small hill to a pile of bones. ``This is my father,''
he said, as if introducing me to a living man. He had been warned
by soldiers not to bury the body, and it had been eaten by dogs.
 &HT;    Nor were you even interested in the Ugandan town of Mbale,
nestled beneath the towering green cone of Mount Elgon, where the
old Edwardian clock tower had been used as a backdrop for a firing
squad; corpses were still sprawled against it. When the clock
struck noon they shivered with each chime.
 &HT;    The hospital there was empty, except for those too ill to flee.
A rivulet of blood still flowing from under a door led us to a
white-coated mound of executed doctors. But the restless
searchlight of international attention had flicked elsewhere.
 &HT;    How can anyone decide what, in this parade of Hogarthian horrors
all clamoring for attention, to zoom in on? Whose suffering do we
broadcast as representative? The family whose father was dispatched
in a particularly gory way? The one that speaks English? Of course,
the most telegenic win the audition.
 &HT;    The ``victims'' instinctively understand this. They are not
interested in hand-holding or in our bogus words of small comfort;
they have no use for our threadbare empathy. They know that come
nightfall we will be back in the Hotel Splendide, while they still
sleep in the open. They understand that we are simply there to
amplify their suffering to a far wider audience. I remember a man
in Matabeleland.
 &HT;    ``We hope you put our problems on the World Service,'' he said
in halting English. ``Otherwise our future will run out. Surely,
surely.'' He gave a solemn bow and shook my hand.
 &HT;    But this faith is often misplaced. What light we can shed on
refugees' plight usually falls too late. The slow and deliberate
shuffle toward the ethnic endgame in Kosovo, so obvious to all of
us who had been there, elbowed its way to the top of the evening
lineup only when it was already too late to prevent.
 &HT;    And the attention span of war correspondents is only as long as
that of our viewers. When your finger hits the remote, we must
leave and seek out a more entertaining tragedy.
 &HT;    The terrible reality is that the more visible the suffering, the
more we get on the air. We grow with the story. So we end up as
practitioners of the ``something must be done'' school of
journalism, automatic advocates of intervention _ as much out of
professional self-interest as genuine humanitarian concern.
 &HT;    Most of us are attracted to this job by the glamour of it. But
in the end, protracted exposure to violence and tragedy can be
highly corrosive. Even those who no longer deeply feel other
people's suffering become prisoners of their own harrowing
anecdotes. Like Scheherazade in ``The Arabian Nights,'' we live for
only as long as our stories engage you.
 &HT;    So is Kosovo a ``good'' war for the media? The viewing
experience can feel like a session with a Sony Play Station
followed by a Bombing Tactics 101 seminar. And there are only so
many times you can watch an F-16 take off from Aviano before you
reach for the remote.
 &HT;    But in their favor, the Albanians make empathy-positive
refugees, and there is the added frisson of Russian saber rattling
just out of theater.
 &HT;    Although it's hard to imagine that their situation could be any
worse, in one sense the Kosovars are a lucky people. An accident of
geography has ordained that their fate, unlike that of so many,
many others who suffer in media silence, is relevant to our vital
interests.
 &HT;    And so for the moment at least, their cries are heard across the
world.

<P>
   In the three weeks of war in the Balkans it is estimated that
NATO planes have flown 6,000 missions and 800 cruise missiles have
been launched.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic result is that the Kosovo conflict has turned into a
catastrophe, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians leaving
their homes and enduring appalling hardships. Many of them have
died in bombings or in the crossfire of fighting between the Kosovo
Liberation Army and Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   With the war sowing death and destruction throughout Yugoslavia,
the damage to it has been estimated at $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the conflict, many people warned that a military
operation against Yugoslavia would be a mistake, an unwarranted and
disproportionate measure, and urged a political solution. NATO took
a different course, which has resulted in an ignominious failure _
a defeat for NATO and for the policy of force generally.
</P>
<P>
   This could have untold consequences for Yugoslavia and for all
of Europe, unless urgent steps are taken to stop this madness.
Henry Kissinger, who was initially critical of President Clinton's
actions, is now saying that if NATO is to avoid breaking up it
cannot afford a defeat in Yugoslavia. He is apparently little
concerned about what would happen to the Albanians or to the Serbs
in the event of NATOs ``victory.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the leaders of the alliance speak of a political
solution, they in fact mean Yugoslavia's capitulation. But that is
just another dangerous illusion, a way to unpredictable,
catastrophic developments. The only alternative to a wider conflict
is a search for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   As I am writing this, news agencies report that the Turkish
authorities are conducting a major offensive against Kurdish
rebels. The long-seething conflict has erupted with fresh force,
but no one is saying a word. What will the United States and NATO
do? Give more weapons to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   And in Colombia, another friend of the United States, where
20,000 people die each year and the number of refugees has exceeded
1 million, even U.S. newspapers are wondering why the United States
chooses to ignore the responsibility of Colombia's government for
that tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, why? This is more than just a double standard. A much
broader hidden agenda is now being revealed. It is clear that the
Kosovo problem could have been resolved politically and that NATO's
military action can only make things worse. It is also clear that
this is a no-win situation for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So why was the United States in such a hurry, why was it not
interested in political solutions? On the eve of NATO's 50th
anniversary, the Kosovo conflict is cynically being used to show
the world who's the boss.
</P>
<P>
   The international community is given to understand that the U.N.
Security Council and other international organizations are
ineffective, indeed helpless, thus forcing the United States to
``lead'' in this way. Even worse, to make arbitrary action look
legitimate, the conflict is being internationalized and other
countries are drawn into it, in a way that compromises them. But
that logic is fatally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the United States
has been boycotting all attempts to reform the United Nations and
circumventing its Security Council. It has also thwarted efforts to
create a new European security architecture, as called for in the
Charter of Paris, thus forcing Europe to accept NATO's ``security''
services.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo conflict, the United States has defied the opinion
of Russia, China and India, which together represent half the
population of the world. It has shown its European allies that
Europe remains a political dwarf, that even its economic might
cannot stop U.S. hegemony. That, today, is how Washington envisions
a new world order.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior has already done serious damage to the
international system. The danger is becoming real that the Yugoslav
tragedy could engulf the entire Balkan region and even all of
Europe. Even if the conflict is stopped soon, it is clear that the
world could hardly go back to what it was before March 23.
</P>
<P>
   A new arms race appears inevitable. There are dozens of
countries where this ``model'' can be replicated _ creating and
exacerbating latent conflicts and then ``settling'' them with
bombs, cruise missiles and ``surgical strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there was an imperfect world order based on
international organizations trying to resolve crises politically.
Now, nations will want to rely on arsenals of weapons. And since
sophisticated modern weapons are too expensive for most countries,
they will not play by the rules of the rich; instead, they will
seek weapons of mass destruction _ nuclear, chemical and
biological, which can be cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, terrorism _ the cheapest weapon. No one can hope
to protect themselves from this dread threat with purely technical
or military means.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear to all that this is a road to disaster. Not
only Russian politicians but most ordinary Russians as well have
been badly shaken by the conflict. It is giving ammunition to the
forces of the past, those who were always against new thinking and
resented any reforms, any cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the Russian people are wise enough not to
allow their country to be drawn into a war. But it would be
irresponsible to ignore the fact that the danger of a wider
conflagration is growing. Of course, we should keep a clear head,
but Russia will now have to rethink a great deal in its strategy,
its treaties and certainly its relations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be impossible to overcome the crisis at no cost _
but overcome it we must. The way out is to resume efforts to build
a new world order based on equitable cooperation of different
civilizations. No one has given NATO the kind of functions that it
has arrogated to itself and seems ready to proclaim as the basis of
its new doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Washington must resist the urge to try to manage increasing
global complexity with police operations. We must not condemn the
world to disorder.

chooses to ignore the responsibility of Colombia's government for
that tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, why? This is more than just a double standard. A much
broader hidden agenda is now being revealed. It is clear that the
Kosovo problem could have been resolved politically and that NATO's
military action can only make things worse. It is also clear that
this is a no-win situation for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So why was the United States in such a hurry, why was it not
interested in political solutions? On the eve of NATO's 50th
anniversary, the Kosovo conflict is cynically being used to show
the world who's the boss.
</P>
<P>
   The international community is given to understand that the U.N.
Security Council and other international organizations are
ineffective, indeed helpless, thus forcing the United States to
``lead'' in this way. Even worse, to make arbitrary action look
legitimate, the conflict is being internationalized and other
countries are drawn into it, in a way that compromises them. But
that logic is fatally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the United States
has been boycotting all attempts to reform the United Nations and
circumventing its Security Council. It has also thwarted efforts to
create a new European security architecture, as called for in the
Charter of Paris, thus forcing Europe to accept NATO's ``security''
services.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo conflict, the United States has defied the opinion
of Russia, China and India, which together represent half the
population of the world. It has shown its European allies that
Europe remains a political dwarf, that even its economic might
cannot stop U.S. hegemony. That, today, is how Washington envisions
a new world order.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior has already done serious damage to the
international system. The danger is becoming real that the Yugoslav
tragedy could engulf the entire Balkan region and even all of
Europe. Even if the conflict is stopped soon, it is clear that the
world could hardly go back to what it was before March 23.
</P>
<P>
   A new arms race appears inevitable. There are dozens of
countries where this ``model'' can be replicated _ creating and
exacerbating latent conflicts and then ``settling'' them with
bombs, cruise missiles and ``surgical strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there was an imperfect world order based on
international organizations trying to resolve crises politically.
Now, nations will want to rely on arsenals of weapons. And since
sophisticated modern weapons are too expensive for most countries,
they will not play by the rules of the rich; instead, they will
seek weapons of mass destruction _ nuclear, chemical and
biological, which can be cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, terrorism _ the cheapest weapon. No one can hope
to protect themselves from this dread threat with purely technical
or military means.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear to all that this is a road to disaster. Not
only Russian politicians but most ordinary Russians as well have
been badly shaken by the conflict. It is giving ammunition to the
forces of the past, those who were always against new thinking and
resented any reforms, any cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the Russian people are wise enough not to
allow their country to be drawn into a war. But it would be
irresponsible to ignore the fact that the danger of a wider
conflagration is growing. Of course, we should keep a clear head,
but Russia will now have to rethink a great deal in its strategy,
its treaties and certainly its relations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be impossible to overcome the crisis at no cost _
but overcome it we must. The way out is to resume efforts to build
a new world order based on equitable cooperation of different
civilizations. No one has given NATO the kind of functions that it
has arrogated to itself and seems ready to proclaim as the basis of
its new doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Washington must resist the urge to try to manage increasing
global complexity with police operations. We must not condemn the
world to disorder.

SHIFTING ATTITUDES RAISE HOPES OF INVESTORS IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese stock market is a lot like the Red Sox:
Periodically it teases you into thinking it's going to do something
great, only to crush your hopes in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, the Nikkei, the main Japanese
market index, has risen 15 percent; small-cap stocks in Japan are
up 45 percent. The question for investors: Is this another in a
series of false starts or is it the beginning of a bona fide rally?
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with a variety of Japan specialists have turned up
something like a consensus: There are genuine reasons to be
optimistic about Japan but don't order your World Series tickets
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Warren, a money manager at Putnam Investments in Boston,
has been following Japanese companies for 20 years. ``For the first
time in my history Japanese executives are waking up to the fact
that they have to make a profit,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is one of a number of investors who are excited by what
seems to be a revolution under way in Japan's private sector.
Companies that once believed the only thing that mattered was
building market share have dropped that notion in favor of a much
more American way of viewing the world.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to Japan, Maureen Allyn, chief economist at
Scudder Kemper Investments, noticed that about half of the
companies she met with had investor relations executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started to see that in Europe in the early '90s,
I pooh-poohed it,'' she says. ``In fact, it actually turned out to
be significant.''
</P>
<P>
   It was significant, says Allyn, because it signaled a new
mindset. It meant that companies were concerned about shareholders
and finding ways to boost shareholder value. Other signs of change
are also visible.
</P>
<P>
   A number of big companies, including Sony and Toshiba, have
announced major US-style restructuring plans, including job cuts.
Merger activity tripled in Japan last year and this year promises
to be bigger. Investors love all of this reshuffling because the
end result should be stronger, more profitable companies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States went down this path in the 1980s and the stock
market boomed; Europe is doing it in the '90s and the markets have
responded favorably. Is Japan going to be next?
</P>
<P>
   Not right away, say money managers. First the Japanese need to
fix their economy. That won't be easy. The Japanese economy has
been in trouble since 1991. Growth since then has averaged 1
percent a year; the United States has done roughly three times
better over the same stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Japanese economy shrank nearly 3 percent and just
this week the International Monetary Fund predicted a 1.4 percent
contraction for 1999. ``There is little reason to think any
recovery is under way in Japan, much less a sustainable one,'' says
Francisco Larios, an economist with Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in
Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Japan's problems is a familiar one: the banking
system is a mess; national and local governments are deeply in
debt; and deregulation is only in its infancy. The government has
cut taxes, cut interest rates, and boosted spending, but so far the
results are tough to spot. Larios said he thinks the Japanese
economy could shrink again next year, a third straight year of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the positive steps taken by the corporate sector
could make things worse in the short run, say economists.
Cost-conscious companies may slash capital spending and fire more
workers, pushing the jobless rate above the current record of 4.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, however, most money managers are more optimistic.
They expect the new way of thinking on the corporate side to lead
to a similar mental restructuring on the government side. When that
happens, the investment opportunities could be big, says Warren of
Putnam. ``There's a huge potential in Japan,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Just when this potential might be realized is difficult to say.
The best advice for investors might be the same advice given each
year to Red Sox fans: Be patient. Eventually you will be rewarded.
</P>

The Red Herring
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Boston Partners Asset Management has lost a key mutual fund
management contract that helped put the firm on the map four years
ago and accounts for 23 percent of assets under management today.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Partners, formed by Desmond Heathwood and other former
Boston Co. managers who bolted from the firm in 1995, will be
replaced as advisers of the $3.6 billion Smith Barney Premium Total
Return Fund on Monday. Boston Partners manages a total of $15.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fund trustees voted April 15 to replace Boston Partners with the
in-house Salomon Brothers Asset Management on an interim basis and
to ask shareholders to approve the firm as a permanent new
subadviser at a meeting June 30. Salomon Smith Barney is part of
Citigroup Inc.
</P>
<P>
   An internal memo at SSB Citi Asset Management cited the ``recent
challenges presented to our (financial consultants) and their
clients by the underperformance'' of the fund as a reason for the
change.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which invests in large, value-oriented stocks, earned
just 6.2 percent in 1998 and has roughly broken even so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Partners spokeswoman said the firm ``very much valued
and appreciated our relationship with Salomon Smith Barney'' and
understood ``the business reasons for bringing their fund
in-house.''

BABY BOOMERS POWERING MARKET RISE

<P>
   They revolutionized music in the 1960s, protested to end the
Vietnam War in the 1970s, and made two-income families fashionable
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with retirement pressing in on them, the nation's 76
million baby boomers are changing the stock market as well,
powering it to previously unthinkable heights as they pour money
into investments for their approaching golden years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average has doubled since November
1995, flying beyond the 10,000 milestone last month and shattering
records almost daily since. The Dow rose Thursday for a third
straight day, gaining 145.76 points and achieving yet another
all-time high, 10,727.18. The Nasdaq Composite Index, a leading
indicator of the high-technology industry, stumbled Monday but
rebounded smartly, posting its strongest three-day rally in a
decade to finish up Thursday at 2561.61.
</P>
<P>
   Experts hard-pressed to explain the market's remarkable feats
point to conventional economic theory, which holds that stocks are
propelled by a unique combination of low interest rates and
inflation, rising productivity, and a US economy enjoying an
unprecedented peacetime expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But these explanations go only so far. A growing number of
market watchers link the irrepressible stock market to the
country's most significant demographic phenomenon: A baby boom
generation of Americans born after World War II who are now between
the ages of 35 and 53.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a wave of immigrants in the 19th century changed
American cities, the generation that once protested the
establishment is having a huge impact on Wall Street as they enter
their peak investing years. Boomers are behind the torrent of money
that has flooded into stock mutual funds and fueled an explosion in
pension-fund assets, which have more than doubled since 1992, to
$5.9 trillion, due not only to higher stock values but to a wave of
contributions to 401(k) plans by boomers and their employers.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not over yet: They will account for $9 trillion of the
$10 trillion growth of all invested assets over the next five
years, according to the discount brokerage firm, Charles Schwab
Corp. Boomers currently hold about one-third of all invested
assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a self-fulfilling momentum cycle,'' said Zhiwu Chen, a
finance professor at Ohio State University, whose research shows
that baby boomers are a ``major factor'' fueling the bull market
which began in the early 1980s, as the first members of the
baby-boom generation, born in 1946, were facing 40.
</P>
<P>
   A stock market moved as often by psychology as by economic
events appears at times to be soaring simply because the `Me
Generation' wants _ even needs _ it to. ``The stock market has
bailed a lot of boomers out of a lifetime of not saving money,''
said Walker Smith, managing partner of Yankelovich Partners Inc., a
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Steven and Stacie Elliott, both age 44, are typical. They are
socking away $1,200 a month _ twice that in a good month _ into
their already considerable portfolio invested mainly in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Having met later in life, they began to worry about retiring
soon after marrying two years ago. Stacie Elliott works part-time
as a tutor. Her husband, an engineer at Xiox Corp., a high-tech
company in Manchester, N.H., earns close to $100,000 a year. Since
they have no children, she can spend part of her day in their home
watching stock reports on the CNBC channel so that she can get more
involved in investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 20, you think (money) is always going to be coming
in,'' she said. ``But when you're older, you start to realize you
don't have as much time, so you get more serious about saving.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Elliotts, boomers typically own homes and have paid off
a portion of their mortgages at the same time earning power is
peaking and _ for older baby boomers _ their children are
graduating from college.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-fourths of all boomers surveyed in 1996 by the
Investment Company Institute, a Washington trade group, own mutual
funds invested in stocks. The typical boomer earns a household
income of $60,000 and has $45,000 in investments.
</P>
<P>
   While their parents actually have bigger investment portfolios,
boomers are at a phase of life which requires that they withdraw
funds, or put them into more conservative investments like bonds.
Their children's wealth, in contrast, is expected to grow
tremendously in future years, investment experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of accumulating their assets, they've only really
just begun,'' said Sandra West, director of the Investment Company
Institute's market and policy research.
</P>
<P>
   A boomer-driven stock market is dismissed by mainstream
economists, who contend that low interest rates are the fuel for
the market. Historically, when interest rates are low, bonds pay
poorly and drive investors into stocks, which promise _ but do not
guarantee _ better returns. ``Stocks sell against bonds all the
time,'' and currently ``bonds aren't rewarding people,'' said
William Shiebler, vice chairman of the Boston mutual-fund company,
Putnam Investments. The boomer theory ``doesn't hold water.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear that boomers play a huge role in the surge of
stock investing. In the past three years, stock funds attracted an
average $200 billion each year _ up from average yearly inflows of
$44 billion in the early 1990s. Contributions to 401(k) and similar
retirement plans rose continually during the first half of the
decade, from $76 billion in 1990 to $117 billion in 1995, federal
data show. At the same time, there was a substantial rise in the
percentage of boomers' portfolios in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics is a factor behind the favorable markets,''
said Ken Leibler, president Liberty Financial Cos., which manages
around $62 billion in investments.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, large stock market gains, year after year, have
padded portfolios for all investors.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen's research, buttressed by econometric models, attempts
to explain the unusually high level of the overall market _ as well
as a spiraling prices of blue-chip stocks. ``Companies have been
increasing earnings by a few percentage points'' a year, Chen said,
``but the demand has been getting stronger and stronger,'' causing
stocks to be ``priced more than they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhiwu (pronounced Ji-wu) Chen is not a member of America's baby
boom generation. But he could fit the demographic profile. Born in
the countryside in Hunan province of China, he came to Yale
University in 1986 for graduate school, eventually settling in
Ohio. Now age 37, Chen has two young daughters and a wife who he
said insists they save for their girls' education and for their own
retirement. Chen is also at the height of his career: He has
accepted a post at Yale and promotion to full professor of finance,
starting in July. He is also an investment consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's baby boom study, originally published in the Journal of
Business in 1993 and recently updated, used the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index to track the stock market through the end of 1998. He
found the index moved in tandem with an increase in the average age
of the US population over 20 years old. Aging boomers accounted for
more than one-third of the market's recent rise _ a strong
correlation in academic research. He reached a similar conclusion
about housing prices, which rose when boomers entered home-buying
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they get older,'' Chen explained, ``the demand for housing
will decrease and the demand for financial assets will increase.
After retirement, the demand for housing will decline dramatically
and at the same time they'll also move assets from the stock market
to relatively safer assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lo, a professor of finance at the Sloan School of
Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, agreed
that boomers ``have an effect'' on the market's level.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he said, the market's high returns recently have
made investors ``more willing to go into the stock market.''
Investors today, Lo said, are not as ``risk-averse'' as earlier
investors who have seen market drops.
</P>
<P>
   But the boomers' market magic may not last forever. Just as they
are expected to create a fiscal crisis in the Social Security fund
when they retire in droves, the bubble may burst as they begin to
withdraw their assets as they leave the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Chen doesn't predict market levels. But, he said, after 2005 or
2010, there will be ``less and less new money coming in and more
money going out of the stock market.''

BEST NOT TO PUT EDUCATION FUND ALL IN ONE BASKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 25, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 49-year-old woman with an 11-year-old son who will be
going to college in seven years. I have a total of $146,000 in a
401(k) plan invested in nine different Fidelity stock funds, and a
Roth IRA of $35,000 divided evenly among Fidelity Puritan, Fidelity
Magellan, Fidelity Value and Fidelity Growth and Income funds. I
contribute $9,500 a year to the 401(k) and $2,000 a year to the
IRA. I have $25,000 in non-retirement savings, all of it invested
in Magellan, and $76,000 in a UTMA account for my son's education,
with this money divided evenly between Fidelity Blue Chip Growth
and Fidelity Growth and Income. Are my investments appropriately
allocated to allow me to send my son to a four-year private college
and to retire in 16 years with an annual income stream of $40,000?
Should I adjust my allocations in my 401(k)? I have too many funds
to keep track of. My company offers only Fidelity funds.
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's start with the education account. You're in good shape
there. According to the Princeton Review publication Paying For
College Without Going Broke, the projection of costs for a
four-year private college education beginning in 2006 will be
$128,475 (starting at $29,808 in the first year and escalating to
$34,506 in the final year). If your son's UTMA account grows at an
average annual rate of 8 percent, it would amount to $130,250 in
seven years, which is to say that you have slightly overfunded it.
</P>
<P>
   There are worse problems to have. An example of a worse problem
would be a severe stock market downturn that would threaten the
projected growth. For that reason, I suggest you make some major
changes in that portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   I would retain about one third in Fidelity Growth and Income,
divide another third among Fidelity Puritan and Fidelity Asset
Manager, and put the final third in Fidelity GNMA. Moreover, every
two years or so, I would move a little more out of the stock fund
and a little more into the balanced and fixed-income funds. Even if
this strategy threatens the projected 8 percent growth rate, your
son should be in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course you have probably heard by now that the money would
have been better saved in your own name, a strategy that would have
increased your son's ability to win financial aid, but at this
point what has been done is done and you can't reverse the moves,
so the point is moot in your case.)
</P>
<P>
   As for your own retirement savings, on the surface it seems
you'll be in good shape. If you presume 8 percent average annual
portfolio growth and ongoing contributions over 16 years, the pool
would grow to $981,569; using a more optimistic 10 percent growth
presumption, the figure would be $1,263,999. Both accumulations
would clearly support a $40,000 income stream.
</P>
<P>
   But the trouble is that if inflation runs at a 3.5 percent
average over the next 16 years, youll need $69,359 to provide the
same buying power that $40,000 does today. At the lower projected
growth rate, you could come fairly close, presuming a 6.5 percent
income stream from a fixed-income portfolio, which would bring you
$63,801 a year. But that would leave you nothing in growth
instruments that might protect you against the ravages of likely
future inflation. At the higher growth projection, you could figure
that $1.06 million could be put in a fixed-income account to
provide the needed income stream, leaving $203,999 to provide you
with future growth.
</P>
<P>
   True, the growth account seems a little thin, but you also
should figure that as those 16 years of accumulation elapse, you
will probably win raises, and as your income increases, you can
increase your savings rate simply by maintaining your savings at
the same percentage of income it now represents. Also note that
none of these calculations include the $25,000 that you have saved
in the taxable account; simply left alone, that would grow to
something in the range of $85,648 to $114,874, representing the 8
and 10 percent growth assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   One reason I include the fairly modest 8 percent growth
assumptions is that I'm not particularly optimistic about the
short-term prospects for the stock market, but an equally important
reason is that I'd like to see you both diversify your retirement
portfolio and reduce its risk level. The 401(k) holdings are
dominated by positions of $46,000 in Fidelity's Magellan, $29,000
in Growth and Income, $31,000 in Equity-Income, and $18,000 in
Spartan US Equity Index funds. Combining those holdings with token
positions in Contrafund and Growth, you come up with more than 89
percent of the 401(k) invested in large cap domestic stocks. The
final three holdings _ $12,000 in Asset Manager and $2,000 each in
OTC and Overseas funds, aren't enough to represent meaningful
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to simplify the portfolio, I'd leave 60 percent in
the large-cap funds, dividing it evenly between Growth and Income
and Spartan US Equity Index, and I'd divide the remainder evenly
among OTC, Asset Manager, Overseas, and (if allowed within your
401(k)), Fidelity Select Health Care. I would suggest similar
allocations within the IRA account. If you aren't able to buy
Health Care within the 401(k), you could build the desired position
within the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd use my ongoing contributions to steadily decrease
the risk level, putting about half of the contributions into Asset
Manager or Fidelity Puritan funds, and dividing the remainder among
the other funds so as to maintain the proportions set forth.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My daughter is 41 years old and recently divorced, with two
teenaged children. She is starting a new job at a large company
where she intends to stay until she retires. She plans to invest at
least 6 percent of her earnings in a retirement account, and I have
helped her select these four Fidelity funds and allocations:
Fidelity Puritan, 15 percent; Fidelity US Equity, 35 percent; Janus
Twenty, 25 percent; and Janus Worldwide, 25 percent. Your
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   D.M., Bedford, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. I think your selections are solid, but titled a little too
heavily to large-cap domestic stocks. I presume Fidelity US Equity,
which is not one of Fidelity's retail funds, is a large-cap fund
available through the retirement plan, possibly tracking the
Standard and Poor's 500 Index. If so, her only holdings that are
not in domestic large caps are the roughly 40 percent of Puritan
that's on the fixed-income side and the two thirds of Janus
Worldwide that's invested outside the United States. I suggest you
confine large-cap domestic holdings to a maximum of 60 percent, and
establish small-cap, mid-cap, and health care positions to
represent the remainder of the portfolio. But the selections you
have made will likely serve her well over the course of 20-odd
years.

   Q. I am 48, single, and plan to leave a company where I have
worked for 11 1/2 years. In my 401(k) I have $91,143 in my
company's stock, $38,654 in Fidelity Puritan, $72,265 in Fidelity
Magellan, $38,609 in Fidelity Growth Company, $5,400 in
Intermediate Growth, and $29,610 in Government Retirement accounts.
I plan to leave the account with the company, but I am thinking of
investing more aggressively by pulling all the money from
everything but Magellan and putting it in the company stock. What
do you think?
</P>
<P>
   P.L., Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a little tough to explain, since you don't want me to
identify the company, but I think it would be a mistake. You're
dealing here with a company with an ultra-high price-to-earnings
ratio and no dividend. It's a good company, but you already have
more than 33 percent of your money in it. That's enough. I can't
tell from your letter what the two last-mentioned funds are _ the
Intermediate Growth and Government Retirement accounts _ but if
Government Retirement is a fixed-income account, I would move that
money to Puritan and figure that you have assumed enough risk. Good
as your company's stock has been, it's simply too risky to put most
of your retirement money in a single, high-priced stock.

IN WAR, ORWELL STILL APPLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In war, the first casualty is truth, an
observation made by the British essayist Samuel Johnson in 1758 and
Hiram Johnson, the California senator, in 1918. In modern war,
language becomes part of the collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   One of George Orwell's six rules of writing is: ``Never use a
long word where a short one will do.'' In the US armed forces, a
job is not a job, but an MOS, a ``military occupational
specialty.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwell died in 1950, after the world learned about Nazi
concentration camps. He would not be surprised to hear Slobodan
Milosevic diminish that horror by discussing ``demographic
genocide,'' meaning non-Serbs having more babies than Serbs. A
henchman of the Yugoslav president also uses the phrase carelessly.
``This genocidal, flying circus of the NATO alliance has caused
huge destruction,'' said Goran Matic, a government minister. ``But
citizens of Yugoslavia will not give in.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Christine Ammer wrote ``Fighting Words,'' a sprightly
summing up of military terms from ``Achilles heel'' to ``zero
hour.'' In a new book, ``Never Enough Words,'' Jeffrey McQuain
writes that ``War is probably the strongest catalyst for the
formation of euphemisms as examples of indirect wording.''
``Incident'' is an all-purpose dodge. A plan ``to neutralize the
enemy's capability'' means death and chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest description of war's effect on language is Orwell's
essay, ``Politics and the English Language.'' Written in 1946, it
could have been written Thursday, based on briefings in Brussels or
bombast from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our time, political speech and writing are largely the
defense of the indefensible,'' Orwell wrote. ``Defenseless villages
are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the
countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with
incendiary bullets: this is called pacification. Millions of
peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the
roads with no more than they carry: this is called transfer of
population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for
years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck, or sent to
die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of
unreliable elements. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to
name things without calling up mental pictures of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In his time, Orwell criticized both Nazi sympathizers and
Marxists, not only because they were totalitarian but because their
jargon was rooted in sloppy thinking and bad writing:
</P>
<P>
   ``An effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause
and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on
indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he feels himself to
be a faliure, and then fail all the more completely because he
drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the
English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our
thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it
easier for us to have foolish thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwell had seen war and aggression. He was wounded during the
Spanish Civil War and his studies of totalitarianism inspired
``Animal Farm'' and ``1984.'' A half-century after his death, the
adjective ``Orwellian'' is apt today. He opposed sham, brutality,
and words used to cover up sham and brutality:
</P>
<P>
   ``The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. A mass of
Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the
outlines and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear
language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and
declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and
exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink. In our age
there is no such thing as `keeping out of politics.' All issues are
political issues, and politics is itself a mass of lies, evasions,
folly, hatred, and schizophrenia.''

`EXISTENZ' PLAYS GAMES WITH HORROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: eXistenZ is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
eXistenZ 
Written and directed by: David Cronenberg 
Starring: Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Ian Holm, Don McKellar,
Callum Keith Rennie, Sarah Polley, Robert A. Silverman, Christopher
Eccleston, Willem Dafoe 
Running time: 97 minutes 
Rated: R 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you thought ``The Matrix'' had a complicated story line,
check out David Cronenberg's ``eXistenZ.'' It hasn't the techno
flash of ``The Matrix,'' but, unlike that film, which is pretty
moronic beneath its dazzling F/X, ``eXistenZ'' at least achieves a
little philosophical heft as it teases us with a world that fuses
the technological and the biological. By grisly coincidence, its
consequence-free trigger-pulling also resonates ominously with the
blood-spilling in Littleton, Colo., this week, even though its
starting point is an imminent future-world where high-tech games
can be downloaded into the human nervous system via a spinal jack
known as bioport.
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg's films are obsessed with the vulnerability and
impermanence of the human body. No filmmaker of stature has more
frequently reminded us of the corruptibility of the flesh,
``eXistenZ'' included. But it's more playful than genuinely
horrifying. Plenty of blood and biomass is splattered across the
screen as a focus group is drawn into an advanced game system that
looks like a great lumpy breast and is plugged into its players'
bioports via a 12-foot connector resembling a giant umbilical cord.
The game pods are alive, sort of. Grown in breeding pools from
fertilized amphibian eggs filled with synthetic DNA, they're the
most arresting props in any Cronenberg movie since the terrifying
stainless-steel gynecological instruments in ``Dead Ringers.''
</P>
<P>
   Events (or is it just the game? or both?) are set in motion when
a gunman rises up out of a focus group and shoots the diva of all
game designers, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh). In the
tumult, she's hustled out of the church (nice touch!) where the
marketing exercise is unfolding. Her rescuer is a company nerd
(Jude Law) working for the big-bucks corporation that has funded
the game's expensive r&AMP;d. He's also a techno virgin. In a droll
reversal of the usual chase movie sexual aggressiveness, she puts
the moves on him and achieves penetration when she makes him agree
to being fitted with a bioport so he can keep up with her
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh's confident bounce, born of believing that she's operating
with complete impunity and not killing real people as she blasts
her way through the landscape, is the frightening thing about
``eXistenZ,'' even without its obvious parallels to the roots of
the Littlewood and other recent slaughters. When the fleeing pair's
hectic itinerary is the real thing and when it's only the game is
left to the audience to figure out. It is not a heavy workout, even
at its goriest, as Cronenberg seems to be revisiting his early
``Videodrome'' and filtering it through that Michael Douglas
roller-coaster ride of a couple of seasons ago, ``The Game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's diverting enough, but not jolting enough, unless, of
course, you press the parallels between escapism into virtual
reality and the social disconnectedness that has been a factor in
America's school and other massacres of the last few years.
Otherwise, this film about game-playing plays too much like a game
and not about anything that seems to matter on any other level. In
trading genuine horror for lightweight existentialism, it forfeits
the visceral impact of Cronenberg's best films _ ``Scanners,''
``The Fly,'' ``Dead Ringers.'' ``eXistenZ,'' in other words, needs
a few more cHeaP thRillZ, although its metal-detector-proof guns
made of bone and gristle and shooting human teeth are a step in the
right scary direction.

CHESNUTT AND WILCO: WORKS IN PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, Vic Chesnutt _
singer-songwriter-guitarist-parapalegic _ spent an evening he can't
recall that well, but one turned out to be fortuitous. He was
playing before a smattering of people at a Nashville bar and had
propped up a cardboard sign that read ``I suck: Tapes $5.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds like something I would do,'' muses Chesnutt, on
the phone, earlier this week. ``I remember that. That's the show
where I met Kurt (Wagner) from Lambchop. He says I talked to him; I
don't really remember it. I was really drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless _ or perhaps because of _ a friendship developed.
Last year, Chesnutt collaborated with Lambchop, a 14-piece band, to
make the haunting and gorgeous song cycle album, ``The Salesman and
Bernadette,'' the recollections of a lovelorn salesman, someone
both similar and different than Chesnutt, he says. ``For me it's
very important to have the pull between the goofy and the pathetic,
the sad and funny. That's what makes my music, I think. That's my
whole thing. I know the South plays a very important role in my
imagination. I love it and I hate it, and that's a lot to do with
my personality, my schizophrenic nature in general, and the nature
of my music.''
</P>
<P>
   The shape of the album ``started after I knew I was recording
with Lambchop,'' says Chesnutt. ``I started picking some old songs,
writing some new songs, it turned into a song cycle, an exercise in
collage portraiture. Like I was going around finding `found
objects' and placing them a big sheet of plywood, and arranging
them in a portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of their Lambchop,''' he says. ``They're a big
band that can play quiet. Their older records were meandering
dirges and they progressed into a soul band and I like both sides.
This album was a complete collaboration, and sounds like a Lambchop
record in a way. They're friends and I love 'em as people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chesnutt says he had the time of his life playing 25 European
shows with Lambchop. They're not on his current tour, where he's
opening for Wilco, because they work day jobs and can't take the
time off. This makes Chesnutt's solo show ``not as lush and
beautiful,'' he says. ``When I play solo everything slows down a
lot. I think you can see the song a lot more, it's more personality
driven. Opening for Wilco is different, too. It's been great. At
least half the crowd knows who I am and they're really quiet while
I'm playing. I'm a short guy and sometimes they can't see me in
these packed rooms. It's heartwarming.''
</P>
<P>
   In another lifetime, when he could walk, Chesnutt played
keyboards in a Georgia band called the La De Das. When he was 18,
while drunk, he smashed his truck into a ditch and irreparably
damaged his spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   In order to play guitar, Chesnutt superglues guitar picks to a
glove on his right hand. Has his technique improved over time?
``No,'' he says. ``I have good days and bad days. Sometimes, I
think I make breakthroughs but it's all physicality: Sometimes my
fingers don't work. It used to horrify me and the show would fall
apart, but I learned to play through it, learned to just not let it
affect me. The crowd loves it. They come up and say, `You're so
real.' They don't see people (mess) up like that that often.''
</P>
<P>
   Chesnutt, says Wilco singer-guitarist Jeff Tweedy, is `` a sweet
guy. I love his music. I think he's one of the best lyric writers
around. It's inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the Chicago-based Wilco has been
regarded as one of the alternative country-rock standard bearers.
But, perhaps, that tag needs revising, at least if the music on
their latest effort, ``Summer Teeth'' is any indication. An
expansive, wide-ranging disc, Tweedy says it's the result, ``of a
band that's been traveling so much the bpast three years, really
becoming a band. We wanted to go into the studio and hear something
that sounded like us, and a bit like the Beach Boys and Beatles. We
really used the studio and took our time. I think we succeeded on
most songs, and came up with something kinda unique.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the result. Did they discuss a plan to cover so much
musical territory? ``Just a little bit,'' says Tweedy. ``In
general, we just wanted to put stuff on tape that would excite us
at the end of the day. I wish I had some good snappy answers, but
it's jsut something that evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   They actually completed most of ``Summer Teeth'' before they
went in to record the Grammy-nominated ``Mermaid Avenue'' with
Billy Bragg, the collection of unearthed Woody Guthrie songs. What
Tweedy took away from working with Bragg was this: ``I took away
some confidence as a writer _ write things down, don't worry about
editing.''

SUBURBAN SCHOOL STRESS HEIGHTENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ Newton North High School's second floor is known
as Main Street, the primary drag in a teenage city of 2,100. The
artsy students lean against red lockers between classes, the
``freaks'' huddle in front of the green. Seniors have their space
in front of the purple and hearing impaired students camp out in
front of the yellow lockers.
</P>
<P>
   For many suburban students, this is the whole, small world. In
city schools, say sociologists, students are more prone to scatter
when the last bell rings, to their neighborhood and other sets of
friends. But in suburban schools, like Newton, or the Columbine
High School where two students went on a rampage this week, the
social pressures are even more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Students in communities like Newton say that almost everyone
they grew up with goes to the same high school. Weekend parties are
planned in the cafeteria, romances sparked in math class. And
whether you like to play chess, french horn or pranks, the school
serves as the brick-faced backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to both suburban and city high schools and it's
harder in those small towns where everyone knows each other,'' said
Judi Storey, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rejection at school can mean total rejection, say
students, because there are few other places students can find a
sense of self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some kids, if they don't get accepted at school, there is
nothing else,'' said Maria Morreale, 17, a junior at Newton North.
``Some kids have other things going on after school, but for many,
school is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In any school, of course, the forces of peer pressure can be
brutal. With a hierarchy defined by social cliques, students say it
takes little to suffer social banishment. It takes a look, a
whispered comment or a vacant seat beside a student in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupid stuff,'' Storey said. ``But a lot of kids take it
really, really seriously. I know some that still talk about it even
after they graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, though, it is a simple matter of geography. In
Boston, for example, there are more than 15 high schools and
students crisscross neighborhoods to attend them. So when school
ends, students go home to neighborhoods to be with friends, and
school may not even come up in conversation. Many urban school
students work and find another group of friends there, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban communities, however, many students and parents said
there are few other opportunities to discover new friends. Students
may not seek out afterschool jobs either because their parents can
financially provide for them or they are pushed to take advantage
of the many afterschool programs suburban schools offer. The school
becomes the center of students' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to a city school, you can belong to a different
community at home. But for many of these kids in suburban schools,
they are here and this is it,'' said Virginia Hunter, who has eight
children, including one at Randolph High School.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure in suburban schools can also come from more
surprising places. Students at suburban schools interviewed
Thursday said they feel extra pressure to be accepted in their
school, academically and socially, because they know their parents
moved to their community for its stellar schools. To fail, they
said privately, is not simply failing school. It is failing their
parents, their community and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``School is the predominant factor in these students' lives and
the parents emphasize that if not overemphasize it,'' said Gary
Siperstein, head of the Center for Social Development and Education
at University of Massachusetts in Boston. ``The message is to
participate in afterschool activities, join clubs. You are expected
to fit into the school as well as get good grades.''
</P>
<P>
   Siperstein and a colleague just completed a study analyzing the
different social stresses facing 581 Massachusetts suburban and
urban middle school students. In suburban schools, students worried
being left out of a group they wanted to be a part of. But in city
schools, that worry was rarely mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   After they leave, students who attended close-knit suburban
schools say they sometimes look back in bewilderment. Fitting in,
they said, seemed so important at the time. Little things, like
being invited to eat lunch with popular kids, or being chosen for a
gym-class volleyball game, were major events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be pure hell,'' said Storey, who said she had trouble
fitting in during her high school years. ``Once you get out, it's
like, `I'm so glad that was over.' You realize the world doesn't
run'' like a high school.

BBC LEGENDS PUT TO SHAME AMERICA'S CLASSICAL RADIO SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALLAN ULRICH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's more than a bit humbling to sit down with the first batch
of ``Great Performers of the Twentieth Century,`` the exceptional
new historical series of compact discs published on the new BBC
Legends label and distributed stateside by Koch International.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, where listeners are hungry for any kind of
serious music on the radio, what can one make of a national network
like the British Broadcasting Corp. that not only has consistently
aired concerts by the finest musicians of the age, but also
produced most of those concerts for the sole purpose of
broadcasting them?
</P>
<P>
   Commercial radio networks in the United States gave up on
classical music a generation ago. Americans can still hear several
of our leading opera companies, while most of the important
American orchestras have lost their syndication contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Listen here and weep. The initial 10 offerings in the BBC
Legends release are a godsend for the serious music lover. They
were recorded from 1951-79 (mostly in public performance without
retakes), and all but two are in stereo. A few of the performances
have appeared on unauthorized labels, but the master tapes, which
have been digitally restored, have delivered better sonic results,
and where possible, BBC Legends has included interviews with the
featured musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Interest focuses first on performances by artists who never made
commercial recordings of the works they attempted here. At least
three fall into the ``don't miss'' category.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1959, conductor Jascha Horenstein assembled 756
musicians in the Royal Albert Hall, and for an audience that
numbered 6,000, led a reading of Mahler's Symphony No. 8 in E-flat
Major (BBCL-4001, two CDs) that, to one listener who heard the tape
soon after, left an indelible impression. A much undervalued
Mahlerian, Horenstein tells interviewer Alan Blyth that conductor
Wilhelm Furtwangler taught him to rehearse a score in broad spans.
</P>
<P>
   And that philosophy here generated a performance that soars on
the wings of inspiration for 80 minutes. Mahler's most grandiose
work had not been performed in England for 11 years, and the sense
of occasion is often overwhelming. There are no cheap theatrics in
Horenstein's reading, simply a gradual unfolding of the music, and
it leaves you profoundly stirred.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the BBC engineers caught much of the detail without
sonic overloading.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's Berlioz's ``La Damnation de Faust'' (BBCL-4006,
two CDs), conducted by one of the composer's finest 20th century
advocates, Pierre Monteux, in 1962, when this most beloved of
musicians was basking in a glorious Indian summer as chief
conductor of the London Symphony. The soloists for this
Goethe-inspired hybrid included soprano Regine Crespin at her
stylistic and vocal zenith, tenor Andre Turp and baritone Michel
Roux. The energy and elan with which Monteux, then 87, imbues the
score are never less than astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   The recorded legacy of Clifford Curzon, that most patrician and
perfectionist of British pianists, is much too small. So, BBC
Legends' exhumation of Brahms' Piano Quintet in F Minor with the
Amadeus String Quartet (BBCL-4009, two CDs) adds a fiery (1974)
performance to the discography. A bonus disc features these
musicians in a 1971 Schubert ``Trout'' Quintet, a somewhat more
extroverted reading than their earlier commercial collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The curiosity of the collection is Bach: Mass in B Minor
(BBCL-4008, two CDs). This 1951 studio recording offers the Boyd
Neel Orchestra conducted by the famed Romanian violinist-composer,
George Enescu; soprano Suzanne Danco, contralto Kathleen Ferrier
and tenor Peter Pears dominate the soloists. This will sound
dreadfully old-fashioned to the hip period performance crowd, yet
Enescu was a foremost Bachian, and his reading wants nothing in
spirituality, shapeliness and thrust.
</P>
<P>
   To all tastes will be Schubert: Sonatas D. 575, D. 625 and D.664
and ``Moment musical'' in C Major (BBCL-4010), the contents of a
March 1979 Royal Festival Hall recital with Soviet pianist
Sviatoslav Richter. On that day, this extraordinary artist chose
two of the composer's less frequently heard sonatas, including the
B Major (D. 575), with its incomplete first movement, and wound up
with an inimitable traversal of the wondrous ``little'' A Major (D.
664). The audience holds its breath for such magical playing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the album that captures a historical moment most
dramatically is Shostakovich: Symphony No. 8; Mozart: Symphony No.
33 (BBCL-4002, two CDs). This 1960 concert introduced one of
Shostakovich's most powerful symphonic utterances to the United
Kingdom 17 years after its premiere in the Soviet Union; the
conductor on both occasions was the formidable Yevgeny Mravinsky,
here with the Leningrad Philharmonic, the orchestra he steered to
greatness, in one of its then-rare visits to the West. A bonus disc
includes the Mozart, nice but a bit soupy.
</P>
<P>
   The next series of BBC Legends releases, due by the end of this
month, will feature composer Benjamin Britten in his guises as
conductor and pianist, performing with colleagues like alto Janet
Baker, baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and cellist Mstislav
Rostropovich _ not a shabby crowd.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Most Red Sox fans think they know the story of Dr.
Arthur Pappas. He's the limited partner who doubles as the team
doctor, a relationship that seems inherently conflicted. He's the
guy who had to pay Marty Barrett $1.7 million in a malpractice
suit, who Butch Henry says pushed him to pitch when he was hurt,
and who several current players say has complicated their comebacks
as this season gets started.
</P>
<P>
   But Pappas's defenders tell a decidedly different story _ of a
concerned citizen who devotes as much time to caring for crippled
children as for prima donna sports stars; of a physician who's
respected enough that Sox players send their wives and kids to him,
while players from other teams say he salvaged their careers. They
see him, in short, as a saint in a white coat.
</P>
<P>
   The true story is a bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas's role does present potential conflicts, but no more than
those of any doctor who collects a paycheck from a team and might
be tempted to put its financial interests ahead of a player's
health. His medical judgment has been questioned by a lineup of
players, but there's a longer line who swear by his diagnoses and
treatments. And while some in the medical world say it's time,
after 22 years, for the 66-year-old Pappas to step aside, others
insist his experience and acumen are needed more than ever if this
injury-plagued Sox team so short on stars hopes to stay healthy
enough to remain a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Butch Henry's recent claims about Dr. Pappas on sports
radio,'' says Bob Tewksbury, a New Hampshire native who pitched for
six big league clubs during his 11-year career. ``I never called a
sports talk show in my life, but I called WEEI about how we never
hear the other side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe in Dr. Pappas so strongly I had to let people
know there's another side . . . I wouldn't have pitched my last 10
years in the big leagues without the care Dr. Pappas provided me on
a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Altchek also is fed up with the finger-pointing, some
of it from his sports medicine colleagues. ``Arthur Pappas is
highly regarded as a pioneer in the field of orthopedic sports
medicine,'' says Altchek, the New York Mets physician who performed
pioneering shoulder surgery on Boston pitcher Bret Saberhagen.
``Dr. Pappas was there trying to figure out players' problems
before we had MRIs and lots of other sophisticated diagnostic
tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're an owner, in a way it ensures no conflict,'' adds
Altchek. ``These are your players and you want the best for them.
If anything it makes that more important to you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To understand the intensity of Pappas's friends, it's critical
to understand the intensity of his foes.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett was the first to challenge the doctor publicly, in a
1992 lawsuit claiming that Pappas misdiagnosed his knee injury a
decade ago and caused his career as the Sox second baseman to
fizzle. The jury sided with Barrett, which Pappas says was the
first and last time he's been convicted of malpractice, or even
charged with it.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about Pappas's role with the team predated the
Barrett case and have persisted into this still-young season.
Henry, a lefty the team let go last year, recently told a Seattle
newspaper that Pappas had advised him he could pitch despite a
ligament tear that required immediate surgery. Questions also have
been raised about the handling of injuries to pitcher Brian Rose,
infielder Lou Merloni, and designated hitter Reggie Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the medical community share those doubts. It is critical
for players ``that the team doctor have an arm's length
relationship with owners so when you talk to players they don't
think you're just an extension of management. But Art is an
owner,'' says one respected sports medicine specialist, who asked
that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   While the grousers have gotten the attention, however, they're
not the only ones with strong opinions on Pappas. He helped Roger
Clemens return to form after shoulder surgery in 1984, prolonged
the careers of Dennis Eckersley, Bruce Hurst, Jim Lonborg, and
Sonny Seibert, and aided Dennis ``Oil Can'' Boyd in overcoming his
combustible combination of emotional, physical, and fiscal stress.
Even Tim Naehring, who never made it back after a raft of injuries,
has said he's eternally grateful for Pappas's help, as is Larry
McCoy, an umpire from Arkansas who thought so much of him that he
sent his daughter here for back surgery several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Mike Flanagan, the former ace of the Baltimore
Orioles, who says simply that Pappas ``saved my career.'' The year
was 1980 and Flanagan was coming off a Cy Young Award year, but he
spent most of the next season with a pain that his doctors could
neither understand nor relieve. During a trip to Boston the last
week of the season he consulted with Pappas _ home team doctors
always treat the visiting team _ and Pappas determined the pain was
emanating from the back of his shoulder rather than front, as other
doctors had said. He also suggested a program of physical therapy
that could avoid surgery, and offered to supervise the care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached for help and he responded, I never felt
uncomfortable seeing him based on our baseball rivalry or going to
the enemy camp,'' Flanagan recalls. ``After that I'd drag young
pitchers to him. He diagnosed their problems early and probably
saved them from the agony I had to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Jobe, whose 35 years as doctor for the Los Angeles
Dodgers make him the dean of professional baseball physicians, also
is a Pappas admirer: ``I've never found him to be anything but
ethical and first class.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising source of kind words about Pappas, however,
is Barrett, who's retired now, living in Las Vegas, and coaching
his children's teams at the same time he's doing charity work. ``I
respect Dr. Pappas,'' Barrett said in a telephone interview. ``I
think the Red Sox and Dr. Pappas treated my situation as business
and I treated it as business right back. But personally, I like Dr.
Pappas and would say `hi' to him if I saw him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a lot of things for my family and children and helped
them . . . I think he's a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the supposed conflict in Pappas's roles as owner and
doctor?
</P>
<P>
   Some Sox watchers say his ownership gives him more clout in
standing up to management and protecting his players as patients.
``Every doctor on every team is hired by the team,'' explains
Saberhagen, who has experienced a lot of them. ``If he wants to
stay the team doc, he pretty much does what the team wants him
to.''
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, a medical ethicist at the Boston University School
of Public Health, agrees that all the furor over Pappas's dual
roles is ``almost a made-up thing . . . If everyone knows that he's
a part owner and that they can get a second opinion I don't see the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, meanwhile, says he ``would advise any athlete that gets
hurt with a team to always get a second opinion'' regardless of
whether the team doctor is an owner or an employee. ``For the most
part, all team doctors try to be objective. Where they get in
trouble is the grey areas where they might lean toward doing
something that's favorable to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pappas generally leaves it to others to defend him. Touting his
own accomplishments simply isn't his style, although a sense of
what he's done and how he feels about the controversy surrounding
him did trickle out over the course of two interviews last week,
one in his tattered office at the rump end of the Fenway clubhouse
and the other in his section of seats in Row A just to the right of
the Sox dugout.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Auburn, where his Greek father and Albanian mother
ran a small grocery. He learned his love of sports in high school,
where he was a four-sport athlete, and developed his fascination
with sports injuries at Harvard, where he was an offensive guard on
the football team and tore up his shoulder. He also injured his
knee, and still walks with a slight limp.
</P>
<P>
   After medical school at the University of Rochester he completed
a residency at Children's and Massachusetts General hospitals,
focusing on orthopedic injuries in children and on the nascent
field of sports medicine. He'd been close to the Red Sox and after
team owner Tom Yawkey died in 1976, Pappas was invited by
then-trainer Buddy LeRoux to join a group that was purchasing
limited-partner shares in the team; his 4 percent cost him about $1
million. At the same time he became the Sox full-time physician.
</P>
<P>
   Being an owner mainly involves watching your money multiply,
with Pappas's initial investment probably worth more than 20 times
what he paid for it. But being the Red Sox medical director is a
year-round job, even though he isn't paid. He starts work in the
offseason, working with the team's trainer, physical therapist, and
strength coach to come up with conditioning plans for more than 200
major and minor league players. The advising and monitoring
continue through spring training and now that the season has
started, he oversees a staff at Fenway of five doctors, three
trainers, and nine first-aid people, along with others throughout
the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are just part of what Pappas does as a doctor,
however, and not necessarily the most important part.
</P>
<P>
   He's at least as proud of his work chairing the Department of
Orthopedics at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in
Worcester, and of the text he's written and more than 100 papers
he's authored on injuries to the elbow, shoulder, and other upper
extremities. And his bushy eyebrows really rise when he talks about
his efforts on behalf of disadvantaged children, including years of
participating in clinics for the handicapped in Haverhill, Lowell
and Worcester, helping found the Bay State Games and serving as
chairman of the board of the Massachusetts Hospital School in
Canton.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas also remains a die-hard Sox fan, rooting for the team
even as he analyzes the motions and mechanics of every player who
comes to bat or fields a ball. As for the controversy that has
surrounded him, Pappas seems philosophical: ``It's frustrating, but
I guess it's part of the world.''

FRYE IS OUT AT SECOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ What Jeff Frye feared all along has come to pass. Jose
Offerman is now the Red Sox second baseman, and Frye believes he is
the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything out of respect for Jimy Williams,
but he told me they have to try to start doing something with the
offense, and Offy will be playing second base,'' Frye said Thursday
morning. ``This is a situation I anticipated happening, and my
theory is that there's not much I can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here for the money. I'm here to play ball. To keep my
mouth shut and sit on the bench, making $2 million, that isn't
going to make me happy. I've gotta be playing ball. That's the kind
of player I am. I'm not a utility player. If I'm not good enough to
be the starting second baseman on a particular team, maybe I
shouldn't be on that team.''
</P>
<P>
   What looked like a one-shot deal Wednesday, when Offerman made
his first start of the season at second base, took on a more
permanent appearance in Thursday's 1-0 loss to the Detroit Tigers
and lefthander Justin Thompson, when Offerman played second, Lou
Merloni played first, and Frye sat on the bench for the second
straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams chose to have Merloni make his first professional start
at first base rather than move Offerman to first, where he has
played, and insert Frye at second.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jefferson's recovery from his back problems, and the Sox'
ongoing offensive woes, were the catalysts to Offerman becoming the
second baseman. The only way Williams can get Jefferson and
Offerman in the lineup at the same time against righthanded
pitchers, as well as Mike Stanley, one of the few power threats on
the club, is to move Offerman to second, DH Jefferson, and have
Stanley play first base. That leaves no place for Frye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie's here now,'' Williams said. ``He's a major league
hitter. We need his bat in the lineup. We've got to have all three
of them in the lineup against righthanded pitchers. The only way we
can do it is put (Offerman) at second.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Red Sox placing a big emphasis on pitching and defense,
Frye, a better gloveman than Offerman, seemed to have the edge at
second base. Many scouts rate Offerman as a below-average second
baseman; only Joey Cora, who had 20 errors last season, made more
errors than Offerman, who had 19. Thursday, Williams defended
Offerman's play afield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose's a bona fide second baseman,'' Williams said. ``He
played well for Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a good defensive player out, add two good offensive
players and a defensive player out there. Basically, that's what
we're doing for the time being, to jump-start us and move on from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye, who missed all of last season after surgery to repair the
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, was batting .265 in 10
games, with two RBIs. All nine of his hits have been singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do anything to get himself out of the lineup,'' said
Williams, who insisted even after the Sox signed Offerman last
November to a four-year, $26 million contract that Frye was his
second baseman. ``He's going to get his playing time. As time goes
by these things take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a lot to our team _ his skill, makeup, heart,
determination. All put together, you've got to have a guy like that
on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman had been the DH for 10 games and first baseman three
times until playing second base Wednesday, the position he played
for the Kansas City Royals last season. It has been clear from the
time Dan Duquette signed Offerman that the Red Sox general manager
envisioned Offerman as the second baseman, and at the outset of the
season, the player expressed unhappiness about being limited to a
DH role.
</P>
<P>
   Frye was asked if he thought Duquette was behind the decision
for him to sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way of knowing,'' Frye said. ``But we all know what
Jimy Williams thinks about my game. I know how he feels about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the utmost respect for Jimy Williams, and I love
playing in Boston and for the fans in Boston. But maybe there's
something in the cards that has to play itself out. I've been the
so-called scapegoat many times in my career, situations where we're
not going well and the only guy they take out is me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Duquette has openly lobbied for Offerman to play second
base, Williams has held his ground on playing decisions, as he
demonstrated at the end of the '97 season, when he gave lefthander
Steve Avery a final start that triggered a $3.8 million contract
option.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the Red Sox were looking to trade him, Frye
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've proved I'm healthy,'' he said, ``and we have four
players for three spots. The middle infield, it's hard to
interchange guys. It's hard to let Offy DH one day and me play
second base, and then have him at second base the next day. Maybe
the feeling is, stick with him at second base, let him and Nomar
(Garciaparra) get comfortable, and interchange other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It would not be a shock if Frye eventually elects to ask for a
trade if he finds himself anchored on the bench, although the $5.1
million due him in the last two years of his contract makes it
tougher for the Sox to move him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him on this team,'' Williams said. ``He's a winning
player.''

TANK BUSTERS HEAD TO HARM'S WAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that Apache helicopters are landing in Albania,
NATO and Serbian forces might soon be fighting each other at close
range.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planes have been bombing Yugoslavia for a month now, but
only from altitudes of 15,000 feet _ beyond the range of Serbian
antiaircraft weapons and too high for the NATO planes to damage
much military gear on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   One NATO plane has been shot down. In turn, the NATO planes have
destroyed a mere handful of Serbian air-defense sites and only 10
or 20 percent of their 400 or so armored vehicles in and around
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Apaches, also known as AH-64As, start to fly, this
situation will likely change _ for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache's main mission is to kill tanks. Each helicopter
carries up to 16 Hellfire heat-seeking missiles, capable of
destroying the turret or tread of any tank in the world. Each also
holds a few dozen 2.75-inch rockets and 1,200 rounds of 30mm
cannon, which can disable thinner-skinned vehicles, kill people, or
make them run in panic.
</P>
<P>
   Attack helicopers, including Apaches, fired 2,876 Hellfires in
the 1991 Gulf War and are credited with destroying 500 Iraqi tanks
and several hundred armored personnel carriers and self-propelled
artillery cannons. An Apache also fired the first shot in that war,
sneaking across the Iraqi border to take out an air-defense radar.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches fly low _ well under the clouds, as little as 500
feet off the ground or even lower. This makes it easier for their
missiles to hit tanks _ but it also makes it easier for enemy
missiles to hit Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have hundreds of antiaircraft weapons, including
shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, all across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some helicopters are going to get shot down,'' an
administration official acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Army field manuals on Apache operations spell out ways to
minimize this vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 Apaches in Albania are joined together in a unit called
``Task Force Hawk,'' which includes 27 Multiple-Launch Rocket
Systems (MLRS).
</P>
<P>
   Each MLRS can fire 12 rockets having a range of 20 miles, or two
Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMs) with a range of 120 miles.
Each ATACM releases 950 grenade-size bomblets over an area several
hundred feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   Apaches, MLRS, and various surveillance systems work in a
coordinated fashion. Once a target is located, Apaches fly in,
hugging the terrain. When they reach the area, MLRS fires its
munitions, pelting the area to suppress enemy air-defense crews.
The Apaches pop up from behind a hill or from under the treeline,
fire their missiles and shells, and pop back down.
</P>
<P>
   That's the theory, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are not going to make it easy for us,'' Barry Posen,
professor of national-security studies at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said Thursday. ``If the Serbs are any good
at air defense, they can probably figure out where they need to
deploy to keep the Apaches vulnerable while staying out of MLRS'
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``if you start hosing the area'' with MLRS, he added, ``they
could start hugging refugees again,'' so the Apaches cannot attack
Serbian tanks without also killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be hard to find Serbian tanks. The sensor in a
Hellfire missile detects tanks by the heat they give off. ``If the
tanks are on the road, that's no problem,'' said Robert Pape,
professor of national-security studies at Dartmouth College. ``But
if they're under a tree, in the shade, or hiding in the mountains,
the heat-signature is not easy to pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seems little doubt the Apaches will ratchet up
NATO's air war, in terms of both damaging Serbian forces and
putting US troops in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO decides at some point to send in ground forces, the
Apaches could be the wedge for them, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Apaches are not only MLRS transporters but also a
small number of M1 Abrams tanks and M2 Bradley infantry fighting
vehicles, as well as a ``ready brigade'' of 800 troops from the 82d
Airborne Division.
</P>
<P>
   These troops and armor are there to defend the Apaches'
staging-areas from possible attack. But once they are set up, John
Pike, military analyst at the Federation of American Scientists,
said, ``It doesn't require a lot of buffing'' to bring in a lot
more for offensive operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1991 Gulf War, Apaches did not see much action until the
ground invasion began, and they moved with _ or slightly ahead of _
the US troops, clearing away paths of resistance.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials, however, continue to oppose a ground war in
Yugoslavia. Robin Cook, the British foreign minister, told
reporters here Thursday, ``Let me just repeat, for the avoidance of
doubt: no ground troops that have to fight their way in; yes,
ground troops to guarantee a cease-fire.''

NATO AT 50: EX-LEADERS SEE LIMITS TO NEW ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, Mass. _ In a sunny office on the campus of Tufts
University this week, two white-haired former generals were
reminiscing about the war that never happened _ and the one that
did.
</P>
<P>
   Each had been supreme commander of NATO in Europe, an elite club
of US Army generals that began with Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1950.
Under their authority was an arsenal of tanks, planes, and infantry
built for one purpose: to defend the democracies west of the Iron
Curtain even if it meant a nuclear battle that would have laid
waste to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   NATO never fought that war. Its great adversary, the Soviet
Union, broke up in 1991. And now in the Balkans, the old soldiers
agreed, NATO is in a fight unlike any they could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Allied Force ``has taken me into a new era,'' said
Andrew Goodpaster, who headed NATO from 1969 to 1975 and is now a
fellow at the Eisenhower World Affairs Institute in Washington.
``The experience we are having in Kosovo requires us to do some
very serious thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are very lucky that NATO is hanging together,''
said John R. Galvin, who served as NATO commander from 1987 to 1992
and is now dean of Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
Galvin had invited Goodpaster to Tufts on Tuesday to address
graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   As leaders of the 19-member alliance mark its half-century
anniversary, those two issues _ the radical new role NATO has
assumed in the Balkans and the present and future stability of a
group of nations as dissimilar as Iceland and Hungary, as
suspicious of one another as Greece and Turkey _ will surely
dominate discussion.
</P>
<P>
   And that could be a big problem, said Ashton B. Carter, who was
assistant secretary of defense for international security during
President Clinton's first term and is now a professor at Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the world around us contains its Kosovos, we
shouldn't be fooled into thinking that is the most important
security priority'' for NATO, said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter lists Kosovo as a ``C priority.'' His A-list includes
threats like the one the Soviet Union once posed. Though there is
not a Soviet-style foe lurking in the world right now, he said,
NATO should always be focused on that kind of problem. Among its
concerns, he said, should be preventing Russia from collapsing and
becoming desperate and militaristic; managing the relationship with
China as it grows into a global power; guarding against the spread
of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons; and countering
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's B-level priority, he said, should be maintaining its
ability to fight two major wars in different parts of the world.
Only after taking care of those concerns, he added, should the
Balkans be on the alliance's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But the Balkan crisis is too big right now to be set to the
side, he acknowledged, worrying that ``the preoccupation with
Bosnia and Kosovo will slow the process of strategic adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's Washington summit was originally designed to make
that very adjustment. Then came Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Allied Force, the first official engagement that NATO
has fought in its 50 years, is precedent-setting on many counts,
analysists say. It is, for instance, a military venture that does
not strictly defend the territory of NATO members, as outlined in
the alliance's charter. In addition, unlike the 1995 NATO bombing
campaign in Bosnia, Allied Force does not have explicit United
Nations approval. And while it is motivated by humanitarian
concerns, it is a direct, uninvited intervention in the affairs of
a sovereign nation _ Yugoslavia _ a step the US and its allies have
been loathe to take until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has phenomenally broad implications,'' said Senator
Joseph R. Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. ``But if NATO does not stand for putting an
end to violence and `ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo, then what in the
hell do we stand for?''
</P>
<P>
   Most strategic analysts in the United States and Europe agree
that the US and its allies were right to try to stop the
persecution of Kosovo Albanians by the forces of Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic. Where they differ is on whether NATO should
have been the vehicle, and bombing the means.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has expressed no doubts. In
Yugoslavia, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in a recent
speech, ``NATO is responding to a real post-Cold War threat to its
interests and values.''
</P>
<P>
   Interests and values, however, are not the same as security,
which is what NATO was narrowly formed to defend when allied
nations signed the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington on April 4,
1949 _ a few short months after the Berlin airlift and as eastern
European nations were falling under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NATO was stretching its charter even before the Soviet
Union collapsed and the Cold War ended. In the Gulf War, for
instance, Galvin led the alliance's efforts, and he now calls the
conflict an out-of-area NATO action disguised as a multinational
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you did not mention that `NATO forces' were
involved _ it had to be `the forces of NATO nations' _ it was OK,''
said Galvin. ``But it was basically a NATO operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even France, which was not then a member of NATO's military
command, joined the effort, allowing US B-52s to operate from
French bases. The reason NATO acted was not that the territory of a
member nation was in jeopardy, but because the West's oil supplies
were threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Like all NATO operations, Desert Storm was carried largely by
the US, which enjoys overwhelming military superiority in the
alliance and the world. But if NATO is to survive, says Britain's
defense secretary, George Robertson, its European members will have
to pick up more of the burden from the US. This will require
modernization of European armies and navies and the acquisition of
the sort of airlift capability that the US alone now has. Airlift
is what will allow NATO forces to move into areas beyond its
traditional European neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But where to draw the line? Biden, for instance, opposes using
NATO to intervene in ethnic wars in Africa or Asia, for fear of
getting stretched too thin. Like many members of the foreign-policy
establishment, he would give that job to various ``coalitions of
the willing'' depending on the nature of a crisis and the part of
the world in which it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO expands, it will be under ever more strain in deciding
where and when to act militarily. Even before it grew from 16 to 19
members, its decision-making was hampered by a need for the North
Atlantic Council, the alliance's governing body, to make unanimous
decisions. Unanimity will become ever more difficult to achieve,
said Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving such questions will be essential and will be part of
the Washington summit's business this weekend. But, Goodpaster
said, in all the brainstorming it is important to remember that
NATO was successful in its original mission. There was no war with
the USSR _ not that the world didn't come close during the Cuban
missile crisis and other moments over the past half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so tense back then that the danger was that somebody in
our army or theirs would think he had to do something,'' said
Goodpaster, recalling the bristling forces facing off in Europe
during the Cold War. ``That would have set everything loose.''

GORE'S KOSOVO STANCE WEIGHS ON HIS CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Clinton administration was contemplating
launching airstrikes against Yugoslavia, Vice President Al Gore
stepped forward to advocate more rather than less use of force
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's hawkishness _ an extension of his attitude toward Bosnia
years earlier when he argued behind the scenes for early and
forceful US intervention in that area of the Balkans _ was far more
evident than even that of President Clinton and national security
adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger, those familiar with the
conversations said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also was among those top officials, including
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who initially thought ``a
little bit of bombing would go a long way,'' said Ivo Daalder, a
former national security aide to Clinton who informally consults
with administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is campaigning for president, perhaps has more at
stake in the Kosovo crisis than Clinton, who only has to worry
about the history books.
</P>
<P>
   If the NATO mission is a success, analysts say, Gore can claim
credit for his role. If it turns into a disaster, his campaign may
be the first casualty. Gore does not want to be running for
president if US ground troops _ other than a peacekeeping force _
are in the Balkans, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore offered what remains the most definitive statement
by the administration against using ground troops. At a campaign
stop in New Hampshire in the opening days of the airstrikes, he
said: ``We are not going to put any ground troops into a combat
situation. Neither are our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement went further than the administration line, perhaps
because Gore's chief foreign policy adviser, Leon S. Fuerth, had
suffered a mild heart attack and was not on the trip. Clinton and
other US foreign policymakers had been saying the United States has
``no intentions'' or ``no plans'' to use ground troops, leaving
America and its allies wiggle room to change their position.
</P>
<P>
   Gore read from the White House script the next day, saying,
``There is no consideration by NATO or any of the allies for the
introduction of ground troops.'' But the incident underscored the
dilemma for Gore and the high stakes.
</P>
<P>
   A protracted military struggle in Kosovo could be a drag on
Gore's presidential aspirations, especially if ground troops end up
being dispatched, because many analysts say history shows that
voters are unlikely to reward the party that gets the country into
a war.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, analysts say Gore can't afford to distance
himself from Clinton and a policy he played a role in formulating,
even if NATO does resort to ground troops, because voters might
view that stance with suspicion. It's a lesson then-Vice President
Hubert H. Humphrey learned in 1968 when he tried to extract himself
from President Lyndon B. Johnson's policy in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters politically is not what happens now, but whether
or not the policy succeeds down the road,'' said Anthony Lake,
Clinton's former national security adviser. ``So you make these
decisions not based on what it may look like politically now, but
the substance of these decisions, and how they play out later. And
we simply can't know that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Fitzwater, former press secretary to presidents Reagan
and Bush, said if the NATO bombing campaign is over by the 2000
election, ``win, lose or draw, I think it doesn't have much
impact'' on Gore. ``But if it's still going on, then it does,
because it forces him to take a position on how he would end it or
how he would carry it out.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the Kosovo issue has given Gore a prime
opportunity to display a grasp of foreign policy, as he did in his
first major speech on the crisis Wednesday at Ellis Island. It also
highlights the reason Clinton chose him as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has played a central role in all major foreign policy in
this administration from day one,'' said Bruce Jentleson, an
informal adviser to Gore and a senior fellow at the US Institute of
Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is he involved, but the president does rely very
heavily on his advice,'' Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the land mines for Gore, Kosovo has raised the public's
awareness of the dangers outside the US shores and the value of a
president with a handle on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Gore suffers in the opinion polls for his
unswerving loyalty to Clinton during last year's sex scandal and
impeachment, Kosovo ``turns attention from Monica, which is helpful
for Gore,'' said historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, she said, Kosovo ``has sped up the presidential
primary process, because it has given a voice to some of his
opponents,'' such as Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and
former Vietnam prisoner of war who has been vocal about using
ground troops if they are necessary to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, Republican presidential candidates are divided on
the issue, and Gore's only Democratic challenger, former Senator
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, has yet to articulate how his views on
Kosovo differ from the administration's.
</P>
<P>
   But most irritating for Gore and his allies are some
Republicans' description of the conflict as the ``Clinton-Gore
war.'' Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, decried the label as
injecting politics into a national security issue that should be
off limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is not to allow our foreign policy to be whipsawed
by domestic political concerns in any way, shape or form,'' Lehane
said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has absorbed much of Gore's time and attention. It
has become the most frequently asked question when he campaigns
around the country. He gets updates from two military aides,
decorated veterans of the Gulf War who travel with him. When in
Washington, he participates in the daily foreign policy briefings
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He has placed calls to former presidents to explain the
administration's policy, and he exchanged telephone calls with
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, who turned his plane
away from Washington after Gore informed him of the start of the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could be a crucial link in a diplomatic solution if it
involves Russia. The vice president has a long-standing
relationship with former Russian prime minister Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, who was chosen by President Boris N. Yeltsin last
week as his personal envoy to settle the Yugoslav conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav conflict might end up being helpful for Gore, said
Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution.
In the absence of a crowded Democratic field of candidates running
for president, he said, there is nothing like a war to concentrate
the mind ``in a very special way.''

NEW NATO MEMBER HAS FEW REGRETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW _ Joining NATO was supposed to be a joyous occasion for
Poland, a confirmation of victory in an centuries-old struggle to
stake out an identity as a stable, independent, Western-oriented
state.
</P>
<P>
   Few Poles knew that their country would join the Western
alliance just as it plunged itself into a major military conflict
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Kosovo crisis has cast a shadow over celebrations of
NATO's 50th anniversary in Washington, it has also dampened the
fanfare here over last month's accession to the alliance. Still,
Poles regard their new NATO membership as a measure of how far
their country has progressed from the sullen, Communist birthplace
of the Warsaw Pact _ the Soviet-dominated alliance that faced off
against the West during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Balkans conflict has produced little discernable regret
in Poland about the timing of its entry into NATO last month.
Instead, the Kosovo crisis, and NATO's military response, seems to
have confirmed for Poles why they wanted to join the alliance in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that Poland will be safer with NATO,'' said
Teresa Szczurowska, a researcher at the Center for Public Opinion
Studies in Warsaw. ``The support people had towards NATO has not
changed because of Kosovo. To tell the truth, it may have
increased.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the center in February showed 63 percent of Poles
supported joining NATO. That edged up to 70 percent in a poll
completed March 31 _ after a week of bombing showed that the
campaign against Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic was going to be
long and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Poland approves of NATO's airstrikes, but
support is strong _ between 50 and 60 percent in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   The way Poles see it, twice in this century the West failed to
back Poland against a powerful foe: in 1939, when Britain and
France allowed Hitler to annex parts of Poland, setting the stage
for World War II; and again in 1945, when Britain and the US
accepted the division of Europe into two camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering our historical background, this is a very positive
change for Poland,'' said Col. Wieslaw Kurzyca, deputy head of the
Polish military's liaison office with NATO. ``That happiness is
offset by the war. It was bad luck. Our new situation is very
fortunate, but we cannot enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland was a battleground in most of the great European wars,
and it was partioned, annexed, and erased from maps for long
periods by the Austro-Hungarian, Prussian and Russian empires.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Poland's defiance of foreign crackdowns and
military invasions is etched into one of Warsaw's central
monuments, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which celebrates the
Polish Army' resistance against Nazi Germany; the ill-fated 1943
Warsaw Getto uprising; and Poland's struggles for independence from
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   It was here, just a few blocks from the building where the
Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites signed the Warsaw
Pact agreement in 1955, that the NATO flag was raised last month
next to the Polish flag.
</P>
<P>
   Just days later, NATO began bombing Yugoslavia, with the full
backing of Poland's government. The few Poles who dissented
expressed concern over the precedent NATO's action sets for
international law.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did NATO, that is the United States, illegitimately
appoint itself policeman of the world?'' asked an editorial in the
leftist Trybuna daily.
</P>
<P>
   But many Poles, mindful of their own history, support the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1939, Europeans did not want to die to save Gdansk from
Hitler, and so we got World War II,'' said Pawel Wronski, defense
and security analyst at Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's most influential
daily. ``Sometimes you need to use force to stop a greater evil.''
</P>
<P>
   But could Poland to contribute to that force if NATO decided to
send in ground troops? Like the Czech Republic and Hungary, which
also gained membership to NATO in March, Poland has met the
alliance's minimal criteria by cutting the size of its Soviet-style
army, putting its military under civilian control, and agreeing to
purchase NATO military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But the Polish army will not be fully integrated into NATO until
2003. In many ways, it is still the same under-equipped, draft army
it was before, lacking officers who speak English, training with
NATO forces, and even NATO flags, Wronski said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Poland has one elite unit, the ``Red Berets,'' who have
trained with American troops and is considered combat-ready. But
Kurzyca of the Defense Ministry said Poland, which has had
peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia since 1992, was ready
to send a similar force to Kosovo to help implement an eventual
peace agreement to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Poles are eager to do something to show their loyalty. Although
no government official will say so, NATO membership for Poland, the
Czech Republic and Hungary is first and foremost a guarantee
against threats from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's angry response was not lost on people in Warsaw. For
Poles, Russia's nuclear saber-rattling over the NATO bombing, which
included a vague proposal to put nuclear weapons back in the former
Soviet republic of Belarus, Poland's neighbor to the east,
underscored the importance of NATO's security umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``During communism, we were always afraid of American weapons,''
said Wronski. ``After communism, we are always afraid of Russia.
How long do we have to be afraid? Now, we are really not afraid.''

NEW YORK GANG SAYS IT'S REFORMED; AUTHORITIES DOUBTFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They shot enemies at point-blank range, sliced gang
tattoos off the arms of members who crossed them, and recruited
children to peddle crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation say they
have buried their past. No more drugging and thugging. They say
they are transforming into a political force that will push members
to educate themselves so they can fight government, police
brutality, and corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message several Kings and Queens from the New York
City group brought to the Harvard Film Archives Thursday during the
premiere of their documentary ``Black &AMP; Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Latino elders say they do not see evidence that the
Kings in Massachusetts have changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, police have charged Latin Kings throughout the
state with crimes, most of them drug offenses. Police say there are
as many as 2,000 members, with the strongest hold in the western
part of the state, in cities such as Springfield and Holyoke.
</P>
<P>
   They see the local screening as a ploy to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hand out recruitment fliers saying they are against
violence, then at the next meeting they'll administer beatings,''
said Detective Lieutenant Thomas J. Quiggley of the Massachusetts
State Police Gang Unit.
</P>
<P>
   But some Latinos are reluctant to accept the Kings' claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust gangs, period,'' said Reyito Santiago, a
director of the Roberto Clemente Baseball League in Bosto's Roxbury
neighborhood. His nephew, Victor Roman, was stabbed to death by a
gang member in 1990. To him, all gangs represent evil. ``If they're
trying to change, I wish them luck.''
</P>
<P>
   William Rodriguez, executive director of the Crime and Justice
Foundation, an agency that advocates for criminal justice reform,
said he doubts that gangs can change.
</P>
<P>
   But Willie Morales, a Boston YMCA director, a former member of
the X-Men gang, said he believes the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them at a public speakout in New York City a year and a
half ago. It was a pretty positive event. I saw it as legit from
the get-go,'' Morales said. ``I admire them. They're not saying
we're former Latin Kings. They are saying, `We are Latin Kings.'
They're not trying to hide their past. I think their past makes
them more credible with young people.''
</P>
<P>
   For many followers, the gang's past is alluring as well. Kings
use hand signs and chant ``Amor de rey'' (King love), which boosts
gang members' egos. They wear black and gold, colors they say
symbolize life and death. The males are kings, and females are
queens, titles that create pride.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say young people are mostly attracted to gangs
because youths want to belong to an accepting peer group. A
charismatic leader, they say, can persuade members to do almost
anything _ from the most heinous acts to the kindest ones.
</P>
<P>
   For Hector Torres, who described himself as one of the leaders
of the New York City Latin King and Queen Nation, the Kings are
following in the tradition of the Young Lords, a group that changed
from a street gang to a political organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome people to question our past, our violent past.
We're not saying we're Boy Scouts,'' Torres said. ``Recognize, too,
that America has the most violent past.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres said he tells members, who number more than 3,000 in New
York City alone, to stay in school, do their homework, stay away
from drugs. He says Kings check up on one another, to make sure
they are not cutting school. Older Kings mentor younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, they have marched in rallies in New York, most
of them demonstrations against police brutality. Torres speaks out
against what he calls America's investment in prisons, and policies
that continue to ensure prisons are filled.
</P>
<P>
   But most of what is shown during the 74-minute documentary is
individuals such as the Rev. Al Sharpton and Richie Perez, the
national director of the Congress of Puerto Rican Rights, speaking
highly of Latin Kings.
</P>
<P>
   It was produced by Big Noise Films, which was created by two
Harvard students, Rick Rowley, who is studying film, and Jacquie
Soohen, who is studying political science. They spent more than a
year and $5,000 of their own money making the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a kind of unity and power and a love that's
difficult to find anywhere,'' Rowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio ``King Tone'' Fernandez, the former leader who is
awaiting sentencing on charges of conspiracy to sell drugs, gets
most of the screen time. He says things such as, ``We are not
minorities any longer. Once you become a Latin King. We are the
majority, and we are not only the majority, we are royalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 40, said there is a struggle brewing in the New York
City Kings, with some members pushing for a violent direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle becomes between the good and the bad,'' Torres
said. ``There will always be a struggle for control of power,
whether it's the Girl Scouts, IBM or the Latin Kings.''

NOT A TIME TO FLINCH FROM THE QUESTIONS

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ School uniforms will not fix what has gone
wrong in America, but already we are seizing on such facile
solutions in the aftermath of the massacre this week at Columbine
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of addressing the need for stricter gun controls and
better outreach services to alienated adolescents, we are talking
about dress codes, video games, and rock 'n' roll lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Like every act of violence, the slaying of 12 students and a
teacher by two disaffected teenagers is a reflection of the culture
in which it occurred. Our children play out apocalyptic fantasies
on their computer screens. They listen to the suicidal seductions
of self-styled ``death rockers.'' They line up for tickets to
movies marketing horror and mayhem expressly to them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our children, however, do not spend their weekends at
dad's workbench fashioning pipe bombs out of propane tanks from the
backyard grill. Most do not stroll into school on a sunny spring
morning, toting sawed-off shotguns and semiautomatic rifles under
their long black coats.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did the two presumed killers Eric Harris, 18, and
Dylan Klebold, 17?
</P>
<P>
   We can blame Marilyn Manson, and what adult would not be
tempted? But we have been here before. In Bethel, Alaska. In Pearl,
Miss. In West Paducah, Ky. In Jonesboro, Ark. In Edinboro, Pa. In
Springfield, Ore. Haven't we learned yet that the obvious answers
are the simplistic ones?
</P>
<P>
   It may be more comforting to blame an epidemic of teen suicide
on Kurt Cobain than to confront the psychic pain so many of our
children are apparently suffering.
</P>
<P>
   If we are going to look to the culture to explain the gunfire
that rained terror and death in the halls of one of Colorado's best
public high schools, let's talk, too, about the proliferation of
guns and the epidemic of adult indifference to children in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of our unwillingness to tackle those
considerably tougher issues that the sponsor of legislation to
expand the right to carry concealed weapons in Colorado withdrew
the bills until the next legislative session out of ``respect'' for
the Columbine victims and their families. If the sponsor, House
Majority Leader Doug Dean, wants to honor the victims of Tuesday's
shooting rampage he should rewrite his legislation to ban concealed
weapons entirely, just as seven other states do.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for movie star and gun lobbyist Charlton Heston
to make the fatuous claim that the Columbine tragedy could have
been avoided if only the school had employed an armed guard. Dean,
a Republican from Colorado Springs, knows that an armed guard was
employed there. But an armed guard was little defense against two
people bent on murder and suicide and equipped with a 9mm
semiautomatic carbine, two sawed-off shotguns and one semiautomatic
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   We do not yet know where the killers got the weapons that
wreaked such destruction, but the fact that two such disaffected
young people had access to so much firepower should give us more
than pause. It ought to mobilize us with the same sense of urgency
that propelled Great Britain to ban handguns in the wake of the
fatal shootings of a kindergarden teacher and 16 of her students in
a schoolhouse in Dunblane, Scotland in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Alone, a ban on guns would not have prevented the carnage at
Columbine High School anymore than a ban on Marilyn Manson's CDs.
The makings for the more than 30 crude pipe bombs that Harris and
Klebold planted throughout their school and its parking lots are
available at most hardware srores.
</P>
<P>
   What was less available to these children was the active concern
of alert adults. Columbine school official will tell you that the
boys, members of an informal clique known as the Trench Coat Mafia,
dressed in black dusters and dark sunglasses, but gave no hint of
the carnage to come. They will tell you that Columbine High School
is a safe suburban school where the tensions between cliques of
preppies, of jocks, of freaks and ``goths'' is no more alarming
then it has ever been at any American high school. But the facts
are clearly otherwise. Six months ago, the Jefferson County
Sheriff's Department warned school officials that fights among
suburban students were increasing. Administrators dismissed those
alarms then, and again this week as an exaggeration, despite the
fact that in the last academic year 506 students in Colorado were
expelled for bringing weapons to school. That's an 18 percent
increase from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In the specific case of Harris and Klebold, the warning sounds
were loud and clear, had only some adult been listening and willing
to intervene. The pair produced a video for a television production
course that classmates say displayed violent gunplay in the school.
One Columbine High School parent says he reported to the Jefferson
County Sheriff last year that Harris, who maintained a well-known
and hate filled website, had threatened his son. In addition, both
boys were arrested a year ago for a property crime. They would
celebrate a strike scored during a school bowling class with a Nazi
salute, a fascination with Adolf Hitler that extended to wearing
Nazi paraphernalia and scrawling swastikas on their books,
</P>
<P>
   Harris wrote essays for his English classes preoccupied with
death and other dark themes.
</P>
<P>
   This set off no alarm bells?
</P>
<P>
   These kids even advertised their despair. In a yearbook ad last
year the Trench Coat Mafia celebrated their ``Insanity.'' ``Stay
Alive, Stay Different,'' they wrote. ``Stay Crazy.''.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Denver School District banned black trench coats
in class and the mayor called on Marilyn Manson to cancel his
concert here next week. That oughta solve things.

CAUGHT IN THE FIRE, A VARIETY OF LIVES AND DREAMS

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Before the bullets and bombs, before the
tears, they were volleyball players and actors, church group
members and fishermen, honor students and average students, beloved
friends and treasured children.
</P>
<P>
   Before they were victims, they laughed, got sad, wrote poetry,
worked after school, watched movies, did homework, picked colleges,
had crushes. They went to the mall, pleased and perplexed their
parents, babysat, and dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 students massacred Tuesday at Columbine High School fit
no neat categories or cliques, no convenient pattern from which
conclusions about their killers' motives can be drawn. One was
black, four were girls; some were jocks, some were not; some were
leaders, some were followers; some were seniors, some juniors, some
sophomores, at least one a freshman. The 22 other injured students,
more than a dozen still hospitalized Thursday, were similarly
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, the real possibility that when the gunmen
were not simply spraying bullets and tossing explosives, they were
targeting anyone plainly unlike themselves. They killed students
with easy smiles and high hopes, healthy relationships and bright
futures, comfortable in the world, in their community and in their
school.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the dead was one teacher, William ``Dave'' Sanders,
who taught business and coached girls' basketball and softball. He
fit that same description, friends and students said Thursday,
describing a man who cherished his wife, his daughter, three
stepdaughters, several grandchildren, and many hundreds of other
people's children he taught and coached for nearly a
quarter-century. He died clutching a family photo, telling the
students who worked for hours in vain to stop his bleeding, ``Tell
my girls I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a spring snowstorm blanketed this grieving city,
providing a temporary cover for the spontaneous memorials that have
sprung up all around the school grounds to declare everlasting love
for the 13 victims, and, in some cases, forgiveness for their
presumed killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's snow also threatened to delay the expected May
blooming of the delicate columbine flowers, sprightly blue and
white perennials for which the school is named. For the moment, no
one here is ready for such a concomitant of spring. Rather, they
want to stop the world long enough to look back and remember.
</P>
<P>
   Through tears and a quavering voice, Carol Samson, an advanced
placement English teacher, wanted to share a line from
Shakespeare's ``Othello,'' a play that had so moved slain senior
Lauren Townsend. It comes from Act 5, Scene 2, when Desdemona's
maid says to Othello: ``Thou hast killed the sweetest innocent that
e'er did lift up eye.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be no better description for Townsend, her teacher
said. ``She's just an excellent woman, tall and thin, beautiful,
with a fragile voice. But we've lost her. I'll never forget her.
Now she's engraved on my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Samson said Townsend had stood in her classroom just days ago,
holding a baby chick she was raising as part of a science project
before giving it to a farm. ``I just keep seeing her with that
chick, how loving she was, how good she was,'' Samson said.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend, 18, was captain of the girls' volleyball team, coached
by her mother, and worked in an animal shelter. She also carried a
perfect 4.0 grade point average and was a candidate for
valedictorian at a May 23 graduation, after which she planned to
attend Colorado State University.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine High School class play, performed just days before
the student body was thrust into a real-life drama, called for
Rachel Scott, 17, to play an outcast, a student searching for
herself in a world of peer pressure and popularity contests.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Scott, a teenager who read the Bible as
enthusiastically as she did stage scripts, rose beyond
expectations, stealing the scenes in ``Smoke in the Room.'' She was
pretty, confident, and had a reputation for warmth, distancing
herself from petty rifts in high school hallways. She wanted to
join a missionary group in Africa, said her friend Rob Salyer, who
worked with her at a local Subway sandwich shop.
</P>
<P>
   During the massacre, Rachel Scott's younger brother Craig, 16,
played dead in the library and helped lead others to safety. After
they were safe, Craig Scott led the group in prayer for their
siblings trapped inside. All emerged safely except for Rachel. Her
car later became a shrine in the school parking lot, covered with
flowers, candles, and heartbreaking notes from friends.
</P>
<P>
   If any one death revealed the twisted minds of the killers, it
was the execution-style slaying of Isaiah Shoels, 18, a senior and
the only black victim. Witnesses said he was singled out because of
his race and his status as a popular athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Shoels had suffered health problems as a child and had heart
surgery twice, pulling through despite fears he would die on the
operating table. He dreamed of becoming a music executive. A
wrestler and football player, Shoels made up for his small stature
with hard work, lifting weights so much that he could bench-press
twice his weight.
</P>
<P>
   Shoels' father, Michael Shoels, said Thursday that Isaiah and
his brother and sister, all three of whom attended Columbine, had
been repeatedly harassed by the presumed killers and their friends,
the self-styled ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Before killing themselves, Klebold and Harris also robbed this
community of the first boy Michelle Oetter ever loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met at church,'' Oetter said Thursday, recalling her
initial crush on 16-year-old John Tomlin, a sophomore two years her
junior whose broad shoulders and blue eyes first drew her to him.
Tomlin was a young man who loved his Chevrolet pickup, his
after-school jobs tending plants at a nursery, and, like many of
the teenagers here, Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``John had a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,'' Oetter
said. ``And I do, too. And I know he's in heaven right now. I know
I will see him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin was in the library, Oetter said, probably reading his
favorite automotive magazine, sitting alone, when he was shot and
killed. The tuxedo he was supposed to wear to Oetter's prom this
weekend at a nearby high school hangs in the hallway of his
family's home. His parents spent Thursday making plans for their
son's funeral in Wisconsin, where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Mauser, 15, a sophomore, also was in the school library
when he was ambushed. No one who knew the blond-haired boy with
glasses was surprised that he was studying during lunch hour,
sitting alone because his small group of friends had differing
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him since first grade,'' said Kristen Schoenoff,
also a sophomore. She was among the students who ran to safety from
the cafeteria Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just the sweetest kid. He probably would not even have
known about the Trenchcoat Mafia,'' she added. ``I can't imagine
what he must have been thinking,'' Schoenoff added. ``But I can't
cry right now. I can't cry anymore. I just feel dried up. I prayed
and prayed last night. I don't know what else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauser was also remembered Thursday as a boy who knew how to
make his elderly neighbor Ken Greenlaw feel good about his fate.
Greenlaw suffered a debilitating heart attack five years ago, so
Mauser would come to his house and rake leaves, said Greenlaw's
crying wife, Donna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he couldn't work, Ken spent a lot of time making
birdhouses,'' Donna Greenlaw said. ``Dan would come by and say,
`Hey Ken, that's a great job you're doing there.' Dan was a very
deep child, a very sweet boy. We've watched him grow up. We wanted
to watch him become a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassie Bernall, 17, was a junior whose friends knew what she
would have wanted them to do: They went to church. She was a member
of the West Bowles Community Church youth group, which also counted
Rachel Scott among its members. Friends said Bernall loved God
above all, and two years ago became a born-again Christian. She
also was passionate about writing poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Corey DePooter, 17, was going through life having fun. He was
easygoing, a fisherman, devoting as many hours as he could spare to
the pleasure of sitting with his friends and waiting for a bite.
</P>
<P>
   On land, DePooter liked to get around on in-line skates or in
golf spikes, translating his enjoyment of golf into a job doing
maintenance at a golf course. DePooter was thinking about joining
the Marines. He had been on the wrestling team, but quit to focus
on his schoolwork, friends said. DePooter's 15-year-old sister,
Jenna, escaped from the school unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of 16-year-old Kelly Fleming, who moved to Colorado just
18 months ago, say she was in the library when gunfire erupted, and
they imagine her writing poetry, as she often did, dedicating pages
each day to a journal of life experiences. She wrote short stories
as a hobby, hoping to one day have a writing career. Looking
forward to getting her driver's license this summer, Fleming stood
out for her maturity and curiosity, philosophic in ways beyond her
years, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Kechter was 16, a strapping junior whose hobby was
weightlifting. He hoped to start for the football team as a
lineman. At the same time, he maintained an A average. Witnesses
said he was shot in the library while trying to reach friends
hiding in the adjacent video room.
</P>
<P>
   The three other dead students were identified as Steven Curnow,
14, a freshman who dreamed of being a Navy top gun and piloting an
F-16; Daniel Rohrbough, 15, who helped in his father's electronics
business and was shot while holding a door open for fleeing
students; and Kyle Velasquez, whose age was not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of lean years, the Columbine girls' basketball
team last season rewarded its long-suffering coach, Sanders, with a
winning record, 12-9. But it wasn't the wins that motivated
Sanders, 47, the only teacher killed, said his friend and fellow
coach, Rick Bath.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarterfinals of last season's girls' softball
tournament, the team's best player, All-American catcher Amber
Burgess, was at bat in the last inning with two outs and a runner
on first base. Their team was losing 4-3. But Burgess couldn't
muster the hit; she grounded out, ending the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first reaction was to run to Amber, to take care of her,''
Bath recalled. ``Winning was nice, but what mattered to him was the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Sanders died a hero, running into the cafeteria
to warn students when he saw the heavily armed gunmen headed that
way. As a result, witnesses said, the cafeteria was nearly empty
when the killers arrived. But Sanders, fatally wounded, could only
stumble into a science classroom where students were hiding. He
died how he lived, surrounded by students.

SURVEY CITES EASY ACCESS TO WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>

   WASHINGTON _ Guns are easy for teenagers to come by, even in
states where it is illegal to own or possess one, criminologists
and gun-control advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 60 percent of students in grades six through 12 said
they ``could get a handgun if they wanted one,'' according to a
survey of 2,508 students across the United States commissioned by
the Chicago-based Joyce Foundation several years ago. One-third
said they could find a handgun in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet known how the two young gunmen in Littleton,
Colo., got their hands on the handgun, rifle, sawed-off shotguns,
and more than 30 explosive devices they apparently used during
their bloody rampage through their high school.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear, academics say, that the number of school
shootings and other mass slayings has climbed dramatically in the
past two decades as a result of greater and easier access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame guns for creating monsters, but you can use
them to explain the large body counts and these tragic
circumstances,'' said Jack Levin, a criminologist at Northeastern
University in Boston. ``It's the proliferation of firearms among
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Two in 25 high school students, or 7.9 percent, reported having
carried a gun in the past 30 days, according to the national
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have lots of access to guns because there are lots of
guns out there,'' said Stephen Teret, director of the Center for
Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 220 million guns in circulation, and an
additional 12 million guns are manufactured and sold each year,
according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Juveniles get guns by buying them illegally on the street, at
gun shows, and through newspaper ads, or by stealing them, paying
someone to buy them, or taking them from their home or the home of
a friend or family member, according to gun crime specialists.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in almost every major school shooting case over the past
two years, juveniles most often use firearms taken from their home
or the home of a family member. Criminologists expect the Colorado
shooting too fit the same pattern.
</P>
<P>
   In a study for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention, researchers found that 53 percent of the 758 high
school students they interviewed said they could ``borrow'' a gun
from someone they know.
</P>
<P>
   There are guns in one-third to half of all American households,
according to government statistics. And a study conducted last year
for a handgun-control activist group arrived at similar figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 42 percent who reported a gun at home, many said that
the guns were loaded and unlocked,'' said Bob Walker, director of
Handgun Control, a group started by James Brady, the White House
press secretary who was wounded during the assassination attempt
against President Ronald Reagan. ``The key is for parents to make
sure their children cannot access the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   After several school shootings had occurred last year, the
Senate voted down a measure that would hold parents responsible for
keeping their guns locked away from their children. A similar bill
is pending this year in both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, there is no minimum age required by law to
possess a firearm, although a juvenile must be at least 18, or 15
with parental consent, to receive the firearm identification card
that makes possession legal.

OBSERVATIONS ON AN AIR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been a number of astonishing developments in the four
weeks since NATO's air bombardment of what used to be Yugoslavia
brought war back to Europe. Here are some surprises,
contradictions, and unintended consequences:
</P>
<P>
   --It is incredible that thousands of combat sorties flown by
NATO aircrews against a relatively sophisticated air-defense system
came without the loss of a single flier. That only one plane has
been shot down is remarkable, given what the pilots face, the foul
weather, the difficult terrain, and the odds of maintaining a
perfect record of aircraft maintainance.
</P>
<P>
   --The United States slipped into a war for which none of us were
prepared. Americans don't seem to talk much about this war; it's
confusing, the geography is remote, the history complex, the
languages strange, the names difficult to spell. It's a TV and
newspaper war, but not a coffee-shop or kitchen-table war.
</P>
<P>
   --The refugees tipped the balance of public opinion, here and in
Europe. The plight of these strange mountain people, most of them
peasants evicted by a merciless military machine, became apparent
as they were driven out.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO's political coalition, stitching together 19 nations
ranging from the US to Iceland, has held together, with no
defections, or political collapse, in the face of the sternest
challenge the alliance has faced in its 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   --President Clinton's congressional opponents, so vociferous in
the year-long impeachment imbroglio have been virtually silenced by
the administration's conduct of a war that no one really
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   --The criticism of US policy by the dozen candidates seeking to
prevent the accession of Vice President Gore is strangely muted.
The war has diminished the candidacies of all but Senator John
McCain, whose clear grasp of the hard end of the stick has elevated
his standing. None of the others seemed willing to pay the price a
superpower must.
</P>
<P>
   --The obduracy of Slobodan Milosevic has surprised all who had
been assured the Serb chief understands only force and would back
down, as he has backed down before, when confronted with resolute
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   --The second-guessing of the NATO strategy seems to have
coalesced around the decision, announced at the outset of the air
war, that no ground combat forces would be employed. What seems
obvious now is that the threat, at least, of imminent invasion on
the ground was essential to convincing Milosevic of NATO's serious
intent. But it may have been a prudent political strategy, both for
assuring a public unprepared for casualties, and for keeping the
NATO governments in harness, to rule out ground combat at the
start.
</P>
<P>
   --The news Thursday that the European Union is prepared to
enforce an oil embargo against Serbia and Montenegro economy puts
more pressure on Milosevic. His house has been blown up; he's lost
half his jet fighters, 10 to 20 percent of his armor, probably
one-quarter of his antimissile defences, by Pentagon estimate. In
return, he shot down one US plane (whose pilot was rescued) and
captured three US soldiers on the border.
</P>
<P>
   --Yugoslavia's communications, infrastructure, oil refining
capacity, and rail and bridge network are getting hammered. This
gets worse by the day. The Serbs' economic infrastructure crumbles
before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   --What has to be conceded is that the NATO planners made a
colossal blunder in unerestimating Milosevic's willingness to
employ the scorched-earth tactics of Hitler and Stalin. By a
Reuters estimate, some 960,000 Kosovars have fled or been driven
from Kosovo in the last year, 590,000 of them since the bombing
began April 24.
</P>
<P>
   --A refugee crisis of a scale not seen in Europe since the Nazi
era complicates NATO's strategy. The European Union is much closer
to the disruption than we are. Our economy soars, as the Euro
plunges. One big reason for NATO's resolve: Europe cannot afford to
lose to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   --There is a slow but perceptible groundswell of reluctant
support for the use of ground troops. If that's what it will take,
then that's what it will take, seems to be the grim consensus.
Europe cannot have a million refugees sloshing around its southern
flanks, and remain unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   --The professionalism of the American military, never mind the
other NATO contributors, is praiseworthy on a number of counts.
Performing a dangerous job, under adverse conditions, in a cause
that is difficult to explain, in a region of the world where ethnic
hatred is the favorite crop, with allies of 18 different
nationalities and a dozen different languages, is an unusually
difficult assignment.
</P>
<P>
   --The West cannot afford to lose this war to a nationalist with
a taste for blood-curdling policies. The beast must be caged. The
390 million people of Europe, never mind the 300-odd million of the
US and Canada, cannot leave a rabid dog running wild at the edge of
Europe. Can one bloodthirsty dictator with fewer than 10 million
people under his heel get away with what this guy just did? Not for
much longer. This is not Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fire that badly needs putting out. NATO is in the
process. One month in, the Serbs have taken a shellacking. But
that's only a foretaste of what's to come, till their leader is
killed, toppled, or comes to realize his miscalculation.

CEILING FAN NEEDS ITS OWN SPECIAL BOX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 25, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Q. I would like to put a ceiling fan in a recessed ceiling
light, but the electrician said it is difficult to put a fan on a
can light. Is there a practical way to do so?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE MURRAY, Mendon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Frankly, no. There would have to be a fastener set up around
the can light to hold the fan, and since a ceiling fan must have a
special reinforced box identified for such use for legal
installation, you must do it another way.
</P>
<P>
   That other way is to remove the can light, and install the fan
in that special box. And buy a ceiling fan with its own built-in
lights.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to put cedar floor boards on my small balcony,
which is concrete, but I don't know quite how, and have gotten
various suggestions. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA STRINGER, Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A. Cedar can be used on your balcony floor, but it should be
raised above the concrete, and the boards spaced, to allow water to
drain through it and across the concrete to drain over the edge of
the balcony. If that is done, the cedar can last for many years. To
do this, install 2 x 4 sleepers on the balcony, from back to front,
on their wide side, 16 to 24 inches apart, using construction
adhesive. Then, nail or screw the cedar floor boards on the
sleepers. The cedar will weather to gray in two years.

wood floor under the hardwood. One man said he would put down
plywood, then the tiles with thin-set mortar. Another said he would
use cement board instead of plywood. A contractor said he didn't
think the granite tiles will stick to plywood with thin-set. Now I
am totally confused. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   SANDY ROSEN, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. How about taking up the old tiles, sanding the hardwood (or
have them sanded) and varnishing it with three coats of high-gloss,
oil-based polyurethane varnish? You will get a good-looking floor
that will resist wear and tear pretty well for a lot less money.
But even with a well-varnished floor, I would put a runner or a
carpet of some kind on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want the tiles, here is the best thing you can do. In
fact, you may not need to take up the hardwood, unless the added
tiles and underlayment would bring the floor up too high,
interfering with door openings. Use cement board, either on the
hardwood or on the subfloor; I think the cement board will give a
much better surface for the granite tiles.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you must be alert to: the cement board must be very
even; if there are any ridges or rises or any other uneven
surfaces, you run the risk of the tiles moving, despite the
thin-set, and breaking. A way to get around that is to use smaller
tiles.
</P>
<P>
   While I think the tiles will stick to plywood with thin-set,
they will stick much better with thin-set on cement board.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. I just cannot keep my stainless steel sink clean. And, I
think some kind of acid made a distinct stain on it. How can I
remove it, and how can I keep the sink clean looking?
</P>
<P>
   P.O., Stow, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Stainless steel is a great sink; I have one and have the same
problem of its never looking clean. It always looks a little
greasy. For polishing and cleaning, try Cameo Aluminum and
Stainless Steel Cleaner (in supermarkets).
</P>
<P>
   The acid might have etched the steel _ does the stain feel
rougher than the rest of the sink? _ If so, it is etched, and the
etching would have to be abraded off. So, Never Dull Magic Wadding
(in a blue and red can in hardware stores) might work.
</P>
<P>
   This might also work: Spray Easy Off oven cleaner, leave
overnight and wash. Once or twice a week, wash with baking soda. Do
not use steel wool on stainless; bits will get into steel and cause
rust spots.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am building an addition, and my builder says I don't need a
vapor barrier with insulation. Is that so? I have never heard of
that.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN QUARTARONE, Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No, it is not so. Every wall, ceiling and floor needs a vapor
barrier with the insulation. That is why insulation makers put
kraft paper (a vapor barrier) on one side of fiberglass insulation.
A vapor barrier should always face the heated part of the house.
</P>
<P>
   While insulation does insulate by reducing the loss of heat
through it to the outdoors, that's only half the job. A vapor
barrier is an air stop, which stops the passage of air to the
outdoors, therefore the passage of heat.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is suggested not to put a vapor barrier on the
attic floor; contractors were afraid a vapor barrier there would
seal the house up, allowing the buildup of pollution (mostly water
vapor) in the house. That could happen in a complete new house, but
it is impossible to seal up an existing house enough to cause
pollution buildup. As for the addition, this is only part of the
house, and while it may be very tight, the rest of the house is as
loose as a goose, preventing buildup of pollutants.

STUDY BACKS USE OF HEARTS FROM DONORS WITH HEPATITIS C 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Survival rates for patients who received heart
transplants from people infected with hepatitis C are not much
different than for similar patients who got uninfected hearts,
according to two studies.
</P>
<P>
   The findings lend support to the trend of using such organs in
the face of a nationwide shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become more pressing as the number of organs known
to be infected with hepatitis C grows. In Alabama, for instance, an
estimated 10 percent of donated hearts test positive for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The research, presented this week at the International Society
for Heart and Lung Transplantation in San Francisco, looked at
survival rates averaging about two years after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   One study also found the vast majority of the 40 patients who
got the infected hearts later showed evidence of the hepatitis C
virus in their bodies. Seven came down with hepatitis and one later
died of the disease, said Cedric Sheffield, a transplant surgeon at
the Cleveland Clinic and co-author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The results raise concerns among some doctors, who worry that
infecting more people with hepatitis C _ even if their lives are
saved in the process _ provides more chances for it to spread.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 percent of the U.S. population is believed to carry the
virus, which was discovered in 1989 and is transmitted by blood and
sometimes by sexual activity. The infection rate is much higher
among some groups, like IV-drug users.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers can be symptom-free for years, but many develop serious
liver damage. The only available treatments work in a small
percentage of patients, are very expensive and have serious side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1991, surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic began
offering some of the sickest patients _ expected to live only days
or weeks _ the chance to get a hepatitis C-infected heart in order
to replace their failing hearts faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``These patients are doing very poorly,'' said Nicholas G.
Smedira, transplant surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic and co-author
of the study. ``You have a great heart that matches their blood
type, you use it. You accept the immediate gain _ living _ for the
potential complication later on.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Cleveland Clinic, for instance, about 30 percent of the
people waiting for hearts die before they can get one, Smedira
said.
</P>
<P>
   While donation rates have risen slightly in the past few years,
air bags and seat belt laws have kept fewer people from dying in
car accidents, one of the chief sources of donated organs, said
James Kirklin, a transplant surgeon at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Kirklin co-authored a study to be presented Saturday that looked
at data collected from more than 40 transplant centers. It found
that just 64 out of 3,084 hearts transplanted from 1993 to 1997
were from hepatitis C infected donors.
</P>
<P>
   The survival rate of those patients mirrored that of patients
who were equally as sick at the time of the surgery, Kirklin said.
</P>
<P>
   The average follow-up was about two years, although some were
followed as long as 4 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Longer-term studies are needed to show how hepatitis progresses
in recipients. It is not known whether the anti-rejection drugs
patients must take will make them more susceptible in years to come
to the effects of the virus, Kirklin said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the new data on survival will encourage more
surgeons to use hearts infected with hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is increasing belief that depending on how sick
your patient is, the profound shortage of organ donors suggests
that in patients whom you believe their probability of survival is
very low, that it's probably totally justified to use hepatitis C
positive donor,'' he said.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the murders this week of 12 students and a teacher at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., by two classmates who
later turned their guns on themselves, pop culture again finds
itself on the hot seat of harsh scrutiny. That the apparent gunmen,
Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, were fans of goth music and
violent video games has led to the usual frenzied search among song
lyrics, Web sites, and popular movies and games for answers as to
the origins of this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is nothing new. In the 1950s, such films as
``Blackboard Jungle'' and ``Rebel Without a Cause'' were blamed for
encouraging teen delinquency. A decade later, some believed the
Beatles' so-called ``White Album'' _ in particular the songs,
``Helter Skelter,'' ``Piggies,'' and ``Revolution'' _ motivated
Charles Manson and his ragged ``family'' to commit the
Tate-LaBianca murders in Los Angeles in 1969. More recently,
hard-core and gangsta rap have been targeted as a frequent cause of
violence among youth.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Littleton tragedy, the media has latched onto such
names as Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Doom, KMFDM, and ``The
Basketball Diaries,'' presenting them as portholes into the minds
of these teenage murderers. It has revealed a pop-culture lexicon
familiar to youth but opaque to most. The following offers a brief
background on the most often-heard terms in the wake of this latest
school shooting:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROWTH OF GOTH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goth was one of the numerous subcultures that formed in England
in the wake of the punk-rock movement of the mid to late 1970s. As
is the case with many British music-and-fashion waves, it spread to
the United States a bit later and took hold here in the early
1980s. Despite having the earmarks of being a quick fad, goth
turned out to have long legs, remaining a force today. Longtime
English goth icon Nick Cave told the Globe last year: Goths ``are
the most enduring and brave of the (subcultures). There's something
sweet about that. When the big bomb goes off, all that's going to
survive are goths and cockroaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Favored goth bands of the day included Siouxie and the Banshees
_ singer Siouxie Sioux was held up as queen of the goths _ the
Cure, Joy Division, Bauhaus, and Depeche Mode. Goth musical culture
spills over into the more aggressive industrial rock genre, where
Marilyn Manson, KMFDM, and Ministry roam.
</P>
<P>
   The music goths listened to tended to employ minor chords and
take a downbeat worldview, expressing futility, frustration, and
despair. Bauhaus wrote ``Burning From the Inside,'' Joy Division
wrote ``Love Will Tear Us Apart.'' Fittingly, performers and
audiences dressed in black, with some folks sporting garish
eyeliner and powdered faces. The idea was to sport an unhealthy
looking pallor. Hair: dyed jet black. As with many of the post-punk
subcultures, one of the prime ideas was, and remains, to define
yourself as an outsider or outcast, yet bond with others who felt
similarly. If goths were angry, they tended to turn their anger
inward, maintaining an outward demeanor of passivity, taking solace
in shared gloom.
</P>
<P>
   At their best, ``goths are beautiful,'' Bauhaus singer Peter
Murphy told the Globe last year, citing ``a vast depth of
subcultural, aesthetic, and poetic ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Littleton shooting, one goth posted a message on a Web
site called www.gothmafia.com. It read: ``The `gothic influence'
does not kill. White supremacy, violence, and stupidity are not
part of the `gothic culture.' I am angry and saddened by what those
idiots . . . did. I am outraged at the scapegoating of the goth and
industrial scenes . . . The universal truth that individuals can be
complete losers on their own without a clique to blame has
obviously not occurred to some people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston area, the Cambridge club Man Ray has been the
nexus of goth culture, Thursday through Saturday.

 &QL; 
DOOM AND QUAKE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both these games were created by Texas-based id Software,
pioneers of first-person, shoot-'em-ups for the PC generation. In
1991, the company, founded by a handful of 20-something gamers and
tech-heads, created Wolfenstein 3-D for computers. The game was
instantly hailed for its three-dimensional, point-of-view design:
The player was the gun whose barrel maneuvered through each level.
It was also the first game with a major body count, with corpses
still strewn about long after they'd been shot. That game featured
a captured Allied soldier trying to escape from a prison filled
with gun-toting Nazis. Each level was adorned with swastikas and
renderings of Adolph Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, id had unveiled the futuristic Doom, which was
bolstered by technological advances and realistic graphics,
including eviscerated prisoners and rooms filled with bloody
skulls. Doom was a major leap in gaming, while maintaining the main
premise _ shoot anything that moves. That included other soldiers
and fireball-throwing imps. It also eliminated a traditional
scoreboard, tallying the percentage of kills at the end of each
level.
</P>
<P>
   But the game, which won several major awards from the leading
computer magazines, was also notably more violent. Everything was
dispatched in a splash of simulated blood and gore. A year later,
Doom II: Hell on Earth was released, and proved as popular as its
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   When Quake hit stores in 1996, it was unlike anything before.
Players could jump and swim through various environments. The
jaw-dropping design was so detailed that fired rockets left a trail
of light and smoke while traveling through a darkened hallway. It
also upped the ante with an extensive multiplayer mode that allowed
gamers, through the use of a modem, to compete against other
players worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In Quake, there were far more things to kill, among them armored
knights, chainsaw-wielding ogres, piranhas known as rotfish, and
razor-clawed fiends. Everything about the game was bigger, faster _
and a lot bloodier. There was a variety of ways to kill: from brass
knuckles to nail guns, from pump-action shotguns to grenade
launchers. Again, the level of violence and gore increased
significantly. Heads could be blown off, and various baddies could
be splattered in a number of ways depending on firepower. For
instance, a shotgun used at close range inflicted far more damage
and spewed more viscera than one used from a greater distance. It
was followed in 1997 by Quake II. Now Quake III is under
construction.

   Here was the scene outside last November before the rock group
Marilyn Manson played its concert in Lowell, Mass. Hundreds of kids
were milling about, many dressed in black, multiply pierced, highly
made up _ generally sporting the provocative goth look. And here
was the word from the police on-site: ``Well-behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is usually the case. A concert may have violent themes _
and you can go back to Alice Cooper of the early 1970s for this _
but it's all part of rock theater, at its best serving a cathartic
need for its intended audience, the young and rebellious, those in
need of a quasi-verboten thrill.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Manson _ both a band and the adopted name of Brian
Warner, the band's leader _ came up from Florida in the mid-1990s
and was nurtured by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, America's most
popular industrial rock band. The industrial genre, begun in the
late 1970s in England with bands such as Throbbing Gristle and in
Germany with Einsturzende Neubauten, came to prominence in the
United States via Chicago's Ministry in the late-1980s and, shortly
after, Nine Inch Nails. Featured sounds: piston-pounding rhythms,
barking vocals, anti-authoritarian worldview, heaping doses of
angst and anger, distorted synthesizers or guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Marilyn Manson band of today has gone in an
androgynous glam-rock direction, its 1996 breakthrough album,
``Antichrist Superstar,'' was full of rants such as ``let's kill
everyone and let God sort 'em out'' (``Irresponsible Hate Anthem'')
and ``I hate it all and I have no choice but to/I'll make everyone
pay and you'll see'' (``Man That You Fear'').

   Manson told the Globe that's ``how I define the more nihilistic,
hopeless elements of my personality. It's when you've finally given
up on the world and only want to see its destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the nihilistic premise behind much of what is called
death metal, a subset of heavy metal. You can trace its roots back
to Black Sabbath and up through Slayer, Metallica. A slew of bands
such as Deicide, Rob Zombie, KMFDM, Morbid Angel, and Napalm Death
employ helter-skelter tempos, thunderous drums and guitar, spewing
violent tales of death and destruction, satanism and damnation.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With their German backgrounds and violent-rich lyrics, KMFDM and
Rammstein are often crowded into the neo-Nazi category by critics.
Both groups beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``KMFDM are an art form not a political party,'' founder Sascha
Konietzko said in a statement loaded onto the KMFDM Web site
(www.KMFDM.com) on April 21. ``From the beginning our music has
been a statement against war, oppression, fascism, and violence
against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Although bound together by Littleton, the two groups come from
opposite ends of the musical spectrum. Rammstein was started in
Germany in 1995. The group is known for its rhythmic metal sound.
KMFDM, an industrial band known for fast beats and electronic
sounds, began in Paris in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   While KMFDM has influenced bands as mainstream as U2, it never
reached pop superstardom. The song ``Blitzkrieg'' includes the
lyrics: ``Leatherclad warriors/Fighting tolerant fools/Mutilation
of values/Where ignorance rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Rammstein turned an unlikely German metal song called ``You
Hate'' into an MTV and radio staple last summer, thanks to an
action-packed video that stole liberally from the films ``The Usual
Suspects'' and ``Reservoir Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, American fans had picked up more than
200,000 copies of Rammstein's album, ``Longing.'' Buyers heard
brutal songs like ``Jealousy,'' which begins: ``Am I pretty/Then
cut me in the face/Am I stronger/Break my neck in disgrace/Am I
smarter/Kill me and eat my brain.'' And even the less aggressive
tunes had an edge since they're sung in Rammstein's guttural,
consonant-rich native language.
</P>
<P>
   But the band, whose stage shows are famous for their eye-popping
pyrotechnics, states on its Web site: ``We only show violence
during our gigs and we make it the subject of our lyrics. But we
definitely refuse to practice violence . . .''

Hate sites
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hate proliferates in cyberspace, where fringe groups of any
persuasion can spread their messages quickly and inexpensively.
Even the most rudimentary search can lead to propaganda pages
posted by neo-Nazis, white supremacists, Holocaust deniers, and
bigots of every stripe. Experts say there are some 250
sophisticated hate sites on-line, plus more than a thousand
additional sites run by militia and terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, recipes for explosive devices are all over the
Net, notably in excerpts from ``The Anarchist Cookbook'' or a page
called the Racial Holy War Kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether the gunmen in Littleton, Colo., pulled
bomb recipes off the Internet. But it is clear that one of the
killers, Eric Harris, posted violent material on his America Online
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   David Goldman, founder of the activist group, Hatewatch.org of
Cambridge, Mass., said he had received material from Harris's Web
site before the tragedy, but he dismissed it as the ramblings of an
alienated teenager. ``You have to distinguish between individuals
who are lured into hate groups because they are alienated and angry
and individuals who are ideologically committed to national
socialism or white supremacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is said to have frequented a site called the Floating
Pancreas, an anarchistic site emblazoned with grinning skulls. It
features a page called Nazi DiscOrama, which asks, ``Care to cut
the rug with Hitler?'' and features a collage of Hitler's face,
arranged Andy Warhol-style.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, said, ``The subculture of hate on-line gives
deep resonance to and magnifies feelings of alienation and anger.''
</P>
<P>
   But while hate is just a mouse click away in cyberspace, the
Internet can also be a powerful teaching tool. Scores of civil
rights groups have created their own sites as an antidote to hate
sites. ``People and parents have to understand that what frightens
them about the Net also _ and I hate the term _ empowers them,''
said Goldman. ``It's a powerful tool to sit down with your child
and talk about hate groups in a contextualized situation. Kids need
to know what the moral parameters are, and you don't do that by
putting in V-chips and blocking software. You need to arm your kids
with information, and that requires sitting down, taking that extra
step, and looking at this stuff.''

Movie violence
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural Born Killers'' and ``The Basketball Diaries'' don't
have much in common. One's a major Hollywood film about a couple on
a violent rampage. The other's a small independent movie about poet
and singer Jim Carroll's drug-addled teenage years.
</P>
<P>
   But the two films have found common ground in the courts.
Lawsuits say the makers of both movies drove kids to violence. And
after the Littleton tragedy, ``Heathers'' and ``The Matrix'' may
soon be added to the list.
</P>
<P>
   The stylish ``Matrix'' shows Keanu Reeves and company blowing
away the enemy in hip black shades and chic leather jackets. That's
just how the teens, clad in trench coats, looked to at least one
terrified witness as the pair bombed and shot their way through
Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Since the so-called ``Trench Coat Mafia'' members used bombs to
hurt their victims, people are pointing to the 1989 cult classic
``Heathers'' as a latter-day inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Violence and film are not exactly distant cousins. ``Clockwork
Orange,'' ``The Deer Hunter,'' and ``Money Train'' have had scenes
that reportedly spawned copycat crimes. ``The Deer Hunter'' was
responsible for Russian roulette deaths; ``Money Train'' inspired
people to ignite token booth clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the parents of three students killed in a high school
shooting spree in Kentucky announced they were suing Time Warner,
New Line Cinema, and Island Pictures among others. They say the boy
responsible for the carnage, Michael Carneal, was inspired by a
scene in the 1995 film ``The Basketball Diaries.'' In a dream
sequence in that movie, a trench-coat-clad Leonardo DiCaprio goes
on a shooting spree in a school.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of freedom of speech and First Amendment rights won't
shield filmmakers from the legal onslaught. Last month, the Supreme
Court decided to allow the ``Natural Born Killers,'' case, in which
a couple shot a woman after watching the film, to move forward. The
lawsuit says the film intended to make viewers commit a crime after
watching the movie.

   WASHINGTON _ When the Clinton administration was contemplating
launching airstrikes against Yugoslavia, Vice President Al Gore
stepped forward to advocate more rather than less use of force
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's hawkishness _ an extension of his attitude toward Bosnia
years earlier when he argued behind the scenes for early and
forceful US intervention in that area of the Balkans _ was far more
evident than even that of President Clinton and national security
adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger, those familiar with the
conversations said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also was among those top officials, including
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who initially thought ``a
little bit of bombing would go a long way,'' said Ivo Daalder, a
former national security aide to Clinton who informally consults
with administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is campaigning for president, perhaps has more at
stake in the Kosovo crisis than Clinton, who only has to worry
about the history books.
</P>
<P>
   If the NATO mission is a success, analysts say, Gore can claim
credit for his role. If it turns into a disaster, his campaign may
be the first casualty. Gore does not want to be running for
president if US ground troops _ other than a peacekeeping force _
are in the Balkans, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore offered what remains the most definitive statement
by the administration against using ground troops. At a campaign
stop in New Hampshire in the opening days of the airstrikes, he
said: ``We are not going to put any ground troops into a combat
situation. Neither are our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement went further than the administration line, perhaps
because Gore's chief foreign policy adviser, Leon S. Fuerth, had
suffered a mild heart attack and was not on the trip. Clinton and
other US foreign policymakers had been saying the United States has
``no intentions'' or ``no plans'' to use ground troops, leaving
America and its allies wiggle room to change their position.
</P>
<P>
   Gore read from the White House script the next day, saying,
``There is no consideration by NATO or any of the allies for the
introduction of ground troops.'' But the incident underscored the
dilemma for Gore and the high stakes.
</P>
<P>
   A protracted military struggle in Kosovo could be a drag on
Gore's presidential aspirations, especially if ground troops end up
being dispatched, because many analysts say history shows that
voters are unlikely to reward the party that gets the country into
a war.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, analysts say Gore can't afford to distance
himself from Clinton and a policy he played a role in formulating,
even if NATO does resort to ground troops, because voters might
view that stance with suspicion. It's a lesson then-Vice President
Hubert H. Humphrey learned in 1968 when he tried to extract himself
from President Lyndon B. Johnson's policy in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters politically is not what happens now, but whether
or not the policy succeeds down the road,'' said Anthony Lake,
Clinton's former national security adviser. ``So you make these
decisions not based on what it may look like politically now, but
the substance of these decisions, and how they play out later. And
we simply can't know that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Fitzwater, former press secretary to presidents Reagan
and Bush, said if the NATO bombing campaign is over by the 2000
election, ``win, lose or draw, I think it doesn't have much
impact'' on Gore. ``But if it's still going on, then it does,
because it forces him to take a position on how he would end it or
how he would carry it out.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the Kosovo issue has given Gore a prime
opportunity to display a grasp of foreign policy, as he did in his
first major speech on the crisis Wednesday at Ellis Island. It also
highlights the reason Clinton chose him as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has played a central role in all major foreign policy in
this administration from day one,'' said Bruce Jentleson, an
informal adviser to Gore and a senior fellow at the US Institute of
Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is he involved, but the president does rely very
heavily on his advice,'' Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the land mines for Gore, Kosovo has raised the public's
awareness of the dangers outside the US shores and the value of a
president with a handle on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Gore suffers in the opinion polls for his
unswerving loyalty to Clinton during last year's sex scandal and
impeachment, Kosovo ``turns attention from Monica, which is helpful
for Gore,'' said historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, she said, Kosovo ``has sped up the presidential
primary process, because it has given a voice to some of his
opponents,'' such as Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and
former Vietnam prisoner of war who has been vocal about using
ground troops if they are necessary to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, Republican presidential candidates are divided on
the issue, and Gore's only Democratic challenger, former Senator
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, has yet to articulate how his views on
Kosovo differ from the administration's.
</P>
<P>
   But most irritating for Gore and his allies are some
Republicans' description of the conflict as the ``Clinton-Gore
war.'' Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, decried the label as
injecting politics into a national security issue that should be
off limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is not to allow our foreign policy to be whipsawed
by domestic political concerns in any way, shape or form,'' Lehane
said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has absorbed much of Gore's time and attention. It
has become the most frequently asked question when he campaigns
around the country. He gets updates from two military aides,
decorated veterans of the Gulf War who travel with him. When in
Washington, he participates in the daily foreign policy briefings
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He has placed calls to former presidents to explain the
administration's policy, and he exchanged telephone calls with
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, who turned his plane
away from Washington after Gore informed him of the start of the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could be a crucial link in a diplomatic solution if it
involves Russia. The vice president has a long-standing
relationship with former Russian prime minister Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, who was chosen by President Boris N. Yeltsin last
week as his personal envoy to settle the Yugoslav conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav conflict might end up being helpful for Gore, said
Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution.
In the absence of a crowded Democratic field of candidates running
for president, he said, there is nothing like a war to concentrate
the mind ``in a very special way.''

NATO AT 50: EX-LEADERS SEE LIMITS TO NEW ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, Mass. _ In a sunny office on the campus of Tufts
University this week, two white-haired former generals were
reminiscing about the war that never happened _ and the one that
did.
</P>
<P>
   Each had been supreme commander of NATO in Europe, an elite club
of US Army generals that began with Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1950.
Under their authority was an arsenal of tanks, planes, and infantry
built for one purpose: to defend the democracies west of the Iron
Curtain even if it meant a nuclear battle that would have laid
waste to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   NATO never fought that war. Its great adversary, the Soviet
Union, broke up in 1991. And now in the Balkans, the old soldiers
agreed, NATO is in a fight unlike any they could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Allied Force ``has taken me into a new era,'' said
Andrew Goodpaster, who headed NATO from 1969 to 1975 and is now a
fellow at the Eisenhower World Affairs Institute in Washington.
``The experience we are having in Kosovo requires us to do some
very serious thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are very lucky that NATO is hanging together,''
said John R. Galvin, who served as NATO commander from 1987 to 1992
and is now dean of Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
Galvin had invited Goodpaster to Tufts on Tuesday to address
graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   As leaders of the 19-member alliance mark its half-century
anniversary, those two issues _ the radical new role NATO has
assumed in the Balkans and the present and future stability of a
group of nations as dissimilar as Iceland and Hungary, as
suspicious of one another as Greece and Turkey _ will surely
dominate discussion.
</P>
<P>
   And that could be a big problem, said Ashton B. Carter, who was
assistant secretary of defense for international security during
President Clinton's first term and is now a professor at Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the world around us contains its Kosovos, we
shouldn't be fooled into thinking that is the most important
security priority'' for NATO, said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter lists Kosovo as a ``C priority.'' His A-list includes
threats like the one the Soviet Union once posed. Though there is
not a Soviet-style foe lurking in the world right now, he said,
NATO should always be focused on that kind of problem. Among its
concerns, he said, should be preventing Russia from collapsing and
becoming desperate and militaristic; managing the relationship with
China as it grows into a global power; guarding against the spread
of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons; and countering
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's B-level priority, he said, should be maintaining its
ability to fight two major wars in different parts of the world.
Only after taking care of those concerns, he added, should the
Balkans be on the alliance's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But the Balkan crisis is too big right now to be set to the
side, he acknowledged, worrying that ``the preoccupation with
Bosnia and Kosovo will slow the process of strategic adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's Washington summit was originally designed to make
that very adjustment. Then came Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Allied Force, the first official engagement that NATO
has fought in its 50 years, is precedent-setting on many counts,
analysists say. It is, for instance, a military venture that does
not strictly defend the territory of NATO members, as outlined in
the alliance's charter. In addition, unlike the 1995 NATO bombing
campaign in Bosnia, Allied Force does not have explicit United
Nations approval. And while it is motivated by humanitarian
concerns, it is a direct, uninvited intervention in the affairs of
a sovereign nation _ Yugoslavia _ a step the US and its allies have
been loathe to take until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has phenomenally broad implications,'' said Senator
Joseph R. Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. ``But if NATO does not stand for putting an
end to violence and `ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo, then what in the
hell do we stand for?''
</P>
<P>
   Most strategic analysts in the United States and Europe agree
that the US and its allies were right to try to stop the
persecution of Kosovo Albanians by the forces of Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic. Where they differ is on whether NATO should
have been the vehicle, and bombing the means.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has expressed no doubts. In
Yugoslavia, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in a recent
speech, ``NATO is responding to a real post-Cold War threat to its
interests and values.''
</P>
<P>
   Interests and values, however, are not the same as security,
which is what NATO was narrowly formed to defend when allied
nations signed the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington on April 4,
1949 _ a few short months after the Berlin airlift and as eastern
European nations were falling under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NATO was stretching its charter even before the Soviet
Union collapsed and the Cold War ended. In the Gulf War, for
instance, Galvin led the alliance's efforts, and he now calls the
conflict an out-of-area NATO action disguised as a multinational
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you did not mention that `NATO forces' were
involved _ it had to be `the forces of NATO nations' _ it was OK,''
said Galvin. ``But it was basically a NATO operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even France, which was not then a member of NATO's military
command, joined the effort, allowing US B-52s to operate from
French bases. The reason NATO acted was not that the territory of a
member nation was in jeopardy, but because the West's oil supplies
were threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Like all NATO operations, Desert Storm was carried largely by
the US, which enjoys overwhelming military superiority in the
alliance and the world. But if NATO is to survive, says Britain's
defense secretary, George Robertson, its European members will have
to pick up more of the burden from the US. This will require
modernization of European armies and navies and the acquisition of
the sort of airlift capability that the US alone now has. Airlift
is what will allow NATO forces to move into areas beyond its
traditional European neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But where to draw the line? Biden, for instance, opposes using
NATO to intervene in ethnic wars in Africa or Asia, for fear of
getting stretched too thin. Like many members of the foreign-policy
establishment, he would give that job to various ``coalitions of
the willing'' depending on the nature of a crisis and the part of
the world in which it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO expands, it will be under ever more strain in deciding
where and when to act militarily. Even before it grew from 16 to 19
members, its decision-making was hampered by a need for the North
Atlantic Council, the alliance's governing body, to make unanimous
decisions. Unanimity will become ever more difficult to achieve,
said Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving such questions will be essential and will be part of
the Washington summit's business this weekend. But, Goodpaster
said, in all the brainstorming it is important to remember that
NATO was successful in its original mission. There was no war with
the USSR _ not that the world didn't come close during the Cuban
missile crisis and other moments over the past half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so tense back then that the danger was that somebody in
our army or theirs would think he had to do something,'' said
Goodpaster, recalling the bristling forces facing off in Europe
during the Cold War. ``That would have set everything loose.''

LOGROLLING: A SIGN OF THE TIMES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend writes: ``You might be interested to learn that The New
York Times Sunday book review killed a review of Natalie Angier's
book, `Woman: An Intimate Geography,' written by Helena Cronin,
because the editors considered it `too negative.' Cronin, a
well-known evolutionary biologist, found the author's grip of the
facts shaky and her position unsupported. Angier, as you may know,
is a star reporter at the Times. `Woman' was reviewed in the daily
New York Times by Marilyn Yalom, author of `A History of the
Breast,' a book Angier herself reviewed glowingly in a 1997 Times
Sunday book review.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that we didn't run Cronin's review,'' Sunday book
editor Chip McGrath told me, ``although `too negative' would be her
words, not mine. I didn't like the tone of the review _ I thought
it was too snarky, which is partly the difference between British
reviewing (Cronin teaches at the London School of Economics) and
American reviewing. And I thought the review failed to address the
whole range of the book. This happens.'' McGrath knows full well
that he will be accused of rolling over for a colleague, which he
denies. ``There's no tradition here of writing positive reviews of
books by Times authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin, whose study ``The Ant and the Peacock'' was selected as
one of the nine best books of 1992 by the Times editors, doesn't
want to discuss the dust-up. But she's happy to talk about Angier's
book, published by Houghton Mifflin. ``It's totally idiotic,'' she
says. ``She uses phrases like `the vagina as a model for the
universe itself.' Then she has these menstrual epiphanies you find
in modern feminist literature _ you know, how we must all dance in
a circle around a Tampax. She was so wrong-headed in the areas
where I knew the science that, even if there were areas where she
might have been correct, I could no longer trust her.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the daily review, here is Stanford professor Yalom
swooning over ``Woman'': ``. . . dazzling . . . Its upbeat message
_ that women are far stronger, more sexual, aggressive and adaptive
than usually given credit for _ is supported by rigorous scientific
underpinnings.'' In 1997, Angier called Yalom's breast work ``a
fascinating cultural, political and artistic history of our most
symbolically freighted body part . . . Yalom shows how the breast
dialectic has been in full swing for centuries now,'' etc. etc.

<P>
   A certain mystery attends the future of Edmund Morris's ``Dutch:
A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' to be published this fall by Random
House. Fourteen years in the making, the book was yanked from
Random's fall list last year, so that the perfectionist Morris
could put finishing touches on the work.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, author of a widely hailed, two-volume biography of
Theodore Roosevelt, is a terrific writer. But some unsettling
question marks are hanging over the Reagan book. A year and a half
ago, Random House editor Robert Loomis told C-Span that Morris has
``a new idea about how to write this book _ which I don't want to
talk about right now _ which is controversial, but it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he spent a great deal of time with Reagan and
members of his family, the Kenya-born Morris has complained that he
had difficulty fathoming the former president's personality. So, to
tell ``Dutch,'' he assumes the guise of a fictional narrator, one
of the 70-odd people Reagan saved as a young lifeguard. Morris's
fans say the unusual device works well. But even they question
whether the unorthodox narrative will translate into the
mass-market success Random is hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a subject Random House wants to discuss. The fate of
the all-important first serial rights _ the right to print an
excerpt from the forthcoming book _ is likewise not entirely clear.
A previously reported commitment from Newsweek turns out to have
been a verbal agreement between the magazine's late editor, Maynard
Parker, and a deceased Random House executive. No contract has been
signed. A Newsweek spokesman says the magazine still plans to
publish a portion of the Morris book. That will have to appear
after a ``60 Minutes'' feature on Morris and Reagan, which has yet
to be scheduled.

`RELAX. . .' IT'S ABOUT FRIENDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RELAX. . .IT`S JUST SEX 
Written and directed by: P.J. Castellaneta 
Starring: Mitchell Anderson, Jennifer Tilly, T.C. Carson, Lori
Petty, Cynda Williams, Eddie Garcia 
Running time; 106 minutes 
Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Relax. . .It's Just Sex'' is a big, bouncing puppy of a movie,
an energetic crowd-pleaser so long as the crowd includes the more
liberal-minded among us. Set in present-day Los Angeles, it's an
often-funny, sexually frank look at the pursuit of love and
happiness among a racially and sexually inclusive group of friends.
Though the film gets a little light-headed at times atop its
soapbox, there are some whipsmart observations about modern
romance, sexual identity and, most of all, friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Vincey (Mitchell Anderson) is a playwright who just can't write
a happy ending for his own love life. He's had a series of
boyfriends and bedmates, but no one he's ever been able to call Mr.
Right. He laments to his galpal, Tara (Jennifer Tilly, whose usual
over-the-top style actually works here) that he's ready to fall in
love with a great guy, ``move in together, get a dog, pick out
china patterns, get Lakers' season tickets, and live happily ever
after.'` But Tara has her doubts. She describes Vincey as a
``Christmas Eve-type person. You can never enjoy the presents once
they're open; as soon as you realize there's a living, breathing
person behind the image, you lose interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of all this, Tara's trying to conceive a child
with her boyfriend Gus (Timothy Paul Perez), who's beginning to see
domestic life as an unwieldy ball-and-chain. Then there's Gus's
brother Javi (Eddie Garcia), recently diagnosed as HIV-positive,
who begins a relationship with Buzz (T.C. Carson), an artist with
outspoken views on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Those are only half of the main characters. There's Sarina
(Cynda Williams) and Megan (Serena Scott Thomas), a lesbian couple,
whose nine-year relationship implodes when Megan takes up with a
man, who also happens to be Sarina's second cousin, Jered (Billy
Wirth). Sarina, meanwhile, seeks solace in the arms of her friend,
Robin (Lori Petty), who's had a crush on her for years. Then
there's Dwight (Gibbs Toldsdorf) and Diego (Chris Cleveland), a
too-beautiful, too-happy couple both admired and envied by their
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because writer-director P.J. Castellaneta had so many
witty things to say _ there's an great zinger comparing delayed
sexual gratification to Andrew Lloyd Webber shows _ he had to
create enough characters for all those snappy lines. Still, since
most of the characters are so deftly drawn, it's hard to imagine
who Castellaneta might have cut. Even the smaller roles are
memorable, such as Susan Tyrell as Megan's hilariously irate
mother, who simply can't abide her lesbian daughter dating a man.
(``What are we going to say to our friends in PFLAG?'' she seethes,
referring to the support organization, Parents and Friends of
Lesbians and Gays.)
</P>
<P>
   Castellaneta also kitchen-sinks his script, and the film is
longer than it needs to be. There's an awful lot to keep track of
here, including a violent gay bashing which takes a shocking,
unexpected turn. That entire scene is so horrific, it seems out of
place with the film's overall lighter tone. It's as though
Castellaneta wanted something heavy to anchor his frothy film, but
it almost sinks it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's awfully hard to quibble with a film with so many
laugh-out-loud moments, and one which isn't afraid to celebrate
friendships between diverse people. All that, and Castellaneta
winningly presents characters rarely seen on screen _ lipstick
lesbians without ice picks, gay men who love sports, black lesbians
and gays beyond tokenism, and what certainly must be a film first _
born-again Chrsitan gym queens.

SPADE LOST WITHOUT FARLEY IN `LOST &AMP; FOUND' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
LOST &AMP; FOUND 
Directed by: Jeff Pollack 
Screenplay by: J.B. Cook, Marc Meeks, David Spade 
Starring: David Spade, Sophie Marceau, Patrick Bruel, Artie Lange,
Mitchell Whitfield, Martin Sheen 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (crude and sex-related humor, brief nudity and
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe David Spade can carry a movie without the late Chris
Farley, but you can't prove it by ``Lost &AMP; Found.'' It's a lame
romantic comedy that makes the mistake of inviting comparisons to
``There's Something About Mary.'' Like that film, it puts a dog
through a lot of mayhem and lumbers through a retirement community
full of unfunny senior-citizen sight gags. Rich, but only in dog
droppings, it has the crudeness of last summer's gross-out hit, but
not nearly the laughs or the offsetting sweetness of Cameron Diaz.
In her first Hollywood comedy, French actress Sophie Marceau is
stuck with a lot of unbecoming pouting as a Frenchwoman in LA,
Lila, who not only can't find a job as a cellist, but can't find
her little terrier either.
</P>
<P>
   The reason she can't find the dog is that Spade's restaurateur,
Dylan, has it hidden in his apartment. He dognapped it, and
intended to return it, pretending he had found it. The idea was to
score points with his pretty neighbor. But while in his apartment,
the dog swallows an expensive anniversary ring Dylan's partner has
given him to hold. So Dylan, a glib but increasingly nervous
schemer, must keep the dog until it passes the ring. That's about
it as far as story, except that Lila's full-of-himself ex-fiance
shows up from Paris to provide romantic competition and shoot down
the sincere but inept wooer Dylan. You will be thinking that there
isn't enough here for a single episode of Spade's TV series, ``Just
Shoot Me,'' much less for a full-length movie. You will be right.
</P>
<P>
   Spade's needling wiseguy persona is softened in a few scenes
when he encourages Marceau's jangly but professionally unassertive
cellist. He's funnier in the smart-mouth stuff on which his
reputation rests, infrequent as the laughs are here. The others
labor valiantly, but the vapid material defeats them. Mitchell
Whitfield is the most sympathetic character as the partner who
stays in the restaurant actually doing all the work, and roly-poly
Artie Lange is the performer with whom one sympathizes the most.
Obviously cast to fill the Farley void, he's sweet where Farley was
wild, even in the gross-out scenes to which he is mostly relegated
as they flit from a strip poker game with senior citizens to a room
filled with all the dog excrement you could hope for. ``Lost &AMP;
Found'' is more lost than found.

WINSLET'S WINSOME WAYS REIGN IN `KINKY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HIDEOUS KINKY 
Directed by: Gillies MacKinnon 
Screenplay by: Billy MacKinnon (novel: Esther Freud) 
Starring: Kate Winslet, Bella Riza, Carrie Mullan, Said Taghmaoui 
Running time: 99 minutes 
Rated: R (some sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hideous Kinky'' is neither hideous nor kinky. It's a modest
but unexpectedly affecting autobiography of a daughter recalling
her English hippie mother's spiritual quest in Morocco and Algeria
in 1972 with her and her sister in tow. The film could easily have
degenerated into a caricature of hippies or a cruel shattering of a
naive young woman's illusions. The reason it gets to us is that it
was made with affection and, more important, respect for the
sincerity of the young mother's motives and the gentleness and
generosity she found in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The film, in short, is a stereotype-free and winningly generous
evocation of a sympathetic screenful of characters. It's a
villain-free film, too. The closest it comes to one is the girls'
absent poet father, who dumped their mother in London, where he has
remained with a new woman and new children. He takes an
out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach, to judge by the infrequency and
meagerness of the checks he mails to Marrakech. While the film
empathizes with Kate Winslet's young mother, Julia, tired of gray,
dreary England and searching for something better, it's open-eyed,
as she is not, about what's happening to them.
</P>
<P>
   It pulls no punches about the fact that the door to
soul-expanding adventures has been pretty much slammed shut by
their poverty. The only skill they possess is making cloth dolls.
But the dolls don't fetch much in the bustling street market, and
it's corrosive waiting around for the irregular checks to arrive.
Things finally take an upturn when Julia is attracted to a hunky
street acrobat, Said Taghmaoui's Bilal. He's sweet and sexy and
he's more than willing to serve as the surrogate father the girls
need. But Bella Riza's elder 8-year-old daughter, Bea, sees a few
drawbacks that her more naive mother does not.
</P>
<P>
   When they journey back to Bilal's village, Bea sees, as her
mother does not, that Bilal already has a wife there. She has
already picked up on the fact that he's a shady character known to
the police. When he takes off and Julia decides to embrace the life
of a Sufi mystic in Algeria, Bea voices a desire to be left behind
in the care of a European couple to attend school and obtain the
structure and normality she craves. The younger sister, Carrie
Mullan's 6-year-old Lucy, doesn't care what happens as long as
she's with her mom. But the spiritual life proves more problematic
than Julia anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   So is the reunion with Bea. The characterizations are on the
superficial side, but Winslet is appealing as a woman whose heart
is in the right place even if she hasn't thought things through.
Taghmaoui brings both softness and dazzle to the role of the warm
but wayward acrobat who's shocked to learn that a European can be
poor. Riza and Mullan are perfect as the girls whose word games
give the film its title. Certainly, it serves up Morocco in a heady
swirl of images that show the appeal of the place for Westerners in
the '60s and '70s. It doesn't even make fun of its resident hippies
as the soundtrack gracefully finds room amid its Sufi trance music
and North African drumming for Jefferson Airplane.

DISAPPOINTING `PUSHING TIN' IS PLANE SPEAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
PUSHING TIN 
Directed by: Mike Newell 
Screenplay by: Glen and Les Charles 
Starring: John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett, Angelina
Jolie, Jake Weber, Vicki Lewis, Kurt Fuller, Matt Ross 
Playing at: Copley Place; suburbs 
Running time: 123 minutes 
Rated: R (language and a scene of sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Newell's ``Pushing Tin'' charts some slightly new territory
in the movies-about-alpha-males sweepstakes. And it's got some
flavorful acting. But it doesn't take us all the way into the
high-pressure world of metropolitan New York air-traffic
controllers as strongly or as affectingly as Newell's ``Donnie
Brasco'' took us into the trenches with low-level Mafia soldiers.
Closer in spirit to one of Newell's earlier hits, it could be
thought of as two weddings and what everyone hopes won't be
hundreds of funerals as the mostly male controllers reach for the
caffeine and sort out the moving blips made by the incoming planes
on the control center's busy radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not without its share of midair near misses,
``Pushing Tin'' (the controllers' way of referring to their
stressful central traffic management of La Guardia, Kennedy, and
Newark airports) wisely avoids the kind of melodramatic strokes
that made all those '70s disaster movies so memorably bad. It
spends most of its time focusing on the domestic embroilments of
two rival controllers, both good at their jobs, but differing
widely in style: John Cusack's hyper Nick Falzone and Billy Bob
Thornton's challenging newcomer, a half-Irish, half-Choctaw Indian
named Russell, whose laid-back cool threatens Nick. In no time,
they're all but pawing the ground and lowering their heads to lock
horns. Or at least Nick is.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what galls Nick is Russell's utter absence of even the
smallest hint of trying too hard. In focusing on their rivalry, or
at least the rivalry that Nick instigates, the film sacrifices what
could have been a more interestingly textured cross section of a
microcosm we don't often see and, especially if one is a frequent
flyer, probably don't want to. But the film pretty much comes down
to a Nick-Russell square-off that crosses the competitive line to
include each going after the other's wife. Cusack brings his usual
naive motormouthing to his pursuit of Russell's lonely and
intoxicated young spouse, played with lots of turquoise-and-silver
jewelry and even more sultriness by Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's Russell retaliates by putting a few moves on Nick's
wife, played in a realistic style poles apart from her young Queen
Elizabeth by the increasingly impressive and as of now amazingly
versatile Australian actress Cate Blanchett. On this occasion she
will absolutely convince you she's from Queens. She and Thornton,
as a loner whose self-containment and slow, deliberate tempo
advertise that he's not a native New Yorker, deliver the most
impressive acting chops here. But Cusack and Jolie are easy to
take. The film's shortfall hasn't to do with the acting, but with
the script's inability to successfully dramatize the fact-based
magazine article on which the film is based. It's amusing to think
of a roomful of understandably nervous people whose idea of a great
day on the job consists of boredom. But ``Pushing Tin'' runs out of
fuel, dramatically speaking, and can't bring them in for the
landing they need.

MESSINA WINS ACT OF THE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Aerosmith won a Grammy and performed on the Oscars
this year, but were humbled at the Kahlua Boston Music Awards
Thursday. They won a video award and singer Steven Tyler got his
obligatory nod for best male rock vocalist, but that was it.
Instead, the big winner was country singer Jo Dee Messina, who
waltzed off with three trophies, including the top prize for act of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a fan of upsets, you've just witnessed one of the
biggest in the history of these awards. A country singer had never
even been nominated for act of the year, yet Jo Dee Messina _ the
little engine that could from rural Holliston _ blew past
Aerosmith, as well as Paula Cole, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and
Rob Zombie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' admitted Candace Avery, director of the awards,
which took place at the sold-out Orpheum Theatre and featured
performances by Messina (a beautiful piano ballad, ``Even God Gets
the Blues,'' dedicated to the bereaved families in Littleton,
Colo.), Jonatha Brooke, Melissa Ferrick, Godsmack, Joey McIntyre,
Jude, Susan Tedeschi, Big Wreck, Martin Sexton, and Buffalo Tom
(playing as a trio because singer Bill Janovitz was off with his
wife, who was having a baby).
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, some people may question Messina's many wins _ after
all, these awards have always had a rock/pop slant in past years
(the winners are chosen by half industry vote, half public vote,
with ballots from Strawberries and the Boston Herald) _ but
Messina, for her part, was a gracious winner. And let's not forget
she has become the first country female to ever have three,
multiple-week, No. 1 country hits in a row. That's prime national
news, but to think she's become so big in country-deprived Boston
is a real shock. She's never headlined her own show here, though
she's on the George Strait stadium bill coming to Foxboro Stadium
next month and has twice been an opening act at the Tweeter Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past year has been phenomenal for me,'' Messina told the
crowd, which gave her a warm ovation. ``The year before was rough,
but radio . . . and mostly the fans have pulled me out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   New blood _ and Messina is still young enough to qualify _ was
rewarded handsomely. The rising star award went to the Push Stars,
a bright, Triple-A radio act that has a new album coming on Capitol
Records May 18. Fast-climbing hard-rockers Godsmack won debut album
of the year (for ``Godsmack''). Swiss transplants My Favorite
Relative won outstanding new rock band. Alt-poppers the Gravel Pit
won best club band. Susan Tedeschi was a well-deserved choice for
outstanding blues act. And lovably raucous Big D &AMP; the Kids Table
won top ska act and promptly gang-tackled each other on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In general, these were the most professional local awards in
some time (MC Julie Barr kept things moving), right down to the
staging (a pop-art depiction of Y2K with tangled wires dangling
from a computer) and the overall sense of crowd harmony. And, yes,
a former New Kid won again _ Joey McIntyre for single of the year
(``Stay the Same''). He, too, was warmly received, compared to
years ago when the New Kids drew boos in a more divisive, more
strained era.

CRANBERRIES: HANDLING THE FRUITS OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cranberries are back on the road, which is a minor miracle.
The band had sold 23 million albums and become the top Irish group
since U2 before crashing and burning on tour three years ago.
Singer Dolores O'Riordan _ exhausted from a diet she describes as
coffee, cigarettes, lots of wine, little food, and no sleep _ was
too weak to go on. She dropped off the tour, throwing the band's
future into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the end of the line, but an inspiring rebirth has
occurred. The Cranberries have a vital new album, ``Bury the
Hatchet,'' due Tuesday, followed by a theater tour hitting the
Orpheum in Boston for a sold-out show May 3, then a likely shed
tour later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   As for O'Riordan, she has a child (Taylor, age 1), a new regimen
(yoga), and a new optimism that is the opposite of the depression
that plagued her on the last tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't slept for about three months,'' O'Riordan recalls of
that time. ``And that started to affect me. I was having shakes and
panic attacks during the day. Then I was having a few drinks to try
to go to sleep, because I didn't want to start taking sleeping
pills. And I was smoking cigarettes like a lunatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, we never really took a career break for seven
years. I joined the Cranberries when I was 18,'' says the
pixie-like powerful-voiced, singer, who is now 27. ``I lived in
buses. I didn't really have anything else. I didn't feel like a
female and I ended up really kind of isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks you're so happy and so wealthy and such a big
star, but you're really kind of lonely and don't know how to stop
it,'' she says of that grind. ``It was a very interesting learning
experience. I went very close to the edge, but it's nice to have
been strong enough to get through it. I'm lucky I had family, a
good husband, and my mom. People like that help balance you. When
you're feeling down and bad, it's the people that love you who kind
of sort your head out for you.''
</P>
<P>
   So much has happened to the Cranberries in these last three
years. Guitarist Mike Hogan and drummer Fergal Lawler have gotten
married. But O'Riordan has changed her life the most. She quit
cigarettes when she became pregnant and she's exchanged many nights
of wine-drinking for early-to-bed evenings that allow her to get up
and watch ``Sesame Street'' with Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Bird rules in our house,'' says O'Riordan, who is married
to Canadian tour manager Don Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Giving birth _ and she hopes to have another child some day _
provided O'Riordan with a another excuse to cleanse her lifestyle.
``I breast fed for three months and it was just all very good. It
really makes you realize how important and precious the body is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cranberries didn't see much of each other in that first year
off the road, though. ``I missed the boys when I was pregnant,''
says O'Riordan. But then the group met and discovered that its
chemistry was still intact. The band came up with new music
(principally written by guitarist Noel Hogan, brother of Michael),
then O'Riordan added the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the lyrics are sunnier than the band's last album,
the often lugubrious ``To the Faithful Departed.'' That disc
contained the worldwide antiwar hit, ``Zombie,'' but it also turned
off some fans who preferred the group's earlier and breezier
acoustic-pop, such as its first hit ``Linger.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album addresses a few serious social issues (``Fee Fi
Fo'' is about child abuse), but for the most part has an upbeat
flavor harking back to the group's sound when it was first
discovered in the town of Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's more like when we started,'' O'Riordan says. ``We're
also more relaxed going onstage and having a laugh and just
enjoying it all. You know, there's no point in getting too worried
about things, because life is too short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more fun now, really. And I don't plan to get into
the negative side of life anymore,'' she adds. ``I tend to kind of
shy away from it, because having been there, I've been sucked into
that kind of mentality, that down-and-out thing. It's something I
try to stay away from a lot now. I try to think about optimism. I
try to look at the beautiful things in life.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also trying to keep her distance from the negative side of
the media, especially from the tabloid press that dogged her when
the Cranberries became stars. The ugliest moment occurred when,
after she returned to Ireland following the last tour, her
grandmother died and O'Riordan went to the morgue to identify the
body. ``Some (expletive) journalist came and took a picture of me
there, and the next day it was on the front cover of a tabloid. It
was horrible. I was pregnant and my granny had just died. I was
sick and I said to my husband, `Let's get out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband went to live temporarily in Toronto, which
helped calm her nerves. ``I just stayed there a while until the
Cranberries became a historical event, really. When it came to the
media, they just totally forgot about us, and it was brilliant. It
was suddenly the Spice Girls, and it was Oasis, and it was All
Saints, and all these things were coming in and we weren't in the
papers anymore. It was like, `Yes! They're leaving me alone at
last.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We just sort of disappeared and it was perfect, the way we
wanted it,'' says O'Riordan. ``Then after another year, I had my
baby, and he was growing up, then you start to think about writing
songs again. It's just like when the band began. Nobody knows us,
nobody cares, and you're just writing songs for the laughs. This
(new) album is almost like a first album in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year will mark the band's 10th year (``we're fossils now,''
she says), but O'Riordan is going into the next millennium with her
eyes wide open. She's cut her coffee intake to two cups only in the
morning, while her band has also picked up the health habit. The
group has cut back its nearly daily schedule of performing as a
means to stay sane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we do a gig and then we take a day off,'' she says. ``It's
just so much more fun than before when we used to just gig, gig,
gig. We didn't really have a life, so we used to get kind of sick
of it. But now it's really nice, because you enjoy the gigs a lot
more.''

GIVING CREDIT TO THE INDEBTED AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
FINANCING THE AMERICAN DREAM 
A Cultural History of Consumer Credit 
By Lendol Calder 
Princeton University Press, 377 pp., illustrated, $29.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lendol Calder has taken on quite a challenge: to find nice
things to say about consumer credit. From the New Testament (Owe no
man anything) to Shakespeare (Neither a borrower nor a lender be),
debt has acquired a rotten reputation. Borrowing money has been
blamed for causing economic misery, for forcing people to live
beyond their means and for destroying the long-held American
virtues of thrift and frugality.
</P>
<P>
   Calder has a simple answer for the critics of credit: You don't
know what you're talking about. In ``Financing the American
Dream,'' a surprisingly lively book about a potentially dreary
subject, Calder argues that debt is as American as apple pie and
that consumer borrowing has been an important engine of economic
growth. And he doesn't stop there. Rather than encouraging
profligate behavior, writes Calder, the installment borrowing we
use to buy cars and houses forces us ``to commit to regimens of
disciplined financial management.'' If we don't, the bank can take
away our cars and houses.
</P>
<P>
   Calder is at his best in exploding what he calls the myth of
lost economic virtue. You've heard the myth articulated by your
parents. ``You kids are in debt up to your ears. Back in our day if
we wanted something we saved up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so. The author cites reliable sources that put average debt
per household in America at $300 in 1858 and $880 by 1890. ``It is
often forgotten, but from Plymouth Rock to the present, American
dreams have usually required a lien on the future,'' says Calder.
More interesting still, the book points out that in every era,
people have bemoaned the rise in borrowing. In 1923, the New York
Times wrote that ``in other simpler days debt was a thing dreaded
as the worst of ogres.'' In 1956 journalist William Whyte said that
``thrift is now un-American.'' Apparently the age of economic
virtue is always 20 years before you showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer credit took a great leap forward with the rise of
installment borrowing. The sellers of farm equipment pioneered the
technique in the 19th century. Eventually the practice was taken up
by retailers of furniture, pianos, and sewing machines.
Installment's appeal was obvious. By letting consumers pay for
merchandise over time, borrowing made goods affordable that
otherwise would have been too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was an alternative. People could have saved up to buy
things. That's what Henry Ford thought they should do. The auto
magnate liked credit about as much as he liked Jews and blacks. In
the 1920s, when rival General Motors adopted installment borrowing,
Ford had a different idea. He created something like a Christmas
club. Potential buyers set up a schedule of payments and deposited
money each week with Ford dealers. When they had saved enough to
buy a car, the automobile was theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was a colossal failure. Consumers wanted their cars
first and payments later, not the other way around. Borrowing made
sense to Americans, even if it forced them to work ever harder to
keep up with the payments.
</P>
<P>
   In every era there has been a disconnect between the rhetoric
and reality of credit. Everyone from preachers to novelists has
denounced credit as the tool of the devil. In this century, credit
expansion has also been blamed on women, big spenders who allegedly
don't know how to control their impulses to buy. Yet in every era,
credit expands and the economy manages to grow. In the one period
when the economy shrank, the Great Depression, people borrowed less
rather than go deeper into debt. To Calder, that experience proved
that consumers were smarter than their critics appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financing the American Dream'' is not a page-turner. In spots,
Calder tells you more about the history of credit than you'd
probably care to know. But for a professor _ he teaches history at
Augustana College in Illinois _ Calder writes forcefully and
clearly. Occasionally he can be downright lyrical, with lines like,
``A river of red ink runs through American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Calder's story leaves off with the Depression. He doesn't tackle
credit cards or any of the modern techniques for lending money to
poor people. Still it isn't hard to imagine what he would say about
them. Credit will never be popular, Calder believes, but it will
always be an essential part of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   You can also bet a borrowed dollar that some time in the future,
our free-spending kids, who don't know the true value of money,
will one day scold their children for spending money like drunken
sailors and relying too heavily on debt.

<P>
   KANI SHAITAN REFUGEE CAMP, Iraqi Kurdistan _ They don't have
electricity or television in this camp between grassy mountains, so
they can't follow events in Kosovo. But, the Kurdish refugees
huddled around these tents and mud outhouses know all about death
and displacement -- at the hands of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, Kurds are forced from their homes in Iraq and
trucked to this semi-autonomous area in northernmost Iraq. About
the size of Austria, it is protected now by U.S. air cover and has
been run for the last seven years by a provisional Kurdish
government.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that, since 1991, more than 150,000
Kurds have been forced to the Kurdish zone from homes in other
parts of Iraq. In this tent village of 103 families and the
hallways of the grimy, fetid and crumbling hotel where many others
end up for years, refugees tell of being jailed until they agree to
leave the country, then having an hour to pack and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish leaders see an almost eerie similarity between their
peoples' plight and events in Kosovo. They say their current
``safe-haven'' in northern Iraq could provide a model for a
solution in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parallels are quite striking,'' said Shafiq Qazzaz(CQ), a
Kurdish cabinet minister in Iraqi Kurdistan. ``I have a satellite
television. I sit there and watch. It is mesmerizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish leaders favor the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia's Serb
military forces -- just as fervently as Iraqi leaders have sided
with the Yugoslavian Serbs -- and say the world should not be cowed
by the scenes of refugees in flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end result is what's important,'' said Sami Abdel Rahman,
a top leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party in an interview this
month with Cox Newspapers. He expects the refugees to be returned
to Kosovo in a safe-haven arrangement similar to Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was NATO -- the U.S. and Britain -- that saved us,'' Rahman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Kosovars, Kurds throughout the region have sought their
independence for decades. In southeastern Turkey, a civil war has
killed 35,000 Turks and Kurds since 1984 with little intervention
from the West.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, drawn by Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, the West has
intervened. But, before it did, the Kurds already faced brutality
and persecution that continues, though to a lesser extent, today.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1970s, Hussein has destroyed more than 4,000
Kurdish villages. In the late 1980s, Iraq's campaign of ``Anfal,''
or ``Plunder,'' killed tens of thousands of Kurds. When Kurds and
Iranian troops briefly took over the Iraqi town of Halabja, Iraq
used nerve gas to kill more than 5,000 civilians in one horrible
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Kurds answered the call of
then-U.S. President George Bush to rise against Hussein. But his
army, thought to be reeling from its defeat in Kuwait, mustered an
overwhelming counter-attack that the U.S. did little to impede.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown thousands of Kurds died and an estimated 1 million fled
to the neighboring mountains near Turkey and Iran. The pathetic
scenes of refugees streaming for cover in the rugged, frigid
landscape, prompted the United States and Britain to use their air
power and establish the so-called ``safe-haven'' now in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi representatives deny they mistreat the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish Najdid Abdel Majid, member of a council of Kurds in
Baghdad who support Hussein's regime, calls the notion of chemical
attacks, though widely confirmed, ``propaganda.'' He notes that
more than a million Kurds live in Iraqi controlled-areas and they
own hotels, stores and factories. He says only criminals are forced
from their lands.
</P>
<P>
   But those in strategic and oil-rich Kirkuk, just outside the
autonomous area, still face what Amnesty International calls Iraq's
``Arabization'' of the important city.
</P>
<P>
   Their first stop is often this refugee camp Kani Shaitan, or
``Devil's Spring, ``a refugee camp near the Kurdish city of
Suleimaniyah in northeastern Iraq. Many of the several hundred
people there have been there more than a year and say they were
forced to leave Kirkuk after refusing to change their official
identity from Kurdish to Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, one mother was trying to get her family of six
set up in the small tent that was now their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army came to our house. My husband was away, so they held
me in jail (two days) until my husband came back,'' recounts Saydan
Ali, 27. Then, they were given an hour to pack, and dropped off at
the border of the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The children always ask why we left the house and always ask
about the bathroom. In Kirkuk, we had a good bathroom, here we
can't even wash,'' said Ali, gesturing to an open latrine. ``I tell
them this is our fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish minister Qazzaz said it is the kind of treatment the
world will no longer ignore, whether it occurs in Iraq or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have that kind of treatment toward people, then the
international community has an obligation to intervene,'' he said.

security cameras may provide crucial evidence of a conspiracy.
Time-lapse security cameras mounted throughout the school do not
run continuously but do record about a week at a time. Authorities
had not yet reviewed the tapes and did not know if the cameras were
running during the shooting. Also today, President Clinton

funerals, medical expenses, lost wages and counseling. (MWilliams,

 FOR RELEASE: APRIL 25 or thereafter  
 By BLAINE HARDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Until Milo Djukanovic's new best friends in the United States
and Western Europe began to drop bombs on Montenegro in late March,
life had been going along swimmingly for the handsome young
president of this Yugoslav republic.
 &HT;    Just 37 years old, built like an NFL linebacker, packaged in
dark Italian suits, married to an attractive blonde and hailed by
voters as Milo the Blade, Djukanovic (djew-KAHN-oh-vich) has been
playing a deliciously wicked game of chicken with the Serbian
dictator Slobodan Milosevic.
 &HT;    Before bombs and cruise missiles began to rain on Yugoslavia,
the Montenegrin president even seemed to be winning.
 &HT;    For the first time since 1918, when Serbia annexed this
mountainous, Connecticut-size republic on the Adriatic Sea and
turned it into a perennial Yugoslav little brother, Montenegro was
moving toward an independent and democratic future linked to the
economies of Western Europe and the United States.
 &HT;    Milosevic, so tactically brilliant in using ethnic hate to
consolidate power, wasn't able to get a grip on the republic's
650,000 residents, even though he ruled 15 times as many people and
more than six times as much land and commanded the formidable
Yugoslav army.
 &HT;    The Montenegrin president has challenged Milosevic with an
impudent Balkan mix of populism, police muscle, cigarette smuggling
and wisecracks about Milosevic's wife. Instead of howling about
historical wrongs, whipping up nationalistic paranoia and ordering
ethnic cleansing, Milo the Blade has preached free-market
prosperity and eased ethnic tensions by securing the civil rights
of his republic's Muslim and Albanian minorities.
 &HT;    Although Djukanovic tested and taunted Milosevic, he took care
never to say or do anything anti-Serb. He never lost sight of who
had the tanks and stopped short of a direct confrontation that
could bring out the Yugoslav army.
 &HT;    Montenegro and Serbia are all that's left of the six republics
that once made up Yugoslavia. Under the federal Constitution, they
are supposedly equal, but larger Serbia has always dominated.
 &HT;    And Djukanovic has remained immune to Tin Pot Leader Syndrome, a
dizzying and endemic Balkan malady that infected his next-door
neighbor, Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, whose
nationalist swagger terrified the Serb minority and helped provoke
a war with Serbia.
 &HT;    Djukanovic is no choirboy. He started out in public life 10
years ago as a Communist enforcer for Milosevic. As one of the Serb
leader's handpicked henchmen in Montenegro, he developed a
state-sponsored air-and-sea smuggling operation that,
paradoxically, gave him the financial resources to slip free of
Milosevic's iron grip and evolve into a Balkan rarity _ a democrat.
 &HT;    The U.S. State Department says it believes Djukanovic's
conversion is real, and so do the handful of long-suffering
human-rights activists who have watched him rise to power. His
bully-boy past is unsavory, even criminal, they say, but he came of
age in a very bad Balkan neighborhood where smart democrats with
popular support and the guts (and police power) to stand up to
Milosevic are hard to find.
 &HT;    The region desperately needs a hero, and Djukanovic is perhaps
the one leader whom the West can rally around.
 &HT;    Yet NATO bombs have changed all that. They have belied
Djukanovic's promise to voters that a turn to the West would
produce peace and wealth. Instead, the bombs have emboldened his
enemies who, with Milosevic's conniving, have already tried to
overthrow his government by force.
 &HT;    Many Montenegrins now consider it cowardly and traitorous to
turn their backs on their embattled Serb neighbors. The bombs mean
that before this story is printed Djukanovic could be put in prison
or killed.
 &HT;    I met him in the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica late on a
night in early April. He was holed up inside the Presidency
Building, which was encircled by Special Forces police officers
wearing camouflage combat uniforms and Israeli-made body armor and
carrying Israeli-made automatic weapons.
 &HT;    After passing through the police gantlet, the metal detector and
the passport review, I was kept waiting for about half an hour in a
barren room with a single fluorescent tube that flicked on and off.
 &HT;    The president's office was nicer. The lights worked. The
curtains were heavy; the rug, plush. Out on the street, nearly all
of the police had been strikingly tall, dark and beefy. So was
Djukanovic. He was also immaculately turned out, considering the
hour and the circumstances, in a starched white shirt and dark blue
suit. His brown hair was freshly trimmed and just barely flecked
with gray.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, he spoke in the stiff bureaucratic locution of the
young Communist that he once was, larding his sentences with
references to ``interlocutors'' and ``democratic structures.'' But
after a few minutes of conversation I noticed that, unlike other
Balkan leaders, he answered questions directly, without taking off
on insufferably self-serving rants about how his people have been
wronged and misunderstood for centuries.
 &HT;    The NATO bombings, the West's campaign to force Milosevic to
halt his army's assault on ethnic Albanians in the Serb province of
Kosovo, had started 12 nights earlier. Some of the strikes have hit
Montenegro, where the Yugoslav army has outposts. Whatever effect
those bombings were having in Kosovo, they were an unqualified
disaster for the man standing in front of me.
 &HT;    Before the bombs, two elections had shown that, by a narrow
margin, Montenegrins approved of Djukanovic's shift to the West and
of his prickly criticism of Milosevic. Now, though, the president
did not bother pretending that he still had the support of his
people. The bombs have already remade politics here.
 &HT;    On the evening he received me, more than 20,000 Montenegrins had
gathered just four blocks from the president's office for a
``Muzicki Hepening'' in the city's central square. The rock
concert, the largest public gathering here in years, was organized
by the pro-Milosevic Socialist People's Party to protest the NATO
strikes.
 &HT;    The noisy crowd carried framed photographs of Milosevic and
posters that read, ``Monica Fell to Her Knees Before Clinton, But
We Won't!'' They applauded speeches that glorified the Yugoslav
army's campaign against the Kosovars. Many Montenegrins were
clamoring for the president's head.
 &HT;    ``Djukanovic is a traitor,'' said Dejan Cvijanovic, a
28-year-old computer technician. ``There are a great number of
people who voted for him who now have turned against him. I hope
there is a coup soon.'' Djukanovic had been hearing the same
belligerent stuff, he told me.
 &HT;    Hundreds of his police officers had watched the concert from the
edges of the square. He had monitored it from his office, and said
he was concerned about similar gatherings that were scheduled for
the coming week. I asked if he was afraid of Milosevic.
 &HT;    ``No,'' he said. ``But I have no illusions. As long as Slobodan
Milosevic is in the political life of Yugoslavia, he will do all he
can think of both against Montenegro and against myself.''
 &HT;    But predicting what Milosevic might or might not do has always
been a fool's game. If there were a confrontation in Montenegro,
where nearly every adult male owns a gun, it could easily escalate
into a dreadful civil war.
 &HT;    It was all so much simpler before the NATO bombs began falling,
Djukanovic kept telling me in his bunkered office. All he had to do
was outfox a dictator who, in the words of the last U.S. ambassador
to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmermann, is the ``slickest con man'' in
the Balkans.
 &HT;    The outfoxing began imperceptibly. Ten years ago, Djukanovic was
thought of _ if he was thought of at all _ as merely a young,
hard-line puppet of Milosevic. The Serb leader had plucked him from
the ranks of the League of Communists in Montenegro to help lead
something Milosevic called the ``antibureaucratic revolution.''
 &HT;    This was reform-sounding double talk for a power grab. Milosevic
pushed aside older Communists still loyal to Tito's version of
Yugoslavia, a place where Serb nationalism was crushed by the power
of the state. Djukanovic helped his Serbian mentor sweep away the
old gray cadres. In return, Milosevic crowned him in 1991 as prime
minister of Montenegro. Just 29, he was the youngest prime minister
in Europe.
 &HT;    The United Nations slapped economic sanctions on Yugoslavia in
1991 at the start of the Bosnian war. Djukanovic, an economist by
training and a pragmatist by nature, quickly figured out how to
profit from them. For a number of years, around 2 o'clock every
morning, several giant Russian-made transport planes landed at the
airport on the edge of the capital. The planes brought in American
and European cigarettes, which were trucked to the coast and
smuggled by boat to Italy.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's government imposed a ``transit fee,'' which,
according to Perovic, the foreign minister, added about $30 million
a year to the republic's coffers. That's not a lot of money by
European standards, but with an annual budget of just $270 million,
the Montenegro government was relying on smuggling for more than 10
percent of its revenue. (NATO bombing, of course, put an end to the
plane landings.)
 &HT;    Djukanovic funneled most of the money into government salaries
and pensions, which in the mid-1990s his government managed to pay
on time. At such budgetary games, he was more skilled than
Milosevic in Serbia, where pensions and salaries almost always ran
six to eight months late, despite equally rampant smuggling. While
Montenegrins widely believed that Djukanovic was creaming off some
of the profits, they didn't much care.
 &HT;    Unemployment was near 40 percent. A decade of war had ruined the
tourist industry. ``Everyone in Montenegro thought that finally
there was someone in government who knew how to create money,''
said Srdan Darmanovic, a former member of the Yugoslav Parliament
and a Montenegrin human-rights lawyer.
 &HT;    During these years, Djukanovic never said a disparaging word in
public about Milosevic, although he insisted in our interview that
he criticized him to his face in private meetings in Belgrade. Such
public loyalty, however, did not prevent members of the Milosevic
family from getting mad at Djukanovic, who was making money that he
wasn't sharing with them.
 &HT;    Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, attacked him in her weekly
newspaper column as the most notorious smuggler in Yugoslavia. It
was a bold and characteristically mendacious accusation. Her only
son, Marko, a gangster who carried a gun and routinely wrecked
expensive racing cars, ran a large cigarette, alcohol and fuel
smuggling operation in Serbia.
 &HT;    Playing to widespread resentment of Milosevic's wife, whom many
Montenegrins and Serbs regard as a low-wattage Stalinist shrew,
Djukanovic countered that she was an irrelevant woman whose
Chinese-oriented Marxist party, the Yugoslav United Left, was so
small that its entire membership could fit on a bus.
 &HT;    Djukanovic waited, however, until her husband seemed to be
losing power before announcing that he wasn't a fan of Milosevic.
In late 1996 and early 1997, when the Serbian leader was struggling
through three months of mass street demonstrations in Belgrade,
Djukanovic said that Milosevic was a politician of the past, that
he did not have a future in Yugoslavia and that Yugoslavia had no
future with him.
 &HT;    When I asked about the smuggling, Djukanovic vehemently denied
rising to power by illegality. Officials in his government, though,
openly concede that it was the only way to make ends meet under
sanctions. They said Djukanovic has tried to attract foreign
investment and legitimate business. Imitating post-Communist
leaders from Poland to Bulgaria, he has announced plans to sell off
state-owned industry. NATO bombings, of course, have put such
reforms on hold.
 &HT;    Besides building a financial power base, Djukanovic had to build
a political machine as well. He did this in a most un-Balkan way,
by advocating ethnic tolerance. The contrast with Milosevic was
nothing short of amazing.
 &HT;    As for Kosovo, Djukanovic has called Milosevic's campaign of
violent ethnic cleansing ``insane, autistic and autocratic.'' He
attributes the catastrophe there to what he has said were years of
neglect by the Serbian leader, during which he refused to negotiate
with moderate Kosovar politicians.
 &HT;    He told me that months before the NATO campaign began, he warned
Western governments that bombing would only make things far worse
for the Kosovars. He said he advised the West to support the
democratic opposition in Serbia and in Kosovo and to show some
patience.
 &HT;    Two nights after Djukanovic and I spoke, a few NATO bombs
exploded near Podgorica _ the first such attacks in Montenegro in a
week.
 &HT;    To find out why NATO was bombing there, I called Robert Gelbard,
the U.S. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, in Washington, who
was eager to explain. Gelbard said he had already been on the phone
that morning with Djukanovic, reassuring him that the bombings were
merely a response to the Second Yugoslav Army, which had fired a
land-to-air missile at NATO planes flying over Montenegro on their
way to Serbia. The strike was not part of a new offensive campaign.
 &HT;    ``From the very beginning of the air campaign, we knew _ and we
let Djukanovic know _ that there were certain minimal army targets
that we were going to have to hit in Montenegro,'' he said.
 &HT;    Gelbard then shifted conversation away from the awkward matter
of bombing his friend and talked about what the Clinton
administration was doing to help Djukanovic. It had just decided to
give the Montenegro government $10 million to help pay for
pensions, salaries and social programs. American money, via the
United Nations, was also helping to pay for the care of the
estimated 35,000 Kosovar refugees who have poured into the
republic.
 &HT;    In addition, he said, Washington had exempted Montenegro from
economic sanctions growing out of the crisis and was urging
Congress to approve large business loans for the area. And it was
training Montenegrin diplomats and granting American landing rights
to Montenegrin Airlines.
 &HT;    ``We don't support secession or independence for Montenegro,''
he said, ``but we do support what Djukanovic is doing. He has
support at the highest levels in this administration. His politics
and his economic policies are a good model for all of Yugoslavia
and a particularly good model for the opposition inside Serbia.''
But Washington, he added, had cut no deal to bail out Montenegro in
case Milosevic's loyal Yugoslav army attacks.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's game of chicken was still on.

age in a very bad Balkan neighborhood where smart democrats with
popular support and the guts (and police power) to stand up to
Milosevic are hard to find.
 &HT;    The region desperately needs a hero, and Djukanovic is perhaps
the one leader whom the West can rally around.
 &HT;    Yet NATO bombs have changed all that. They have belied
Djukanovic's promise to voters that a turn to the West would
produce peace and wealth. Instead, the bombs have emboldened his
enemies who, with Milosevic's conniving, have already tried to
overthrow his government by force.
 &HT;    Many Montenegrins now consider it cowardly and traitorous to
turn their backs on their embattled Serb neighbors. The bombs mean
that before this story is printed Djukanovic could be put in prison
or killed.
 &HT;    I met him in the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica late on a
night in early April. He was holed up inside the Presidency
Building, which was encircled by Special Forces police officers
wearing camouflage combat uniforms and Israeli-made body armor and
carrying Israeli-made automatic weapons.
 &HT;    After passing through the police gantlet, the metal detector and
the passport review, I was kept waiting for about half an hour in a
barren room with a single fluorescent tube that flicked on and off.
 &HT;    The president's office was nicer. The lights worked. The
curtains were heavy; the rug, plush. Out on the street, nearly all
of the police had been strikingly tall, dark and beefy. So was
Djukanovic. He was also immaculately turned out, considering the
hour and the circumstances, in a starched white shirt and dark blue
suit. His brown hair was freshly trimmed and just barely flecked
with gray.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, he spoke in the stiff bureaucratic locution of the
young Communist that he once was, larding his sentences with
references to ``interlocutors'' and ``democratic structures.'' But
after a few minutes of conversation I noticed that, unlike other
Balkan leaders, he answered questions directly, without taking off
on insufferably self-serving rants about how his people have been
wronged and misunderstood for centuries.
 &HT;    The NATO bombings, the West's campaign to force Milosevic to
halt his army's assault on ethnic Albanians in the Serb province of
Kosovo, had started 12 nights earlier. Some of the strikes have hit
Montenegro, where the Yugoslav army has outposts. Whatever effect
those bombings were having in Kosovo, they were an unqualified
disaster for the man standing in front of me.
 &HT;    Before the bombs, two elections had shown that, by a narrow
margin, Montenegrins approved of Djukanovic's shift to the West and
of his prickly criticism of Milosevic. Now, though, the president
did not bother pretending that he still had the support of his
people. The bombs have already remade politics here.
 &HT;    On the evening he received me, more than 20,000 Montenegrins had
gathered just four blocks from the president's office for a
``Muzicki Hepening'' in the city's central square. The rock
concert, the largest public gathering here in years, was organized
by the pro-Milosevic Socialist People's Party to protest the NATO
strikes.
 &HT;    The noisy crowd carried framed photographs of Milosevic and
posters that read, ``Monica Fell to Her Knees Before Clinton, But
We Won't!'' They applauded speeches that glorified the Yugoslav
army's campaign against the Kosovars. Many Montenegrins were
clamoring for the president's head.
 &HT;    ``Djukanovic is a traitor,'' said Dejan Cvijanovic, a
28-year-old computer technician. ``There are a great number of
people who voted for him who now have turned against him. I hope
there is a coup soon.'' Djukanovic had been hearing the same
belligerent stuff, he told me.
 &HT;    Hundreds of his police officers had watched the concert from the
edges of the square. He had monitored it from his office, and said
he was concerned about similar gatherings that were scheduled for
the coming week. I asked if he was afraid of Milosevic.
 &HT;    ``No,'' he said. ``But I have no illusions. As long as Slobodan
Milosevic is in the political life of Yugoslavia, he will do all he
can think of both against Montenegro and against myself.''
 &HT;    But predicting what Milosevic might or might not do has always
been a fool's game. If there were a confrontation in Montenegro,
where nearly every adult male owns a gun, it could easily escalate
into a dreadful civil war.
 &HT;    It was all so much simpler before the NATO bombs began falling,
Djukanovic kept telling me in his bunkered office. All he had to do
was outfox a dictator who, in the words of the last U.S. ambassador
to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmermann, is the ``slickest con man'' in
the Balkans.
 &HT;    The outfoxing began imperceptibly. Ten years ago, Djukanovic was
thought of _ if he was thought of at all _ as merely a young,
hard-line puppet of Milosevic. The Serb leader had plucked him from
the ranks of the League of Communists in Montenegro to help lead
something Milosevic called the ``antibureaucratic revolution.''
 &HT;    This was reform-sounding double talk for a power grab. Milosevic
pushed aside older Communists still loyal to Tito's version of
Yugoslavia, a place where Serb nationalism was crushed by the power
of the state. Djukanovic helped his Serbian mentor sweep away the
old gray cadres. In return, Milosevic crowned him in 1991 as prime
minister of Montenegro. Just 29, he was the youngest prime minister
in Europe.
 &HT;    The United Nations slapped economic sanctions on Yugoslavia in
1991 at the start of the Bosnian war. Djukanovic, an economist by
training and a pragmatist by nature, quickly figured out how to
profit from them. For a number of years, around 2 o'clock every
morning, several giant Russian-made transport planes landed at the
airport on the edge of the capital. The planes brought in American
and European cigarettes, which were trucked to the coast and
smuggled by boat to Italy.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's government imposed a ``transit fee,'' which,
according to Perovic, the foreign minister, added about $30 million
a year to the republic's coffers. That's not a lot of money by
European standards, but with an annual budget of just $270 million,
the Montenegro government was relying on smuggling for more than 10
percent of its revenue. (NATO bombing, of course, put an end to the
plane landings.)
 &HT;    Djukanovic funneled most of the money into government salaries
and pensions, which in the mid-1990s his government managed to pay
on time. At such budgetary games, he was more skilled than
Milosevic in Serbia, where pensions and salaries almost always ran
six to eight months late, despite equally rampant smuggling. While
Montenegrins widely believed that Djukanovic was creaming off some
of the profits, they didn't much care.
 &HT;    Unemployment was near 40 percent. A decade of war had ruined the
tourist industry. ``Everyone in Montenegro thought that finally
there was someone in government who knew how to create money,''
said Srdan Darmanovic, a former member of the Yugoslav Parliament
and a Montenegrin human-rights lawyer.
 &HT;    During these years, Djukanovic never said a disparaging word in
public about Milosevic, although he insisted in our interview that
he criticized him to his face in private meetings in Belgrade. Such
public loyalty, however, did not prevent members of the Milosevic
family from getting mad at Djukanovic, who was making money that he
wasn't sharing with them.
 &HT;    Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, attacked him in her weekly
newspaper column as the most notorious smuggler in Yugoslavia. It
was a bold and characteristically mendacious accusation. Her only
son, Marko, a gangster who carried a gun and routinely wrecked
expensive racing cars, ran a large cigarette, alcohol and fuel
smuggling operation in Serbia.
 &HT;    Playing to widespread resentment of Milosevic's wife, whom many
Montenegrins and Serbs regard as a low-wattage Stalinist shrew,
Djukanovic countered that she was an irrelevant woman whose
Chinese-oriented Marxist party, the Yugoslav United Left, was so
small that its entire membership could fit on a bus.
 &HT;    Djukanovic waited, however, until her husband seemed to be
losing power before announcing that he wasn't a fan of Milosevic.
In late 1996 and early 1997, when the Serbian leader was struggling
through three months of mass street demonstrations in Belgrade,
Djukanovic said that Milosevic was a politician of the past, that
he did not have a future in Yugoslavia and that Yugoslavia had no
future with him.
 &HT;    When I asked about the smuggling, Djukanovic vehemently denied
rising to power by illegality. Officials in his government, though,
openly concede that it was the only way to make ends meet under
sanctions. They said Djukanovic has tried to attract foreign
investment and legitimate business. Imitating post-Communist
leaders from Poland to Bulgaria, he has announced plans to sell off
state-owned industry. NATO bombings, of course, have put such
reforms on hold.
 &HT;    Besides building a financial power base, Djukanovic had to build
a political machine as well. He did this in a most un-Balkan way,
by advocating ethnic tolerance. The contrast with Milosevic was
nothing short of amazing.
 &HT;    As for Kosovo, Djukanovic has called Milosevic's campaign of
violent ethnic cleansing ``insane, autistic and autocratic.'' He
attributes the catastrophe there to what he has said were years of
neglect by the Serbian leader, during which he refused to negotiate
with moderate Kosovar politicians.
 &HT;    He told me that months before the NATO campaign began, he warned
Western governments that bombing would only make things far worse
for the Kosovars. He said he advised the West to support the
democratic opposition in Serbia and in Kosovo and to show some
patience.
 &HT;    Two nights after Djukanovic and I spoke, a few NATO bombs
exploded near Podgorica _ the first such attacks in Montenegro in a
week.
 &HT;    To find out why NATO was bombing there, I called Robert Gelbard,
the U.S. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, in Washington, who
was eager to explain. Gelbard said he had already been on the phone
that morning with Djukanovic, reassuring him that the bombings were
merely a response to the Second Yugoslav Army, which had fired a
land-to-air missile at NATO planes flying over Montenegro on their
way to Serbia. The strike was not part of a new offensive campaign.
 &HT;    ``From the very beginning of the air campaign, we knew _ and we
let Djukanovic know _ that there were certain minimal army targets
that we were going to have to hit in Montenegro,'' he said.
 &HT;    Gelbard then shifted conversation away from the awkward matter
of bombing his friend and talked about what the Clinton
administration was doing to help Djukanovic. It had just decided to
give the Montenegro government $10 million to help pay for
pensions, salaries and social programs. American money, via the
United Nations, was also helping to pay for the care of the
estimated 35,000 Kosovar refugees who have poured into the
republic.
 &HT;    In addition, he said, Washington had exempted Montenegro from
economic sanctions growing out of the crisis and was urging
Congress to approve large business loans for the area. And it was
training Montenegrin diplomats and granting American landing rights
to Montenegrin Airlines.
 &HT;    ``We don't support secession or independence for Montenegro,''
he said, ``but we do support what Djukanovic is doing. He has
support at the highest levels in this administration. His politics
and his economic policies are a good model for all of Yugoslavia
and a particularly good model for the opposition inside Serbia.''
But Washington, he added, had cut no deal to bail out Montenegro in
case Milosevic's loyal Yugoslav army attacks.
 &HT;    Djukanovic's game of chicken was still on.

   MACEDONIA
</P>
<P>
   Population: 2 million
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic makeup: Slavic majority of Macedonians; 23 percent ethnic
Albanian minority, though unofficial figure is estimated as high as
45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Background: A former republic of Yugoslavia making strides
towards democracy. Accepted U.N. and NATO forces to prevent Balkans
conflict from spilling onto its soil.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Ethnic tensions high. Fears refugee crisis will
destabilize government. Opposes NATO forces launching ground attack
from its territory, but flexible on this point if Macedonia gains
NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
   ALBANIA
</P>
<P>
   Population: 3.3 million
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic makeup: Albanian majority of 95 percent
</P>
<P>
   Background: Turbulent political past; has virtually turned
country over to NATO and humanitarian aid agencies to cope with
more than 360,000 refugees who have fled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Main staging area for possible NATO ground action;
fighting along border between Serb forces and KLA. Europe's poorest
country, will depend heavily on international aid.
</P>
<P>
   MONTENEGRO
</P>
<P>
   Population: 638,000
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic makeup: Slavic majority of Montenegrins, 70 percent; 7
percent ethnic Albanian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Background: The smaller partner with Serbia that forms
Yugoslavia, a new president elected several months ago has
distanced the republic from Belgrade and sought close relations
with United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Uncertain. Yugoslav army is testing the police troops
loyal to the local government; NATO is bombing strategic targets in
Montenegro even as the government is trying to remain neutral. The
influx of more than 66,000 refugees from Kosovo has strained
resources.
</P>
<P>
   CROATIA
</P>
<P>
   Population: 4.7 million
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic makeup: Croat majority, 78%; Serb minority of 12%
</P>
<P>
   Background: Formerly part of Yugoslavia, Croatia fought a bloody
war of independence in 1991 with the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army
and later became involved in the Bosnian war that ended in 1995.
Still dealing with a massive rebuilding problem as a result of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Fears the economic gains, particularly in tourism,
since the war's end will be lost as a result of war over Kosovo.
Concerns conflict could spill across its borders.
</P>
<P>
   BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA
</P>
<P>
   Population: 3.5 million
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic makeup: Estimated at roughly 40 percent Muslim, 40
percent Bosnian Serb and 20 percent Croat (Uncertain because of the
massive dislocations caused by Bosnian war).
</P>
<P>
   Background: The breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 prompted a bitter
and bloody three-way war between Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
U.S.-sponsored peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, led to an agreement in
1995 that called for a Muslim-Croat federation and a Serb entity
with a rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: A force of 32,000 NATO-led troops keeps the fragile
peace; fears that the Kosovo war will fuel Serb animosity against
the Western presence and re-ignite the conflict in Bosnia.

 &HT;    NEXT DOOR TO WAR: INSTABILITY SHAKES YUGOSLAVIA'S NEIGHBORS
 &HT;    With BALKANS-BOX-$ADV25.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ To understand the prevailing attitude among
Serbia's neighbors toward the NATO air war against Yugoslavia,
think of a trip to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   The drilling is underway and maybe it will fix the region's
unsettling problem in Belgrade. But the quicker the drilling ends,
the better.
</P>
<P>
   Any second-guessing over the wisdom of NATO's war against
Yugoslavia faded weeks ago in the frontline states that have been
politically and economically shaken by the ongoing bombing campaign
and refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, NATO needs to finish its operation quickly and
decisively in order to minimize the damage already done to the
Balkans, according to government officials and political analysts
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO leaders meet in Washington to mark the 50th anniversary
of the alliance, the small countries along Yugoslavia's southern
and eastern flank -- Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Croatia and the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro -- are grappling
with the consequences of a war now in its fifth week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day the war continues is dangerous,'' said Srdan
Darmanovic(CQ), a former Yugoslav parliament member from Montenegro
who heads a think tank in Podgorica. ``All of our historic
divisions are so sharp and so tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, the junior partner with Serbia in the Yugoslav
republic, is braced for a coup or civil war amid confrontations
between its pro-Western government of Montenegro and federal army
troops controlled by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, already the target of sporadic Serb shelling, fears the
conflict could grow as the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, operates
freely in its territory. The poorest country in Europe, it has been
overwhelmed with the influx of more than 350,000 ethnic Albanians
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic tensions in Macedonia are near a flashpoint as the
country has been overwhelmed in recent weeks by more than 140,000
refugees from Kosovo. The country's president, Kir Gligorov urged
Macedonia's supreme defense council to declare a state of emergency
to handle what he called ``one of the most dangerous'' situations
since independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, the NATO-led force of 32,000 troops that has
maintained a delicate peace since 1995 have had their mission made
more difficult by the war next door. They are on high alert as
tensions grow between them and the Bosnian Serb population.
</P>
<P>
   To the north in Croatia, which is heavily dependent upon
tourism, summer bookings are down and nervousness has grown over
reports that Yugoslav troops crossed the border onto part of its
territory demilitarized under the accords that ended the Bosnian
war.
</P>
<P>
   The widely held view of moderate politicians and analysts is
that the regime in Belgrade must be transformed. The Balkans
without Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia,
would be more stable and offer better prospects for the advance of
democracy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Macedonia has asked for immediate NATO
membership in part because of the possible repercussions of a
half-finished NATO campaign that leaves Milosevic's war-waging
machine intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here fear reprisals from Belgrade because the Serbs
have long memories and even longer knives,'' said Athanas Kirovski,
a political analyst in Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of communism a decade ago, and the bloody
civil war in Bosnia, parts of the region in recent years were
beginning to inch their way toward democratic reforms and market
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   With the onset of the air war, they see the gains slipping away
and are unnerved by the feeling that their fate is once again out
of their hands, controlled by the actions Belgrade on one side, and
Washington and Brussels on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worst political loss of this crisis, this feeling
that the optimism is gone. When I look to the future, it is
depressing. Here, everything is possible and nothing is possible,''
said Zarko Jordanoski, editor of Dnevnik, Macedonia's leading
independent newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration is compounded by the knowledge that even if
Milosevic were to surrender tomorrow, the logistical effort to
rebuild Yugoslavia and resettle the hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians who have fled Kosovo will take years and cost billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the small and weak republics have suffered
significant economic losses.
</P>
<P>
   Factories in Macedonia have begun to lay off thousands of
workers because the Yugoslav market, 20 percent of its foreign
trade, is closed and access to other European markets is
restricted.
</P>
<P>
   ``However you look at the map, the shortest route to Europe is
through Serbia,'' said Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski of
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has acknowledged the regional economic damage cause
by the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia. Earlier this month,
President Clinton raised the prospects of a Marshall Plan-style
rebuilding program for the Balkans once the war is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should try to do for Southeastern Europe what we helped do
for Western Europe after World War II and for Central Europe after
the Cold War,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The war also promises a political by-product for the budding
democracies: closer ties to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria and Romania, non-NATO countries on Yugoslavia's eastern
border, have given the alliance approval to use their airspace to
expand the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis appears certain to strengthen military ties between
the West and the former Yugoslav republics, too. As in the
aftermath of the war in Bosnia, the prospects seem strong that the
United States and Europe will have to commit tens of thousands of
troops and spend heavily in the region to restore Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of Yugoslavia is not in war but in cooperation with
the international community,'' President Milo Djukanovic of
Montenegro told Cox Newspapers in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, Djukanovic had been working toward democratic
reforms and better relations with America and Europe. Now, he
simply struggling to remain in power.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's growing presence in the region is also aggravating
historic ethnic divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, where the bulk of Kosovo refugees have fled, has
virtually given itself over to NATO control as the alliance builds
up its forces there to deal with the refugee crisis and launch a
possible military operation using ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly close association between NATO and Albania has
stoked historic fears among its Slavic neighbors that the West
would help to build a ``greater Albania'' linking Albanian and the
considerable ethnic Albanian populations in Macedonia and Kosovo.
The inter-ethnic dispute over Kosovo stretches back to the 14th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, Macedonia and Bosnia -- with sizable ethnic Serbian
minorities and pro-Serbian nationalists -- are struggling to keep
the lid on political unrest in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states that have the strength of tolerance will survive,''
said Hisen Ranadani, an ethnic Albanian political leader in
Macedonia and former member of the federal parliament. ``Otherwise,
the Balkans will always be bleeding.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The primeval equivalent of your neighborhood
meat market has been found near the village of Bouri in the Afar
desert of Ethiopia. There, scientists found prehistoric antelope
bones covered with scratches caused by knife-like rocks, clearly
wielded by human- like butchers millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery means that a primitive version of the butcher shop
has been part of humans' ancestry for 2.5 million years, at least a
half million years longer than previously thought, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   They dated the antelope bones by analyzing their ratios of
radioactive elements, which vary over time and so provide a kind of
clock.
</P>
<P>
   By tracing butchery back so far, ``we're right at the beginning
of that great leap (in hominid development) that followed (the
start of) meat eating,'' said one of the researchers, J. Desmond
Clark of the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Meat-eating transformed our ancestors and enabled them to
outlast other hominid types millions of years ago, Clark said
Thursday, while he polished off his lunchtime meal _ a hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   Meat's protein fueled hominids' body growth, strength and brain
power, Clark said. Those traits gave them powerful advantages over
other hominid species that subsisted largely on vegetarian diets,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The antelope bones contain many V-shaped, irregular gouges,
which are characteristic of stone tools used by hominids, Clark
said. The nicks would have been smoother and U-shaped if they had
been made by wild animals, such as coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   This ``evidence of large mammal butchery shows that the earliest
stone technologies were aimed at getting meat and marrow from large
animals,'' said UC-Berkeley spokesman Robert Sanders. ``This
signals a dietary revolution that may have eventually paved the way
toward (hominids') invasion of new habitats and continents.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development at the Afar desert site, the scientists
found another branch amid the numerous prehistoric twigs of the
hominid family tree.
</P>
<P>
   The new branch _ a sort of lost family cousin _ has been named
Australopithecus garhi, or A. garhi for short. ``Garhi'' means
``surprise'' in the language of the Afar Desert's native
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise is the appropriate word because A. garhi's skullcap has
completely unforeseen and unanticipated bony and dental features,
Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   With its unusually big teeth and other features, ``this cranium
was a big surprise to all of us,'' acknowledged one of the
discoverers, Egyptian anthropologist Berhane Asfaw.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on both discoveries, made between 1996 and December
1998, were published in Friday's issue of the journal Science.

GROWING BERRIES CAN BE AS EASY AS EATING THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 25) 
(jt) 
 By LEE REICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plucking a perfectly ripe raspberry or blackberry from a plant
and popping it in your mouth is an ambrosial experience. And these
berries, collectively known as bramble fruits, are easy to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much the only thing you have to do for the plants,
besides harvesting, is prune them diligently once or twice a year.
When plants are pruned properly, their stems and leaves bathe
freely in air and sunlight, so they dry quickly following dew or
rain to minimize disease problems.
</P>
<P>
   Pruning also keeps these spreading plants from taking over the
rest of the garden. And rather than being buried in a tangle of
thorny canes, the fruits on pruned plants are splayed out for easy
picking.
</P>
<P>
   Pruning a bramble patch is not at all difficult _ nothing like
the combination of art and science needed to prune an apple or a
pear tree. Just follow a few simple steps.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing something about how brambles grow and fruit helps you
understand how to prune them. Although all brambles have perennial
root systems, individual canes live only two years.
</P>
<P>
   Canes of summer-bearing varieties do nothing but grow leaves
their first year, bear fruit in midsummer of their second year,
then die. Canes of everbearing varieties begin fruiting near the
top in late summer and early fall of their first year. These same
canes bear additional fruit farther down in midsummer of their
second year, then die.
</P>
<P>
   Because new canes grow from ground level each year, a planting
of either summer-bearing or everbearing brambles can always have an
assortment of one- and two-year-old canes, and so bear fruit every
year (twice a year for everbearing varieties).
</P>
<P>
   Because the canes are biennial, the first step in pruning is to
cut down all canes that have completed their second growing season.
Old, cracking bark makes them easy to identify. Cut these canes all
the way to ground level as growth is starting this spring.
Alternatively, you could have cut them down right after they
finished fruiting last summer.
</P>
<P>
   With full sun and fertile soil, brambles are productive plants,
each spring sending up many _ too many _ new canes. This leads to
the second step in pruning: getting rid of excess young canes. Cut
them to ground level as growth is beginning.
</P>
<P>
   First go after wayward young canes. If you grow your brambles in
a continuous row, lop down any canes that make the row wider than
12 inches. If your planting consists of ``hills,'' or tight
clusters of plants three to six feet apart, lop down any canes
escaping a hill.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have removed these wayward canes, the next step is to
further reduce the number of young canes. Prune plants growing in a
continuous row so that no canes are closer than six inches apart.
If plants are in hills, reduce the number of canes in each hill to
6 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   As you choose young canes to lop to the ground, always save
those that are thickest and healthiest. Keep an eye out for and
remove canes with gray splotches of disease or swellings due to
borers.
</P>
<P>
   From this point on, various sorts of brambles begin to differ in
their pruning needs, and can be divided into two distinct groups.
</P>
<P>
   The first, which includes upright blackberries and black and
purple raspberries, bears fruit on branches on the year-old canes.
Prod these brambles to make fruiting branches by pinching out the
tip of any new cane as it reaches three feet in height. Canes do
not reach this height simultaneously, so go over the planting a few
times through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The final pruning needed for this group of brambles is to
shorten those fruit-bearing branches. Do this now, cutting all such
branches back to a length of 4 to 18 inches, allowing more growth
on huskier branches, because they can bear more fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The second pruning group consists of red and yellow raspberries,
which bear fruit directly on the canes, not on branches. So once
the old canes and excess young canes have been cut to the ground,
the only further pruning needed is to shorten the canes that remain
while plants are dormant.
</P>
<P>
   This is done for convenience and to prevent the canes from
flopping around in the wind, so the amount you shorten them depends
on how you support them. The longer the canes, the more fruit you
will harvest. For instance, one common method of training is to tie
the canes _ shortened to about six feet _ to wires strung between
two posts, one wire at two feet above the ground and the other wire
at five feet. With this same trellis, you could also leave the
canes nearly full length if you bent them along and wove them
around the upper wire.
</P>
<P>
   Prune everbearing types of red and yellow raspberries the same
way as the summer-bearers, with one slight difference. The year-old
canes that started fruiting at their ends last year will finish
fruiting lower down this year. Therefore, shorten those canes to
just below where they stopped fruiting last year. Old fruit stalks
still hanging on the canes will show you where to cut.
</P>
<P>
   A simpler way to prune everbearing red and yellow raspberries is
just to cut the whole planting to the ground each autumn. This
sacrifices your midsummer crop, but will give a somewhat larger
fall crop. It also reduces problems from pests that overwinter in
canes and eliminates damage from cold or browsing deer in winter.
And it's easy.

DALLAS-BOUND SCHOOLS CHIEF LEAVES LIST OF PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ School officials in Dallas have voted to hire
the head of the San Francisco school system, a move that rankled
education officials here at a time when the school district faces
major budget challenges and desegregation issues.
</P>
<P>
   During his seven years as superintendent, Waldemar (Bill) Rojas
has enjoyed a mostly tranquil relationship with the board, a
significant accomplishment for the head of an urban school system.
But there have recently been cracks in the administration of the
San Francisco Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   The system has been assailed for spending money it doesn't have;
buying buildings for vague purposes from funds not readily
reimbursable; and touting academic gains while removing thousands
of low-performing children from the testing base.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the end of a federal desegregation order that governed
the district for 16 years and assigned students based on a rigid
racial formula, San Francisco Unified must now craft an enrollment
plan that maintains diversity without considering race. It is one
of the most complex issues facing any district in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, 54, told board members he would discuss his decision to
leave his $185,000-per-year job and go to Dallas at a school board
meeting Tuesday night. He could earn up to $275,000 per year in the
new job.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas school trustees voted 9-0 Thursday to give the job to
Rojas. The announcement took some officials here by surprise and
some criticized his timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the superintendent to walk away from us in a time of
crisis, a crisis that is his making, is a total betrayal and is
cowardly and pathetic,'' said San Francisco school board member Dan
Kelly. ``He has spit in the face of the board and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewing for another job without notifying board members was
a ``flagrant violation'' of the superintendent's contract, said
board member Jill Wynns.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas' contract, which began April 16, 1992, and extended
through June 2001, requires the superintendent to notify the board
in writing of any job interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions have voided his contract,'' Wynns said. ``I think
it will be suggested that he leave immediately and an acting
superintendent step in.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynns, who has often been the lone board member to openly
challenge Rojas, said there were two ways to look at the timing of
the job switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take the positive spin and say he's been here for
seven years, which is a long tenure for an urban superintendent,''
Wynns said. ``You can also say that things were starting to fall
apart for him. You had questions about his budget, about real
estate deals, about his special education programs, about the test
scores.''
</P>
<P>
   The past few weeks have been a time of trouble for San Francisco
Unified.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from a lawsuit, the system agreed in an
out-of-court settlement to abandon its desegregation formula that
tried to balance the ethnic makeup of each school.
</P>
<P>
   In March, two California lawmakers called for an outside audit
of the district's finances. Then it was revealed the district
borrowed $7.8 million from the general fund to buy a building
without having a guaranteed reimbursement from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Then district testing and reporting policies were questioned. An
analysis of 10 years of district test scores, conducted by the San
Francisco Examiner, indicated that while student enrollment
remained flat, test results from fewer students were being reported
each year, raising questions about whether the gains were real or
manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is the only urban district in the United States to
post six years of consecutive gains in test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This news (of Rojas leaving) couldn't have come at a worse
time,'' said San Francisco teachers union President Kent Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with assignment policy for next year, budget
cutbacks, possible layoffs _ issues that take leadership. I didn't
anticipate that when things started getting tough in the district,
the superintendent would leave so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, born in Puerto Rico and reared in the South Bronx, has a
personality that mixes eloquence with braggadocio, power with
compassion. He has managed to maintain more supporters on the board
than detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas will be lucky to get him,'' said board member Mary
Hernandez. ``For many years, because Bill has such a good national
reputation, there has been interest from other school districts.
He's a great superintendent. I think he's the best there is.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Board of Education President Juanita Owens, also a
Rojas supporter, said, ``He's a change agent. He's creative, a risk
taker. He was brought here to bring about reforms and I think he's
done that. Dallas' gain is San Francisco's loss.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, Rojas would be taking on a significantly greater
challenge in terms of district size and budget.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 158,000 students and 9,300 teachers, the Dallas
system is the nation's 10th largest district. San Francisco 64,000
students and 4,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas district's budget for the 1997-98 year was nearly $967
million, compared with $550 million in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving here in 1992, following two decades in the New
York City public school system, Rojas has pushed for significant
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas and the board also approved tougher graduation
requirements and added a seventh period to the school day for
middle school kids.
</P>
<P>
   Popular for some reforms, Rojas has been denounced for others.
He stirred controversy with his policy of ``reconstitution,'' in
which employees at chronically failing schools are replaced by a
new team.
</P>
<P>
   He was also criticized for his brazen challenge of state
policies on testing children who speak little, if any, English.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, San Francisco Unified _ joined by the school districts
in Oakland and Berkeley _ successfully sued the state Department of
Education to excuse children who speak little English from testing.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Rojas has cast unprecedented attention on the
achievement gaps between racial and ethnic groups, vowing to raise
the test scores of blacks and Hispanics to the national average by
this spring.

THROW OUT THE WINDOWS?
</HEADLINE>

By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am about to get my first PC, and it will have
Windows. I've read so much about Linux and how good it is. Would it
be possible to use it without removing Windows? Also, would you
recommend that a newcomer use Linux?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Gates' Nightmare
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NIGHTMARE: I'd recommend you using it, but not installing
it. That's what your good buddy at work is for. You know who I'm
talking about: the four-eyed geek in Information Systems who gives
``socially dysfunctional'' a whole new spin. Sure, you never spoke
to him before in your life, but you never really needed to, did
you?
</P>
<P>
   Linux makes strange bedfellows. And it gives Big Bill heartburn.
It's an incredibly stable, free operating system you can use
instead of Windows or DOS. Unfortunately, a new user like you is
going to need help from Geek-boy installing it. You really have to
know a lot about your hardware and what you want to do with it, and
newbies rarely know either.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that if you struggle through the installation
and get everything to work correctly, you'll know one heck of a lot
about your computer, unlike the people who just wave a mouse at the
screen and expect things to magically work the right way every
time.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to dump Windows to use Linux, which is probably
the only thing keeping Bill's intestinal walls intact. You'll need
to divide your hard drive into a Windows partition and a Linux
partition, though, using either a utility that comes with Linux or
a separate package like Partition Magic. In the wrong hands, these
utilities can hammer everything on your drive, so let Geek-boy do
this step. At least you have somebody to blame when things go
horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't a lot of commercial programs designed to run under
Linux yet, so don't expect to be playing Half-Life any time soon.
You can find shareware out the wazoo, though, most of it free for
the downloading. There's even something called StarOffice, a free
suite of applications that will leave Microsoft Office owners
wondering what they paid all that money for.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing footsteps, Bill?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Would you please explain memory? If you have 64
MB of memory and use 32 MB researching something, but never shut
the computer completely off, the next time you use it, will you
only have the remaining 32MB available?
</P>
<P>
   _ Memory Lapse
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MEM: I'm sorry, I've forgotten the question. They said the
ginkgo would help, but ... Well, maybe it was ginkgo. They might
have said ginseng. No, that wasn't it. Uhhhh. ... Gecko? Glocko?
Gorgonzola? Somebody help me out here.
</P>
<P>
   Ohhhh, that's right. I remember now. Think of RAM as a shelf.
You pull some stuff off a disk or create some new data and stick it
on the shelf so it's handy when you need to refer to it.
</P>
<P>
   A decent program cleans off the shelf when it finishes its work
so others can use it. Less-than-decent programs leave remnants that
take up valuable shelf space other programs are expecting to use,
bringing the whole thing crashing to ... I forgot where I was going
with this.
</P>
<P>

know, all that stuff about, uhhhh ... was it computers? No, that's

AFTER DECADES IN SUPPORTING ROLES, JUNE CARTER CASH RETURNS TO
RECORDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   June Carter Cash is two months shy of 70, bewildered and a
little saddened at finding herself in the matriarchal role. She
has, after all, spent a lifetime as the daughter of country music's
sainted mother, Maybelle Carter, and 31 years as the wife of the
legendary Johnny Cash.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's her turn to, as Madonna might say, express herself. And
what a statement: June Carter Cash just released an
autobiographical album that is as much a personal statement as
Johnny Cash's ``American Recordings'' five years ago. ``Press On,''
which gets its title from a line in the A.P. Carter song ``Diamonds
in the Rough,'' is an honest, powerful acoustic journey through one
woman's experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I've wanted to do one like this, authentic and
real, the style of music my family played,'' Cash says during a
phone interview last week. Despite her lifetime in the music
business, ``Press On'' is only her second solo album, following
``Appalachian Pride'' in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had contracts with RCA, Liberty and Columbia, but I quit
recording years ago to keep up with John,'' she says. ``It's been a
pretty good job itself, you know, to have seven children, and be a
wife to John, and he doesn't have much of a love for business, so
I've done a lot of business stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It took three years to pick the 13 cuts for ``Press On,'' eight
June Carter Cash originals, three A.P. Carter songs and two others.
An entire recording studio was installed in the Cash family cabin
late last year, with her son John Carter Cash and J.J. Blair as
producers. June's former sons-in-law, Marty Stuart and Rodney
Crowell, as well as Norman Blake and Dave Rowe, were contributing
musicians. June's daughter Rosie Carter and Johnny Cash contributed
vocals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, these are the first takes on everything I did,''
Cash says. ``I kept saying, `John Carter, I know I can sing better
than this.' '' But the tapes were taken to California for mixing,
and in three days, the album was complete. It is being issued on
the independent label Risk/Small Hairy Dog.
</P>
<P>
   While traditional Carter Family cuts are poignant, especially
June singing alone on ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken,'' other more
eclectic songs such as the self-penned ``I Used to Be Somebody''
define June's own life more clearly. They are anything but
innocent. They reflect, Cash says, her own take on her family's
history of limelight and pain. The few times she is alone and
quiet, she says, she is still overwhelmed by such memories _ as
well as that she is the only Carter family member still active and
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I feel strange coming to grips with,'' she
says. ``I used to think Bill Monroe had a few more days on me. But
I can't tell you anybody that's been in the business longer than
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although born in Virginia, June began her career in Texas,
singing on border radio with her mother and two sisters at age 9.
By 1944, teen-age June was on the road continually with her mother
and sisters, and by 1950, the Carter Sisters act was a Grand Ole
Opry regular. She remembers coming to Fort Worth to play major
dates at Panther Hall through the touring years. (Cash once studied
acting with famed director Elia Kazan in New York. She has had
occasional roles in television and movies, the latest being Robert
Duvall's mother in 1997's ``The Apostle.'')
</P>
<P>
   But her career has always been a sideline to her supporting role
beside Johnny Cash. ``That never really bothered me. I made a
choice,'' she says. ``I just felt very lucky to have John in my
life. If a woman is lucky enough to really fall in love, then she
makes a choice. I've never regretted mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a trying one for June. Her sister Helen died, and
their other sister Anita has been hospitalized in her battle with
arthritis. Then there was the diagnosis of Johnny's Shy-Drager
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is much better now. We took off a year and nine months
(mostly in Jamaica),'' she says. ``We told them a year, but we
liked it so well, we took off more.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter Cash says many outside observers just don't see the
rhythm of their lives at this point, focusing instead on health
reports and touring and recording hiatuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Is he bored?' and I always say, `He's having the
time of his life,''' she says. ``You see, we're OK; even if we died
and went to heaven, we're all right. I've always walked with
thousands of angels. They've put me on their wings and they've
carried me.''

WOULD I BACK DOLE? TELL ME WHAT SHE THINKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Women split over female president,'' said a front-page
headline in Monday's paper. ``Possible Dole bid triggering
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   With apologies for contradicting my own newspaper: Not in my
circle of friends, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   So Elizabeth Dole, her recently vacated chair at the helm of the
Red Cross still warm, is contemplating a run for the White House.
Various political pundits and academicians think this will twist
Republican women into a tizzy about whether they're ready to vote
for one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sometime between now and the Republican National
Convention in 2000, Dole will give America some idea where she
actually stands on issues instead of just leaving the media with a
giddy glow because a ``credible'' woman might be going after
politics' brass ring next year. Then Republican women _ and men _
can decide about her qualifications as a viable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Bob Dole's other half has chalked up an
impressive career of public service. The Harvard Law School
graduate has worked directly with three administrations in
Washington: served as a federal trade commissioner and headed two
Cabinet Departments _ Transportation and Labor _ under Nixon;
organized a Task Force on Legal Equity for Women during the Reagan
days; and served as President Bush's labor secretary. She went on
to head a internationally respected relief agency, the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, impressive. And she was the show-stopper at the '96
Republican National Convention with her mingle-with-the-people,
I'm-just-a-simple-girl-from-the-South-who-loves-her-husband
introduction of Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The gal can walk and chew gum at the same time, all right, but
does that make her presidential material? Not until and unless she
gives America specifics about what's on her agenda.
</P>
<P>
   I had the same misgivings about retired Gen. Colin Powell when
it was rumored that he might be interested in a presidential run in
'96. You'd be hard pressed to find many folk who can match his
impeccable record of achievements and values. Stand-up patriot, war
hero, loves his wife and kids, rose above adversity to achieve
success, the whole ``from tiny acorns, mighty oaks grow'' story.
</P>
<P>
   But no one other than perhaps his immediate family and close,
close friends ever found out where he stood on specific issues
facing the country. Turned out it didn't matter, because Powell had
more sense than to put his family through a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The problem I have with people jumping up at this early stage of
the campaign to wave flags and shout hosannahs for Liddy _ or
George W. Bush, or any of the Republican candidates who are testing
the political waters without really committing themselves to
specifics _ is that ambiguity and verbal gymnastics are all we're
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   And the problem I have with the question, ``Will women vote for
a woman?'' is that it is based on an oversimplified premise. The
idea of identity politics, that women will vote for Dole or any
female candidate out of some kind of ``atta girl'' motivation, is
insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, I've heard the same cliches everyone else has about
men in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men have been running this country for more than 200 years,
and look where it's gotten us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America's had enough male, pale and Yale presidents to last a
lifetime _ give someone else a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Kate O'Beirne, Washington editor for the National Review, hit
the nail squarely with bright red polish in a recent column for The
Women's Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Activist Republican women ... will support politicians who
think like them over ones who look like them,'' O'Beirne wrote in
the Independent Women's Forum publication.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. Republican women want intelligent, decisive, strong,
articulate, competent leaders who share their ideologies. If they
happen to be wearing skirts, or went to a state university, or have
Hispanic surnames, great. And if they don't, that's fine, too.

SCHOOL TRAGEDY EXPOSES THE EMPTINESS OF OUR SOULS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Adolf Hitler's birthday. And the evil unfolded at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. What does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not simple. But religionists agree that America
needs a wake-up call in taking care of its children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evil in the world,'' said the Rev. John Tietjen, a
former bishop in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
``Forces are out there ready to turn our children into demons. And
we saw that happen this week.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a bright side, said Tietjen, now senior minister of
Trinity Lutheran Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces also are out there in America eager to help kids learn
how to be human beings,'' he said. ``They don't have to be angels _
just human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservative religionists gave a familiar explanation of
why two teen-age boys, apparently fascinated by the dark and evil
forces of Hitler's Nazism, began shooting down their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``God was violently expelled from school by a Supreme Court
decision in 1962,'' said the Rev. Flip Benham of Dallas, director
of Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group. ``When God is
removed, violence always fills the void.''
</P>
<P>
   Benham referred to the high court's decision to outlaw
government-organized prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   One of Benham's associates, Eileen Schopf of Buffalo, N.Y., who
led an Operation Save America program at high schools in northern
New York this week, expanded on that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have crawled away from the moral upbringing America has
always had, and are refusing to say evil is evil and sin is sin,''
she said. ``We've ignored God's laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Raymond Barber, an independent Baptist leader for 48
years, said he is disturbed and angry about the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what do we expect to happen in America when we try to
diminish the power and presence of Almighty God?'' the Fort Worth
minister said. ``Every time you turn on the TV, you see somebody
sticking a gun in somebody's face, about to blow them away. We've
left God back in the 19th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Tietjen doesn't agree that the problem can be solved by merely
giving God a higher profile in America's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any assumption that God is not there in school.
We have a magnificent bunch of people in the public schools,'' said
Tietjen. ``The problem is with individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   He concurs, though, that schoolchildren need spiritual guidance
and more love and attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot abandon our children to the odd and the morbid and
the evil that is very prevalent in the world,'' Tietjen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Scott Colglazier said those who think the Colorado
massacre can be explained simply do not appreciate the complexity
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about good schools and bad schools, good parents
and bad parents, good neighborhoods and bad neighborhoods,'' he
said. ``It is a problem of the American soul.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes beyond just having prayers in public schools, he said.
It is a deep, systemic problem that must be addressed on the soul
level.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, he believes, must have a new resolve to care for many
adolescents at risk in America's schools who are plagued by
feelings of emptiness and hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Members of all faiths must work together in helping to alleviate
such despair in the very young, said Colglazier, senior minister of
University Christian Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every faith is rooted in divine love, and thus hope,'' said
Colglazier. ``And when we know we are loved and feel ourselves
loved in this universe, it opens the door for caring for ourselves
and for our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Colglazier and his congregation will join with many others
Sunday in remembering the Littleton catastrophe. A candle will be
placed on the Communion altar for every person killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to mourn this, because God is mourning today,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, Americans must immediately take action to give
better care and loving attention to their children.

TANDY'S STOCK PRICE, QUARTERLY INCOME SOAR AS IT TIES FORTUNES TO
INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Leonard Roberts has long believed that Tandy
Corp. would be part of the Internet revolution.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy's stock price, a laggard for much of the decade, has
surged 75 percent since Jan. 1, ranking it No. 5 among the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index companies.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Tandy in the same neighborhood as the index's No. 4,
America Online, a bellwether for today's digital times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growth is dependent on how big the Internet becomes,''
said Roberts, Tandy's chief executive. ``It's going to be a major
new anchor for this company.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two days, Tandy's stock has gained more than $10 a
share, catapulted first by a deal to sell Internet access at Radio
Shack stores and then by a report of strong earnings that surpassed
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy's stock closed at $72.3125 Thursday, up $2.8125. It ended
1998 at just over $41 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy said that net income, before dividends, totaled $55.9
million for the first three months of 1999, a 50.6 percent increase
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales declined 29 percent because the company no longer
operates the Computer City chain. But same-store sales for the
quarter, considered the key measure of a retailer's health,
increased 13 percent at Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   Strong demand for wireless phones and satellite TV drove the
sales gains, the company said, while higher productivity pushed up
operating profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy's stellar results come on top of an 11 percent sales gain
for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all these great visions and strategies, but if
you don't get results along the way, you'll never get there,''
Roberts told analysts in a conference call. ``This has been one of
the best-performing quarters in Radio Shack history.''
</P>
<P>
   It also happens to be Roberts' first quarter as CEO. And he has
been ushering in a series of strategies that are remaking the
company and capturing the attention of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   He is positioning Radio Shack as ``the home connectivity
store,'' the place where America can turn to hook up to high-speed
Internet lines and learn how to apply the latest consumer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he announced a strategic agreement with NorthPoint
Communications, a firm that provides digital access lines. The deal
will let Radio Shack sell the service in up to 28 markets, some
beginning this year, and will allow Tandy to use the technology at
its outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that NorthPoint will pay the costs of installing
the infrastructure at Tandy, which will save the company money
while also helping its workers become more efficient. Separately,
the Tandy board also approved a $20 million investment in
NorthPoint's initial public offering, slated for later this year.

   Roberts is trying to build loyalty and boost morale in an
industry often known for high turnover and poor service. After
telling employees that Radio Shack wants to become the best place
to work in America, he has relaxed the dress code, given stock
awards to store managers and increased benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts appear to be paying off: He said turnover among
store managers is 15 percent, down from about 40 percent several
years ago. And he said productivity gains are reflected in the
growth of same-store sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team of store managers tell me that morale has never been
higher,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy is demonstrating how it can earn a steady stream of
recurring revenues, a key trait that makes Internet companies so
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   When Tandy sells service contracts for wireless phones and
satellite TV, it earns a percentage of the monthly fee, which it
calls ``residual revenue.'' That money is almost pure profit, and
it is having an growing impact on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tandy's residual revenue totaled $32 million. This
year, Roberts projects that it will hit $60 million, and by 2000,
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offers a separate windfall that may be as
lucrative. By selling connections to high-speed Internet lines,
Roberts said Tandy could bring in up to $100 million in a separate
residual stream early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are developing a low capital-intensive, high
earnings-growth model,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the market is responding to the company's
results and its prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers they're putting out are clearly topping the
expectations of the street,'' said David Leibowitz, a managing
director at Burnham Securities in New York. ``And Tandy appears to
be in perfect position to be a direct participant as the home
becomes more digital.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit is being directed toward Roberts. He joined
Tandy as president of Radio Shack in 1993, when the parent company
was struggling with several underperforming units.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'90s, Tandy took write-offs totaling more than
$500 million as it closed or sold Incredible Universe, Computer
City and other operations.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was promoted to Tandy's chief executive this year, after
John Roach retired from the post. Roach remains chairman of Tandy.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts unveiled the slogan, ``Tandy is Radio Shack,'' to help
clear up confusion about the company's identity. And while Roach
had tried to grow the organization by creating new retail concepts,
Roberts has focused on leveraging Radio Shack's 7,000 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have an absolute understanding of our strategy,''
Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Telzrow, an analyst at Hoak Breedlove Wesneski in Dallas,
cited a few other factors for the stock's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company has gotten a lot stronger over the past three
months,'' said Telzrow, who has followed Tandy for many years.
``And there's no question that there is a lot of confidence in
management.''

U.S. LAUNCHES A 5-YEAR, $12 MILLION DEEP SEA PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley, in
announcing the launch of a five-year, $12 million underwater
research project, said it will allow scientists to travel ``to the
depths of our marine sanctuaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means is divers can go to depths we can only dream
about,'' Daley added in describing the Sustainable Seas Expedition,
a major ocean exploration by his department's National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Geographic
Society.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition will include exploration of areas off the San
Francisco and Marin County coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's visit here Thursday was part of an Earth Day tour of the
San Francisco Bay area, where he met with business and port
officials at the Port of Oakland to discuss dredging and stopped by
Fisherman's Wharf to talk about revitalizing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Scuba divers normally cannot go below 100 or 150 feet, but once
inside a tiny submarine called ``DeepWorker 2000 _ which resembles
a mini Volkswagen bug with crab arms _ they will be able to plunge
as deep as 2,000 feet with a high level of maneuverability. The
expedition will use more than one sub to explore 12 sanctuaries
administered by NOAA. Four of them are in California.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Guardino, a chemistry and physics teacher at Carmel High
School, is one of about 60 scientists and teachers being trained to
pilot the new mini-subs. He and other teachers said they see the
opportunity to travel deep below the surface of the sea as a
learning experience for his students. ``These kids have already
learned how to cite and identify more than 160 species of marine
organisms in the (Monterey) Bay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of organizations are financing the project, including
the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund, a San Francisco philanthropic
and environmental group that provided $5 million; National
Geographic Society ($1 million) and $5 million from NASA, NOAA and
other federal agencies, said Dale Petroskey, a senior vice
president with National Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind the project has been Sylvia Earle, a
marine biologist from Oakland, Calif., who is now
explorer-in-residence at National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
   Earle, who said the mini-sub was tested last weekend in
Monterey, Calif., will help lead a team to explore California's
four marine sanctuaries _ the Gulf of the Farallones, Cordell Bank
near Point Reyes, Monterey Bay and the Channel Islands. The team
will then head up to the coast off Washington's Olympic Peninsula.
The project will shift to the East Coast and down to the Florida
Keys by August.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers planning to pilot DeepWorker, built by Nuytco
Research Ltd. of North Vancouver, B.C., said they were excited
about what they might find.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Brown, executive director of the Farallones Marine
Sanctuary Association, said, ``If people don't know what's down
there, they won't understand it and they won't protect it. With
knowing, comes caring.''

 &HT;    Teen-age killers raised in a U.S. culture in decay
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By George Orbanek
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the cell phone call came on the long-planned vacation-day
off, I thought to myself, ``This better not be about someone
complaining about an editorial or griping that the TV logs are
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Would that it had been.
</P>
<P>
   Instead I was told that two heavily armed gunmen, wearing ski
masks and black trench coats had entered a Littleton high school
and were indiscriminately shooting up the place. I was told that
police SWAT teams were assembling outside the high school amid
fears of widespread hostage-taking and dozens of casualities.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to leave the mentally therapeutic currents of the
Roaring Fork River and get back to The Daily Sentinel's newsroom.
When I arrived late in the afternoon, it was all over but the
incalculable shock and grieving. The news wires and television
broadcasts were reporting that up to 25 people may have been
killed, including the two trench-coat-clad assailants, who had not
yet been identified but were presumed to be Columbine High School
students.
</P>
<P>
   Good Lord.
</P>
<P>
   Time once was not all that long ago _ let's say, in the late
'60s _ that a relatively harmless fistfight over a girlfriend or
knocking over a headstone in a cemetery was about the most serious
trouble a 17-year-old kid would ever find himself in. For those
with a hard-core anarchist streak, a really dark fantasy may have
tended toward dreams about taking over the dean's office and
lighting up a joint after spending just a semester or two at dear,
old State.
</P>
<P>
   How quaint. These days, spraying bullets in a recreational
murder spree has replaced spray-painting the school colors around
town as the trouble-making du jour of high school kids.
</P>
<P>
   As the old '60s Buffalo Springfield lyric said, ``Something's
happening here. What it is ain't exactly clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, something is clear. The popular culture of the late '90s
is several shades darker than the popular culture of the late '60s.
There are, of course, many reasons behind the degradation of the
nation's popular culture and attendant societal decay. There's
enough blame to go around for all us to share. But you can place
the influence of Hollywood and the mass media at the top of the
list.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, the suicidal killers
responsible for Tuesday's horrific shooting spree, are products of
the culture they grew up in.
</P>
<P>
   On his late-night television show a few weeks ago, the
ever-so-midwestern-mainstream David Letterman attempted to talk up
Marilyn Manson _ the cross-dressing, violence-spouting,
satanic-worshipping shock rocker said to be Harris' and Klebold's
favorite musician _ as if Manson were merely an outrageously garbed
version of Kathy Lee Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   Call me an old-fashioned relic of a 1950s childhood, but I don't
understand what the likes of a Marilyn Manson is doing on network
television, even on a late-night show which airs after most kids
have presumably gone to bed.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s, Hollywood gave us director Sam Peckinpah's
``The Wild Bunch,'' a film celebrated by critics for its ``balletic
violence.'' Since then, most of us have become anesthetized to the
film violence once lauded as groundbreaking movie making. At the
same time, it's become increasingly difficult to avoid the
conclusion that some people aren't anesthetized to film violence,
but are inspired by it.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 film ``Basketball Diaries,'' Leonardo DiCaprio is
featured in a dream sequence in which he guns down a teacher and
school classmates. As his shooting fantasy fashion statement,
DiCaprio sports a long, black trench coat similar to the trench
coats worn by Harris and Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   Cause and effect? Nah, say apologists for the purveyors of our
contemporary cultural crudescence. It just must be a strange
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Shock rock. Millenial doom-mongering. Dark computer games. A
fascination with Hitler and Nazism. Pervasive movie violence. Mix
in the virtual cesspool found on much of the Internet. To suggest
that none of this contributes to the corruption of the human soul
evilly manifested in the likes of Harris and Klebold is to suggest
the music of Johann Sebastian Bach and movies like ``Chariots of
Fire'' are incapable of elevating the human spirit. In fin de
siecle America, there seems to be far too much of the former and
not enough of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural influences aside, Harris and Klebold are, at bottom,
responsible for the boundless suffering and carnage they inflicted
last Tuesday. And you can spread some of the responsibility toward
the killers' parents. (Hello-o-o-o-o-o, Mom and Dad. How do kids in
this day and age go about building three or four dozen pipe bombs
without parents having any clue?)
</P>
<P>
   Those of us in the business of putting out newspapers are
generally disposed toward the broadest expression of opinion and
artistic creativity. After what happened at Columbine High School
last Tuesday, it's time to wonder whether we as a society can
continue to afford it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I like a a guy who says ``nice to meet you'' while he's kissing
both your cheeks. A guy who inventories his outfit _ ``Karan pants
and top, Gucci belt, Prada shoes and overcoat'' _ and answers the
question ``How much do you cost?'' with a hoot, declaring: ``It's a
fortune, darling. But after you wear good clothing, it's so hard to
go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Khan, 41, knows from good clothing. He is a top music
stylist who dresses Lauryn Hill, Sean (Puffy) Combs, Salt 'n' Pepa
and Monica. Now, I admit it had to be explained to me that the
Monica in question was not she of the Oval Office, but a hip-hop
artist Khan finds so fabulous he says, ``The minute I saw her, I
dropped on the floor and kissed it.'' He was so excited telling the
story, I didn't have the heart to ask what hip-hop was. He already
had his hands full with me.
</P>
<P>
   We were setting off on a styling spree to achieve the latest
fashion craze, haute hippie. Yes, the very term is an oxymoron.
Back in the days when I was a baby hippie myself, all it took was a
pair of bell-bottoms and a peasant shirt bought at a ``head shop''
(rolling papers situated near the cash register), total cost about
$30. But these days, the fashion world has determined that ponchos
and peasant blouses, beads and flowers are all back and better than
ever _ especially if they're silk or cashmere, by Gucci or Chanel
and cost enough to feed a commune for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Delaney, the senior fashion editor at Glamour magazine,
says the hippie trend ``is a backlash to the almost masculine
streamlined forms of spring'' _ items like messenger bags and
straight-leg suits with boxy jackets. ``The '60s hippie clothes are
feminine, flowy, sexy,'' she says. ``You feel groovy wearing them,
loose and unstructured. It's a relief to women to be sexy again.''
Not to mention groovy. But looking groovy in the 1990s isn't the
old ``anything goes'' mentality of the '60s. Today's hippie look is
more refined, pardon the expression: better fabrics and expert
tailoring, a nod to the past, but modern. For this, I needed Khan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the record, a stylist is not a personal shopper limited
to the inventory of one store. A stylist has access to the private
showrooms and collections of many designers and, as Khan says,
``has an eye and encourages you.'' Khan's eye, by the way, costs
$10,000 a day for those without recording contracts. When I
shamefacedly admit that my idea of a fashion high is getting into
bed with a catalog, he is surprisingly nice about it. ``My clients
are just like you,'' he assures me. ``Most artists are very
understated. The glamour is a persona.''
</P>
<P>
   Our first stab at glamour was Chanel. We would not be going to
Gucci, Khan announced, because ``they have too much press
already.'' Though Tom Ford, Gucci's head designer, is a guiding
force behind the resurgence of the hippie look, sewing feathers
onto jeans and beads onto blouses, Khan was adamant: ``The Daily
News did a story on how to make the jeans yourself. When it gets to
that point, honey, it's overdone.''
</P>
<P>
   At Chanel, Khan was greeted warmly by Anne Fahey, the executive
director of fashion public relations. Neither she nor Khan seemed
to grasp the irony of searching for hippie duds in the temple of
the pastel suit, which was standard uniform for all those mothers
bemoaning their daughters' bell-bottoms. (``Why do they have to
drag on the ground?'' I remember, was a popular refrain.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fahey led us into a suite of offices where Khan flung open
the closet doors and started pulling clothes. ``What do you think
of this?'' he asked of a knit skirt with thick horizontal stripes
that looked more librarian than hippie, and not haute at all. I
shook my head. He immediately removed it. ``I try to see from your
eyes,'' he said. ``I don't throw my full creative vision at you.
Then it's not you.''
</P>
<P>
   He assembled piles of beaded necklaces and bracelets, belts,
scarves and shoes. None of them looked the way I remembered _ but
as Ms. Delaney says: ``Designers have to find their own creative
way to craft a trend, or what's the point of being in business? You
can just go to a thrift shop.'' I sat back and watched Khan, secure
in the knowledge that, like a doctor studying a slide under the
microscope, he was seeing things I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   He gave me my first two pieces _ a gold skirt and a multicolored
polka-dot top. ``I don't want it to look like a costume,'' he said,
but as I put on the clothes, I couldn't imagine it wouldn't scream
Halloween. He shook his head. ``I hate that skirt,'' he breathed,
and after fussing with the blouse, tying the top of it every which
way, he shook his head again. ``Try this skirt,'' he said, handing
me a pale pink slip of material. ``We'll go for a hipster look.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came back inside, I winced. ``This gives new meaning to
hipster,'' I said, showing him how tight it was. He quickly
replaced it with a fuller cut skirt, white with a black and tan
swirl (``reminiscent of batik,'' he said), and it fit perfectly. He
paired it with a black camisole top and flat silver sandals. He
then took a silver belt, studded with mirrors, and tied it around
my forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding, right?'' I asked, and he considered a minute
before nodding. ``Too fashion victim,'' he agreed, but then he
hooked it around my hips. It fell perfectly on the skirt's yoke,
giving the faux batik a touch of glitz. He finished it off with a
silver mesh bracelet on my upper arm and a small metallic bag, and
I had to admit the entire look approximated hippiness while
remaining thoroughly contemporary. Total cost? $3,355. That's
haute, all right. Would I actually wear it? Probably. After
visiting a head shop.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop was the Chrome Hearts boutique in a town house on
the Upper East Side. In the car, Khan warned me that this stop
would be for haute hippie, ``but with a biker edge.'' There was
leather, leather everywhere, lots of fringe and five-inch platform
shoes. It looked like Cher's idea of a tough neighborhood. ``I
would never wear this,'' I told Khan, but he was so excited just
seeing the clothes, I let him persuade me to try a few things on.
</P>
<P>
   Or try to try them on. When the pair of harlequin suede pants he
was enamored of proved impossible to button, he kneeled down and
with enormous effort got them closed. Awful. A black leather
minidress with a fringe bottom was also a bust. And I fell off a
pair of platform Birkenstocks, twisting my ankle. Khan could see my
spirits drop; he assured me we could leave and go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But then he saw the leather raincoat, as he called it, with a
belt, and insisted I put it on. He thought awhile. ``Do you have
any jeans?'' he asked Lynn Sable, the store's manager, and
suddenly, there were jeans with appliques and jeans without. ``I
had these jeans!'' I cried, seeing a pair with silver buttons I
used to wear in college. Everyone nodded without meeting my eye,
and I suddenly knew my Goodwill bag had been railroaded. The
applique jeans sell for $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The jeans were too big, so an assistant ran out and got some
binder clips, and they clipped the excess, turning them into
straight-legged tight-fitting pants. I put on a cropped chenille
top that showed some stomach (``You've got a good midriff,'' Khan
insisted) and he had me climb into a pair of Dolce &AMP; Gabbana
four-inch spike heels. With the coat open, a choker around my neck,
a leather bracelet on my wrist and a printed bandana tied on my
head, I suddenly looked vintage Berkeley. Except for the fact that
I was frozen in those shoes (``For glamour,'' Khan insisted), the
outfit was great.
</P>
<P>
   I smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my joy!'' Khan exclaimed, circling me. It would have
been Ms. Sable's joy, too, if I were a paying customer. The total
cost was $6,880.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw today is how it works,'' Khan said, excitedly.
``Now that I see your flavor, lots of subconscious things are
clicking in my head. No one likes trying on clothes. But we want to
grasp that inner thing and expose it. Finding what within you
shines.''
</P>
<P>
   I climbed out of the clothes, thoroughly exhausted. I left Khan,
still raring to go, to his own shopping. He needed to find
something for the VH-1 Divas party _ in which he would shine, no
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Happily relieved of my own shining duties _ no sit-ins at Veruka
for me _ I went straight home, put an ice pack on my ankle and
sorted through the mail, which included a stack of catalogs, not a
platform Birkenstock among them.
</P>
<P>
   It was going to be my kind of night.

 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bronx belonged to Tito Puente last Tuesday night.
As dusk fell, stars were heading uptown on the Major Deegan
Highway, and local Bronx heavyweights like the rapper Fat Joe were
suiting up in their flashy best. All were coming out to pay homage
to Puente, the godfather of Latin music, who was celebrating his
76th birthday in grand style at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Puente had to make a stop. Clad in a light cream
double-breasted suit and collarless gun-metal shirt, he stepped
onto the infield of Yankee Stadium to throw out the opening pitch.
Introduced as ``The King of Latin Swing,'' Puente swiveled his hips
in a deft mambo step, went into his windup and then delivered an
anemic, one-hopping pitch over home plate. The stadium erupted in
cheers, as if he had just burned a hole in catcher Jorge Posada's
mitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous,'' Puente explained moments later,
exiting through the stadium's underground passageways. As a child
on the streets of Spanish Harlem he had always dreamed of being a
professional ballplayer. Instead, he became the most famous of the
Latin band leaders, and a seemingly ageless pop icon. His fans
range from grandmothers who grew up dancing to his mambo rhythms,
to teen-agers who know Puente from crossover pop records like ``Oye
Como Va'' and TV appearances on ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo, Tito! Como 'ta?'' called two Hispanic police officers
outside Yankee Stadium, who then offered birthday greetings to
Puente and did exaggerated we-are-not-worthy bows. With his wife on
one arm and his daughter on the other, he took his place in the
back of a white stretch limousine replete with long-stem Champagne
glasses. But when the limo pulled up outside Jimmy's, all seemed
quiet _ just the bouncers and a parked television news van.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're too early,'' said Puente's daughter, Audrey, a
television weather anchor in Jackson, Miss. ``Should we go back and
watch the rest of the baseball game?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Puente said. ``Jimmy told me get here by 8.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it was almost as if he had walked into a surprise
birthday party. Television lights flashed on as Puente talked to
reporters, hugged old friends and was kissed by complete strangers.
``Happy birthday to me,'' Puente said softly, raising a glass of
wine. As barrel-chested bouncers cleared a path through the crowd,
women in bright lipstick and shimmering gowns blew kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy's Bronx Cafe, the cavernous club in a former auto
dealership on West Fordham Road, is best known as a hangout where
Latino athletes, rappers and salsa stars carouse alongside
silk-shirted tough guys. But for most of the non-Latin celebrities
in attendance, the glitz of the South Bronx night spot was a
revelation: a breezy, high-ceilinged, palm-tree-adorned throwback
to nightclubs like the Copacabana.
</P>
<P>
   Like a scene from a Ricky Martin video, salsa-steppers in
pinstriped suits whirled athletic women in tight white skirts slit
up to the hip. Chris Noth, the star of the television series, ``Sex
in the City,'' who had never been to Jimmy's before, congratulated
Puente, barely taking his eyes off the long-legged dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby ribbed Puente about his bouncing first pitch at
Yankee Stadium: ``You thought you were playing cricket, Pops?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to throw it over his head,'' Puente said, moving
on to glad-hand friends like the actor Armand Assante and the
former light-heavyweight boxing champ Jose Torres. Jimmy Rodriquez,
the restaurant's proprietor, served Moet and platters of jumbo
shrimp, but Puente had no time for a nosh. He was still lost in the
scrum when Cosby and city luminaries took the stage to toast and
roast him. Felipe Luciano, a Fox TV newsman read his poem ``Why I
Love the King.'' Rep. Jose Serrano spoke, and a proclamation from
Gov. George Pataki was read, declaring Oct. 20, 1999, as Tito
Puente Day in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m., the tributes had stretched on too long for Puente's
wife, Margaret. ``Latin crowds don't want to hear speeches,'' she
said. ``They want to dance.'' As if on cue, the all-star band,
featuring the vocalist Tito Nieves and the flautist Dave Valentin,
fired up. The soul star Isaac Hayes jammed for a few numbers, as
did another of Puente's friends, the 91-year-old jazz great Lionel
Hampton. Wheeled onto the stage, he played vibraphone during ``How
High the Moon?''
</P>
<P>
   When Puente climbed on stage himself it was as packed as the
dance floor. He tried to thank all the vocalists he had ever worked
with, then gave up. ``I have 117 albums out; who can remember them
all?'' he asked, and then attacked his brightly painted timbales.
Wagging his tongue, rolling his eyes with cartoonish glee, he
circled one drumstick overhead like a lariat. A woman in a silver
lame dress gyrated her hips onstage beside him. Puente's frenetic
pace seemed to exhaust even the head-nodding rappers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tito Puente at 76 still looks sexy,'' said Sandra Guzman,
editor in chief of Latina magazine. ``He is el hombre. He is el
macho.''
</P>
<P>
   By midnight, Puente paused at the exit for a farewell photo with
a woman in a feather wig and purple Lycra miniskirt, then his wife
put him in his black trench coat and they headed home. The king had
an early flight in the morning. Monday (April 26) he was to be in
Fort Lauderdale, for another club, another gig.

   STAR-WARS-REVISITED (Undated) _ The Force wasn't with me, and my
little niece and nephew didn't like it. I am, after all, their

   AUDREY-HEPBURN-IMAGE (New York) _ You can never be too rich or
too thin or too Audrey. Hepburn, that is. She was an object of
fascination _ some might call it obsession _ well before her death
six years ago. And now, her status as style goddess is spreading
from the fashion world to the real one with new urgency. On May 4

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Plucking a perfectly ripe raspberry or
blackberry from a plant and popping it in your mouth is an

KIDS CONDITIONED TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS VIOLENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A Scottsdale friend was talking with his 10-year-old
daughter at dinner Wednesday night about the Colorado high school
shootings, trying to convey his alarm and despair.
</P>
<P>
   She gave him a quizzical look and a reply that spoke for
contemporary America, or at least the image of our society widely
held by young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why's it so tragic? It happens all the time,'' she shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   I ran into a similar reaction last year after watching ``Saving
Private'' ``Ryan'' with my teenage stepdaughter. Some of the battle
scenes were the most frightful I'd seen on film, and I asked how
she felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't all that impressed,'' she said. ``I've seen a lot of
stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   To blame the high-school slaughter on an indifference to
violence would oversimplify an event with many roots. But I think
it's one cause, one that has infected American kids from coast to
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by so much violence _ in real life and in pop culture
_ kids develop emotional immunity. On television alone, a typical
child will see as many as 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of
violence before reaching high school. Is it any wonder their brains
become numb to it?
</P>
<P>
   Few psychologists think that exposure to fictional violence, no
matter how frequent or intense, turns teens into killers. But many
believe that violent images desensitize them, and in many cases,
make them less empathic. They also worry that kids who see violence
portrayed as justified self-defense are then able to rationalize
their own outbursts more readily.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in pop culture these days is less the exception than
the rule. Movies glorifying mayhem, blood-drenched video games and
noxious music lyrics are solidly mainstream. Death is talked about
dispassionately. News media, local TV news broadcasts in
particular, reinforce the view that anti-social behavior is
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rohde, an adolescent psychologist in Phoenix, said kids who
feel disconnected from their peers are especially prone to see
violence as an appropriate response to any serious offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two boys in Colorado apparently felt alienated,'' Rohde
said. ``Kids like that often feel powerless. So they want to get
power. When you put power and alienation together, you get
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the boys, Eric Harris, liked to play a homicidal computer
game called Doom, as do a lot of well-adjusted kids. For him,
however, the line between fantasy and reality didn't seem very
clear. Students who survived Tuesday's rampage said the killers
laughed as they went on their murderous binge, as if it were just a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Gratuitous use of violent imagery isn't confined to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Limited Inc., a national clothing chain, recently adopted an
employee campaign called WAR (Win at Retail) that features a
motivational film with battle scenes drawn from war movies. The
company told the ``Wall'' ``Street Journal'' that lagging sales
made it necessary to do something dramatic to shake up managers.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, CEO Leslie Wexner affirms, ``It is a war, and in
wars people really do live and people do die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be willing to shed fear and doubt,'' another
executive declares. ``Make the critical and key decisions
effectively and efficiently, then move in for the kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's film indulges in a kind of desperate, catastrophic
thinking that's common to troubled teenagers. Problems take on
life-or-death significance and can be resolved by only the most
extreme response. The two outcasts in Colorado evidently thought
killing their classmates was the only way they could get
satisfaction for the years they had been treated as losers.
</P>
<P>
   Much in our society has legitimized violence as an acceptable
way of dealing with conflict. If you have a grudge, grab a gun and
get even. We see it on the streets, where police are fatally shot
and road rage is on the rise, as well as on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   What happened at Columbine High School was a nightmarish
aberration, but the contributing social forces are thriving. That's
a good subject for more dinnertime conversations between kids and
parents. &QL;

HELPING HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes is not the
only high-powered political operative working hard behind the
scenes in New York to help Hillary Clinton get elected to the US
Senate next year. Thomas Doherty is also doing what he can for the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty is a close personal friend of Governor George Pataki. He
also serves as Pataki's chief dispenser of patronage and favors. If
you're wondering why the patronage czar of the Republican governor
of New York is trying to derail the Senate candidacy of the
Republican mayor of New York City, at a time when the GOP's control
of Congress is tenuous at best, well, let's see _ where would you
like to begin?
</P>
<P>
   The best place to start is the summer of 1994. Rudy Giuliani had
just been elected mayor. Senator Al D'Amato had just handpicked
George Pataki to be the New York GOP's gubernatorial candidate.
Previously, Pataki had served in obscurity as the state senator
from Peekskill, N.Y., a small Hudson River community one hour north
by northwest of Manhattan. Giuliani had never heard of Peekskill
and couldn't imagine that anyone from such a backwater could ever
be elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   In this opinion, many others concurred. Based on these good
opinions, Giuliani endorsed Governor Mario Cuomo's candidacy for a
fourth term, crossing party lines to do so. Unfortunately for
Giuliani, Cuomo had by then become such a crashing bore that even
the state senator from Peekskill looked like Teddy Roosevelt. And
so it came to pass that Pataki was elected governor, despite
Giuliani's best efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's treachery was neither forgotten nor forgiven. Four
years later, Pataki put pen to paper to describe exactly how much
he hated Giuliani for what he had done. The passages, though never
published between hard covers, were made readily available to
members of Albany's news-starved press corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no mere endorsement,'' wrote Pataki. ``Giuliani wasn't
just for Cuomo. It was an all-out trashing of our effort.'' Pataki
went on to characterize Giuliani's endorsement as ``a knife in the
back,'' that left him ``speechless,'' ``stunned'' and feeling ``as
if the wind had been knocked out of me, after a sucker punch.'' His
wife, wrote Pataki, was ``even more outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when nasty New York GOP political disputes were
mediated by Wall Street barons. The fat cats would gather, slap the
politicians around for misbehaving, and then lay down what was
known as Rockefeller's Law: no comity, no cash.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's loathing of Giuliani, however, makes Pataki's
hatred of the man seem almost benign. In the 1980s, Giuliani had
led the prosecutions of many Masters of the Universe. The memory of
leading investment bankers being hauled out of their offices in
handcuffs seared the consciousness of every last trader. There, but
for the grace of God, went them. So, rather than intervene, Wall
Street has stood by and let Giuliani suffer.
</P>
<P>
   National Republican leaders have every reason to broker a peace
deal, since it is manifestly in the party's interest to pick up the
Moynihan seat to protect against possible losses in other parts of
the country. But so far, only Texas Governor George W. Bush (who is
my cousin) has made it public that he fully supports Giuliani.
Everyone else has steered clear, for fear of alienating the
governor of the nation's second-largest state.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator Al D'Amato, whose patronage made possible
Giuliani's service as the US Attorney for the Southern District of
Manhattan, has also been mentioned as a possible peace maker, but
he too loathes Giuliani with white-heat intensity. D'Amato harbors
MacArthur-like political ambitions and sees Giuliani as a threat to
his return. Having been displaced by his former protege Pataki as
the leading GOP political figure in New York, D'Amato has no
interest in helping Giuliani ascend to the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Republicans, another group that might think it
wise to repair the breach, look to Albany for guidance. It is here
that Tom Doherty, dispenser of patronage and favors, serves as a
kind of political directory assistance. The message Republicans
hear from Doherty is succinct: Help Giuliani and you're out of
business with the governor. Last Monday, Doherty took the unusual
step of reiterating this message in the pages of the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   It is an axiom of modern American politics that protracted
primary battles make victory in the general election much harder to
achieve. Forces loyal to Governor Pataki are actively trying to
recruit a primary challenger to Rudy Giuliani. They may or may not
succeed, but the damage they do in the interim will have its
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of all these Republicans conspiring to clear
Hillary Clinton's path to the Senate is a wonder to behold. But as
the TV detective Kojak once said, ``Hey, baby, it's New York.''

COUNTRY FASHIONS: TODAY'S CLOTHES NOT ALL SUGAR AND SPICE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Country fashion has changed so much that it may no
longer be a recognizable style.
</P>
<P>
   When Emma Lee Turney organized the first Round Top Antiques Fair
31 years ago, traveling to a small Texas town to buy fine antiques
was an odd idea to city slickers. But not any odder than the notion
of dressing up to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, high-heels-and-pantyhose women from the city tended
to dress down for the country, emulating the natives or recapturing
their own roots. They were, as they told themselves, ``country when
country wasn't cool,'' with a nod to the country-western song, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   But in Texas, Turney's Round Top shows, as well as a general
back-to-the-country movement, changed all that. In the newly
acceptable country dress, denim and diamonds were not out of the
question. Prairie skirts ruled the rural world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen country fashion change from Levi Strauss to Ralph
Lauren and watched denim go from country hick to country chic,''
Turney said.
</P>
<P>
   Turney, along with Beverly Harris, is author of ``Denim and
Diamonds`` (C. Going Press, $35), a book that last year chronicled
the first 30 years of the Round Top show. Now the show has grown to
include two more Turney sites, and many more dealers set up
temporary shop in Round Top, as well as nearby Carmine, Warrenton
and Shelby. As the show evolved, so did country dress.
</P>
<P>
   Now fashion is changing again, but the Round Top show remains a
good place to get a handle on country dress _ if there is such a
thing today _ as shoppers and browsers arrive in vehicles from
Model T Fords to Mercedeses.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular vehicles are the roomy and utilitarian sport
utility vehicles, and this trend to utilitarianism and comfort
carries into fashion. As Lauren graduated from his country clothes
into Southwest-inspired fashions, and now active-sports-inspired
clothing, so have customers.
</P>
<P>
   Urban sprawl has blurred the boundaries between city and
country, so that now clothing also tends to cross boundaries. Today
city folks dress down for work, and that ethic is spilling over to
country dress.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the glitz is gone. As in city dressing today, jeans and
blue denim are increasingly in the minority, although blue is still
the most popular nonurban neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Khaki _ and, this time of year, white _ clothing far exceeds
indigo blues and denims in what is known as the ``city casual''
look. In fact, most fashions at the recent semiannual Round Top
Antiques Fair looked as if they were purchased from Old Navy, the
Gap or Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   City casual calls for pants, shorts or capris, with a few
miniskirts and long skirts. Unlike in rodeo season, footwear in
warm weather is either athletic shoes, sandals or mules. As fire
ants continue to proliferate, closed shoes are becoming more of a
country necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe/Southwestern look remains a key trend in the
country. Colors tend to black, browns and beiges, sunrise and
sunset golds and peaches, and many shades of green, from celadon to
olive.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular fabrics are linen, cotton, rayon or blends of
these fibers, but washable linen is the innovation most responsible
for this look, especially that with the Flax label.
</P>
<P>
   At Round Top, LaNell Arndt, owner of Nellie's Boutique &AMP; Gallery
in Brenham, said washable linens have lured women away from other
styles. Most of the Flax garments also fit loosely and ``breathe''
during the warm, humid months, especially this season's new
seersucker linens.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Sante Fe-look garments worn today fall straight or
in A-line shapes from the shoulders, with skirts slit up the sides
for comfort and ease. Styles include sleeveless dresses and jumpers
or easy two- or three-piece coordinates with straight or broomstick
skirts. Accessories are turquoise, coral and silver jewelry, silver
concho belts and wide-brimmed straw hats.
</P>
<P>
   While hand-painting on garments _ blue geese, bluebonnets, etc.
_ isn't being done much anymore on country clothing, Sante Fe
styles seem to have only recently discovered it. Now designers of
Santa Fe styles are appliqueing painted patches and pockets on
dresses, skirts and tops.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Another trend, perhaps the closest to past country dress, is
``English garden chic.'' This style includes florals, ginghams and
patchwork, often all in the same garment, and again in fabrics of
cotton, linen or blends that include rayon.
</P>
<P>
   Jackets, smocks and jumpers made of thick floral or other
printed cotton drapery fabrics are popular, as are aprons made to
wear over dresses and separates.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Ballard, whose business, Forever, Rebecca, is in Flint,
Texas, sells a chintz floral cover-up apron with red gingham trim
($40) in a pattern she calls her ``grandma's apron.''
</P>
<P>
   Overalls and overall jumpers are as popular for women as for
children, with the women's wear in fabrics such as pink linen. But
again, these are items for city and country wear.
</P>
<P>
   Novelty items include drapery-fabric backpacks, lace-trimmed
socks and umbrellas with handles made from silver cutlery, so a
woman can choose her umbrella to match her wedding silver.
</P>
<P>
   Country clothing made from embroidered vintage dresser scarves
and napkins, so popular only a few years ago, is seldom seen today.
While embroidery is gaining popularity in city wear, it is falling
out of favor beyond the beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Pony- and cow-printed hide bags are catching on, while leopard
and zebra have moved beyond the zoo-zone no-nos. Raffia and
straw-pouch or basket-type bags are cool again.
</P>
<P>
   Other city trends creeping into country duds include pockets
that negate the need for purses. One sees these even on
garden-print long dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Authentic American Indian jewelry is enjoying a revival, not
only on the fashion runways of the world but in the country _ and
for both men and women. For women, at least, this stems from the
affinity of today's washable linen separates for Indian jewelry of
silver and natural semiprecious, often chunky stones.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of country dress is that it must lend itself to
outdoor wear, not air-conditioned confines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a poll yesterday, and three out of four people around
here aren't wearing underwear,'' said dealer Cynthia Anderson of
Kerrville.
</P>
<P>
   Brassieres are usually the first to go when the thermometer
climbs toward the 90-degree mark; other unmentionables are just
that.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, layering makes country dress easier with the addition
of thick American Indian-inspired sweaters or leather, suede or fur
jackets.

PRO-GUN LEGISLATOR HAUNTED BY COLORADO SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ His family in Colorado Springs is living
under police protection because of death threats. He broke into
tears during an interview with a newspaper reporter.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Doug Dean, fairly or not, has become the focus of
anger in the aftermath of Tuesday's slaughter of 12 students and a
teacher by two schoolmates, who then took their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   As the state House majority leader in Colorado, Dean, a
Republican, was the sponsor of two bills that prompted the most
heated gun-control debate in the state's history. One would have
enabled most people to carry concealed weapons, while the other
would have eradicated rigid anti-gun rules in Denver that city
officials credit with reducing violent crimes by 40 percent in the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   And on the day of the massacre at Columbine High School, the
state House of Representatives was poised to pass both of them.
</P>
<P>
   While Dean's bills, since withdrawn, enjoyed the support of most
state politicians _ with strong Republican majorities in the House
and Senate _ it had appalled Denver's political leadership and
placed Dean in what now appears to be a remarkably vulnerable
position.
</P>
<P>
   To understand Dean's problem, it is necessary to travel back to
1993, when Denver, a city of 580,000 in a metropolitan area of
slightly more than 2 million, experienced what is remembered as its
``Summer of Violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Drive-by shootings ruled the headlines. A small child was killed
by a random bullet. The city responded by passing some of the most
restrictive anti-gun legislation in the nation. The City Council
banned ownership of all assault weapons, required safe storage of
guns at home, made it illegal to carry guns on hips and prohibited
firearms in city parks. Guns within reach of an automobile driver
were also forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Denver has tried pretty hard to control guns and
there (in Littleton), but for the grace of God go we,'' said
Jennifer Mouton, head of the city planning department.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver ordinances, though not by design, raised the
possibility that hunters passing through the city might be subject
to arrest if their guns were within reach. The National Rifle
Association, according to some politicians here, jumped on that
apparent unfairness and took it to the Legislature for redress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are large areas of rural Colorado where people have
grown up with guns and hunted. Guns are part of the culture.
They're not associated with crime,'' said House Minority Leader Ken
Gordon, a former public defender from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The other view was hardened, he said, by ``the well-publicized
incident a couple of years ago where a mother bought her
15-year-old son a pistol for his birthday and he went out and
killed somebody. It was a completely unprovoked shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed, he said, was essentially a battle between
Colorado's two populations _ the rural people and the urbanites,
most of them living around Denver.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle escalated, gun control liberalization bills began
to appear on the floor of the House. One, ironically, would have
permitted guns in schools (though not carried by students).
</P>
<P>
   That was not forgotten this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who have actually said that if the teachers
in Littleton had been armed, this could have been stopped,'' said
Happy Haines, president of the Denver City Council.
</P>
<P>
   The idea died when Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican and supporter
of concealed weapons laws, declared that he would not support guns
on campus. That followed large demonstrations against the idea on
the steps of the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The gun control liberalization bills were presented or endorsed
by Dean. He finally came up with two that were on the verge of
being passed and signed by Owens.
</P>
<P>
   One, said Denver District Attorney Bill Ritter, ``would have
preempted cities from passing any (gun control) laws more
restrictive than the state statute.''
</P>
<P>
   The other would have made it mandatory to issue concealed
weapons permits to anyone who was not a convicted felon, legally
mentally ill or obviously unsuitable to carry a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, it was the first bill that created the greatest
concern, because it meant that most of the legislation adopted by
the city would have been usurped.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've heard from Denver police is that they don't find
firearms in cars anymore because of those ordinances,'' said Ted
Pascoe of the Coalition Against Gun Violence, an offshoot of the
Denver-based chapter of the Physicians for Social Responsibility.
``The Denver ordinances were about to be preempted.''
</P>
<P>
   After the killing spree at the suburban high school, Dean
withdrew both bills from consideration.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That has not prevented him from being a target of hatred for
outraged citizens shocked by the mass murder in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten death threats because of his advocacy,'' said
Gordon, the minority leader who had fervently campaigned against
both of Dean's bills. ``I'm feeling bad for him because, even
though I disagreed with him, I think he's advocated in good
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Reimer, an aide to Dean, said: ``Doug is just destroyed by
this. There have been threats against his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst of it came Wednesday, the day after the shooting.
``The phone calls that came in _ `You have blood on your hands' _
just devastated him, absolutely devastated him,'' she said.

A REFRESHER COURSE ON COMPUTER BASICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writing a computing column that's aimed at novice to
intermediate users is not an easy task. The trick is to keep things
clear and understandable for newcomers, but not put the more
techno-savvy folks to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, I usually make certain assumptions about readers'
knowledge. I figure most users of Windows 95/98 know what the
desktop is; how to launch programs using the Start menu; how to
find things on a hard drive using either My Computer or the Find
command; and how to copy files from one drive to another.
</P>
<P>
   I also presume users know the difference between hard drive
space and memory; where a file that's been downloaded from the
Internet gets stored; and what a Web browser is.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, often those assumptions are false. Judging from
my mail, there are a lot of people out there who don't know these
computing basics. They're not necessarily dumb _ these just aren't
the kinds of things they feel they need cluttering up their
everyday lives. That is, until they run into a jam and get
frustrated with trying to fix a problem themselves, or feel
overwhelmed by the jargon-laden patter of a technical support
person.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is essentially Computing 101 for beginning Windows
users _ some of the very basic things you need to know. This isn't
everything, mind you, but it's a start.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Terms and concepts. &LR;  First, you'll need to know what's what.
</P>
<P>
   The big open area on your monitor where you see icons and where
programs appear is called the desktop. The bar at the bottom of the
screen that includes the Start button, as well as buttons that
correspond to each program, is called the taskbar. The boxed-off
area on the right side of the taskbar where the clock and possibly
some small icons are located is the system tray. My Computer,
usually located in the upper-left-hand corner of the desktop, is
another name for the Explorer _ a program that lets you see the
files stored on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The icons on your desktop, in the Explorer and in the system
tray mean different things. Most, but not all, of the desktop icons
are shortcuts _ they are pointers to files that start specific
programs. If you delete a shortcut, you do not delete the file
itself _ just the pointer to it. Most shortcuts have a small arrow
in the lower left corner of the icon.
</P>
<P>
   The icons in the system tray are programs that are running in a
kind of ``suspended animation'' state in the background. They
usually are waiting for some type of action _ the press of a
button, behavior that looks like a virus or a timed event _ before
they wake up and do something. You can usually find out more about
what they do by holding your mouse cursor over them, or by clicking
on them with the left or right mouse buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The icons you see when you open My Computer are the files and
folders stored on your hard drive. Delete these, and you have
actually removed the files _ and lost their functions.
</P>
<P>
   Your hard drive, by the way, is not the same thing as your
computer's memory. The hard drive is where your programs and the
documents they create are permanently stored. The computer's memory
is where programs are loaded when they are launched. You can think
of your hard drive as a book, and memory as your brain. When you
open a book and read the words there, they ``move'' from the page
into your brain, where you think about them and store them in your
own form of memory.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Work those files. &LR;  Now that you know what they are, what can
you do with them?
</P>
<P>
   Moving files from one place to another is as easy as picking
them up and moving them by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you want to copy some files from a folder on your hard
drive called Documents onto a floppy disk. You'd open My Computer
and see several icons _ they'll represent your hard drive (usually
C:), your CD-ROM drive, your floppy drive, a folder called Printers
and another called Dialup Networking. Double-click on the C: drive,
and you'll see the first level of folders available to you. I say
``first level'' because you can have folders within folders. But in
this case, let's presume the Documents folder is on this first
level.
</P>
<P>
   Find the folder, double-click on it, then find the file you
want. Next, if you have Windows set up to open each folder in the
same window, go back to My Computer and double-click on it again to
open a second window. Put your floppy disk in the A: drive and
double-click on the floppy-disk icon in the second window.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the windows showing the Documents folder and the A:
drive contents side by side; click on the file you want, hold down
the mouse button, and drag the file from the Documents window into
the A: drive window, and release.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to move the file instead of just copying it _ so it
no longer resides in the Documents folder _ click with your right
mouse button and hold that down as you drag. When you release,
you'll get a menu that lets you choose to move rather than copy.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to use just one window, you can drag the file
directly to the A: drive icon in the left pane of the Explorer
window.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a tip. Most Windows 95/98 systems are configured to
allow you to copy a file to the A: drive just by using the right
mouse button. Right-click on the desired file, choose Send to ...
and then click on the A: drive icon in the menu that appears.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Download blues. Where did that file go? &LR;  When you download a
file from the Internet using either of the major Web browsers
(Internet Explorer or Netscape Communicator/Navigator), a window
opens that lets you designate where on your hard drive it can be
saved. Note the name of this folder, which appears in a field at
the top of the window called ``Save in ...'' If you want to see
where this folder is in relation to the rest of your hard drive,
click on the down arrow to the right of your name. You'll see a
kind of map that gives more information about its location.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use this map to save the folder in a different
place. When the map appears, click on your C: drive, and in the
window beneath you'll see all the folders on your C: drive. Choose
a folder to save the file in. You can even create a new folder in
this window _ named, say, ``download'' _ by right-clicking in an
open area of the window, choosing New, then Folder.
</P>
<P>
   Open the folder by double-clicking on it, then click the Save
button. Now you'll know where your file is.
</P>
<P>
   If you still can't find it, there's still hope. Click the Start
button, choose Find, then Files or Folders. From the box that
appears you can search for the file by name, or even by just a part
of its name.

ROY PORTER, A GLUTTON FOR HISTORY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British medical historian Roy Porter was embarking
on his first sabbatical in nearly three decades of frenetic
teaching and writing when he fell spectacularly ill last fall. ``I
got a gigantically enlarged testicle,'' he said cheerfully. What
was particularly notable about his condition, which turned out to
be a cluster of easily removable benign cysts, was that it was the
first time he had been sick in decades.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Porter's unexpected descent into the world of the
unwell was a fine illustration of one of his favorite observations,
that illness of the body often has its roots in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been teaching nonstop for 27 years, and I've been healthy
for 27 years,'' he said recently in his vast, cluttered cavern of
an office at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine,
where he is a professor of the social history of medicine. ``And
within a fortnight of taking sabbatical leave, when I finally had
nothing urgent to do, I got sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter has not had much time to be sick. He has written more
than three dozen books on topics ranging from the Industrial
Revolution to madness through the ages to the history of London.
(His latest book, written with G.S. Rousseau, is on the history of
gout.)
</P>
<P>
   Through them all he has earned a reputation as an expert who can
bring potentially dry subjects to life, making his work appreciated
as much by the general public as by specialists. He is the model of
a popular historian _ appearing on talk shows, writing book
reviews, being consulted by governments _ but is still admired by
academics for the rigor of his research and the sweep of his
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The books crammed onto his shelves reflect his eclectic
interests and his twin obsessions, the history of the 18th century
and the history of medicine. This year he is off in yet another
direction. ``I'm deep into the roots of feminism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he produced ``The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A
Medical History of Humanity'' (W.W. Norton), a breathtakingly
thorough survey of medicine, its place in society and its
implications for civilization from the time of the ancient Greeks,
when Hippocrates devised his famous oath, to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The book might have lived a worthy but generally unacknowledged
existence if it had not been authoritative and enthusiastic enough
to appeal to a lay audience. The same could be said of Porter. With
his longish gray hair and shaggy, unshaven face, his black leather
jacket and his heavy use of gold necklaces, rings and bracelets
(his father repaired jewelry for a living, instilling a lifelong
taste for adornment in his son), he looks like a 52-year-old
undergraduate or the extremely cool college professor you never
had. What he does not look like is the kind of person whom The
Economist would call ``a formidably learned man,'' as it did in a
typically glowing review of his medical history.
</P>
<P>
   The book's title comes from Samuel Johnson, who had endless
faith in medicine's capacity to improve the world, but Porter
doesn't exactly agree. ``I kind of wanted the publishers to put a
question mark at the end of it,'' he said. (They didn't.) ``I'm a
great fan of Samuel Johnson, but I didn't want people to take the
title as an assertion. I wanted them to take it as a possibility. I
hope that I raise it as a question rather than a certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he does. While some reviewers said that Porter's book
reflected a Whig view of history, meaning that it assumed linear,
cumulative progress in which today was always better than
yesterday, the author doesn't see it that way. Medicine, he said,
has by no means been one long march toward something better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some areas in which medicine has really advanced and
made general progress,'' he said. ``But there are other areas where
it's made virtually no advance at all. And there are others in
which it's been pretty counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the great paradoxes of today, Porter believes, is that as
medicine becomes more sophisticated and develops better strategies
for diagnosing and treating illness, so the world at large becomes
increasingly anxious about health and mortality.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly to do with loss of faith. Now that fewer people,
especially in the Western world, believe that life is a
transitional phase leading to immortality, they are left with
nothing to believe in after death. So they put their faith in
technology and in doctors, who, Porter says, are less and less
equipped to deal with patients as humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are generally reassured these days that when they're
going to have surgery, there's an enormous amount of expertise and
they're not going to get hurt,'' Porter said. ``At the same time,
there's also a sense that the machinery is out of control. You're
making advances, and the consequence of that is that things become
too technical, too mysterious, too expensive, too complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   What really bothers Porter is the tendency to regard each new
breakthrough as the ultimate panacea. ``Nowadays, with the genome
project, people might say that all diseases have a genetic basis,''
he explained. ``In 20 years, they'll realize it was a gigantic
mistake, in the way that throughout history almost all obsessional
monocausal theories about how there's one model for disease _
they're all due to the humors or all due to the devil or all due to
bacteria or genetics _ turn out to be wrong because the human body
is so complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter came to his area of interest in a roundabout way. A
clever, bookish boy from a nonacademic family in South London
(``They look at me with total pity,'' he said), he advanced by
brains and ambition to Christ College, Cambridge, where Charles
Darwin once studied. He was taught history by Jack Plum, who he
said ``had a vision of history as being accessible to everybody''
and who infused him with a love of the 18th century. Being in
Darwin's old college sent him off on other paths, through geology
and then medicine and then the role of health and healing in
society.
</P>
<P>
   Porter has a historian's eye for detail. ``If I've made a
contribution to the social history of medicine, it's that I got
interested in terms of trying to see it from the point of view of
sick people,'' he said. This means his book is sprinkled with
engaging anecdotes and amusing, telling tangents taken from the
primary sources into which he loves to sink his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   History, he believes, should be as rooted in detail, and as
messy, as life itself. ``Specificities _ people, facts, statements,
quotations _ these are the sort of nuggets which are real and which
stick in the mind and excite me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a snobbery about theory,'' he went on. ``For example,
the post-modernists believe that somehow it is the academic's duty
to come up with high-level generalizations which have a kind of
intellectual loftiness to them. That's all very well _ I've got no
beef against other people doing that kind of thing _ but it's
always seemed to me that reality, society and my life are complex
and contradictory and full of opposites and that therefore my view
of history will be like that as well. Don't think there's anything
conclusive about history. It is a culmination of lots of different
pulls and drives and tendencies and trends. There's no master
narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   If Porter is fascinated by health, he is equally interested in
death. After all, the better medicine gets, the longer people live,
which raises profound questions about whether it is better to live
a diminished life than not to live at all. After a period in which
death was almost a taboo subject, he said people in the late 20th
century are again obsessed with it. Porter calls it an ``age of
anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure whether it's the fear of oblivion that's causing
the anxiety or the fear of having a bad death,'' Porter said. ``In
the past, there was a theater about dying and you stage-managed
your illness and your death. You prepared to die and had your
speech ready.'' (One of Porter's favorites: the deathbed words of
Oscar Wilde, who reportedly said, ``My wallpaper and I are fighting
a duel to the death. One or the other of us has to go.'')
</P>
<P>
   But people are becoming moved once more, he said, by the thought
of a ``good death.'' Porter certainly intends to have one. Ideally
he would like to die while gardening, and he would like it to be
quick, although not so quick as to deny him the opportunity of
uttering his final bon mot. ``I quite like the idea of being
conscious of dying, but actually in the middle of doing something
at the time, rather than going through a long process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After that he plans to donate his body to science. ``They can do
anything they like with me,'' he said. ``They can even eat me.''

   KUKES, Albania _ Relief officials decried Albanian authorities'
coerced removal of Kosovar refugees from this overburdened city
Friday, but forced relocation may be the only effective tactic to
get them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said please do not use violence,'' said Jacques
Franquin, spokesman here for the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR), acknowledging Friday that Albanian police had
compelled some refugees to leave. The agency, he said, protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been expelled from Kosovo. Once is enough,''
Franquin said.
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up program urging voluntary departures has convinced
some refugees to leave, but not nearly the tens of thousands that
relief agencies say will be necessary to make places for a
potential influx of more escapees from Serbian ethnic cleansing in
the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday an estimated 4,500 refugees departed, according to the
aid agency, which was fewer than were leaving before the campaign
began. Earlier, officials had expressed hopes of relocating perhaps
10,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 200 refugees crossed over the border from Kosovo
Friday, but a torrent of wounded and exhausted people could be
released any time. In a bizarre twist, one group of 60 men arrived
without their wives and children, whom they said had been held back
by Serbian Yugoslav forces. Routinely, men -- especially young men
-- have been kept.
</P>
<P>
   Other pressures to vacate this place include fears that summer
conditions could be catastrophic, or that the Serbs' increasing
cross-border assaults into Albanian territory could target these
camps any day.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bad news is the city's estimate that by high summer
the water supply will stand at only one-third its present level.
</P>
<P>
   And the current spring flush of mountain melt, coupled with
unusually heavy rains, has barely been sufficient to meet the needs
of the additional 120,000 or more refugees piled on top of this
city whose normal population is only 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Local thugs and mafia groups also are a growing problem,
organizing thefts of everything from food stocks to refugees'
property.
</P>
<P>
   But these disadvantages are dwarfed by the refugees' wish to
stay as close as they can to home.
</P>
<P>
   The family of 12-year-old Bujar Mecini lost its single most
valuable possession when its tractor was stolen in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his family is willing to accept the risk and to tolerate
the mud swamp surrounding cold tents that are leaking water, in
order to stay close to relatives still in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to leave,'' the boy said. ``All the men have
stayed there. My father is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   His camp on the outskirts of town was the site of a snafu that
only aggravated the problem.
</P>
<P>
   When the information campaign started Thursday to induce
refugees to leave for less crowded and safer areas, hundreds of
people here packed up and got ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the morning, we thought all these people will go, so we
will go too. We didn't want to stay here alone,'' said Sherife
Xhemajli, a 28-year-old mother here with eight relatives.
</P>
<P>
   However, the promised buses never came. So the families
unpacked, and many said Friday after considering the options that
they would not bother to try it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about how they didn't tell us we would go to better
houses,'' she said. ``We cannot accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials said the city government somehow failed to get
buses out to the camp.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Those who were sitting on buses in the center of town at noon
Friday were predominantly people who had some money or had family
or friends awaiting them elsewhere in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   On one bus, a family was heading to the port of Durres where a
relative from abroad had found them a house. Another family heading
to Rreshen had sent an envoy ahead to rent a house there, where
prices are cheaper. Families on a bus going to Berat had relatives
there.
</P>
<P>
   Few refugee families are so lucky. Most who agree to leave will
be heading to unknown accommodations, perhaps a gymnasium or
crowding into a private home, and that is another reason they are
reluctant to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian police here overcame that reluctance Thursday by
simply demanding that scores of tractors be moved from a parking
area in the center of the city, according to eyewitnesses and aid
officials. The people who have been living in open wagons attached
to the tractors were rounded up and put on buses.
</P>
<P>
   Families were separated because the tractor driver usually
stayed to look after the machine, while his family headed out on a
bus.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the tactics employed with the few tractors still
remaining at the site were more gentle. Police were demanding the
tractors and wagons be moved, but were permitting refugees to park
in another part of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where it is better and where it is worse,'' said
a confused Haxhi Haxhaj, 32, who was preparing to drive his family
of 16 people somewhere the police had yet to specify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they told us to stay in Kukes. Maybe there they will
tell us to leave too and go some place else,'' he said. ``I'm
afraid of this.''

 &HT;    Williams faces cap problems in getting top rookie contract
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although his client slipped to the sixth spot in the first round
of the NFL draft, agent Leland Hardy insisted that Heisman tailback
Ricky Williams should be awarded a contract ``commensurate with the
greatest player ever in the college game.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the New Orleans Saints agree with Hardy, they can't
give Williams the best deal in this year's draft. Because they had
the first one-player draft in NFL history, the Saints were awarded
one of the smallest pools of money for signing rookies. The maximum
aggregate salary-cap room that New Orleans is permitted to use on
its 1999 rookies is $1,749,185, the second-lowest total of any team
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some published reports Thursday erroneously placed the New
Orleans rookie pool at $1.479 million. But not even the additional
$270,000 can help Williams and Hardy in their pursuit of this
year's highest rookie contract. Even if the former Texas star
accepts the lowest possible base salary, in order to maximize his
signing bonus, the most up-front money he can earn is $9.15
million-$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch, the first overall pick, received
a signing bonus of $12.25 million from the Cleveland Browns. Couch
signed a seven-year contract worth $48 million and the deal voids
after three seasons if the quarterbacks achieves predetermined
performance levels.
</P>
<P>
   Saints general manager Bill Kuharich said Thursday that the team
is ``not married'' to the concept of voidable years. But to satisfy
the demands Hardy is certain to make, the Saints probably will
follow the same contract structure the Browns used with Couch.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns, who had 11 selections during the weekend, have the
league's highest rookie-pool figure, $5.165 million.
</P>
<P>
   1999 ROOKIE POOL TOTALS

 &HT;    REPUBLICANS SAY THEY HAVEN'T ABANDONED SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stung by criticism from President Clinton, House
leaders Friday denied reports they have abandoned efforts to reform
Social Security until after the next election.
</P>
<P>
   A story in Friday's (ITALICS) New York Times (END ITALIC)
</P>
<P>
   that said Republican leaders had decided it would be too risky
to adopt fundamental changes in the nation's popular retirement
program was widely repeated by other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton chided Republicans early Friday for being ``either
unable or unwilling to face up to the challenge of strengthening
Social Security. That is not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, Republican leaders declared their intent to
seek a ``bipartisan solution,'' to Social Security's long-term
problems.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert issued a statement calling the
(ITALICS) Times (END ITALICS) story ``not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As one of our four agenda items to secure America's future,
Republicans have strengthening retirement security topping the list
that also includes improving education, fortifying national
security and providing middle-class tax relief,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   The (ITALICS) Times (END ITALICS) said the GOP leadership had
decided not to pursue Social Security reform even though key
Republican lawmakers were on the verge of unveiling a proposal
based on using the projected federal surplus to finance a tax cut.
Individuals could then use the money that otherwise would have been
paid in taxes to invest in individual retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Republican from Fort Lauderdale who
chairs the Ways and Means Social Security subcommittee and has been
drafting the GOP proposal, was quoted as saying he would not push
the bill without support from the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement issued Friday afternoon, Shaw said he and
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, planned to
introduce their legislation soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe that now is the time to seize the
opportunity to
</P>
<P>
   strengthen this vital program,'' Shaw said. ``We have a strong
economy and a budget surplus. If we do nothing, we will end up
face-to-face with a disastrous situation. It is my hope that my
colleagues and our president will join us so that we can work
together for the good of our children and
</P>
<P>
   grandchildren. To succeed, and I believe we will, we must go
forward in a
</P>
<P>
   bipartisan way.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer also issued a statement saying he was ``fully committed
to strengthening and modernizing Social Security for the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless changes are made, the Social Security trust fund reserve
is expected to be depleted in 2034. At that time, Social Security
would be able to pay only 75 percent of monthly benefits.

WOMEN DRIVERS GET A SERIES OF THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ore., Wash.)  (See also CARS-WOMEN-SMITH) 
(mk) 
 By LESLEY HAZLETON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For three days in January, men were shut out of the Road Atlanta
race track in Georgia. All the drivers were women, there to vie for
a place in an automotive league of their own: the new Women's
Global GT Series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lilian Bryner, a former commercial pilot from Switzerland,
arrived with jet lag, having flown in that morning from her home in
Lugano. She had never driven on the 12-turn, 2.54-mile track, but
qualified easily with five fast laps. Then she flew out that
afternoon to Florida, where she finished fourth, in a field of 78,
in the 24 Hours of Daytona. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helen Bashford, who won the Jamieson Award as Britain's fastest
woman driver last year, was hoping the series could help women
crash through the glass ceiling at the highest levels of auto
racing. ``Right now, you have to be three times better than Michael
Schumacher,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Racers like Bryner and Bashford came from three continents, 11
countries, nearly every state and just about every form of auto
racing, from Formula One to tiny karts. But not every top woman
racer turned up. The series' executive director, Lyn St. James, got
faxes and e-mail messages from some of them accusing her of
organizing a powder-puff derby, of running nothing more than a
showcase, even of bringing racing down to the level of mud
wrestling by making a display of women racing women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were quite volatile,'' she said, then grinned and added,
``but I guess I was pretty volatile at first, too.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Don Panoz, the promoter who owns Road Atlanta, first
approached her with the idea of a women's series, she turned him
down. ``I said: `This is one of the few sports where women can
compete equally with men. The car doesn't know the gender of the
person behind the wheel. So why would we want to separate
ourselves? We're already there.''' She paused, then added, ``We may
be invisible, but we are there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That invisibility is precisely what prompted her to reconsider
Panoz's offer. ``This series is a way of putting women on the
map,'' she said. ``A showcase? Certainly. A showcase can launch
careers, and that's what this is all about.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked why some women would turn down the opportunity, St. James
picked her words carefully. ``Their credibility is established
because of their singularity. The tendency is to think it's somehow
OK to lose if you're the only woman. But it's never OK. `You did
well for a woman' is not acceptable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At age 54, Divina Galica, a four-time Olympic skier who now
teaches competitive driving at the Skip Barber Racing School, was
one of the oldest women to qualify. ``When I started 25 years ago,
there were only three or four women who could drive as fast as I
could,'' she said. ``Now half of them here have the potential to
beat me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of those who might beat her in the future is Jenny Hohfelt,
a 17-year-old kart champion who had never shifted a gear until four
weeks before qualifying. Jockey-sized and soft-spoken, she seemed
unfazed by the prospect of competing against the world's best women
drivers. ``There's a lot of really tough drivers here,'' she said
calmly. ``In fact, some of them have been racing longer than I've
been living.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not a single woman at Road Atlanta even mentioned the photogenic
potential of a winner's taking off her helmet and shaking loose a
cascade of hair. They left that to the men, who were where the
women usually are _ behind the fences, stopwatches and press
releases in hand, nervously watching as wives, girlfriends,
daughters _ and in one case, mother _ competed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bashford's husband accepted his role as the cheering section
with delight. ``I love seeing the men's faces when she gets out of
the car after a race and they realize they've just lost to a
woman,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But potential sponsors seem less enthused. Although auto racing
is America's biggest spectator sport, and though the Women's Global
GT Series would seem as good a match for chain stores, soft-drink
companies and gasoline brands as any other series, no major sponsor
had emerged by the time the first race was run.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz had invested $3 million in building the 400-horsepower GT
cars for the series, but competitors still had to find their own
sponsors or cover their costs, including insurance and a $3,000
entrance fee for each of the seven races in the women's series. And
no prize money had been lined up.
</P>
<P>
   So although many of the world's fastest women drivers had
qualified for the series, finances kept most of them away on the
inaugural day. Most of those on the starting grid were relative
unknowns. Yet the race provided a spectacularly close-fought battle
among two unexpected contenders and one seasoned racer: Audrey
Zavodsky, a registered nurse and teacher from Michigan; Kiki
Wolfkill, a Microsoft art designer from Seattle who specializes in
computer racing games, and Cindi Lux of Oregon, who started as the
favorite after posting the fastest qualifying times. Lux finished
third behind Zavodsky, in first, and Wolfkill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will the series propel Zavodsky's and Wolfkill's careers and
make them stars, as St. James intends? Or will the lack of
financing persist? Lux is sure which way it will go. ``You'll
see,'' she said. ``Now that we have this series, a lot of men are
going to want to come out and play on the track with us as much as
we want to play with them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, that group of men will include some
sponsors. &QL;

CONFESSIONS OF AN OVERAGE `STAR WARS' CONSCRIPT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Force wasn't with me, and my little niece and nephew didn't
like it. I am, after all, their epic-making uncle, the one who
orchestrates sea battles in the bathtub, death scenes in the
elevator and costume dramas on demand.
</P>
<P>
   But when ``Star Wars'' became part of their world view (their
parents bought the trilogy on video last year) they started
spinning into a Luke- and Leia-centric universe without me.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen only the very first episode 20 years ago, when I was
a college freshman, remembered little about it and didn't even know
what it meant to be a Jedi. I lived in darkness. And with ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' coming at us with meteoric
force, I decided that as a good uncle (italics)and(end italics) a
good American, I'd better get up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday last month, with Madeleine, almost 7, and Ian, 4, as
my pilots, I began my voyage into the well-known unknown by
slipping the first episode (confoundingly called Episode IV) into
the VCR. Immediately, I was in trouble. Did I actually have to
understand what all those words scrolling into the cosmos about
rebel forces and evil empires meant?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't want the children to know I was confused, but
eventually, I had to pause the tape and ask Madeleine what was
going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to find Princess Leia to get the plans for the
Death Star,'' she said. She also let me know with some impatience
that the bad guys were wearing black (italics)and(end italics)
white and that R2-D2 and C-3PO were in the escape pod heading off
into space.
</P>
<P>
   Was it embarrassing to have to ask a first grader to explain all
this to me? Sure it was. But it was also necessary. Like getting to
know yourself through therapy, ``Star Wars'' is a commitment, with
much to learn before it all comes clear.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if I had been a child when ``Star Wars'' hit, I
wouldn't have to scramble to catch up. Now, as I watch the tidal
wave of hoopla rising before the ``The Phantom Menace'' opens on
May 21, with adults lining up just to see a preview in theaters, I
realize that I missed the original ground swell by about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X may have missed Woodstock and Watergate. It may
have inherited civil rights and feminism without participating in
any revolutions. But as adolescents, its members were poised to be
yanked into the orbit of ``Star Wars'' and the relentless
merchandising it inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as I open myself up to all of it today, I can't help
wondering why George Lucas is deemed the most moral of pop
mythologists when he's marketing so much stuff.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Monday morning at FAO Schwarz in New York City, and a
robotic voice on the elevator was announcing: ``I am Go-2-Floor-2!
I am happy that your journey has brought you to our galaxy of
toys!'' I was happy, too, at first, just to see the happy look on
little Ian's face. Then I started being overwhelmed by what I
didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Yoda, Uncle Bobby,'' Ian said of an E.T.-like
character I did not recognize. ``There's Chewie and the Millennium
Falcon.'' In this confusing landfill of expensive merchandise, I
was relieved to see a light saber for $6 and suggested we buy two.
That was fine with Ian until he noticed one for $24.99. ``I want
this one,'' he said. ``Please.''
</P>
<P>
   I started to sweat. I didn't have that much money to drop on a
light saber. Before the jaws of mercantilism could close around us,
I bought the cheaper ones and whisked Ian out of the store. It was
only a taste of the outsize world of ``Star Wars'' merchandising,
but it was enough.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks that followed were one big ``Phantom Menace''
preparation, and far more intensive than my scrambling to catch up
before any Oscars night. I screened ``The Return of the Jedi'' and
``The Empire Strikes Back.''
</P>
<P>
   I bought fan magazines. I studied a behind-the-scenes CD-ROM and
scanned spinoff novels, Joseph Campbell's musings on heroes and
``The Uses of Enchantment'' by Bruno Bettleheim, which analyzes how
myths affect young people.
</P>
<P>
   As I waged light-saber battles with the children, my commands
grew more and more ``Star Wars''-specific. Finally, I was ready to
take their imaginations forward. One evening, after getting them
dressed up Luke and Leia-style (oversize white T-shirts, belt for
him and earmuffs for her), I sat them down in front of the
television.
</P>
<P>
   I dimmed the lights, put a tape of the ``Phantom Menace''
preview into the VCR (by now the Force was with me, and the
publicity office of Lucas Films sent it), and to approximate THX
sound, I turned the volume up way too high. Then, feeling a tiny
bit of the thrill that Lucas himself must feel, I hit the play
button.
</P>
<P>
   Ian jumped around, waving his light saber. Madeleine, although
riveted by the possibility of a whole new cosmos of unknown
characters, digitized creatures and wacky hairdos, held her ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's this loud in the theater, I'll have to wait for it to
come out on video,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as she said that, I remembered holding my own ears in
the movie theater in 1977, when ``Star Wars'' seemed to me like
nothing more than an overblown pop phenomenon with shag haircuts.
Back then, I could still dismiss it on principle just for being so
big.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like so many other adults who have dumbed down their taste
to go along with whatever the most popular phenomenon of the moment
happens to be, I'm a lot more willing to love what I'm supposed to
love.
</P>
<P>
   Even when I end up loving too much.
</P>
<P>
   At my most recent baby-sitting stint, for insance, the
encyclopedic trivia collection on CD-ROM that I bought, ``Star
Wars: Behind the Magic,'' didn't interest Madeleine and Ian at all.
``What kind of children would like this?'' she asked. ``Very old
children,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did they care much about the superslick fan magazine for
kids I tried reading to them instead of bedtime stories. Quite
simply, it was too much information. Unlike so many obsessed
adults, who can't take their myths or actors at face value, they
just wanted the story, not the making of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in these final days before the new movie arrives in
theaters and gives us something more important to discuss than the
war in Kosovo, I've been feeling a little pushy in my anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, when I was reading yet another ``Star Wars''
fan magazine to the children before bed, they didn't even want to
hear an exclusive profile of Jake Lloyd, the adorable 9-year-old
star of the new episode, who plays Darth Vader as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants people to think of him as a regular kid, not an
actor,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, Uncle Bobby, no problem,'' Madeleine said as I tucked
her in. ``Now, good night already.''

DUPLICATED FILE NAMES COULD BE AT ROOT OF PROBLEMS WITH WORD 97

<P>
   Q: I have repeated problems with Microsoft Word 97 crashing on
me (illegal operation, page fault, etc.) when I try to print or
change some of the formatting on a page. I've uninstalled it,
reinstalled it, patched it, you name it. What can be causing this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Helping out a friend who was having similar problems, I
discovered something about how Windows stores its font files that
may be at the root of your woes.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it's possible to store two files with the same name
in the windows/font folder if one of the files is named using all
lower-case letters and the other is in all upper case.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you have a file called courier.ttf, you also may
have a file called COURIER.ttf. In most cases, this duplication
apparently causes no problems.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until Word goes to use one of these fonts, either for
formatting or printing. Essentially, it gets confused and crashes.
</P>
<P>
   In my friend's case, the duplicated font was a crucial one:
Times Roman, the default typeface for Word. Once one of the
times.ttf files was deleted, his problems disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Before you go deleting any fonts, though, choose the Details
view and make sure the two files have the same file sizes and
dates. Rather than deleting one, move it into a temporary folder.
If you experience no new problems as a result, go ahead and delete
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After reading your column on the upgrading to Internet
Explorer 5.0, I decided to do it. Although it took all night, it
was successful. However, I have this problem. I have a Compaq
Presario with the easy access buttons on the keyboard to open
e-mail or access the Internet. Now, when I use these buttons, a
window comes up for ``dial up connection'' and I have to use the
mouse pointer to connect. This is an extra step that defeats my
easy access feature. Is there a way I can eliminate this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although this may be a problem specific to Compaq's setup _
and thus you might want to talk to the company's technical support
_ there is a generic fix you can try.
</P>
<P>
   You need to tell Internet Explorer 5's new connection-management
feature that you want to make an instant dialup connection when
your Internet software launches. The connection manager is handy
because it lets you set up multiple dialup accounts, each with its
own settings. But because the settings can be customized, it turns
off auto-dialup by default.
</P>
<P>
   Right-click on the Internet Explorer icon on the desktop, choose
Internet Options, then Connections. Make sure ``Always dial my
default connection'' is checked.
</P>
<P>
   When the dialup box next appears, make sure your password is in
place and both Save Password and Connect Automatically are checked.
From now on, your connection should be made without help.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a question on any alternates for the touch pad on my
laptop. I have tried to get used to the thing for hours, but
perhaps my fingers are too big or insensitive ... In any case, I
just can't seem to manage it and usually take a mouse along with me
on business trips and use my right leg for a pad! There must be a
better way. Other than the mini-ball option in the keyboard, do you
know of a small mouse or other device that would be a bit more
practical on the road than the conventional mouse?
</P>
<P>
   A: Logitech makes a mouse specifically designed for notebook
usage. It's slightly smaller than a regular mouse, so it will take
up less space _ very important on airplane meal trays _ and it has
a very short cord. That's a particularly thoughtful feature,
because the worst part of using a full-sized mouse in a cramped
area is always having to push the cord out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Wheel Mouse for Notebooks, as it's called, sells for about
$40.

TV CYCLE SHOULDN'T INVOLVE EXERCISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, April 26)  
(DW) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest assault on the great national pastime of TV-watching
comes from one David Wells, an obesity researcher from New York who
has invented a torture device called the TV Cycle.
</P>
<P>
   When I think of the TV Cycle, I think of something that begins
at 8 a.m. with ``Dr. Katz,'' followed by the ``Daily Show.'' Then
it's time for a short nap in order to build up strength for reruns
of the ``Andy Griffith Show,'' which begins at 11 a.m. An hour of
Aunt Bea can put you in the mood for a little violence, which is
why I usually tune in ``Masters of War'' at noon on the History
Channel, or else live U.S. Senate coverage on CSPAN2.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 2 p.m., I have to choose between a ``Saturday Night
Live'' rerun, ``Casper the Friendly Ghost,'' ``Traditional
Medicines of Asia'' or the ``Jerry Springer'' show. (Is this a
great country, or what?)
</P>
<P>
   All that decision-making can be exhausting, which is why I
usually take another nap until ``Bill Nye the Science Guy'' comes
on at 4 p.m. (Did you know inertia is a property of matter? I
thought it was just a property of newspaper columnists.) In the 5-6
p.m. time slot, it's a choice between the news and the ``Match
Game.'' (I'll take Vicki Lawrence over Bob Hite any day.) Then it's
``Simpsons,'' ``Frazier,'' maybe a ``Seinfeld'' rerun, a ball game,
a little ``Sports Center'' and then wearily, happily, to bed to
dream of the morning and the start of another TV Cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But David Wells' TV Cycle is something entirely, perversely
different. He has invented a television that is connected to a
stationary bicycle. The television only works if you are pedaling
the bike. He found (big surprise) that people watch less television
this way, something that he and a lot of other members of the
Health Police view as a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking behind the TV Cycle is that television is evil
because it cuts into the time that we would otherwise spend
exercising, or, to put it another way, if it weren't for ``Funniest
Home Videos,'' we'd all be outside at this moment chopping wood or
limbering up for the next marathon.
</P>
<P>
   While it is probably true that most people who watch 18 hours of
television a day are not in peak physical condition, it is quite
possible that they would still find a way to avoid exercising even
if their television was taken away or, worse, hooked up to a
stationary bike. Staring at a blank wall or weeping softly to
oneself while rocking gently back and forth in the corner of a dark
room are (un)activities that spring immediately to mind.
</P>
<P>
   For people who do not like to exercise, TV-watching is a
wonderful alternative because it does not require a great deal of
strength or agility unless, of course, you drop the remote control
behind the couch. Very few people have accidentally sliced off a
finger or hand while watching ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' which is
more than you can say about people who spend their leisure time
chopping wood.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some validity to the argument that senior
citizens should be made to prove that they can see before their
driver's license is renewed, there is no reason why a person should
be required to have the cardio-vascular fitness of Wayne Gretzky in
order to watch reruns of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   One might even argue that excessive physical fitness would be
detrimental to prolonged TV-viewing. Hard, angular bodies don't fit
well with the soft contours of an overstuffed chair, plus the
clear-headedness that exercise promotes often runs counter to the
themes of such shows as ``Baywatch'' or ``Beverly Hills, 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking for new ways to punish gentle, unassuming,
avocado-shaped TV-viewers, it would be nice, for a change, if
scientists picked on fitness nuts, a group of people who are far,
far more annoying than folks who sit alone in a dark,
air-conditioned room watching ``Xena: Warrior Princess'' or reruns
of ``Love Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps invent some sort of contraption where they can't
exercise unless they're watching ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' or ``The
Newlywed Game.''
</P>
<P>
   See how they like that.

SHERIFF GIVES BACK CONFISCATED MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE GENIELLA   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UKIAH, Calif. _ Grasping a grocery bag of home-grown marijuana
worth about $2,000 that was given back to him by local authorities,
Christopher Brown on Thursday triumphantly walked out of the
Mendocino County sheriff's office to make medical marijuana
history.
</P>
<P>
   Brown became the first person in the United States to legally
retrieve a personal stash of pot seized by law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Local drug agents confiscated the half-pound of marijuana during
a 1997 raid on Brown's former residence in Willits and refused to
return it even after charges were dropped against him. Brown took
his case to the California Supreme Court, which in November upheld
a Mendocino County Superior Court judge's order that the marijuana
be returned to Brown. The high court agreed that Brown's marijuana
use met provisions of voter-approved Proposition 215, which
legalized pot use for medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good. I feel I've stood up for a lot of people who
need marijuana for medical reasons,'' said Brown, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he smokes up to two marijuana cigarettes a day to
alleviate chronic pain from injuries suffered in a motorcycle
accident about 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview Thursday afternoon outside the sheriff's
office, Brown said he was eager to roll a joint and smoke it to see
if the three-year-old pot still could provide the relief he seeks.
</P>
<P>
   But, gesturing toward the sheriff's office, Brown said, ``I
don't think I'll do it right here. I still get real nervous around
cops.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's case is being touted as a milestone in the continuing
debate over implementing Proposition 215.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time a person has walked out of a police
station with marijuana legally in their hands,'' said Hannah
Nelson, a Redway attorney who represented Brown.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Nelson waged a legal battle on Brown's behalf. At
first local authorities, and later state officials, refused to give
Brown his pot back after felony marijuana cultivation and
possession charges were dismissed against him and his late wife.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers unsuccessfully argued that if law enforcement
officers returned Brown's home-grown marijuana they would be acting
as ``drug pushers.''
</P>
<P>
   The original order issued in August 1997 by Mendocino County
Superior Court Judge Joseph Orr ``commands law enforcement to
commit a federal crime,'' state attorneys argued to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court unanimously rejected the law-enforcement
appeal and ordered that the pot be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said law enforcement authorities scoffed when she first
made her request on Brown's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't imagine having to return the marijuana, even
though charges against my client had been dropped. But the fact is
that the marijuana was being used legally and he has a right to
it,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and his late wife, Dorlissa Perrine, were arrested in 1997
at their Willits home and accused of cultivating marijuana for sale
after sheriff's deputies responded to a domestic dispute call and
saw some pot seedlings, along with buds and leaves, in their home.
Deputies notified the county Narcotics Task Force, which obtained a
search warrant and seized the pot after arresting Brown and his
wife at their home.
</P>
<P>
   But felony criminal cultivation and possession charges were
dismissed by Orr when the couple produced doctors' statements
contending that they each needed pot to ease chronic pain. Perrine
suffered from a degenerative tissue disease. Brown said his chronic
pain is eased by smoking marijuana regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rely on pot to help me get through the day,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown described himself Thursday as an honor student at Cabrillo
College in Santa Cruz, where he's studying physics. He plans to
transfer to the University of California, Santa Cruz, to get his
degree, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite critics' claims that persistent marijuana use dulls
minds and emotions, Brown said, he is succeeding academically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not function without marijuana. It's as simple as
that,'' he said.

   Gift-Giving Retirees Angry at J.P. Morgan &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., the banking giant, were
concerned enough about its plans to stop matching its retirees'
charitable contributions to raise the issue at the bank's annual
meeting earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's chief executive, Douglas A. Warner III, speaking the
same day that the bank said first-quarter profits had surged 64
percent, told questioners that the decision was part of
cost-cutting. Morgan had been a weak financial performer and was
criticized by Wall Street analysts as having bloated expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said it gave $18 million to charities last year and would
continue to match its employees' gifts. Most of its competitors do
not match retiree gifts, it added.
</P>
<P>
   But some Morgan retirees are still perturbed. ``I wonder what
the real expense benefit of this is when there's a tax benefit to
charitable contributions,'' said C. Helen Lovell, a retiree who
once was a vice president in the private banking unit.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote in a letter to The New York Times that she was
``shocked, angry and embarrassed to think that a firm of Morgan's
reputation would solve its problem of mismanagement by terminating
aid to the poor, handicapped and neglected members of our society,
our educational institutions, hospitals and other health care
providers.''

   Au Pair, the Luxury Model
</P>
<P>
   Au Pair in America, which operates in more than 35 states, is
hoping to satisfy parents' needs and attract better-qualified young
women from overseas to work in American households with a program
called Au Pair Extraordinaire. Participants are at least 20 years
old, compared with the usual minimum of 18, and have studied child
care or worked full-time in the field for two years.
</P>
<P>
   For a family hiring an Extraordinaire au pair, the annual cost
before travel expenses would be about $20,800, instead of $17,750
for a regular au pair. The totals include weekly stipends of $300
and $240, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gertz, the executive vice president of the American
Institute for Foreign Study, which runs Au Pair in America,
attributes a short supply of au pairs in part to the publicity
about Louise Woodward, the British au pair who was convicted of
manslaughter in 1997 in the death of her charge, Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Gertz said, ``parents have become much more interested in
screening and training.''

   ATT _ AT&AMP;T Corp. dragged U.S. stocks lower after its $62.5
billion bid for MediaOne Corp. sparked concern its acquisitions
will hurt earnings. ``It looks like it's a lot to digest in one go
for AT&AMP;T,'' said Neil Smeaton, who helps manage $1.4 billion in
U.S. stocks at Scottish Equitable Asset Management. MediaOne's
stock, however, was up sharply, as investors bet on a bidding war
for the cable TV operator. (Kanell/Haddad, Atlanta

   COKE-BIAS _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co., which has plenty of
experience dealing with glass bottles, must now contend with
allegations of ``glass ceilings'' and ``glass walls.'' The
Atlanta-based beverage company has been hit with a federal
discrimination lawsuit that accuses it of fosterting inequality
against black employees in pay, promotions, performance evaluations
and terminations. The lead plaintiffs' attorney, Cyrus Mehri of
Washington, handled the discrimination case against Texaco, which
resulted in the largest race discrimination settlement in history.

 LOUISE SMITH: NEVER ONE OF THE GOOD OL' BOYS

 By LESLEY HAZLETON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best-known women in car racing are probably Lyn St. James,
Janet Guthrie and Shirley Muldowney, but on Thursday it was Louise
Smith who became the first woman inducted into the International
Motorsports Hall of Fame at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 82, was once known as the queen of the Darlington
Speedway. From 1945 through the mid-'50s she was a big attraction
at races up and down the East Coast. The only woman on the circuit,
she chalked up 38 victories _ and almost as many crashes _ in the
rough-and-tumble world of stock-car racing, long before the
corporate sponsorships and television deals of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks she drove on were dirt or sand. The cars were
souped-up castoffs rescued from her husband's junkyard. And a tire
iron came in handy to deal with the fights that often broke out at
the end of races.
</P>
<P>
   How does she feel about the honor? ``It's about time,'' she said
in a telephone interview from her home in Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty rough,'' she recalled. ``But it's still rough
for women. The men don't want women out there. They just will not
give you credit.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR drivers can now earn more than $1 million a race; the
most Smith ever won was $750. ``I thought I was in heaven,'' she
said. ``Usually they'd give me $100 or $150 to turn up. And if I
wrecked the car, I'd be lucky if I could borrow enough money to get
home, 'cause I couldn't get one dime's worth of insurance.'' &QR;

 &HT;    INSIDE THE NATO BUBBLE, A WORLD WITHIN A CITY
 &HT;    With NATO-SUMMIT.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After shopping for souvenirs at Planet Hollywood,
three teen-aged girls peered over the barricades along a deserted
Pennsylvania Avenue on Friday and wondered how they would rejoin
their classmates on the sophomore field trip from Tulpehockon High
School in Bethel, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get anywhere,'' moaned Lora Seiverling. ``Everything
is blocked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was as if a giant bubble had been dropped over
several blocks in the heart of the nation's capital for the
three-day 50th Anniversary NATO Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the bubble, city life went on at a lazy, weekend-like
pace. Amid fears of traffic gridlock resulting from closed streets,
thousands of federal employees were given the day off from work,
and others just stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot quieter than I would have expected on a Friday,''
marveled Greg Baker, shepherding Wisconsin safety patrol members
along an empty sidewalk beside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the NATO bubble, though, a bustling, surreal community
had sprung up. The citizens all wore plastic photo ID cards around
their necks testifying to their role: Host Committee. Secret
Service. Vendor. Print Journalist.
</P>
<P>
   The bubble is secure. Armed guards scanned the ID cards at
checkpoints along the perimeter as visitors passed through metal
detectors. Sharpshooters with rifles stood on the roofs of
buildings and scanned everything through binoculars. Dogs sniffed
purses and briefcases for bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Two of America's most famous thoroughfares _ Pennsylvania and
Constitution Avenues _ run through the NATO bubble. These wide,
usually crowded avenues were strangely vacant on Friday, save for
the occasional motorcade carrying a leader of one of the 19 NATO
nations to a session at the Andrew Mellon Auditorium. Most other
traffic consisted of organizers in green golf carts or District
police officers wearing yellow shirts and black shorts and riding
bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   The limousines cruised down spiffy streets, both inside the
bubble and leading to it. The District of Columbia government
borrowed street-sweeping machines from Baltimore and Philadelphia
and drafted jail inmates to pick up litter. Tunnels were
steam-cleaned and graffiti scrubbed off. Homeless people were moved
from benches. Stylish tripods made from U.S., D.C. and NATO flags
stand at 260 spots along the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the official meetings of the NATO leaders are taking
place in the Mellon Auditorium, where the original treaty creating
the alliance was signed half a century ago. But the adjacent Ronald
Reagan Building is headquarters for the 1,700 dignitaries visiting
from 42 countries and the 3,400 representatives of the world's news
media.
</P>
<P>
   In the Reagan Building, conversations overlaps in countless
languages, but English blares forth from the NATO-TV feeds shown
nonstop on countless monitors. Hundreds of correspondents who have
traveled the globe to reach this historic event find themselves
hunched over laptop computers in a filing center, chronicling what
they see on the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the media action takes place on a plush blue ``NATO 50
Summit'' carpet that muffles the sounds of thousands of footsteps.
TV crews film from the corners of the carpet, and young women rush
across it to powder the faces of perspiring correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   The bubble has its own bazaar. At a souvenir stand, a tan NATO
Summit jacket sells for $95, a blue denim NATO Summit shirt costs
$45 and a NATO Summit key chain goes for $8. At the nearby jewelry
booth, your choice of a gold-plated NATO cuff links or a
gold-plated NATO pin is $50 _ with part of the proceeds going to
the children of Kosovo, the vendor promises. The U.S. Postal
Service is selling T-shirts, neckties and stamps behind a sign that
says, ``Get your special envelope commemorating the 50th
anniversary of the NATO summit here!''
</P>
<P>
   The bubble has its own ``Science of NATO'' exhibit. Nearby,
private firms display cellular telephones _ nearly as prevalent as
the necklace ID's _ and futuristic high-tech gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the bubble, though, were scenes reminiscent of the '60s.
Sarah Stone was lounging on the grass listening to some aging baby
boomers _ older then her parents _ sing protest songs and speak
against NATO's war on Yugoslavia. An eighth-grader from Saint Mark
Lutheran School in Houston, she noted not only history repeating,
but also fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell bottoms, long hair, hippie style,'' she said, noting the
clothes of young people at the ``Citizens' Summit to De-Nuke NATO''
two blocks away from the official ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah shared the sentiment as well as the garb.
</P>
<P>
   Peace would prevail and the national debt would be reduced ``if
we would just leave other countries alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There were only about 100 protesters, and many didn't recall the
original words to the anti-Vietnam War anthem by Country Joe
McDonald and the Fish, the ``Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag.'' But
they sang gamely to the new verses: ``And it's one, two, three,
what are we fighting for? Don't ask me, I don't really know. Next
stop is Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So sell your mutual fund and pick up a gun, you're gonna have
a whole lot of fun,'' they sang.
</P>
<P>
   But they were outside the bubble, too far away for anyone inside
to hear.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If it is true that history repeats itself, the spirit of
junk-bond king Michael Milken had to be present when
representatives from several of Wall Street's most influential
leveraged-buyout firms and a gaggle of European executives gathered
at the opulent Claridge's hotel in London last November for two
days of schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   The group had been invited by Chase Manhattan Bank to discuss
investments in Europe as large corporations restructure there. And
the guests _ feted as architects of ``the new Europe'' _ were
denied no luxury.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wallace Collection, a museum in London's West End, and
later at Claridge's, Europe's elite executives supped and sipped
tea alongside emissaries from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.; the
Blackstone Group; Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, and other well-known
American buyout firms.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the veneer of British gentility, the gathering had
all the subtlety of Milken's now-famous Predators' Balls, the
glitzy soirees where vulture investors prowled for takeover prey
during the last merger craze. And that similarity was not lost on
James Bainbridge Lee Jr., the group head of Chase's global
investment banking department, who issued the invitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling in Europe is these people are the `Barbarians at
the Gate,''' he said, echoing the title of the book that chronicled
Kohlberg Kravis's 1988 takeover of RJR Nabisco. ``That was one of
the big myths I wanted to pop. Europeans think they are corporate
raiders. They were surprised to find out that some of them were
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbarians or not, American buyout firms have been flocking to
Europe in recent months, chasing the wave of corporate divestitures
swelling as bloated companies begin to streamline. Already, several
of the best-known buyout firms _ so called because they buy
troubled companies with the hope of selling them later for a profit
_ have opened their doors: Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice is planning an
office in Germany; both Kohlberg, Kravis and Hicks, Muse have set
up shop in London.
</P>
<P>
   And with American firms having more than $90 billion in their
coffers _ 25 percent of that intended for Europe alone _ more are
sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more than biscuits and a cup of Earl Grey to
soften their aggressive image. For all the talk of globalization,
executives at buyout firms are learning just how ``foreign''
foreign countries can be. And if recent experiences are any
indication, buyout firms are in for some tumultuous times.
</P>
<P>
   Some American firms have offended potential partners by backing
out of deals. Simple misunderstandings are turning into deal
killers. And even when a buyout firm does find a company to take
over, business practices taken for granted in the United States _
like dismissing employees or otherwise cutting costs sharply _ are
frowned upon or illegal in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is the degree of brashness coming from the United
States is not appreciated,'' said Michael Stevens, head of
leveraged buyout services in Britain for KPMG Corporate Finance, a
division of the accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Franci J. Blassberg, a lawyer for Debevoise &AMP; Plimpton in New
York, recently told a group of lawyers and academics about one
incident in which a client was accused of pirating information
after lawyers and accountants conducted a routine examination of a
German business. ``The German seller misunderstood the process and
concluded that our client's real motive was to obtain competitively
sensitive information,'' Ms. Blassberg said. As a result, the
seller terminated negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is still lacking, too, in some of the deal-making tools
necessary for complex transactions. Junk bonds are an accepted
American form of financing, but in Europe, demand for them is
relatively small. Stock option programs were illegal in Germany
until 1998 and are still rare. And the market for initial public
offerings in Europe is immature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know the big names have made a lot of fuss about
setting up their operations,'' said Raymond Svider, a partner at BC
Partners, a buyout firm with offices in London, Paris, Hamburg and
Milan that is expected to compete with the newer entrants. ``But
their experience is limited. And only time will tell if they will
be successful.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A leveraged buyout fund is a pool of money run by a buyout firm
with assets culled from insurance companies, banks, pension plans
and other institutional investors. The funds range in size from
$100 million to $6 billion and are used to buy stakes in private
and publicly traded companies. A fund's executives use its capital
and borrow money _ hence the term ``leverage'' _ to buy two or
three companies a year.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to cut costs, increase profits and then sell out. In
the United States, that was easier in the 1980s, when corporations
weren't yet so attentive to shareholder value. Companies like RJR
Nabisco Holdings, Trans World Airlines and Safeway were taken over
in an orgy of financial wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people lost jobs even as companies gained new
strength, and legendary corporate raiders and financiers like
Milken, Henry Kravis and T. Boone Pickens were either demonized or
lionized, depending on the observer's politics or personal stake in
the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But years of corporate downsizing and other measures have made
it harder today to squeeze new savings out of already-lean American
companies. That is one of the main reasons that buyout firms are
turning their attention across the Atlantic: European companies
resemble the fat American conglomerates of the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they are expected to sell assets over the next few
years to focus on core businesses. And family-owned concerns with
no successors are likely to put their businesses on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is an important marketplace,'' said John Muse, chief
operating officer of the Dallas-based Hicks, Muse, who recently
moved to London to pursue deal-making there. ``From our point of
view, you can create pan-European strategies in sectors with more
ease. I personally think the pie is going to get so big there is
going to be a lot for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Europe isn't anything like the open field the United States
was a decade ago. British firms like Doughty Hanson &AMP; Co., Cinven
Ltd. and Electra Investment Trust (which itself recently rejected a
takeover bid) already have longstanding corporate friendships. And
they are better versed in Continental ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a softer style,'' Muse acknowledged. ``People want to get
to know you better.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After 21 years in business, and investments in 30 companies,
executives at Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice might be expected to have
seen everything. And last year, it seemed that they anticipated
almost every obstacle when they made their first European
investment, buying a majority stake in Thyssen Schulte Bautechnik,
a division of Germany's Thyssen AG that sells heating equipment and
bathroom supplies.
</P>
<P>
   First, they offered equity stakes to executives as an incentive
to improve profits. Next, they agreed to lay off workers over the
course of a year instead of all at once and to pay handsomely _
almost a year's salary _ those who would lose their jobs. Finally,
some employees received bonuses despite failing to reach initial
performance targets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nothing prepared the Clayton team for the reception they
received at a regional sales meeting last fall. Forty sales
managers had gathered at Thyssen headquarters to discuss 1999
performance goals. When one was asked to discuss his projections,
he warned that a downturn in sales would make it impossible for him
to meet his quota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't matter, though,'' Clayton executives remember him
saying. ``My department has been profitable the last two years. We
don't need to be profitable the next two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clayton team was aghast. ``All the Americans thought, `We
can't let this go on,''' said Charles Ames, a Clayton partner who
is serving as chairman of Thyssen Schulte's supervisory board.
``This would never happen in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But the manager's comments might have been more bluster than
truth. ``The next morning the guy went into his boss's office and
said he rechecked his numbers and agreed he could indeed increase
profitability,'' Ames said. ``What I think he was doing was playing
a game to see how we'd react.''
</P>
<P>
   Ames's experience is not atypical. Strict performance
requirements are unfamiliar terrain for many European managers.
Most corporations have their roots in strong family ownership, and
corporate executives often view themselves as stewards of their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Executives ``kind of know the factory has too many people, but
you don't want to lay people off because you will be the most
unpopular guy in town,'' said one financial investor with
experience buying companies in Germany. ``You still have to go to
restaurants and see people's kids at school. You will be ostracized
socially, with no upside.''
</P>
<P>
   In the American Rust Belt of the 1980s, buyout firms were often
able to bulldoze resistance to layoffs. But in Europe today,
political realities and social customs require the firms to be more
sensitive to public perceptions _ or risk being snubbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You basically have to change from being transaction-oriented
to being relationship-oriented,'' said Muneer Satter, a Goldman
Sachs partner who was co-head of private investing in Germany for
six years.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the cool calculus of deal-making that comes naturally
to Americans, as was apparent in several episodes last year.
</P>
<P>
   In October, for example, Kohlberg Kravis scuttled a potential
$1.79 billion offer to buy the Herberts paint division of Hoechst,
the German conglomerate. And in November, Hicks, Muse backed out of
an agreement to buy the American reference and business publishing
divisions of Simon &AMP; Schuster from Pearson, the British media
company, for $860 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst had favored a transaction with Kohlberg Kravis because
layoffs would be a less important issue with a sale to a buyout
firm than with one to a competitor, people close to the
negotiations said. But Hoechst's announcement in August was
premature; Kohlberg had agreed only in principle, subject to
substantial details being worked out later.
</P>
<P>
   When world markets tumbled late that month, stock prices of
comparable companies fell and high-yield financing dried up.
Kohlberg would have had to borrow more money than expected at
higher rates or put up more of its own capital to get a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Americans tried to trim the price by about 15
percent, the people close to the deal said. Hoechst balked, and
within days signed an agreement to sell Herberts to the DuPont Co.
for a higher price _ $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Hoechst and executives at Kohlberg Kravis
would not comment for this article. But industry specialists in
Europe say such high-profile backtracking has damaged Americans'
reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a thought that they were pushing too hard,'' said
Stevens at KPMG. ``There was a general feeling that maybe Hoechst
got one over on Henry Kravis when it walked away,'' he added,
referring to the buyout firm's best-known partner.
</P>
<P>
   While Kohlberg faced snickers from the business community,
Hicks, Muse was castigated in the British press. Muse said his firm
backed out of the Simon &AMP; Schuster deal after closer review
prompted it to reduce estimates of the reference and publishing
units' earnings on six separate occasions. Pearson was willing to
renegotiate, he said, but the companies could not agree on price,
and the agreement was terminated.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers, though, speculated that Hicks, Muse was
unable to get financing. Muse denied that, but an impression had
already been made. ``Hicks is guilty of thorough bad faith in this
affair,'' Neil Bennett, a columnist for The Sunday Telegraph of
London, wrote last November. ``After its recent performance,
however, is this really the sort of firm that Europe's investment
banks and companies want to do business with?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not, according to a lawsuit filed by Pearson last
month in New York State Supreme Court. Pearson accused Hicks, Muse
of breach of contract, saying that its backing away from the
publishing deal was part of a pattern of bargaining in bad faith.
The suit cites the termination of Hicks's offer last year to buy
Grupo Radio Centro, a Mexican company, for $237 million.
</P>
<P>
   Muse attributed the failure of the Grupo Radio deal to a
significant earnings shortfall at the Mexican company. He said the
lawsuit had no merit and expressed satisfaction with the
cancellation of the Pearson deal. ``At the end of the day, the
responsibility is to our investors, and they are relaxed with this
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such stumbles haven't thwarted the desire of most firms to adapt
to Europe's ways. Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the
Blackstone Group, said his firm holds regular lunches for the ``the
great and the good'' _ that is, the upper echelons of British
society, including royalty, government officials and socialites.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent gathering, top executives from the London Stock
Exchange, Christie's and Britain's National Gallery of Art joined
Mr. Schwarzman and his colleagues at Claridge's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do this to get to know people and be an accepted member of
the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buyout executives are also ingratiating themselves by hiring
Europeans who speak the local languages and understand regional
customs. And American investment banks are gearing up their
overseas operations to help buyout firms acquire companies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, deals continue to get lost in the translation.
</P>
<P>
   Frank D. Yeary, head of the telecommunications team at the New
York offices of the buyout firm Carlyle Group, said he was
approached last November about taking a 60 percent stake in a
European company. But when Yeary asked for the company's offering
document, he got more than 1,000 pages of financial data and
contracts. ``It was written like a Swedish Nobel Prize entry,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeary passed on the deal, explaining that Carlyle didn't have
the staff necessary to analyze the volumes of information. ``If
they hired an American-style investment bank to lead this process,
the information would have been easier to understand,'' Yeary said.
``We speak the same language.''
</P>
<P>
   American buyout firms are likely to find allies in the next
generation of Europeans headed for corporate suites _ executives
who were educated in the United States and are willing to apply the
knowledge they gained. Those cosmopolitan managers ``are the agents
who are the biggest beneficiaries of the changes going on in
Europe,'' said Peter Gonye, a partner who runs the United States
financial services practice for Egon Zehnder International, an
executive search firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, though, the road to credibility remains
challenging. Joseph Rice, the chairman of Clayton, spends as much
as a week a month in Germany, not only visiting the management of
Thyssen, but also lunching with government and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our efforts are at getting the European community to know us
and understand that when we say we are going to do a deal, we'll do
it,'' he said. ``It is our first investment, and it needs to be a
success for us and the current management so they can proselytize
the next level of managers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his voice was weary at the task ahead: ``It's all
marketing now,'' he sighed. ``I'm selling all the time.''

   School Shootings Alter Political Debate on Guns
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With several state legislatures abandoning pro-gun
bills, the horrific shooting spree at a Colorado high school has
already altered the political debate on guns in America.
</P>
<P>
   But there's little evidence yet that the Republican-controlled
Congress will take up any new gun control measures this year. While
the Clinton administration wants to expand background checks,
require trigger locks on guns and increase penalties for adults who
transfer guns to juveniles, Republicans are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who counts fighting juvenile
violence as a priority, said there are enough laws on the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``But very few of them have ever been used,'' Sessions said on
CNN's Crossfire. ``We've had less than 10 prosecutions, for
example, nationally of guns on school grounds. That really,
apparently, is not the real solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans point to cultural reasons for the shootings, saying
that violence in the media and a breakdown in society's morals have
fostered an atmosphere that breeds killers. On Capitol Hill,
reaction to the shootings has generally been muted with most
lawmakers simply expressing their shock and grief over the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, however, wasted no time offering
its analysis of the shootings at a Colorado high school, suggesting
the slayings had little to do with a proliferation of guns.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from the NRA president, Charlton Heston, hinted the
group would give no ground in its fight against gun-control
legislation. ``We must stand in somber but unshakable unity, even
in this time of anguish,'' Heston wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential contenders were even blunter. ``I hope
we don't try to use this as an excuse to go and take away guns,''
former Vice President Dan Quayle said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide has apparently turned against a raft of pro-gun
bills introduced in several state legislatures. Alabama, Florida
and Colorado all shelved bills aimed at either easing concealed
weapons laws or protecting gun makers from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   And the NRA did offer one public relations concession in the
wake of the school shooting. It scaled back plans for its annual
convention, which coincidentally is to begin in Denver later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold Shoulder
</P>
<P>
   With their eyes on textile jobs back home, two Southern senators
are leading the fight against China joining the World Trade
Organization, a move that would enhance the country's trading
status.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Fritz Hollings of South Carolina and Republican Jesse
Helms of North Carolina have long been leery of trade deals they
believe threaten domestic jobs. Textile production is a major
industry in both states, but China wants to further break open the
market here with its goods.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also cite China's poor history on human rights and
recent allegations of espionage as additional reasons why the
United States should be cool to any new trade deal with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any trade agreement with China would be premature before these
issues are resolved,'' the senators said in a letter to colleagues.
The debate is expected to heat up this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Beach Reading
</P>
<P>
   Southern coastal states have regularly come under criticism from
environmental groups for their failure to test water cleanliness at
public beaches and notify the public of any health risks.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana have no monitoring plan at all,
according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. Mississippi has
no closure policy and Florida and South Carolina have piecemeal
monitoring. Only North Carolina has what the group considers a
comprehensive policy.
</P>
<P>
   But that may now change. A bill moving through Congress would
authorize $30 million for states to develop and put into effect new
testing programs that meet federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation advocates said the bill had been kicking around the
last few sessions of Congress with Democratic backing but never got
moving. This year, Republicans seized on it as a way to give
lawmakers a solid environmental vote and demonstrate that the
Congress is getting some legislative work done.
</P>
<P>
   Party Politics
</P>
<P>
   Who says Congress can't be bipartisan?
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., is busy promoting a favorite candidate
in the state's upcoming special congressional election to replace
Bob Livingston, saying David Treen would be in line for a spot on
the appropriations panel due to previous service in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's sudden departure left the state, which loves its
government pork, without a member on the committee. Should Treen
lose, Tauzin has another prospect for the panel _ Rep. Chris John.
Though John is a Democrat, Tauzin evidently feels having someone on
appropriations from the opposite party is better than having no one
at all.

<P>
   Next week The American Scholar will publish an article by James
Trilling, the son of Lionel and Diana Trilling, titled ``My Father
and the Weak-Eyed Devils,'' in which he writes that his father was
so blinded by his love of Freud and psychoanalysis that he missed
his real disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's worst problem was not neurosis, it was a
neurological condition, attention deficit disorder,'' he writes.
Then he lays out the diagnoses of the rest of his family. His
mother's affliction was ``panic disorder with agoraphobia, which
made her an emotional cripple for many years.'' His aunt had
Tourette's syndrome. His grandfather suffered from attention
deficit disorder. And so does he. Attention deficit disorder, he
emphasizes, is ``the most insidious culprit in my family.'' Its
main feature is ``the inability to maintain a productive level of
concentration (`focus') through the normal range of daily
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at this description, the reader might first think,
``Gee, I wish I could have Lionel Trilling's disorder, the kind
that is so crippling that you are forced to write important books,
become a judicious critic, teach at a major university and have a
family too.'' The reader then might wonder, ``Why does an article
about attention deficit disorder sound so Oedipal?'' Maybe it is
because confronting the Oedipus complex is something that the
rebellious son of a Freudian cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   This is an odd moment in psychobiography. For much of this
century Freud has been the lens for biography, Peter D. Kramer, the
author of ``Listening to Prozac'' noted in an interview. Now the
lens is biological psychiatry. ``Lionel Trilling in `Sincerity and
Authenticity' shows how in the modern world the moral man is
expected to take responsibility for not only his conscious but also
his unconscious motivations,'' Kramer said. ``His son claims that
in the post-modern world authenticity requires acknowledging one's
diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   James Trilling, an independent art historian who specializes in
the history of ornament, acknowledges the diagnosis not only for
himself (in a way that is quite convincing) but also for his father
and grandfather. Here is the son of a confirmed Freudian attacking
his father with biological psychology. His goal seems to be not
only to describe all his father's faults but to insure that no one
will look at them the way his father did, which is to say
psychoanalytically.
</P>
<P>
   Thus James Trilling takes his place on the growing shelf of what
Joyce Carol Oates calls ``pathography,'' biography whose main focus
is diagnosis. Like any other literary form, pathography can be good
or bad, Kramer said. When it is good, ``it destigmatizes an
illness. It's refreshing. It can show that depression or attention
deficit disorder doesn't disqualify anyone from the full range of
social behavior.'' When it is bad it attempts to show that the
subject is ``damaged goods.''
</P>
<P>
   How are we to understand the case of James Trilling and his
father?
</P>
<P>
   The most outstanding feature is the son's unwillingness to
concede that there is anything about his father that cannot be
explained by attention deficit disorder. He writes, ``All my
father's personality flaws, which continued to haunt my mother
almost 20 years after his death, were symptoms of attention deficit
disorder.'' He blames his father's absent-mindedness,
secretiveness, anger, impatience, indecisiveness, bad driving, bad
swimming and bad tennis on the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Here is his description of his father having attention problems
on the tennis court: ``He would wear himself to a frazzle on the
tennis court, always reacting too late and pursuing the ball with
all his energy when it was hopelessly out of reach.'' Here is the
son's description of his absent-minded father on the street: ``He
is said to have praised the appearance of a woman he passed on the
street, not realizing it was his own mother.'' (Did somebody say
Oedipus?)
</P>
<P>
   But the most reductive charge the son levels against his father
is the idea that Lionel Trilling's very thinking _ not only his
love of Freud, but his whole moral universe _ was determined by
attention deficit disorder: ``He saw the world as a practical and
moral obstacle course, but it was the obstacles that fascinated
him, not the ways around them. He loved to follow the path of most
resistance, and where obstacles were lacking he turned all his
ingenuity to inventing them.''
</P>
<P>
   James Trilling then challenges his father's literary judgment:
``During his entire career as an interpreter of literature, I doubt
my father ever solved a problem, in the sense of marshaling
evidence to prove or disprove a theory. On the contrary, he built
his career on the mistrust of certainties and was rarely content
with a simple answer when a complex one could be found. . . . Of
all `simple' solutions he mistrusted happiness the most. The idea
of living happily ever after must have seemed almost crass to him.
Certainly it left him all dressed up with no place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There it is then: Lionel Trilling, temperamental husband,
skeptical critic, abysmal tennis player, erratic driver,
absent-minded professor, impatient father, was the sum of his
neurological symptoms.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can never be too rich or too thin or too Audrey.
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn, that is. She was an object of fascination _ some might
call it obsession _ well before her death six years ago. And now,
her status as style goddess is spreading from the fashion world to
the real one with new urgency. On May 4 she would have turned 70.
But as far as her rejuvenated image is concerned, it's ingenue all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   A shoe designed for her in 1957 by Salvatore Ferragamo has been
reissued for sale at Ferragamo stores next month. A D.J. known as
Dimitri From Paris sampled bits of dialogue from ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's'' for a CD, a version of which is being used in a Volvo
commercial. And this fall, ABC will broadcast a television movie
chronicling Hepburn's early life and times and starring Jennifer
Love Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   These are only the most obvious manifestations of a Hepburn
``moment.'' The subtler, almost subliminal, ways she is in the air
may be more telling evidence of her pervasive influence. The
fashion world that always revered her now seems to want to revive
her. The impulse is visible in Marc Jacobs' flats and Michael Kors'
cigarette-cut pants, almost any little black shift dress, bateau
necklines, tiaras, Ralph Lauren's pastel sweaters and the
minimalist uniforms of the Club Monaco militia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helmut Lang's basics are a very arch, modern interpretation of
what her closet must have looked like,'' said Anne Slowey, Elle
magazine's fashion news director.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Hepburn made a look out of Capri pants and a
white shirt before anyone else doesn't fully explain her magnetic
pull. Jacqueline Onassis, the late Princess of Wales and Marilyn
Monroe inspired similar idolatry, but few people would want to be
them. Not the way many women (and even a few men) seem to pattern
their behavior after Holly Golightly, the loopy glamour girl
Hepburn made famous in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' issued in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was who I wanted to be,'' said Kimberly Rubin, a
television producer who pitched the Hepburn movie for seven years
before ABC finally said yes. ``When I was a teen-ager, I would be
in circumstances where I would say, `What would Audrey do?'''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Ms. Hewitt, queen of teen-age television and
movies, came more than prepared for the starring role in the ABC
film, which is so far untitled. When she was 11, her mother showed
her Audrey for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like every little girl, you wonder what you're going to grow
up and be like,'' she said from the Montreal set of the film, now
in its third week of production. ``And you have these women in your
life, your mom and your grandmother, and my mom was great enough to
say, `You should also be like this woman.' And she showed me
`Breakfast at Tiffany's.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hewitt said that since then, she has seen the movie ``25 or
30 times.'' Hepburn, she said, is ``classically what a women should
be: soft, delicate, glowing and sparkling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She turns heads when she walks in a room,'' Ms. Hewitt said.
``She's playful and mysterious and cute and funny, and a little bit
daring. She was strong and respected and people listened to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Being all those things _ and not a bombshell or a sexual
predator, a la Marilyn Monroe or Madonna _ was her appeal then as
it is now. Cynthia Rowley didn't become a designer because of
Audrey Hepburn, but she gets her share of comparisons to her for
being thin and dark-haired and for making clothes that suit both
fair ladies and funny faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess because she's sort of that nonsexy sexy,'' Ms. Rowley
said, explaining her affinity for Hepburn. ``She made that
boyishness cool. I don't have the body to show a lot, either, and
so I think I do clothes like that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rowley never met Hepburn. But at an awards dinner several
years ago, she touched her dress _ the hem of her garment, as it
were. ``I just got close enough to brush by her,'' she said. ``And
that was enough!''
</P>
<P>
   Actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow and Cameron Diaz, glamorously
packaged in the pages of In Style magazine, don't seem to inspire
the same level of deep identification. Fans may covet their
clothes, accessories and proximity to Brad Pitt, but without the
intensely personal connection they often make with Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes and the 20-inch waistline Hepburn wrapped them
around are not the sole reasons for her allure. Nor is her fandom
limited to women and fashion designers. For a certain type of
heterosexual male, she represents an irresistible type of woman:
beautiful, high-strung, loopy, happy, sad, maddeningly
inaccessible. Holly Golightly.
</P>
<P>
   Among the entranced is Tad Low, a creator of ``Pop-Up Video'' on
VH1, who seeks out his favorite Hepburn movie whenever it plays on
the big screen. ``Anyone who's capable of hosting a party like the
one in `Breakfast at Tiffany's' is the kind of woman I would want
to spend more time with,'' he said. ``She gets away with causing a
firestorm of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The film may be nearly four decades old. But its antic central
character again feels right enough to make the producer Robert
Evans want to make a movie updating her.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Garbarino, the editor in chief of Detour magazine and
something of a Harry Golighty himself, said he has always been
seduced by his female counterparts. He devoted several pages of his
March issue to Holly wannabes _ young women who seem to exist on
Champagne, cigarettes and the fervid attentions of older men.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the women was asked a series of Golightlyesque
questions. Favorite aliases? Last party crashed? To which Anna
Miller, who works in public relations at Sonia Rykiel, replied,
``Lulu Margot,'' and ``That of a fabulous Spaniard in Marrakesh.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is full of these women, as Truman Capote, who created
the character in his 1958 novel, knew (although he wanted Marilyn
Monroe for the movie). For them, Hepburn's Holly is the ultimate
role model.
</P>
<P>
   Holly is not Audrey Hepburn, though the distinction tends to
blur. ``Roman Holiday,'' ``Sabrina'' and ``My Fair Lady'' were all
variations on a similar fairy tale, with Gregory Peck, Humphrey
Bogart and Rex Harrison as her Princes Charming. And her own
Cinderella story, rags-to-couture, was no less romantic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brussels, 1929. Daughter of a baroness and a businessman
with Nazi leanings who took off when Audrey was a 6. Suffered
malnutrition in World War II. Made her way as a dancer in London
after the war, then into bit parts in British movies. (Memorable
first line: ``Who wants a ciggy?'' from ``Laughter in Paradise,''
1951.) Won an Oscar for ``Roman Holiday'' at 21. Became muse to
Hubert de Givenchy. Made gamine sexy, and casual cool. Crusaded on
behalf of impoverished children. Aged gracefully. Never got fat.
And, as if to prove the Zen rule that nothing is perfect without
some imperfection, made some bad movies (``Wait Until Dark'') and
unsuccessful marital choices (Mel Ferrer).
</P>
<P>
   The events of her private life were always private, and they
remain so, except her crusades for Unicef and Save the Children.
Those well-publicized expressions of noblesse oblige contributed
increasingly to her image as a cross between Grace Kelly and Mother
Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the feeling with a lot of celebs they're doing charity
stuff to look good, like it's a photo op,'' said Sally
Klingenstein, 31, the executive director of her family's
philanthropic foundation. ``She just seemed like such a genuine
person.'' Ms. Klingenstein saw photographs of Hepburn from the set
of ``Sabrina'' in the March issue of Allure magazine, then found
her way to the James Danziger Gallery on the Upper East Side to buy
one.
</P>
<P>
   The halo of her charity work notwithstanding, Hepburn is defined
for many of her admirers by nothing more than her sense of style.
In the classic image of her from ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' her
eyes are not even visible. She's wearing sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   But style means a lot. Many people spend a lifetime without any,
or trying to figure out what theirs is. Hepburn seemed
instinctively to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was modern enough and courageous enough and smart enough
to figure what style worked best for her and her physique, and she
had the discipline and style to stick with it,'' said Pamela Clarke
Keogh, the author of a new book called ``Audrey Style''
(Harper-Collins, $40).
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, Hepburn's upscale beatnik look was as radical as
Brando's leather jacket in ``The Wild One'': the black turtleneck,
pedal pushers and chest as flat as her ballet slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Those flats, popularized by her, have become ubiquitous again.
``It's what she felt comfortable with,'' said Mossimo Ferragamo,
whose father shod Hepburn's size 10 feet for most of her adult
life. ``And she felt comfortable with herself.'' Why not heels?
``She didn't want to appear to be anything other than the size that
she was,'' Ferragamo said.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Newcomber, a fashion historian at the Fashion Institute of
Technology, said: ``Even though she was European, she typified the
new American woman after the war. Suburbia gave American women a
reason to dress more casually, and she looked well in casual
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' on Nick at Nite: Laura Petrie
is Audrey Hepburn in New Rochelle.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Hepburn wore many looks, from Givenchy ball
gowns to Ralph Lauren sportif, even Guess jeans on trips to Africa
in her 60s. But her genius was that people think of her as having
just one look. This consistency is what seems so desirable today.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '90s we regurgitated every trend on the nanosecond,''
said Ms. Slowey, of Elle. ``The schizophrenic nature of that has
led women to say, `Wait a minute _ I just want beautiful staples.'
And Audrey really edited it down to the basics. If you study her,
and mimic her, you'll find that she really gave a lot of thought to
it. They're all crisp, clean silhouettes. You always feel
timeless.''
</P>
<P>
   For inspiration, the men's wear designer Jeffrey Banks keeps a
nine-foot-tall Hepburn photograph from a Macy's window display in
his apartment. ``Fashion is either very creative or very boring,''
he said. ``So you're looking for something to hold onto that is
easily recognizable, and there's Audrey.'' Always stylish, always
skinny. This last factor cannot be underestimated in Hepburn's
hagiography.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Wilder, wife of the director Billy Wilder, is quoted in
Ms. Keogh's book as saying that when Hepburn first arrived in
Hollywood, ``everyone immediately wanted to lose 10 pounds.'' The
only waist in her league was Scarlett O'Hara's. The teen-age
Hepburn was even tinier, recalled Polly Mellen, creative director
at Allure, who first met her at a Richard Avedon photo session.
``What bothered me a little bit about her was how thin she was,''
Ms. Mellen said. ``You could see her veins.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe's coinage ``social X-ray'' comes to mind, except that
Hepburn never looked that unhealthy. Thin as she was, suspicions
that she had an eating disorder had little basis in reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was her metabolism,'' Ms. Keogh said. And her dancer's
discipline. ``Her training was in ballet, and she wanted to keep
that line.'' But she was known for her healthy appetite, a trait
alluded to in ``Charade'' (1963), which opens with Hepburn
devouring a meal al fresco at an Alpine ski lodge, to Cary Grant's
shock and dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he falls for her anyway.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Snowfall accumulations exceeded 30 inches in portions of the
Front Range of the Rockies Thursday and Friday as a late-season
storm stalled across the region, producing a prolonged period of
heavy snow. On Saturday, this same storm will weaken slightly as it
remains over the central Rockies. Nevertheless, areas of snow and
rain will once again pepper portions of the intermountain West and
Rockies. Up to 12 inches of fresh snow may occur in the Watsach
Mountains of Utah and higher reaches of the San Juan Mountains in
southwest Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, scattered showers and isolated strong
thunderstorms will erupt over western Texas and the Red River
Valley as a stream of humid air flowing north from the Gulf of
Mexico intercepts an approaching jet stream disturbance. A few of
these storms will produce hail and damaging wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and spotty thundershowers will surround a stationary
front draped across the interior Southeast Saturday. It should
remain dry and very warm along the Gulf Coast and across Florida,
however, where the threat of spreading brush fires remains quite
high.
</P>
<P>
   A bracing day is expected across the Northeast Saturday as brisk
winds from the northwest direct unseasonably chilly air southward
from Canada. Skies will be generally sunny across the region,
though clouds and isolated showers will affect portions of northern
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny and mild conditions will cover the Northwest coast
Saturday. Farther south, California will be mainly dry, though
isolated showers will occur in the Sierra Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Waiting for Humidity
</P>
<P>
   The rainy season cannot come fast enough for the
wildfire-charred landscape of southern Florida. The average date
for the start of the rainy season is May 21, but there is hope that
the season could begin as early as next week. The start and
duration of the summer rainy season is determined by the arrival
and persistence of sultry, tropical air. Specifically, the
dew-point temperature, which is an absolute measure of the amount
of moisture in the air, must reach and stay above 70 degrees. In
response to such high humidity, tropical afternoon thunderstorms
frequently develop.

AN ARGENTINIAN OIL COMPANY MOVES FROM TROPHY SEEKER TO TROPHY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES _ For decades after its founding in 1922 as the
world's first state-owned oil company outside the Soviet Union,
Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales was the butt of one of
Argentina's most enduring jokes as ``the only oil company in the
world that knew how to lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives were chosen for their loyalty to a series of military
dictators, even if they did not know the difference between crude
and kerosene. It didn't matter: the union made key management
decisions anyway. Meanwhile the rest of the government's agencies,
including the railroad and gas distribution company, balanced their
books by neglecting to pay their fuel bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Argentina's oil company is no longer a joke. It was
privatized between 1990 and 1993 in an overhaul that cut the
payroll of YPF, as it is widely known here, from 50,000 to fewer
than 10,000 employees. The company sold off marginal fields, got
rid of a rickety tanker fleet, and dumped useless movie theaters
and money-losing hospitals that had nothing to do with its basic
business. It introduced an array of cost controls and employee
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   YPF, leaner if not meaner, has since catapulted itself into the
second tier of world energy companies by acquiring exploration
fields, gas stations and pipelines in the most unlikely places,
from Peru to Indonesia to the Texas panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now act like an American company,'' said Roberto Monti, the
company's chairman, who spent most of his career at Schlumberger,
the global oilfield services giant based in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   YPF is already the largest private oil company in Latin America
and the largest private company of any kind in Argentina _
representing better than 20 percent of the total market
capitalization of the local Merval stock exchange. It is among the
most actively traded Latin American companies on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 51 percent of its stock controlled by institutional
holders.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company, with its $11 billion in market capitalization,
is poised to take advantage of the expected privatization and
selloff of the Brazilian government's energy holdings and the
continuing opening of Venezuela's huge oil patch in the next few
years. Consequently, Wall Street analysts say, the blue and white
YPF logo should cast an ever wider shadow in the years to come. A
huge billboard over a YPF filling station on Avenida Libertador in
Buenos Aires trumpets a new company slogan: ``YPF: Here and
Everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless YPF is acquired first, making the trophy seeker
a trophy itself. ``YPF could be bought by Repsol today or by Shell
tomorrow,'' said a senior Argentine oil executive who spoke on the
condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish oil company Repsol, another formerly state-owned
concern beginning to expand its repertoire on the world stage,
became the largest YPF shareholder in January when it bought a
14.99 percent stake in the company from the Argentine government at
a premium price of $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Repsol's purchase at $38 a share raised eyebrows in the
investment community because no other company would bid anywhere
near that level: the price was about $10 a share higher than the
market quote at the time. But over the last two months, with Latin
American stock markets and the international oil price beginning to
recover, YPF's shares have risen to $32.95, up about 18 percent for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   If Repsol acquired YPF, the merged company would be the
eighth-largest integrated oil company in the world as measured by
asset value. But Repsol's takeover prospects appear increasingly
unlikely since YPF's bylaws prohibit a stock swap. Raising the
necessary cash would not be easy. Moreover, many analysts say the
Spanish company underestimated the spirited resistance the YPF
board would put up to avoid being caught up in the consolidation
trends that have seized the international oil industry. Under
pressure from relatively low prices, even such giants as Exxon and
Mobil and British Petroleum and Amoco have agreed to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings when we talk about consolidation,''
Monti said in an interview. ``Size can impede speed to react. What
we are looking for is YPF to be one of those dynamic companies, one
that can make use of opportunities faster than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 60, Monti is a dour man who goes to bed at 10 p.m. so he
can get to the office before 8 a.m. He is so precise about
scheduling he is known to cancel appointments with people who are
five minutes late. Monti would speak little about the proposed
Repsol takeover beyond saying, ``You are better off being the owner
of your own destiny.'' Associates say he thinks YPF would be better
off with another partner _ a junior one.
</P>
<P>
   Monti described himself as a collector, one who has assembled a
collection of 60,000 stamps from every corner of the world since
his childhood. At age 40, he bought a 1929 Chevrolet Phaeton and
over the last 20 years he has acquired a slew of vintage cars
including a Jaguar, a Mercedes-Benz and a Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   He said his internationalist collections say a lot about his
personality and the way he views YPF. ``I know my way abroad,'' he
said. ``Two years ago we were not exporting any gas. Now we are
exporting to the south of Chile and to the Santiago area. We were
importing gas from Bolivia, now we are going to reverse the flow
and send it Brazil via Bolivia. We are going to Uruguay and from
there extend to Porto Alegre and Sao Paulo.''
</P>
<P>
   Monti said he intended to continue to dominate the Argentine
market: YPF controls nearly 50 percent of Argentina's production of
908,000 barrels a day (the country ranks 21st among oil producers)
and operates almost half of Argentina's 6,000 filling stations. But
the core of his strategy for growth is expansion abroad,
particularly into the growing neighboring markets of Brazil and
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   From virtually no foreign operations only four years ago, YPF
now has 17.5 percent of its 3.2 billion barrels in reserves and
16.4 percent of its production outside Argentina. More than 38
percent of its $5.5 billion in revenues in 1998 came from exports
or operations in other countries, while a honeycomb of gas
pipelines reaching into Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and
Brazil are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   YPF's push abroad began in earnest in 1995, when it spent $1.7
billion to buy Maxus, an independent exploration and production
company with 50 percent of its properties in Indonesia. It also has
a joint gas venture in the Texas panhandle with BP Amoco. (YPF has
a 65 percent interest in a field that yielded 144,000 cubic feet of
gas a day in 1997.) The acquisition of Maxus originally received
negative reviews from international investors because of the
company's history of cost overruns and debt, but that has changed
as YPF improved its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Monti said his concept of targeted, measured growth was designed
to raise the return on capital from just below 11 percent when he
took over the company in 1997 to 15 percent by 2002. Last year he
reached 13.2 percent _ just above the current standard for
international oil companies _ even as oil prices and revenues
dropped.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The company reported net operating income in the final quarter
of 1998 ending in December of $115 million, or 33 cents a share, a
decrease of 42.5 percent from the corresponding period in 1997. But
Wall Street analysts said results would have been far worse had the
company not reduced exploration and production costs by as much as
30 percent over the last two years, and they are predicting that
considerably higher profits will come with higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Dario Lizzano, head of Santander Investment's equity research
team in Buenos Aires, said one yardstick for YPF's improved
operations was that while the company needed an international price
of $11 a barrel of oil to break even in 1995, it only needs a price
of $7 a barrel to break even this year. ``They have done an
outstanding job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of two management advisers contracted from Chevron
and a $56 million modernization project, for instance, YPF's
largest refinery in La Plata has decreased the cost of processing a
barrel of oil from $4.69 to $2.66 a barrel since 1995, according to
management. A tour of the 1,000-acre operation leaves a visitor
with a strange sensation akin to visiting a ghost town of flare
towers and storage barrels. Only 690 employees work there (over
several shifts 24 hours a day), down from 1,350 at the time the
company was privatized.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past YPF knew how to meet production targets but had no
idea about efficiencies,'' said Abraham Zarzur, director of the La
Plata refinery and a holdover from the pre-privatization days.
``Now we make money, lots of money.''

SOME EXPERTS SAY GROUND TROOPS WILL BE NEEDED TO WIN WAR IN
YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With airstrikes moving into a second month and
Yugoslavia showing no signs of knuckling under, military experts
and key lawmakers say the use of ground troops may be the only way
to end the fighting in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting this weekend in Washington to mark the 50th anniversary
of NATO, alliance leaders were expected to discuss the possibility
of deploying ground forces in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a
move not supported by all 19 NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has said repeatedly that the war can be
won without a ground assault, acknowledged on Thursday that the
updating of NATO's contingency plans to include a land attack is
``a wise and prudent course.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is under pressure from some members of Congress to use
ground troops to end the conflict. Lawmakers say the Serb military
has taken a tremendous pounding in past weeks but has survived.
They argue that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will not bend
to NATO demands unless he faces an all-out ground assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``In history, an air campaign alone has never decisively
affected a campaign,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a
presidential candidate who recently turned up the heat on Clinton.
``It's apparent that the administration wants to win a war without
waging it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain knows something about air warfare. A Navy fighter pilot
during the Vietnam War, he was shot down in 1967 but survived with
fractures of both arms and a knee, spending nearly six years as a
prisoner of war in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Senate hearing, McCain asked Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about Clinton's strategy to
avoid the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does it make sense ... to tell your enemy before you go
into a conflict that you will not exercise whatever options are
necessary?'' McCain asked.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton looked back at McCain and replied sternly: ``There's no
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has military history on his side.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, a 43-day operation to drive Iraq's
army from neighboring Kuwait, allied pilots flew about 1,000
sorties a day and pounded Iraqi air defenses and command centers.
But it still took a 100-hour ground war to defeat Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO began airstrikes against Yugoslavia on March 24 to
thwart Milosevic's policy of ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo, allied
pilots have flown some 9,000 sorties, hitting bridges, oil
refineries, communications facilities and even Milosevic's Belgrade
home. But Army Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme NATO commander in Europe,
said recently that there is ``no evidence of any pullback of Serb
military or police forces,'' who have been driving ethnic Albanians
out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts say that won't change unless NATO begins
amassing troops on the Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Maj. Gen. William Nash, who led U.S. peacekeeping
troops into Bosnia during a previous Balkan conflict in 1995, said
in an interview that America ``relearned'' in the 1991 gulf war the
old adage that a war cannot be won from the air.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the laser-guided bombs, cruise missiles and stealth
fighters that the Air Force and Navy bring to the air campaign in
Kosovo, the war will be won on the ground, like previous major
conflicts, Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, this strategy would be greatly enhanced by the
threat of a land campaign,'' Nash said. ``Barring that, diplomacy
will win this. Not bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash, like McCain, is critical of Clinton for pledging not to
use ground forces in Kosovo. He said that the president's pledge,
while politically appealing at home, gave Milosevic a strategic
advantage against NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, coalition forces massed troops on the border between
Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The threat of a ground war forced Saddam to
keep his troops nearby and ready for combat, making them easy prey
for allied pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, Clinton's strategy has allowed the Serbs to
disperse equipment and personnel, making them less vulnerable to
NATO fighters and bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elimination of the ground threat to Milosevic allowed him
to see the limits of our determination and may have given him false
hope that he could outlast us,'' Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   But any move toward a commitment of ground troops is likely to
trigger a backlash from the American public, which, according to
opinion polls, would probably not support a war that brings heavy
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must also consider the ramifications of such a decision
on political stability in Europe; the reaction of Russia, which is
sympathetic to the Serbs; and historical precedent, which indicates
that a ground war in the Balkans _ as the Nazis learned in World
War II _ could end in a blood bath for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most diplomatic observers say that Clinton must not allow
Milosevic to claim any semblance of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have put everything on this roll of the dice,'' said Joseph
Montville, a 23-year veteran of the State Department, who is with
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot walk away from Milosevic and allow him to accomplish
his brutality in Kosovo. It looks now like only ground troops will
be able to secure the region.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some recent signs that NATO is considering the
prospect of a ground war. There are now about 13,500 NATO troops in
Macedonia. And NATO is building a force of 8,000 troops in Albania,
where the alliance is establishing a staging area.
</P>
<P>
   Also, U.S. Apache tank-killing helicopters arrived Wednesday in
Albania. The attack helicopters are expected to be used initially
against Serb targets in southwestern Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
fighting for independence have gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Nash said it would probably take a NATO force of 200,000 to
accomplish the alliance's mission in Kosovo. The Serb army in the
region has about 40,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective has to be to drive the Serb military out of
Kosovo and create a situation where the Albanian refugees could
return,'' said Goodwin Cooke, a former State Department diplomat
who visited Yugoslavia regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke, a professor of international relations at Syracuse
University, said any military operation would be difficult in
Kosovo because many roads and bridges have been destroyed and Serb
forces are entrenched. But he said the size of NATO forces and
their technological superiority would give them a decided
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A NATO force fighting the Serb army would be very effective,''
he said. ``We are better trained and better equipped. The Serbs are
very undisciplined. They may be brutal and tough, but they are not
a particularly well-organized military unit. I cannot see them as
effective against American and British units.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO leaders, after a three-hour meeting Friday morning,
said nothing publicly about the prospect of using ground troops in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said only that the alliance will
pursue its month-old bombing campaign for as long as necessary and
would strike at ``the central nervous system'' of the Belgrade
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Shea said, is to attack ``those assets which are used
to plan and direct and create the political environment of
tolerance in Yugoslavia in which these brutalities can not only be
accepted but even condoned.''

   KOSOVO-NATO (Washington) _ The leaders of the Western Alliance
hold a war council on Kosovo. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ As NATO's leaders gathered behind
closed doors, the alliance's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
offered a strikingly optimistic view of the war against Yugoslavia.
``We are winning,'' he declared. ``He is losing. And he knows it.''
The scorecard, however, is anything but that clear. By Steven Lee
Myers and Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Lipkovo, Macedonia) _ Thousands of refugees are
straggling over the ice-packed mountains, carrying mud-caked
clothes on their backs, whimpering children in their arms, horror
in their heads. U.N. aid workers say that extraordinary numbers of
Albanians seem to be trekking their way through the rugged peaks
that span the border between Kosovo and Macedonia. There are at
least 10,000 on the move, and possibly 10 times that. By Barry
Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING (Littleton, Colo.) _ The governor of
Colorado tours Columbine High School and says investigators are all
but certain that the two gunmen had help from others; the police
say security cameras may provide crucial evidence of a conspiracy.
The 911 tapes are released. By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-KOSOVO (Washington) _ After outdoing each other for
months in their pledges not to fritter away the federal budget
surplus, both parties in Congress have quickly agreed that the
costs of the Balkans conflict should be an exception. But having
opened the door to spending some of this year's anticipated surplus
to pay for the direct costs of the air war and some relief aid
Republicans and Democrats alike now find themselves sorely tempted
to dip deeper for other military needs. A news analysis. By Richard
W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-MUSIC (Undated) _ The status of efforts in the
recording and electronics industry to hammer out a universal,
pirate-proof technology for distributing commercial music on the
Internet. By Neil Strauss.

NATO MARKS 50 YEARS WITHOUT POMP OR CIRCUMSTANCE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a nearly deserted downtown Washington Friday,
the ceremony that was meant to be a self-congratulatory celebration
of NATO's 50 years and the end of communism instead turned into a
cheerless discussion of the harsh reality of war and ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With NATO bombs falling on Yugoslavia, the alliance's leaders
decided to scrap most of day's more dramatic celebrations,
including a booming flyover of jet fighters and a colorful military
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the main ceremony took place in the newly-refurbished
Mellon Auditorium in the Old Customs Building _ near the Washington
Monument _ where the original North Atlantic Treaty was signed on
April 4, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was designed
to counter Soviet expansion and the military might of the
Moscow-backed Warsaw Pact. Now NATO is struggling with a new role:
responding to an ethnic crisis in one of Europe's smaller states.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the ceremony was to be the centerpiece of a weekend
celebrating NATO's triumph over the Soviet bloc and the extension
of membership in the alliance to three former communist states _
the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. In addition, the White
House had planned for several gala parties to celebrate the
alliance and other nations that aspire to join it.
</P>
<P>
   But during the ceremony, NATO leaders took a sober tone,
focusing as much on the organization's present struggles as on its
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an occasion to honor NATO's past, its mission in
Kosovo and to plan its future,'' President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the alliance that
``helped bring Eastern Europe out of the darkness of communism ...
must (now) show the world that it is willing to fight for its
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the auditorium, three 50-foot blue banners hung down in
front of the entrance to the building with a red carpet leading out
to the sidewalk. Across the street, a large grandstand, initially
built to be used by the NATO leaders to watch the military parade,
was being used by television crews to film the leaders leaving the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   But as the leaders emerged from the building, there was no
feeling of celebration. Under a foreboding sky, they quietly walked
out onto streets lined with hundreds of security personnel rather
than cheering crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Even after leaving the security perimeter surrounding the event,
the leaders encountered a virtual ghost town. With nearly 100,000
federal workers given the day off and motorists warned for weeks to
avoid the center of the nation's capital, the streets were largely
empty, except for police vehicles and a few roller-bladers.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary ceremonies end on Sunday. Guests at several
White House dinners have been asked to wear business suits rather
than formal attire and music at every event has been changed to be
more restrained.

SHOWTIME'S `LOVE SONGS' DARES TO BE DIFFERENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television rarely, if ever, does justice to romantic scenarios
involving black characters. If sex, for instance, isn't played for
laughs, its presentation is either too serious or too awkward.
Endearing and enduring relationships are practically nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Gossett Jr., who has found himself writing in his own love
interests now that he's spending more time behind the camera,
thinks Hollywood's skittishness toward black romance falls
somewhere between fear and ignorance. Fear that romance, like
drama, is simply unmarketable and unbankable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional wisdom is that no one wants to see it _ which is
the same reason why there are no regular TV family-type dramas
featuring black people as the lead,'' Gossett says. ``For whatever
reason, Hollywood has gotten in its mind that black people
shouldn't be seen as merely people, but super doctors or cops.
People who love and lust and get their hearts broken. Not being
comical makes us too human, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday night's ``Love Songs,'' a modest Showtime film that
links three stories, you'll find all of the above, and then some.
Gossett plays a bar owner and family man who kisses his wife
passionately, works hard and cares deeply for the welfare of his
son and abused sister-in-law. Like the other main characters who
turn up in this intriguing trilogy, he stars in one story and
weaves in and out of the others as a supporting player.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice little device that works, particularly once you get
the drift of what the creators are trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Love Songs,'' which airs at 7 p.m. CDT on the
cable channel, includes Gossett, Andre Braugher and Robert
Townsend, who all take turns starring, co-starring and directing
the short stories.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Whitfield also stars, along with Rachel Crawford, Carl
Gordon, Dule Hill and Sandra Caldwell. All of the interlocking
stories were written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and
screenwriter Charles Fuller, and are set in the same working-class
black community. It's a place that has the usual variety of
problems, but judging from its closeness, is actually presented as
being quite idyllic.
</P>
<P>
   As is always the case with anthologies, the mix is uneven. In
``A Love Song for a Champ,'' directed by Gossett, Townsend plays a
boxer (Champ) who is either up-and-coming or over-the-hill. He
doesn't look much like a prize fighter, but perhaps that's the
point. His real job is being a car mechanic, but it doesn't pay the
bills. Nor does it satisfy the soul. The story centers around
Champ's frustration in the often corrupt boxing game, using a
specific event that tests his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend is charming as Champ, which isn't surprising, and
Crawford's turn as his very pregnant and very worried wife lends a
sense of seriousness to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The bar that Gossett's Reuben owns is Champ's hang-out place,
and in one scene, Braugher (Ellis) is shown yelling from his fruit
truck while Whitfield (Jean) rips into him for being ``a disgusting
loudmouth.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that once ``A Love Song for a Champ''
ends, ``A Love Song for Jean and Ellis,'' directed by Townsend,
begins with Ellis courting Jean, with no chance whatsoever. But a
brutal rape attempt on Jean changes both of their lives. The treat
is seeing Braugher's chronic ear-to-ear smile and upbeat nature. (A
shot of him waiting for his love, a picnic spread at the ready, a
huge smile on his face, will simply tickle ``Homicide: Life on the
Street'' fans.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Love Song for Dad,'' with Braugher taking his first shot
at directing, Reuben teaches his son (Hill) that violence is the
last resort when it comes to protecting his sister-in-law from her
abusive husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Songs'' won't knock you over. In fact, even the stories
featuring abusive elements come with a twinge of sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's the point. ``Sweetness'' isn't a word readily
attached to film projects where the cast is exclusively
African-American. How sad.
</P>
<P>
   ELSEWHERE THIS WEEK:
</P>
<P>
   Now there's fashion, the series. American Movie Classics kicks
off a weekly series examining why we remember what Cher wore when
accepting her Oscar rather than the role in which she played to get
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hollywood Fashion Machine'' (6:30 p.m. CDT Monday) is a
sly attempt by AMC to gain a foothold into the enormously popular
fashion/celebrity hype. Daryl Hannah hosts the 30-minute opener, on
Edith Head, whose honors included eight Academy Awards. She had an
unparalleled career in costume design from the late 1930s until her
death in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Star Makers'' is the second installment of this series,
slated for May 3. It looks at Hollywood's star-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Note: AMC will soon premiere another weekly series (hosted by
Lauren Bacall) which showcases a film featuring trendsetting or, as
they put it in a press release, ``breakthrough costumes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic: Answers From the Abyss'' (7 p.m. CDT Sunday,
Discovery) _ Enough, already. Discovery revisits the luxury liner's
resting place and, with what it claims as new technology,
challenges some theories surrounding the disaster. Wait. Following
is ``Inside the Titanic,'' which looks at the living spaces of the
ship as they are today, submerged, in case some bored billionaire
wants to try and book them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimate Portrait: Lindsay Wagner'' (9 p.m. CDT Sunday,
Lifetime) _ Lifetime again digs deep for a subject. Wagner's
``Bionic Woman'' is her claim to fame, unless you count a string of
women-in-distress, made-for-TV movies. Lifetime lists her as
``Emmy-level,'' which is a polite way to say that she never won
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Durango'' (8 p.m. CDT Sunday, CBS) _ Based on the
autobiographical novel by Irish writer John B. Keane, this is the
story of a young Irishman who in 1939 plans a daring 40-mile-long
cattle drive to outfox a ruthless local merchant. Oscar winner
Brenda Fricker plays an irrepressible woman who helps the lad carry
it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dean Koontz's Mr. Murder'' (8 p.m. CDT Monday, ABC) _ There's
a reason why this miniseries is close to, but not in the pivotal
sweeps month of May, and why it begins on a Monday. Hmmm. It's
about a successful mystery writer and his family who are terrorized
by a stranger. It stars Stephen Baldwin and Julie Warner (now
moving in on ``Party of Five'' as the latest Salenger girl toy)..
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patty Duke Show: Still Rockin' in Brooklyn Heights'' (8
p.m. CDT Tuesday, CBS) _ Does anyone care if Patty's still rockin'
in Brooklyn Heights? Duke reprises her roles from ``The Patty Duke
Show'' as look-alike cousins Patty and Cathy Lane. The girls are
not nearly as perky _ OK, OK, it's been 33 years. This might appeal
to the core fans or it might be used just for laughs. For even more
nostalgia, Cindy Williams (''Laverne &AMP; Shirley'') stars as the
cousins' high school nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nickelodeon's 12th Annual Kids' Choice Awards'' (7 p.m. CDT
May 1, Nickelodeon) _ Rosie O'Donnell is back as host of this
annual awards show, which ranks right up there with the MTV Movie
Awards as one that gives viewers a fun ride. Besides, it's
interesting to see what young voters have chosen in the fields of
music, film, television and sports.

   LIPKOVO, Macedonia _ And still they come, thousands of refugees
straggling over the ice-packed mountains, freezing, exhausted and
bereft, carrying mud-caked clothes on their backs, whimpering
children in their arms, horror in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. aid workers say that extraordinary numbers of ethnic
Albanians seem to be trekking their way through the rugged peaks
that span the border between Kosovo and Macedonia. There are at
least 10,000 on the move, and possibly 10 times that.
</P>
<P>
   They emerge from their harsh, up-and-down journey in villages
like this one, where on Friday hundreds finally found shelter in a
mosque. They ate loaves of bread, dozed on the carpeted floor and
smoked up mounds of tobacco in hand-rolled cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Delivered into safety and warmth, the refugees nevertheless made
no secret of being belly-shot by life. Nazlie Hysku, 67, ached in
her shoulders, her legs and especially her heart. ``Is there a God
anymore for Albanians?'' she asked, closing her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Zyrije Hasani, 33, was relieved that her 4-year-old had
surrendered to sleep. The boy had been coughing up blood. He had
conked out an hour before, and now she watched him gratefully until
he began to twitch. Then she wondered what fears jolted through his
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has seen people being shot,'' the mother said. ``He has
seen people lying dead.''
</P>
<P>
   People were frantic to leave Kosovo, but the Serbians did not
permit the ease of automobiles. To get to Macedonia, the cold
mountains would have to be crossed on foot _ a forced march into a
treacherous and unfamiliar landscape. Often, they walked without
the benefit of even a slim path. People would have to sleep on the
snow, slip in the mud, collapse on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the pitch of one recent night, Zyrije Hasani of the village
of Begunce heard her little daughter stumble and then roll down a
gully. She was found with the help of a searchlight, and men formed
a human chain to pass the girl back to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Another toddler was not so fortunate. According to several who
were there, one night an 18-month-old boy similarly tumbled down a
mud-sloped ravine. The child was not found until the next morning.
He was given a burial not far from where he fell.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, these refugees _ and thousands like them _ had
found sanctuary in a 60-house flyspeck called Malina, just across
the border into Macedonia. The village seemed to be a vortex of
intersecting mountain paths, and its residents had taken it upon
themselves to patrol the area on horseback, welcoming the tired and
the sick to a very humble oasis.
</P>
<P>
   Malina is a poor place. Visitors slept 20 and 30 to a room. Tray
after tray of biscuits baked in the ovens, but flour was running
low. The U.N. High Commission for Refugees knew of the problems,
but the Macedonian government had refused to allow the agency's
trucks to bring in food and medicine. The narrow mountain roads ran
close to Serbian strongholds, and the government asserted that the
rescue operation was too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Macedonians relented, but when the aid workers
arrived in Malina, they found that most of the refugees had
journeyed on, returning to the mountain passes and looking for
other towns and other samaritans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have teams searching for these people in the nearby
villages,'' said Paula Ghedini, a U.N. spokeswoman in Macedonia's
capital, Skopje. ``We have to hunt the refugees before we can help
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. teams have questioned people about their days _ and
sometimes weeks _ roaming through the steep terrain. From reports
compiled so far, at least 10 children and ``a few of the elderly''
have died during the long ordeal, Ms. Ghedini said.
</P>
<P>
   International aid workers may be doing their best, but in large
part it has fallen to the ethnic Albanians of Macedonia to take
care of the ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. Far more refugees are now
being housed in private homes than in official transit camps.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The people who left Malina walked five hours to the village of
Presnic, where they again received food and shelter. Then they
endured another five-hour struggle toward Lipkovo, which is about
25 miles northeast of Skopje. Lipkovo's farmers drove out to meet
them in tractors and carried them the final few miles in flat-bed
trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the mosque, fed and rested, the refugees told
frightening tales of two sorts _ calamities in their home villages
and calamities during their arduous escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbian paramilitary went house to house, demanding
money,'' said Azemine Hysku, 38, from the village of Libiste. ``You
could hear them knocking and the shouting. So much knocking, so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   For some Serbian soldiers, ethnic purging carries the benefit of
personal profiteering. The Albanians were told to produce thousands
of dollars or pay with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees who on Friday arrived in Lipkovo came from
Libiste. They told of the same triple murder. The Serbians had made
an example of three young men, beating them in the open road and
then mutilating the bodies with some odd and sordid symbolism. One
corpse was scalped. Another had its eyes plucked out. The third was
deprived of fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see such things, you grow sick with fear,'' Azemine
Hysku said.
</P>
<P>
   However difficult the effort to reach Macedonia, there was no
celebration _ or even psychic comfort _ upon reaching the border.
Serbian guards were there to extort a crossing fee.
</P>
<P>
   Adem Aziri, a 52-year-old man from Begunce, was in a large group
that pooled together almost $10,000 to bribe the guards. ``They
were very pleased with us,'' Aziri said. ``They told us where to
step in order to avoid the mine fields. And they gave us advice on
how to avoid the Macedonian police.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians already make up a share of Macedonia that is
variously estimated at 17 percent to 35 percent. The Macedonian
majority does not get along well with the Albanian minority _ and
it fears a disadvantageous change in the population's percentages.
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonian police are often as feared as the Serbians.
``When they saw us, they fired their guns,'' said Hazir Aziri, 22,
Adem's nephew. ``I froze up with fear, but it turned out we were
very lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called us dogs,'' he said. ``And then they let us go.''

$1.2 MILLION AWARD IN CHILDREN'S FIRE DEATHS THROWN OUT 
 

</HEADLINE>

c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ A jury's $1.2 million damage award against
the city of Houston is invalid because family members who sued over
the fire deaths of two children made their claim too late, a
federal judge said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The jury decided in a March trial that the Houston Fire
Department's failure to repair a ladder truck water pump
contributed to the deaths of Crystal Durden, 3, and her cousin,
Alex Freeman, 4.
</P>
<P>
   However, the jury also said that Ruth Hill, the children's
grandmother, and Schanell Durden, Crystal's mother, notified the
city of damage claims six months past the statutory deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Because that notification missed the deadline, U.S. Magistrate
Judge John Froeschner ruled the family cannot collect the damage
award.
</P>
<P>
   Froeschner's ruling puts the two-week March trial and verdict on
track for review by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court's ruling will be critical to whether the
children's family can press federal civil rights claims against the
city in connection with their deaths. In a portion of their
original lawsuit that has yet to be tried, the family maintains the
Fire Department discriminatorily placed old, run-down firefighting
equipment in minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Family attorneys want the appellate court to affirm the jury's
ruling that the Fire Department's failure to follow its own repair
guidelines contributed to the children's deaths in a January 1996
fire at Hill's home.

GIAN-CARLO ROTA, MATHEMATICIAN, PHILOSOPHER AT MIT; AT 66 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gian-Carlo Rota, a mathematician and philosopher who taught at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for many years, died at his
home in Cambridge, apparently in his sleep. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rota was found Monday afternoon after failing to arrive in
Philadelphia on Sunday for three lectures he was to give this week
at Temple University. The cause of death was heart disease,
according to the Middlesex County Medical Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rota was the only MIT faculty member to hold the title of
professor of mathematics and philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   As a mathematician, he is credited with having transformed his
specialty area, combinatorics _ which he described as ``putting
different colored marbles in different colored boxes, seeing how
many ways you can divide them'' _ into one of the most important
areas of mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gian-Carlo Rota almost single-handedly lifted the subject of
combinatorics from a barely respectable obscurity to one of the
most active areas of mathematics today,'' said Richard Stanley, a
mathematics professor at MIT who is also a former student of Mr.
Rota's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through his commitment to the highest standards of scholarship
and his generous sharing of ideas and time, he has inspired
innumerable students and colleagues to share his enthusiasm and joy
for combinatorics and related areas of mathematics,'' Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   As a philosopher working in the 20th century continental
tradition of phenomenology _ a philosophical tradition established
by Martin Heidegger _ Mr. Rota was known for his humanistic
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always brought a very fresh perspective on philosophical
issues because he dealt with them with a mathematician's style and
interest,'' said Robert Sokolowski, a priest and philosophy
professor at The Catholic University of America. ``He had a good
sense of human realities. He felt that the continental approach, as
opposed to the analytical, brought out more effectively the humane
side of scientific and philosophical questions. He was very
imaginative. He saw the big context of all those things. That's why
he's so irreplaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   He was author or coauthor of seven books and founding editor of
three journals: Journal of Combinatorial Theory (1966), Advances in
Mathematics (1967), and Advances in Applied Mathematics (1979), as
well as founding editor of several book series, including
``Mathematicians of Our Time'' (MIT Press), ``Contemporary
Mathematician'' (Birkhauser Boston), and ``Encyclopedia of
Mathematics'' (Cambridge University Press). He also served on the
editorial boards of many other journals. He published almost 200
papers in mathematics or philosophy, and more than 500 short book
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a consultant to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
since 1966, and for the Rand Corp. from 1966 to 1971 and Brookhaven
National Laboratory from 1969 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rota was born in Vigevano, Italy. He was educated in Italy
until 1945, when his family was forced to leave Vigevano to escape
Mussolini's death squads during World War II. He completed high
school in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rota came to the United States in 1950. He graduted from
Princeton University in 1953, earned a master's degree in
mathematics at Yale University in 1954, and a doctorate at Yale in
1956.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a sister, Ester Rota Gasperoni.

`ELECTRIC   COMPANY' COMES TO CABLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hey you guuuuuuys ... Letter Man, Easy Reader and
Silent E are back!
</P>
<P>
   That's right: ``The Electric Company'' has returned to TV. It's
actually been airing since February on the new Noggin channel, a
co-venture of Viacom's Nickelodeon and the Children's Television
Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 97 percent of households that have cable but don't
yet get Noggin, TV Land _ which is in 38 million cable households,
compared to Noggin's 2 million _ will air four half-hours of
classic ``EC'' on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of an after-school special for 30-somethings. The
shows produce the expected happy memories ... though you may be
shocked to realize you remember all the words to the ``Letter Man''
intro (``It's a word ... it's a plan ... it's Letter Man!'')
</P>
<P>
   What you may not have realized 25 years ago is just how much
talent the show had. Rita Moreno (who yelled the show's opening,
``Hey you guuuuuuys!''), Morgan Freeman and Bill Cosby were all
regulars on the program, which aired from 1971 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Cara, who went on to stardom in ``Fame,'' was one of the
children who made up the show's ``Short Circus.'' Musical humorist
Tom Lehrer wrote the ``Silent E'' ditty, and there were witty
little guest appearances by TV characters from Edith Bunker (Jean
Stapleton) to Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene) _ who gamely says, ``I
can't hear you, I have a Bonanza in my ear.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Sesame Street' had a huge reputation at that time, and most
of us who ended up on the show had young children then,'' recalled
Moreno in a phone interview. ``When they called me, I said yes
immediately. Other show people admonished me not to do it. They
said it would look like I couldn't get work. But I ended up having
one of the best times of my life, and Bill Cosby and Morgan Freeman
became my lifelong friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, of course, went on to become a multiple Oscar-nominated
dramatic actor in such films as ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``The
Shawshank Redemption.'' Though it's a joy to watch his portrayal of
such '70s-hipster characters as Easy Reader, he has expressed some
frustration at having been labeled a kid's show cast member rather
than a serious actor for several years after ``Electric Company''
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers, though, should have only fond memories of the show.
Though it has a definite '70s flavor _ bell bottoms and earth tones
abound _ it remains a rare combination of entertainment and
education. ``There are some things that are a little dated,''
admits Moreno. ``In one sketch, we have a Howard Cosell-type
character. Kids don't know who he was. But I don't think it
matters, really. They can still appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno says her daughter, a ``reluctant reader,'' even learned
to read from the show. Eventually, reading was incorporated into
the Children's Television Workshop's flagship show, ``Sesame
Street,'' and ``Electric Company'' went dark in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get adults who remember me mainly from the show,''
says Moreno, who already had a substantial career and an Oscar (for
``West Side Story'') under her belt by the 1970s. ``I'll go into a
restaurant, and someone will call out, `Hey you guuuuuuys!' ''

L.A. MASTER CHORALE VOICES ITS EXCELLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the community center of Glendale's First United
Methodist Church this past Monday evening, the floor rumbled and
the air rang as the Los Angeles Master Chorale sang Brahms. The
singers, many dressed for the heat in shorts, T-shirts and sandals,
clearly adored the sounds of the composer's ``Schicksalslied,''
which they will perform along with other Brahms works on Sunday at
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer love, Brahms was no match in their hearts for
Morten Lauridsen. Lauridsen, a professor of composition at the
University of Southern California, has been a composer-in-residence
with the chorale for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been such a wonderful collaboration (with the chorale
and conductor Paul Salamunovich),'' said Lauridsen _ a soft-spoken,
bearded 55-year-old _ after the group's Monday evening rehearsal.
``It's been fantastic to work so closely with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Salamunovich, a highly honored conductor and music educator for
the past 50 years, recalls the afternoons he and Lauridsen spent at
a piano, working out the fine points of Lauridsen's work so that
Salamunovich could translate it on stage. ``As a conductor, you're
a music re-creator, not a creator,'' said Salamunovich. ``So this
was great ... Through his music, I'll have some fame after I'm
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The work paid off this year in the form of a Grammy nomination
for the chorale's all-Lauridsen CD, led by the composer's ``Lux
Aeterna'' (1997). Salamunovich says the album, the only one the
chorale has recorded besides a Christmas album, has sold in excess
of 20,000 copies _ a smash hit in classical music terms. Lauridsen
somewhat shyly admits he's gotten ``drawers full'' of fan mail; the
CD has been a top seller at Tower Records and on the Internet's
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Salamunovich admits some frustration at the public's lack
of knowledge. ``Choral music has never been better, but people
today just aren't aware of it,'' said the conductor. Indeed, the
Los Angeles Master Chorale has been praised by esteemed conductor
Simon Rattle as ``one of the finest choruses in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   When choral music was at the height of its popularity in the
1940s (thanks to Fred Waring), Los Angeles County even provided
conductors to choral groups around the area, Salamunovich says.
Today, we have to settle for simply having one of the best
choruses, bar none, right in our own back yard. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ For decades after its founding in 1922
as the world's first state-owned oil company outside the Soviet
Union, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales was the butt of one of
Argentina's most enduring jokes as ``the only oil company in the
world that knew how to lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives were chosen for their loyalty to a series of military
dictators, even if they did not know the difference between crude
and kerosene. It didn't matter: the union made key management
decisions anyway. Meanwhile the rest of the government's agencies,
including the railroad and gas distribution company, balanced their
books by neglecting to pay their fuel bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Argentina's oil company is no longer a joke. It was
privatized between 1990 and 1993 in an overhaul that cut the
payroll of YPF, as it is widely known here, from 50,000 to fewer
than 10,000 employees. The company sold off marginal fields, got
rid of a rickety tanker fleet, and dumped useless movie theaters
and money-losing hospitals that had nothing to do with its basic
business. It introduced an array of cost controls and employee
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   YPF, leaner if not meaner, has since catapulted itself into the
second tier of world energy companies by acquiring exploration
fields, gas stations and pipelines in the most unlikely places,
from Peru to Indonesia to the Texas panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now act like an American company,'' said Roberto Monti, the
company's chairman, who spent most of his career at Schlumberger,
the global oilfield services giant based in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   YPF is already the largest private oil company in Latin America
and the largest private company of any kind in Argentina _
representing better than 20 percent of the total market
capitalization of the local Merval stock exchange. It is among the
most actively traded Latin American companies on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 51 percent of its stock controlled by institutional
holders.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company, with its $11 billion in market capitalization,
is poised to take advantage of the expected privatization and
selloff of the Brazilian government's energy holdings and the
continuing opening of Venezuela's huge oil patch in the next few
years. Consequently, Wall Street analysts say, the blue and white
YPF logo should cast an ever wider shadow in the years to come. A
huge billboard over a YPF filling station on Avenida Libertador in
Buenos Aires trumpets a new company slogan: ``YPF: Here and
Everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless YPF is acquired first, making the trophy seeker
a trophy itself. ``YPF could be bought by Repsol today or by Shell
tomorrow,'' said a senior Argentine oil executive who spoke on the
condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish oil company Repsol, another formerly state-owned
concern beginning to expand its repertoire on the world stage,
became the largest YPF shareholder in January when it bought a
14.99 percent stake in the company from the Argentine government at
a premium price of $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Repsol's purchase at $38 a share raised eyebrows in the
investment community because no other company would bid anywhere
near that level: the price was about $10 a share higher than the
market quote at the time. But over the last two months, with Latin
American stock markets and the international oil price beginning to
recover, YPF's shares have risen to $32.95, up about 18 percent for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   If Repsol acquired YPF, the merged company would be the
eighth-largest integrated oil company in the world as measured by
asset value. But Repsol's takeover prospects appear increasingly
unlikely since YPF's bylaws prohibit a stock swap. Raising the
necessary cash would not be easy. Moreover, many analysts say the
Spanish company underestimated the spirited resistance the YPF
board would put up to avoid being caught up in the consolidation
trends that have seized the international oil industry. Under
pressure from relatively low prices, even such giants as Exxon and
Mobil and British Petroleum and Amoco have agreed to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings when we talk about consolidation,''
Monti said in an interview. ``Size can impede speed to react. What
we are looking for is YPF to be one of those dynamic companies, one
that can make use of opportunities faster than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 60, Monti is a dour man who goes to bed at 10 p.m. so he
can get to the office before 8 a.m. He is so precise about
scheduling he is known to cancel appointments with people who are
five minutes late. Monti would speak little about the proposed
Repsol takeover beyond saying, ``You are better off being the owner
of your own destiny.'' Associates say he thinks YPF would be better
off with another partner _ a junior one.
</P>
<P>
   Monti described himself as a collector, one who has assembled a
collection of 60,000 stamps from every corner of the world since
his childhood. At age 40, he bought a 1929 Chevrolet Phaeton and
over the last 20 years he has acquired a slew of vintage cars
including a Jaguar, a Mercedes-Benz and a Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   He said his internationalist collections say a lot about his
personality and the way he views YPF. ``I know my way abroad,'' he
said. ``Two years ago we were not exporting any gas. Now we are
exporting to the south of Chile and to the Santiago area. We were
importing gas from Bolivia, now we are going to reverse the flow
and send it Brazil via Bolivia. We are going to Uruguay and from
there extend to Porto Alegre and Sao Paulo.''
</P>
<P>
   Monti said he intended to continue to dominate the Argentine
market: YPF controls nearly 50 percent of Argentina's production of
908,000 barrels a day (the country ranks 21st among oil producers)
and operates almost half of Argentina's 6,000 filling stations. But
the core of his strategy for growth is expansion abroad,
particularly into the growing neighboring markets of Brazil and
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   From virtually no foreign operations only four years ago, YPF
now has 17.5 percent of its 3.2 billion barrels in reserves and
16.4 percent of its production outside Argentina. More than 38
percent of its $5.5 billion in revenues in 1998 came from exports
or operations in other countries, while a honeycomb of gas
pipelines reaching into Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and
Brazil are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   YPF's push abroad began in earnest in 1995, when it spent $1.7
billion to buy Maxus, an independent exploration and production
company with 50 percent of its properties in Indonesia. It also has
a joint gas venture in the Texas panhandle with BP Amoco. (YPF has
a 65 percent interest in a field that yielded 144,000 cubic feet of
gas a day in 1997.) The acquisition of Maxus originally received
negative reviews from international investors because of the
company's history of cost overruns and debt, but that has changed
as YPF improved its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Monti said his concept of targeted, measured growth was designed
to raise the return on capital from just below 11 percent when he
took over the company in 1997 to 15 percent by 2002. Last year he
reached 13.2 percent _ just above the current standard for
international oil companies _ even as oil prices and revenues
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The company reported net operating income in the final quarter
of 1998 ending in December of $115 million, or 33 cents a share, a
decrease of 42.5 percent from the corresponding period in 1997. But
Wall Street analysts said results would have been far worse had the
company not reduced exploration and production costs by as much as
30 percent over the last two years, and they are predicting that
considerably higher profits will come with higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Dario Lizzano, head of Santander Investment's equity research
team in Buenos Aires, said one yardstick for YPF's improved
operations was that while the company needed an international price
of $11 a barrel of oil to break even in 1995, it only needs a price
of $7 a barrel to break even this year. ``They have done an
outstanding job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of two management advisers contracted from Chevron
and a $56 million modernization project, for instance, YPF's
largest refinery in La Plata has decreased the cost of processing a
barrel of oil from $4.69 to $2.66 a barrel since 1995, according to
management. A tour of the 1,000-acre operation leaves a visitor
with a strange sensation akin to visiting a ghost town of flare
towers and storage barrels. Only 690 employees work there (over
several shifts 24 hours a day), down from 1,350 at the time the
company was privatized.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past YPF knew how to meet production targets but had no
idea about efficiencies,'' said Abraham Zarzur, director of the La
Plata refinery and a holdover from the pre-privatization days.
``Now we make money, lots of money.''

 &HT;    Refined Trans Am at its best
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox Service Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although only 30 years old, the Pontiac Firebird Trans
Am is absolutely antediluvian, having been launched before the
flood of emission restrictions, energy crises and pseudo muscle
cars that don't throb and go vroom-vroom.
</P>
<P>
   It's wonderfully primitive, in other words, and is intended to
appeal to enthusiasts in their 30s and 40s who have the means to
make their old memories come alive. A thirtysomething woman, one of
many admirers of the test Firebird Trans Am convertible, looked it
over inside and out, shook her head and said, ``If I'd had that car
when I was 17, I'd still be in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed, and time is what the Trans Am is running
out of, with AutoWeek and other publications reporting that General
Motors will eliminate the various Firebirds and Camaros in the next
couple of years. (GM's response is to say the cars are scheduled to
be built through 2002.)
</P>
<P>
   If so, the current models represent a good stopping point, and
the Trans Am convertible represents the beast at its best. Add the
ram air option package ($3,150) to a list of standard features that
includes air conditioning, leather seats, a 500-watt stereo with
eight speakers and keyless entry, and the Trans Am ragtop can be a
fairly comfortable, usually tractable daily driver.
</P>
<P>
   For $34,535, buyers also get a 320-horsepower V-8, their choice
of a four-speed automatic transmission or six-speed manual (the
drivetrain is a variant of the Corvette's) and EPA figures in the
same range as those massive sport-utilities being bought by many
peers of Trans Am owners. Suffice it to say that one of the best
changes Pontiac made for '99 was upping the fuel tank capacity to
16.8 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the Trans Am with the big V-8 (5.7 liters, or 346
cubic inches, in old-times terms) isn't a pure holdover from the
one-trick pony car days. It's got that same old straight-line speed
and still launches like those Trans Ams that had the screaming
chickens painted on their hoods, but is much more refined. The
suspension and ride are taut, the handling is decent (save when wet
pavement strips away traction) and the driving is, face it, fun.
</P>
<P>
   The negatives are around, though, if you care to complain. The
test car's power top operated only when the car was parked
perfectly level. Entry and exit are an athletic exercise, and the
token, scooped-out rear seats won't take even a small-bottomed
passenger.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long for those characteristics, along with the
pleasing ones, to reinforce the first impression: The Trans Am is
an either/or car, one that can be as easy to hate as to love. But
for those who love rumbly muscle cars, it doesn't get much better
than this today.

FIGHT OVER HOUSE EXPOSES TENSIONS IN COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Ore., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINDLE, Wash. _ Perched on a gusty bluff high above the
Columbia River, the dream house that Brian and Jody Bea are trying
to build here looks out on a spectacular vista. Evergreens and
basalt hills are all around. And, across the way in Oregon,
620-foot Multnomah Falls, one of that state's most popular tourist
sites, cascades down into the broad river.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a big problem with this house with a view: It can
be viewed all too well.
</P>
<P>
   In an escalating dispute that pits environmental groups against
property-rights advocates and has become a major test of a
13-year-old federal law intended to protect the beauty of the
gorge, the bi-state Columbia River Gorge Commission has ordered the
Beas to move their house at least 200 feet so that it will be far
less visible from the surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, any new structure must be ``visually subordinate
to its landscape setting.'' The commission says the
4,000-square-foot house, which sits in a clearing cut out of the
woods by the Beas and has a soaring cedar facade, bright green roof
and large windows, clearly violates that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   But Bea, a 28-year-old physician's assistant who grew up in a
smaller, less visible home owned by his parents, just below the new
house, and whose great-grandfather homesteaded the land on which
the house is being built, says it fits beautifully into the gorge
scenery. Backed by a conservative property-rights group, he is
suing the commission and vows to fight all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offends me that people would come here and say this is an
eyesore,'' asserted Bea, who said it cost $300,000 to build the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the environmentalists who say the house violates
the law, Bea, a first lieutenant in the Oregon National Guard,
invokes military terminology. ``This is their Armageddon,'' he
said. ``This is their Waterloo. They're drawing their line in the
sand. Well, we're ready to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Columbia Gorge, a nonprofit organization based in
Portland, Ore., that has taken the lead in opposing the Beas, said
that about 600 homes had been built in the gorge without major
controversy since President Reagan signed the gorge protection bill
into law. But Kevin Gorman, executive director of the group,
maintains that the Beas' house is such a clear violation of the law
that allowing it to stand as is would ``send a terrible message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you let this go through,'' he added, ``you really have
pulled the rug out from under the act.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, which has successfully challenged plans to build
other houses in the gorge but, until now, never one that is nearly
complete, has offered to give the Beas at least $20,000 worth of
help to move the house, but the Beas have said no. The house could
be damaged in transit, they fear, and they don't want to move
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit against the commission, the Beas call the act's
requirements unconstitutionally vague _ ``so vague that men and
women of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning
and differ as to its application,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, they are obeying a stop-work order on the house, but
they said they could move in within weeks if they were allowed to
finish the drywall and other interior features.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's depressing coming up here,'' said Jody Bea, who is
pregnant and living in a rental home in nearby Washougal with the
couple's first child, 15-month old Brandon. ``Brian took me here
when we were first dating and said this is the spot. It doesn't
feel that way now. All we can do is look around.''
</P>
<P>
   How the construction of a single house mushroomed into a major
legal fight over the gorge protection act itself is a tale that
seems to spring from a series of misunderstandings, beginning with
Skamania County's initial approval of the Beas' plans for the house
and including what might charitably be called creative
interpretations on their part of those plans. (An upstairs
``loft,'' for instance, consists of four bedrooms and two
bathrooms.)
</P>
<P>
   The commission says Bea did not maintain adequate vegetation and
other natural screening, as promised in the plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight has also exposed tensions in communities along the
85-mile gorge over the law, which some here see as a clear abuse of
government power _ the Skamania County commissioners ordered the
courthouse flag flown at half-staff for a week when Reagan signed
the legislation into law. Others, however, view the law as an
important tool to keep the gorge pristine for tourism, which in
recent years has become the dominant industry here. (While a lumber
mill used to be the biggest employer in the county, that
distinction now belongs to the Skamania Lodge, a resort and
conference center.)
</P>
<P>
   Many homeowners who have worked painstakingly to comply with the
law are clearly angry at the Beas, saying that it is very feasible
to build houses that blend in so well with the gorge that they are
nearly invisible, thus preserving the magnificent vistas that make
the area, which is essentially a large wooded canyon with one of
the greatest concentrations of waterfalls anywhere in the world, so
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house they have put up is an obscene gesture,'' said
Daniel Dancer, a writer and photographer who eight years ago built
his own house farther east in the gorge in Underwood, Wash. ``They
totally overdid it. We might have liked to make our home a little
taller or a little closer to the bluff, but I'm a firm believer in
the importance of following these rules, which are there to protect
the gorge.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are clearly on the Beas' side, and regard the house
as a way to fight back against the gorge protection act. Earlier
this year The Skamania County Pioneer News complained in an
editorial that bureaucrats and environmentalists ``want us all
living in camouflage yurts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And, invoking the region's most famous explorers, a recent
letter to the editor of The Columbian, a daily newspaper published
in nearby Vancouver, Wash., said: ``The right of an American family
to venture west and establish a home secure from capricious
government interference is threatened along the very stretch of
river where Lewis and Clark's discoveries culminated.''
</P>
<P>
   The order to move the house was described by one member of the
gorge commission as the ``least-worst of a lot of terrible
solutions.'' But the Beas, aided by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a
property-rights group whose offices are in Sacramento, Calif., are
fighting the order in court, and the battle could stretch on for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Bea says the real fight is between the gorge commission and the
county, which approved his plans in the first place. ``I simply
think we're a bone between two dogs here,'' he said, adding:
``We're not moving the house. It's ridiculous. Would you move your
house?''
</P>
<P>
   But Gorman of the Friends of the Columbia Gorge says that the
house is clearly in the wrong place and that the Beas should accept
the offers of help to move it. ``If they relocate the house now,''
Gorman added, ``the Beas could be in their home this spring and
still live in one of the most beautiful places on earth.''

IMF TO REVIEW MORATORIUM ON RUSSIAN AID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pressured by NATO allies to help relieve tensions with Russia
over war in Yugoslavia, the International Monetary Fund is
negotiating to lift an aid moratorium and extend $4.5 billion in
funds to the country's battered economy, a Russian official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In IMF meetings to begin Sunday in Washington, Russia's first
deputy prime minister, Yuri Maslyukov, the IMF's managing director,
Michel Camdessus, and World Bank officials have scheduled talks
about an aid package that would address Russia's financial woes,
which Camdessus earlier this week described as ``the most difficult
problem we must tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia has not reached economic targets set by the IMF,
the specter of future debt defaults by Russia at a time the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization is bombing Yugoslavia _ over Russia's
objections _ has created a mix of international finance and
politics which make agreement likely, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole IMF package is far more political than economic
now,'' said Peter Westin, an economist at the Russian-European
Center for Economic Policy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's finance minister, Mikhail Zadornov, confirmed Friday
that the government's economic blueprint has ``virtually been
approved by the IMF,'' but the amount of new loans has not been
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the World Bank's Moscow office, Michael Carter, said
the sides were nearing agreement, the Russian news agency,
Interfax, reported.
</P>
<P>
   While IMF spokesmen continue to deny an aid package is
inevitable, the agency still hopes to pressure Russia to agree on
badly needed budget reforms as well as a restructuring of the
country's unstable banking system.
</P>
<P>
   But, political pressure to agree quickly is being brought to
bear by NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Thursday there are
``enormous national security issues'' involving Russia. Getting
Russia back on track is ``very difficult, but we cannot afford not
to do it.'' Chiming in during a trip to Chicago, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair said the world cannot stand back and watch
Russia ``slide into an abyss. It will affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus, in a press conference Wednesday to kick off this
weekend's IMF meetings, said NATO politics ``don't determine at all
our course of action in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, under the government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
has made limited progress in fiscal reforms. But with the economy
still deep in depression and debt continuing to mount, the
country's ability to repay outstanding IMF loans due this year is
in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people believe this is a way to buy Russian acquiesence
to the NATO campaign in Kosovo, which I think is a false
hypothesis,'' said Michael McFaul, a Russia specialist at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ``It
grossly exaggerates the influence'' of Russia's debt problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``That is not to say it's not a politicized
decision.'' Although Russia has not made reforms the IMF would
like, IMF officials are ``worried about default. That's their
primary concern. They don't want to make the situation worse in
Russia, which could happen if they default.''
</P>
<P>
   A new IMF aid package would be the first funds extended to
Russia since last July when the international lender was seeking to
stem a currency crisis circling the globe and threatening US
financial markets and emerging economies from Russia to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the IMF suspended its $22 billion package to Moscow,
because Primakov's government failed to come up with a plan to lift
the country out of a financial and economic morass.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh funds would open the door for Russia to negotiate with
other creditors breathing down its neck, including the Paris Club
of countries that have lent to Russia _ Germany is the largest
holder of debt _ and the London Club of commercial creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials Friday ordered a money transfer to pay some of
the country's Eurobond obligations. The Finance Ministry said it
has ordered the transfer of $37 million to Citibank in London on
April 29 to meet a Eurobond payment.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend meetings in Washington continue a two-week mission by
the IMF in Moscow to design a framework for reforms and an aid
package. IMF officials will leave Moscow Saturday, and the Russian
delegation leaves Sunday for Washington.

   Internet surfers curious about Colorado are greeted now with
information about the tragedy at Columbine High School in
Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you help? How can you get help?'' is a top link on the
Colorado state homepage, along with a link to Gov. Bill Owens'
pledge against gun violence in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The state page directs potential donors to send money to the
Mile High United Way's Community Healing Fund, offers directions to
potential blood donors to locations on the Front Range and provides
a list of 14 hot line numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It also directs families and relatives of victims to the
Jefferson County Sheriff's Office victim's service center, where
people could arrange for transportation and lodging assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The center's voice mailbox was full Thursday night. Youngsters
also can print out a copy of the governor's pledge that they can
sign and give to their teacher or school principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never bring a gun to school; I will never use a gun to
settle a dispute; I will use influence with my friends to keep them
from using guns to settle disputes,'' says the pledge. ``My
individual choices and actions, when multiplied by those of young
people throughout the country, will make a difference. Together, by
honoring this pledge, we can reverse the violence and grow up in
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado state homepage is www.state.co.us and access to the
pledge is available at www.state.co.us/pledge/

 &HT;    Cox exits PSC business with Sprint sale
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two Cox companies completed their exit from the
day-to-day business of operating a digital wireless telephone
network Friday, selling off the last piece of this business to
long-distance carrier Sprint for $1.2 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The sale marks the end of a strategy announced last spring. At
that time, Cox Communications and privately held Cox Enterprises
Inc., which owns a majority of the cable TV concern, said they
wanted to leave the PCS business.
</P>
<P>
   The companies began that process by transferring a 20 percent
stake in a joint venture called Sprint Spectrum to a new company
controlled by Sprint. The Sprint venture sells wireless service
based on a digital technology called personal communications
services, or PCS. It is different from standard cellular telephone
technology because it is digital and enables several functions to
work in one device, such as telephone, pager, e-mail and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was among the pioneers of PCS, winning a special federal
license to develop a wireless network based on the technology in
Southern California in the early 1990s. Sprint has since expanded
that network across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Cox still believes in the technology. That's why, the company
said, it opted to receive Sprint stock rather than cash in exchange
for its PCS operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this transaction marks our departure from the PCS
business as an operator, we remain bullish on the business and are
delighted to remain an investor,'' said David Woodrow, Cox
Communications' senior vice president for new business development.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as a passive investor in new technologies has been Cox
Communications' traditional role. It holds many stakes in
new-technology companies, such as Internet access provider At Home.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal announced Friday, Cox exercised an
option to require Sprint to buy out its remaining 40.8 percent
stake in the PCS business. Sprint bought out Cox's stake with 24.3
million shares of its Series 2 common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Enterprises held an 8.8 percent of that stake and Cox
Communications the remainder. The transaction is expected to close
in the second quarter. Cox Communications is one of the country's
largest cable TV concerns, with 3.8 million subscribers. Cox
Enterprises is a diversified media conglomerate. Its holdings
include The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

TAYLOR TO SUIT UP DESPITE NEW INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ He battled the pain and aggravation of a
severely sprained ankle that forced him to miss 32 games, and dealt
with a groin strain that sidelined him for the final regular-season
contest against the Flyers. And during the Bruins' Game 1 victory
against the Carolina Hurricanes Thursday, center Tim Taylor added a
broken nose to his list of physical woes.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor finished the game, playing his usual steady style on the
club's top checking line, and Friday practiced as normal despite a
bad bruise across the bridge of his nose that had affected his
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (restricted) it for a time, but we put some cotton in there
and it was fine,'' said Taylor, who will suit up for Game 2 of the
best-of-seven series Saturday night at the Coliseum. ``Through the
night it was leaking out a little bit but now it's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who was elbowed in the face by center Jeff O'Neill after
a faceoff, said such injuries are the price you pay in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens to everyone,'' said Taylor. ``(Linemate Rob
DiMaio) goes through that five times a year. It's just something
that comes with the game. I had it broken a couple of times before.
This one seems to shove it over a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill wasn't assessed a penalty on the play, despite Taylor's
best efforts at getting the attention of the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came through on the draw and I was holding up (Ron) Francis
and he elbowed me as I was getting the puck,'' said Taylor. ``It
hurt and I tried to make the referee (notice it) and I thought he
was going to call a penalty but he didn't. I tried to let him know
that he did catch me with his elbow, but those referees did a good
job, especially in the first 10 minutes. It was a hard-hitting game
and they let a lot of things go. It kind of dictated the rest of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio scored the club's first goal early in the third period,
and fourth-line left wing Ken Belanger accounted for Boston's other
goal. The playoffs are often greatly affected by the contributions
made from the third- and fourth-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need everyone playing well,'' said Taylor. ``We know that
goals are going to be hard to come by. A big goal lifts our hockey
club and a big defensive play lifts us as well, so as long as we
can shut the other team down, if we get a goal it's going to help
our team win. The power play wasn't going too well so it was a
situation where Robbie stepped up and got a big goal for us. Then
Kenny Belanger scored and it was 2-0. I don't think it was two guys
the other team expected to score so it was a big boost for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was given the task of smothering Carolina captain Keith
Primeau. Primeau, who levied some huge hits during the contest, was
held off the board and Taylor said he's hoping he made a dent in
his pysche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game I can shut him down and get in his face a little
bit it's going to help us in the long run,'' he said. ``These
series aren't usually won in the first or second game, it's (the
later games) where you're pounding and pounding and in his face.
Hopefully, he'll take some retaliation penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor in that combination has been the contribution
of left wing P.J. Axelsson, who most likely won't get the
consideration he deserves for the Selke Trophy as the league's top
defensive forward. Axelsson is normally with Taylor and DiMaio but
Friday at practice was on a line with Joe Thornton and Anson Carter
because Steve Heinze was bothered by sore groin muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of times, little defensive things go unnoticed, but guys
who play defense notice it a lot,'' said Taylor. ``I know the
coaches really appreciate the way P.J. plays day in and day out.
His skill level is great defensively. He knows exactly where to be
at all times. For a guy his size to have that physical nature, a
lot of Europeans don't go like that, especially a guy his size. He
brings that attribute to the table every game. When he plays like
that, he's a big factor for us.''

IMF TO REVIEW MORATORIUM ON RUSSIAN AID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pressured by NATO allies to help relieve tensions with Russia
over war in Yugoslavia, the International Monetary Fund is
negotiating to lift an aid moratorium and extend $4.5 billion in
funds to the country's battered economy, a Russian official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In IMF meetings to begin Sunday in Washington, Russia's first
deputy prime minister, Yuri Maslyukov, the IMF's managing director,
Michel Camdessus, and World Bank officials have scheduled talks
about an aid package that would address Russia's financial woes,
which Camdessus earlier this week described as ``the most difficult
problem we must tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia has not reached economic targets set by the IMF,
the specter of future debt defaults by Russia at a time the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization is bombing Yugoslavia _ over Russia's
objections _ has created a mix of international finance and
politics which make agreement likely, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole IMF package is far more political than economic
now,'' said Peter Westin, an economist at the Russian-European
Center for Economic Policy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's finance minister, Mikhail Zadornov, confirmed Friday
that the government's economic blueprint has ``virtually been
approved by the IMF,'' but the amount of new loans has not been
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the World Bank's Moscow office, Michael Carter, said
the sides were nearing agreement, the Russian news agency,
Interfax, reported.
</P>
<P>
   While IMF spokesmen continue to deny an aid package is
inevitable, the agency still hopes to pressure Russia to agree on
badly needed budget reforms as well as a restructuring of the
country's unstable banking system.
</P>
<P>
   But, political pressure to agree quickly is being brought to
bear by NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Thursday there are
``enormous national security issues'' involving Russia. Getting
Russia back on track is ``very difficult, but we cannot afford not
to do it.'' Chiming in during a trip to Chicago, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair said the world cannot stand back and watch
Russia ``slide into an abyss. It will affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus, in a press conference Wednesday to kick off this
weekend's IMF meetings, said NATO politics ``don't determine at all
our course of action in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, under the government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
has made limited progress in fiscal reforms. But with the economy
still deep in depression and debt continuing to mount, the
country's ability to repay outstanding IMF loans due this year is
in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people believe this is a way to buy Russian acquiesence
to the NATO campaign in Kosovo, which I think is a false
hypothesis,'' said Michael McFaul, a Russia specialist at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ``It
grossly exaggerates the influence'' of Russia's debt problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``That is not to say it's not a politicized
decision.'' Although Russia has not made reforms the IMF would
like, IMF officials are ``worried about default. That's their
primary concern. They don't want to make the situation worse in
Russia, which could happen if they default.''
</P>
<P>
   A new IMF aid package would be the first funds extended to
Russia since last July when the international lender was seeking to
stem a currency crisis circling the globe and threatening US
financial markets and emerging economies from Russia to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the IMF suspended its $22 billion package to Moscow,
because Primakov's government failed to come up with a plan to lift
the country out of a financial and economic morass.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh funds would open the door for Russia to negotiate with
other creditors breathing down its neck, including the Paris Club
of countries that have lent to Russia _ Germany is the largest
holder of debt _ and the London Club of commercial creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials Friday ordered a money transfer to pay some of
the country's Eurobond obligations. The Finance Ministry said it
has ordered the transfer of $37 million to Citibank in London on
April 29 to meet a Eurobond payment.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend meetings in Washington continue a two-week mission by
the IMF in Moscow to design a framework for reforms and an aid
package. IMF officials will leave Moscow Saturday, and the Russian
delegation leaves Sunday for Washington.

CRITICS ATTACK MERGER OF EUROPEAN TELEPHONE GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Only two days after formally reaching an
agreement on the biggest merger in European history, Deutsche
Telekom and Telecom Italia came under attack Friday from Italian
government leaders, shareholders and competitors, raising doubts
about the deal's future.
</P>
<P>
   Resurrecting an issue that had seemed to be settled, Italian
officials threatened to block the $82 billion stock transaction
between the two telephone giants if the German government refused
to offer more explicit assurances about its plans to reduce its
stake in Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   There were also signs that some of Italy's top business leaders,
who are shareholders in Telecom Italia, were throwing their support
to a rival $65 billion bid by Olivetti SpA, Telecom Italia's main
domestic competitor.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Olivetti, which is pressing ahead with its
unsolicited offer, said Friday that investors had oversubscribed
Olivetti's new bond and stock offerings that would be used to
finance its takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported Friday
that a number of Telecom Italia's big shareholders had sided with
Olivetti. The list includes the Agnelli group, the insurance
company Assicurazioni Generali and Comit, an Italian bank.
</P>
<P>
   In an outward indication of shifting sentiment, investors bid up
the shares of Tecnost SpA, an obscure subsidiary of Olivetti that
it is using as the legal vehicle for the attempted purchase of
Telecom Italia. Tecnost shares, traded in Milan, jumped 10 percent
to 9.6 euros after Italian officials raised new complaints about
the deal with Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders were also grumbling in Germany Friday. The German
Shareholder Protection Group, a Duesseldorf association that
represents small investors, warned that the merger with Telecom
Italia still had ``skeletons in the closet'' and might be a bad
deal for Deutsche Telekom shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The group also complained that the merged company would remain
vulnerable to political interference, implicitly from the Italian
government, and warned that the two companies' awkward plan to
alternate chairmen every year would do little to solve that
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of configuration is not practical and hides a big
potential for risk,'' the association said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness of Deutsche Telekom's share price also could pose a
serious problem for the merger partners because it hurts the value
of the deal for Telecom Italia shareholders, who will be paid the
equivalent of one Deutsche Telekom share for every three Telecom
Italia shares.
</P>
<P>
   Although Deutsche Telekom shares ended unchanged Friday at 35.50
euros, they have fallen 1.6 percent since the deal was formally
announced Wednesday, when it was worth 12.03 euros a share or $82
billion.
</P>
<P>
   That means at Friday's price, the value of the deal is 11.8
euros a share or about $80.5 billion and could decline further.
Much of the speculation Friday grew out of muddled statements from
the Italian government.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's finance minister, Vicenzo Visco, insisted Friday that
the German government had to provide greater assurances about its
plan to reduce its 72 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom. The issue
is the same one that bogged down Telecom Italia's board earlier
this week, but it appeared to have been resolved when the German
government issued a comforting but noncommittal letter saying that
it would reduce its stake over time and had no interest in running
Telekom on a day-to-day basis.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Visco and other Italian officials demanded that the
German government offer more concrete assurances for ``parity''
between the Italian and German companies and more specific detail
about its own plan to reduce its stake in Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not reasonably acceptable or conceivable that Telecom
Italia is bought by a German state company,'' Visco told reporters
in Rome. ``The Germans must give clear, precise and rapid signals
on parity and on the timetable of privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   German officials offered nothing new in response. Torsten Albig,
spokesman for the German Ministry of Finance, said the Italian
objections had already been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom has already announced plans to float a big new
stock offering in the next several months, which would dilute the
German government's share. The government has repeatedly said it
wants to sell off its holdings in an orderly fashion over the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   But the German government has refused to limit its voting rights
and refused to spell out a particular timetable for selling its
stake.
</P>
<P>
   That has galvanized Italian critics. Silvio Berlusconi, the
former prime minister and financier, complained on Thursday that
Germans already own big stakes in Italy's second-biggest cellular
telephone company and in Wind, a competitor to Telecom Italia in
fixed-line service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Telecom also becomes German, we will have to send our
children to German school,'' Berlusconi told the Business Club
d'Italia. ``I don't like this project.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Anger over the deal also is rising at France Telecom, which
regards it as a double-cross by Deutsche Telekom. The two companies
are partners along with the Sprint Corp. in Global One, a
joint-venture that serves multinational corporations but which is
losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining that Deutsche Telekom violated agreements to consult
with it before making a big strategic change, France Telecom said
it ``deplores this behavior and will undertake whatever action is
appropriate to protect its rights and the interests of its
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Though both Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom insist they
support the Global One venture, the merger would create new
conflicts. Telecom Italia, for example, is a shareholder in Telecom
9, a new competitor in France to France Telecom. It also owns a
stake in Retavision of Spain, a new competitor to Telefonica de
Espana. France Telecom owns a stake in a third Spanish telephone
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at France Telecom refused to say anything Friday
about their plans for Global One or about any legal action against
Deutsche Telekom. &QL;

THORNTON SAYS PAIN IS GONE, HE'LL PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The ache, twinge, and soreness, whatever the
bubble and squeak has been around Joe Thornton's sternum,
disappeared Friday in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 100 percent,'' said the Bruins' ever-smiling sophomore
center. ``I'm in. I feel good. It will be good to be in the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this the South's version of Lourdes? Is there something in
the Greensboro Reservoir that makes the wounded want to shed their
bandages and kick up their heels?
</P>
<P>
   Thornton came here hurting, after getting banged up last week as
the regular season came to a close, and coach Pat Burns figured his
No. 2 center would have to sit out at least one or two games. When
the Bruins won their playoff series opener against the 'Canes
Thursday night, 2-0, the conventional wisdom was that Jumbo Joe
would sit out Game 2, adding another 48 hours to his recovery
process. Everyone knows that a 1-0 series lead can be as good as a
pocketful of anti-inflammatories when it comes to the
rehabilitation process.
</P>
<P>
   But when the puck is dropped Saturday night, Thornton will be
wearing his familiar No. 6 and playing his role as No. 2 center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took some hits along the boards to get a feel,'' said
Thornton, shortly after Friday's brief workout. ``I wasn't asking
guys to hit me or anything, but I was testing it _ and it feels
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's return now, when the postseason math says he doesn't
have to be here, is a reflection of the kind of struggle the Bruins
had in Game 1. The 'Canes came at them harder, banged them more
often and intensely, than any club has since they met the Islanders
in the 1983 Stanley Cup semifinals. Who could forget the
heavyweight bout between Clark Gillies and Terry O'Reilly? The
Islanders went on to win their fourth consecutive Stanley Cup _ a
4-0 sweep of Wayne Gretzky's Oilers in the finals _ and it was all
the more impressive after the pounding, brawling series they had
with the Bruins lasted six games.
</P>
<P>
   There were no fights between the 'Canes and the Bruins. The
former Forever .500s came out with a ferocious forecheck that left
the Bruins flatfooted for nearly the opening half of the first
period. If not for Burns recognizing the sparkle on Ken Belanger's
chiseled teeth, and Belanger being able to help neutralize the
runaway freight train that was Keith Primeau, the assault would
have lasted longer and the night's outcome could have been vastly
different.
</P>
<P>
   To open the game, Burns had Randy Robitaille filling Thornton's
pivot spot between Dmitri Khristich and Sergei Samsonov. Tossed
into the torrent, the line was a nonfactor. Either Robitaille
doesn't have the speed and quickness to compete, or he lacked the
confidence to play at full throttle in such a setting. His two
wingers looked equally lost. Robitaille was told to return to
Providence after the game and, hours later, Thornton's sternum was
feeling mighty fine. Funny how that works.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see a little more, I'd say, stability in our lines with
Joe back,'' said No. 1 center Jason Allison, who saw a variety of
wingers in Game 1, Burns rolling the numbers, looking for any
spark. ``You'll still see some mixing, but Joe's our second center,
and at times he's played great for us. He's an important part of
the team right now, and it will be nice to have him back _ as you
saw, we didn't have a first, second, third line out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if not for Belanger, they might have had a 60-minute
911 drill out there. But slowly, the momentum changed, the 'Canes
obviously losing their enthusiasm when faced with Belanger's
pound-for-pound return to their hits and Byron Dafoe's continuing
airtight work in goal. No team can play foot to the floor for 60
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Canes will spring the same attack on the Bruins again in
Game 2, hoping to cash in on a couple of early chances, and it very
well could be their last chance to win the series. They don't have
the kind of scoring depth to overcome a 2-0 series deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, meanwhile, can't count on winning again with goals
by Rob DiMaio and Belanger. Burns has to figure out which four
wingers to package around Allison and Thornton and keep his
dependable trio, DiMaio, P.J. Axelsson, and Tim Taylor, in their
valuable checking role. He kept borrowing from that line in Game 1,
sprinkling the three into different combinations, in hopes
something would click.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton came here wishing that he could play in Game 1. He left
Wilmington Wednesday with the dream of convincing Burns that he was
OK to play. Burns wouldn't listen. When the game began, Thornton
was in the stands, hearing the heavy Hurricane bodychecks resonate
through the building.

   ``Did I say, `Thank God?' '' said Thornton, asked if, when he
saw the hitting, he was thankful not to bring his battered body
into battle. ``No, it wasn't like that. But I suppose it was smart
(to sit out), just in case I ran into someone like that, I might
have ended up worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight hours later, cured and eager, Thornton gets his
turn. Look out, Lourdes. There could be another player in the
miracle game.

KOSOVO LIBERATION ARMY APPARENTLY HAS A SURPLUS OF RECRUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNWOOD, Texas _ Azem S. and his younger brother, Beqir, are
prepared to die.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of men in New York, Chicago, Germany,
Switzerland, even small towns in Central Texas, the ethnic Albanian
brothers would like to leave the homes and families they have
worked so hard for to join the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But the KLA, once a radical nationalist group that enjoyed few
members in its ranks, is apparently so overrun with recruits from
around the world that it is turning away healthy and willing men
like Azem and Beqir.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many men joining the KLA and they have no weapons
for them,'' Azem said. ``Also, I'm not too young. They're looking
for younger men, more strong men. They told me to wait a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago that the KLA was merely a rag-tag
guerrilla group that sought independence from Serbia, sometimes
using violent methods. But some estimates now put the KLA at around
30,000, some 2,000 of them from the United States who have joined
since hostilities increased a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the KLA staged its only public induction of
recruits from the United States. Almost 400 Albanians gathered
outside a hotel in Yonkers, N.Y., before flying to Tirana. A group
of about 10 Albanians from North Texas, including Ramiz Halili of
Granbury, left with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, the KLA recruited anyone, but now, they're
more selective,'' said Shirley Cloyes, an adviser to the New
York-based Albanian-American Civic League, a lobby organization.
``They've become more professionalized as an army.''
</P>
<P>
   That increased selectiveness has left Azem, 38, and Beqir, 34,
out of the fighting, at least for now. The two brothers _ and three
others _ continue to work long hours in the kitchens of their pizza
and pasta joints in Burleson and Brownwood.
</P>
<P>
   Their story is one of conflicted emotions, torn between the
security of their homes in the United States and their allegiance
to Kosova, the Albanian spelling for their home.
</P>
<P>
   It is also testimony to the fear this war has brought, even to
Brownwood, that the brothers asked that their last name not be
published, because they don't want their family in Kosovo targeted
for what they said here.
</P>
<P>
   The six brothers and four sisters of the family were raised on a
large farm in the southern part of the province, an area where most
of the family still lives.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, Azem had settled in New Jersey, the cradle of Albanian
immigration in the United States. Fully half of the 500,000
Albanians in the country live in the New Jersey/New York area. A
majority are Muslim, but a significant minority are either Eastern
Orthodox or Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the brothers settled in North Texas, where about
1,000 Albanians make their homes, following friends who moved here
to set up one of the many small Italian restaurants that have
popped up in shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   America is unquestionably their home now. Azem's children, a
7-year-old boy and 5-year-old girl, know no other. But their
parents, uncles, aunts and cousins are somewhere in Kosovo, out of
touch since the bombing began and presumably in great danger. They
believe two cousins have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to leave. Who wants to fight a war?'' Azem said.
``But we have to go. We have relatives. How would you feel if your
parents are not safe, if they are waiting to be killed or raped?
Who would want to leave good life here?''
</P>
<P>
   Azem and Beqir, who are in contact with commanders in the KLA,
said the group is mostly having to conduct a guerrilla war against
the Serbian army, which has far more and heavier weapons. The KLA
is also trying to protect refugees who have poured out of the
country, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could buy an F-16,'' Azem cracked, only
half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   While enjoying a resurgence among the Albanian diaspora, the KLA
has been compared to a terrorist organization and Congress has thus
far shied away from helping to arm its members. The KLA's financial
support now comes almost entirely from Albanians living abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Cloyes, the wife of a former New York congressman, strongly
denied the terrorist assertions, saying the KLA is a ``defense
force, a people's movement'' that has not taken any weapons or
money from fundamentalist Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
   Azem and Beqir aren't buying the accusations either.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you call someone a terrorist who is defending his
home?'' he said. ``KLA isn't fighting in Serbia. They're fighting
in their back yard to protect their homes. Since the war started,
do you see any Serb civilians get killed by KLA? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Azem and Beqir ever wear the uniform of the KLA or
whether NATO sends in ground troops to take back Kosovo, they
believe God will ensure them victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't send in ground troops, it will take longer. But
the KLA will win,'' Beqir said. ``You can never occupy someone
forever. You can occupy someone for one year, two year, 30 years,
500 years like Turks. But not forever.''

 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Wasted by drugs, his voice broken, the addict on the
line begged for help from Herzl Ben-Aharon, the late-night host on
an ultra-Orthodox pirate radio station, the Voice of Kindness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see only darkness and I want to see light,'' said the
addict, who identified himself only as Yitzhak. ``Physically I'm
alive, but my soul has been dead for a long time,'' he said,
crying.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Aharon appealed to his listeners for contributions so that
Yitzhak could join a drug rehabilitation program. The money was
raised in minutes, and Yitzhak was beside himself with gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``With God's help, I take upon myself to repent and return to
the faith,'' he promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yitzhak, we love you,'' Ben-Aharon said. ``Commit to repent
tonight, and you will be granted the goodness of the Creator. Say a
prayer now for the love of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Yitzhak responded, ``Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the
Lord is One!'' To applause in the studio, Ben-Aharon chimed in,
``Well done, Rebbe Yitzhak.''
</P>
<P>
   Part revival meeting, part yeshiva of the airwaves,
ultra-Orthodox radio in Israel offers spiritual solace, community
assistance and religious guidance to untold thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The programming, geared mostly to Sephardic Jews of traditional
bent, is a window into a culture that is a world apart from
Israel's mainstream secular society, catering to entirely different
listener preferences.
</P>
<P>
   On about a dozen ultra-Orthodox pirate stations that have sprung
up in recent years, several of them in Jerusalem, rabbis and other
broadcasters serve up a mix of biblical lessons and Jewish music,
inspirational sermons, family counseling, stories for children and
charity collections for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting sole allegiance to rabbinic authority and rejecting
government regulation, the stations operate without licenses.
Although they are occasionally been shut down by the police, they
usually go back on the air unimpeded, offering what they call a
``positive Jewish'' alternative to what the broadcasters see as
hopelessly permissive radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   On ``the holy channels,'' as the stations call themselves,
announcers dispense dream interpretations to callers, warnings
against the evil eye, and morality tales about divine reward and
punishment. They exhort nonreligious listeners to become observant.
</P>
<P>
   Talk shows field questions from listeners that range from
marital and child-rearing problems to the occult. On a recent
broadcast, a listener complained that she had been suffering
headaches since she accidentally laundered an amulet, erasing some
of its sacred words. Other callers poured out personal troubles,
asking for a blessing from the rabbi in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   There are no news reports. Instead, programs have featured live
events like a newly religious listener smashing his television set
on the air and another ripping up a secular newspaper, ridding
themselves of the temptations of the material world.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to frequent appeals, listeners donate food, household
goods and appliances to needy families. In keeping with a strict
interpretation of religious law, women's voices are not heard. The
announcers are all male, the music is by male singers only, and
calls from women listeners are relayed by the broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news on Israel radio is hype and idle talk,'' said Shmuel
Ben-Attar, director of The Whole Truth, a pirate station linked to
the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party Shas. ``The music there has
lyrics we can't listen to. The programs are full of malicious
gossip. We talk about eternal matters, not passing fancies. People
have begun discovering the Torah _ why they're living in this
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lend an ear,'' Ben-Attar continued, adding that the station
is supported by donations. ``We've flown sick people for operations
abroad, reformed criminals through our broadcasts and counseled
couples on the verge of divorce. Prisoners have called us from
jail; they want to discover God. This is community radio that the
state should take on as a project instead of harassing us. It's a
disgrace that we have to operate underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Attar spoke in his station's makeshift studio in a shabby,
smoke-filled hotel suite with a false number on the door to hide
its location. The station has been shut down more than once, and a
sign warned employees to check carefully before opening the door.
</P>
<P>
   The Whole Truth and other such stations seemed to get a new
lease on life recently when the Israeli Parliament passed a bill
legalizing pirate stations that have been broadcasting for at least
five years.
</P>
<P>
   But enforcement of the law, originally drafted to legalize a
station run by Jewish settlers on the West Bank, has been held up
by a challenge in the Israeli Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the pirate stations argue that because they are
unregulated, they can carry inflammatory messages. One rigorously
Orthodox pirate broadcaster was arrested and his station was
dismantled last month after he made a death threat on the air
against a leftist member of Parliament, Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
   Despite, or perhaps because of, their run-ins with the law, the
``holy channels'' enjoy enormous popularity among their listeners,
whose numbers have never been authoritatively determined.
</P>
<P>
   David Ohana, a newly religious grocer who grew up as a secular
Jew, said he did not miss the news on mainstream Israeli radio and
television. ``I'm not interested in hearing who robbed, murdered or
committed suicide,'' he said. ``There are many lies on the news.
Thank God we listen to the words of the Torah.''
</P>
<P>
   To both broadcasters and listeners, these pirate stations are a
bulwark against what they see as the permissiveness of Israeli
society and culture.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent program on the Voice of Kindness, Rabbi Menashe Yona
cautioned listeners against pitfalls they might encounter on a mere
walk down the street.
</P>

   ``A person goes outside, the atmosphere is inflamed, women are
wearing all kinds of immodest clothes and leading the holy sons of
Israel into sin,'' Rabbi Yona said. ``We must not feast our eyes.
When a young man overcomes his desire and lowers his eyes, his soul
is granted the grace of God.''

CHINA ESCAPES CENSURE IN VOTE BY U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS AGENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Human rights advocates failed to secure international
condemnation of China's rights record on Friday, but they eked out,
by one vote, a censure of Cuba by the U.N.'s top rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   China was able to evade criticism at the U.N. Human Rights
Commission when member nations backed its ``no action'' motion,
which blocked any debate on complaints against it. This was the
eighth time that China has succeeded in avoiding full-blown
scrutiny on human rights since the first resolution was brought
after the military suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators at
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution on Cuba, sponsored by the Czech Republic and
Poland, was adopted in a 22-21 vote by the 53-member commission,
which is in the final stages of its annual six-week session that
reviews human-rights violations worldwide. Russia and China were
among nations that abstained.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the Chinese motion was 22-17, with 14 abstentions.
There were few surprises, as China won support from Russia, India
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates burst into applause when the vote tally was announced.
This year, however, the mood was more businesslike than for China's
victory in 1997, when it also used procedural tactics to bury
debate on its rights record. In 1998, the United States declined to
field a critical resolution, citing Beijing's steps to improve
democratic rights for its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But with the crackdown on pro-democracy advocates toward the end
of last year, the United States once again mounted an effort to
call China to account on human rights. The effort seemed rocky from
the start, as only Poland signed on, just two days ago, as a
co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Hongju Koh, the American assistant secretary of state,
said that although he was ``deeply disappointed,'' he felt that the
United States had achieved its goal of focusing ``international
attention on the sharp deterioration in the human rights situation
in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defeat, the United States narrowed the margin of
China's victory. Two years ago, China won by 10 votes, 27-17. This
year, only five nations tipped the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The effort against Cuba was led by two formerly Communist
nations, the Czech Republic and Poland, which chalked up a win on a
measure expressing concern over ``continued repression'' in Cuba
and urging the release of all those imprisoned for their political
or religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a blow to the United States, its resolution on
Cuba was defeated for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Cuba benefited from Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba,
which many believed signaled that the island nation was relaxing
its strict hold on its citizens. But recent convictions of four
dissidents accused of trying to subvert the Communist state brought
widespread criticism of Fidel Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   Voting on dozens of other resolutions that highlighted
violations worldwide, the U.N. rights watchdog also voted to
condemn Israel's actions in detaining thousands of Palestinians
without trial and taking over Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem.
Only the United States voted against the measure. Israel is not a
member of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's rights record was condemned overwhelmingly, 35-0, with 18
nations abstaining. A resolution criticizing Iran's rights record,
particularly its discrimination against women as well as its
treatment of religions like the Bahai, passed 23-16, with 14
abstentions.

MULTITUDE OF ERIC HARRIS PAGES SPROUT ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're full of rough sketches of knife-wielding warriors,
apocalyptic song lyrics, and youthful bravado. At first glance,
they could be the on-line ramblings of any teenager obsessed with
pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   These eerie postings are allegedly the Web pages of Eric D.
Harris, a 17-year-old presumed gunman in the Littleton, Colo.
massacre. The pages were removed from the Internet on Tuesday night
by the service provider America Online and were later subpoenaed by
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Replicas of the pages have emerged in mirror sites all over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting on Tuesday, on-line sleuths have scoured the
Internet to find the pages. Web addresses with any reference to the
words ``trench coat mafia,'' the assailants' teen group, were
bombarded with hits.
</P>
<P>
   Early this week, on-line discussion groups overflowed with
queries about where to find the material on-line. In the first few
days after the tragedy, most of the answers led to dead ends, since
the pages had been removed from their original addresses.
</P>
<P>
   But as of Friday, the bulletin boards teemed with addresses of
Internet users who had captured the original material and reposted
it, with or without commentary. Some of the mirror sites have
already been removed by Internet service providers, but the sites
are going up as fast as they are being taken down.
</P>
<P>
   One of the mirror sites is set up as a sort of resource center
on Harris's Web activity, with photos from the high school
yearbook, copies of the various profiles Harris allegedly posted on
AOL, and news items. This site, which goes by the name ``Soupfreaks
Page of Madness,'' is run by David Hillenbrand, 31, a salesman in
Montclair, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when something like this affects so many people in the
way it did, people want to know what's going on in the mind of
these kids,'' Hillenbrand said in a telephone interview Friday. ``I
know I wanted to see it, and it shows a lot about these kids. They
were living in a fantasy world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillenbrand received the material by posting messages in on-line
bulletin boards. Several of his computer-savvy contacts captured
the pages after the shootings began, and they have been sharing the
information with others all over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One file, labeled simply ``The Book,'' is a primer on how to
build explosives. The description of the bombs contains a chilling
foreshadowing of the suicidal massacre: ``Since they won't be used
until NBK , it'll be kind of hard to report the results,'' the file
said, the ``NBK'' probably referring to the film ``Natural Born
Killers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You might try asking the survivors if they got a good look at
the bomb before it went off and then the remains!'' the file added.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mirror sites, including the one posted by
Hillenbrand, include clear warnings against using the bomb manual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that some people might use the information for
the wrong reasons, but they're in the minority,'' Hillenbrand said.
``That's sort of something you have to live with when you want to
have freedom of speech. The majority of people are just interested
in finding out what triggered these kids, and that kind of
information should be preserved so people can see it.''

 &HT;    LETTER FROM ALBANIA: UNFILING TONIGHT -- HERE'S WHY
 &HT;    With Photo Mug of Albright.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary categories.

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ ProForndesk ExAlbright: Sorry, Unfiling
Tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Friday's been one of those bad hair days.
</P>
<P>
   It started at 6:15 a.m. when I tried to check my e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   It's taken the last two weeks in Albania to get a reliable way
to send stories. We think there is no need to give further
sustenance to the quick-study capitalists who run the Rogner Hotel
business center and charge $7 a minute for overseas calls.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I went to bed about midnight Thursday, I had signed
up with two local internet service providers for the next three
months. Supposedly I could file stories by e-mail any time of the
day and it would cost us only pennies.
</P>
<P>
   My first internet provider, Abissnet, had to go. They'd only
been in business for a week.
</P>
<P>
   I signed up a rival called Adanet. Cox is Adanet's customer
number 300. The company has been in business all of a month.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, our communications finally seemed to be purring.
</P>
<P>
   But then on Friday morning, I picked up the phone in the
apartment we've just rented and there was no dial tone. It was the
next-worst thing that could have happened besides a lightning surge
that zapped my hard-drive.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment phones were down, and I had no time to ask anyone
about it_ even if I could speak Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   I had to rush for breakfast at the Rogner Hotel here, where most
of the journalists are staying. Then my driver had to hustle out to
Rinas Air Field and try to catch a helicopter for the largest
concentration of refugees near the northeastern border in Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two weeks, Marcia Kunstel, my journalistic colleague
(who happens to be my wife), has been covering the flight of the
refugees to Kukes. And now I've gotten word that she needs things
-- a bunch of cash, a pair of Travelsmith quick-drying pants and
some undershirts.
</P>
<P>
   Getting up north to Kukes seemed do-able Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For the last week, I've been chatting up a certain Col. Salem
from the United Arab Emirates, or UAE, who has his own tent inside
the Rinas Air Field.
</P>
<P>
   Out of Muslim solidarity with the Kosovo refugees, the emirs of
UAE have dispatched Col. Salem and others, along with eight
French-made Puma helicopters, to support a slice of the refugees in
Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   To my delight, Col. Salem remembered my face when I turned up in
his operations tent inside the airfield.
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Saalem Aleichem,'' which roughly means, ``Hello, God
Be With You.'' The colonel said, ``Aleichem Salem,'' (''And God be
With You.'')
</P>
<P>
   By now it is 9 a.m. Friday in Tirana, and pouring big-time.
</P>
<P>
   Someone appeared with a delicious cup of Arabic coffee that the
UAE helicopter pilots had brewed up over a field stove. That cup
was one of the best things that had happened to me in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, my friend Col. Salem said he'd cancelled journalists'
right to fly on all friendly helicopter flights to Kukes. Bad
weather, he said.
</P>
<P>
   I had five hours to kill before the only U.S. military ``media
availability'' of the day -- billed by the U.S. Army briefers as a
chance to meet a female Blackhawk pilot who wouldn't be flying in
the strikes into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   I decide that there will be time to drive up north to an old
Albanian fighter base called Gjader Air Base. Colleagues say the
U.S. military used the Gjader base a few years ago to launch drone
helicopters over Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The betting in the press corps is that the Americans will pretty
soon move back into Gjader, perhaps for the U.S. Marines or perhaps
for the Army's MLRS rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Mike Hedges of Scripps-Howard, a pal from the Gulf
War press pools, I decided to drive north and check out what's
happening at Gjader.
</P>
<P>
   It should be only a two hours' drive. But when our driver Ilir
and his 1982 Mercedes taxi gets to the outskirts of the town of
Lac, we hit a traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Mike and I, and his photographer, get out of the Mercedes and
make our way through a crowd of about 500 Albanians to the center
of Lac.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder traffic is tied up. We see a half-dozen guys with
black masks over their heads. They are carrying Kalashnikovs.
</P>
<P>
   We hear some of them shooting a burst or two into what looks
like a restaurant with a big Coca-Cola sign over the entrance.
Someone inside is shooting back. It seems that the Coca-Cola guy
had been whacked.
</P>
<P>
   We lose about an hour, and our trip to the Gjader Air Base was
almost a total waste. The Albanian soldiers on duty at the sentry
posts said they hadn't seen any Americans in a long time. A look
around showed that they weren't fibbing.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike and I decided there was still time to make the Army
briefing back at Rinas Air Field at 4 p.m. -- despite the alarming
potholes on the road to Gjader.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't count on hitting a world-class traffic jam on
Albania's main north-south highway. It made think about how tough
it is going to be for the U.S. Army to move forward in the next
week toward the Kosovo border. Most of the state highways in
Albania look like abandoned logging roads in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Though we'd missed the military briefing by nearly two hours,
all was not lost.
</P>
<P>
   When we got back to our Tirana apartment, we found that the
telephone had regained its dialtone. We were on-line again.
</P>
<P>
   I used the momentary access to dial the internet to check my
e-mails. Then I headed off for the Rogner Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Three things caught my attention in the Rogner's Gift Shop.
</P>
<P>
   To change my luck, I decide to buy all of them: a copy of the
``Blue Guide'' for Albania, an oversized Swiss Army knife and a
bottle of Finlandia vodka.
</P>
<P>
   When I got back to the Cox apartment, I used my thumbnail to
open one of the little blades of the Swiss Army knife. This is what
I used to try and slash open the plastic top of the Finlandia
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss Army knife and Finlandia bottle -- it was a bad
combination.
</P>
<P>
   The knife slipped. Instead of cutting off the clear plastic
collar around the bottle cap, the blade punctured my right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   The blood started flowing. It keeps flowing, as though I
deserved a Purple Heart. After a while, I put my thumb into the
freezer compartment of the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding finally stops.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow I'll try to explain to my Albanian landlord about why
there is frozen blood in her refrigerator.

   The betting in the press corps is that the Americans will pretty
soon move back into Gjader, perhaps for the U.S. Marines or perhaps
for the Army's MLRS rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Mike Hedges of Scripps-Howard, a pal from the Gulf
War press pools, I decided to drive north and check out what's
happening at Gjader.
</P>
<P>
   It should be only a two hours' drive. But when our driver Ilir
and his 1982 Mercedes taxi gets to the outskirts of the town of
Lac, we hit a traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Mike and I, and his photographer, get out of the Mercedes and
make our way through a crowd of about 500 Albanians to the center
of Lac.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder traffic is tied up. We see a half-dozen guys with
black masks over their heads. They are carrying Kalashnikovs.
</P>
<P>
   We hear some of them shooting a burst or two into what looks
like a restaurant with a big Coca-Cola sign over the entrance.
Someone inside is shooting back. It seems that the Coca-Cola guy
had been whacked.
</P>
<P>
   We lose about an hour, and our trip to the Gjader Air Base was
almost a total waste. The Albanian soldiers on duty at the sentry
posts said they hadn't seen any Americans in a long time. A look
around showed that they weren't fibbing.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike and I decided there was still time to make the Army
briefing back at Rinas Air Field at 4 p.m. -- despite the alarming
potholes on the road to Gjader.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't count on hitting a world-class traffic jam on
Albania's main north-south highway. It made think about how tough
it is going to be for the U.S. Army to move forward in the next
week toward the Kosovo border. Most of the state highways in
Albania look like abandoned logging roads in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Though we'd missed the military briefing by nearly two hours,
all was not lost.
</P>
<P>
   When we got back to our Tirana apartment, we found that the
telephone had regained its dialtone. We were on-line again.
</P>
<P>
   I used the momentary access to dial the internet to check my
e-mails. Then I headed off for the Rogner Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Three things caught my attention in the Rogner's Gift Shop.
</P>
<P>
   To change my luck, I decide to buy all of them: a copy of the
``Blue Guide'' for Albania, an oversized Swiss Army knife and a
bottle of Finlandia vodka.
</P>
<P>
   When I got back to the Cox apartment, I used my thumbnail to
open one of the little blades of the Swiss Army knife. This is what
I used to try and slash open the plastic top of the Finlandia
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss Army knife and Finlandia bottle -- it was a bad
combination.
</P>
<P>
   The knife slipped. Instead of cutting off the clear plastic
collar around the bottle cap, the blade punctured my right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   The blood started flowing. It keeps flowing, as though I
deserved a Purple Heart. After a while, I put my thumb into the
freezer compartment of the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding finally stops.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow I'll try to explain to my Albanian landlord about why
there is frozen blood in her refrigerator.
</P>

D.C. UNITED-REVOLUTION GAME SHOULD BE A JAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rowdiness of the RFK Stadium crowd should be reduced for the
D.C. United-Revolution game Saturday night, and not because of the
50th anniversary celebrations of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. If anything, the presence of the world peacekeepers'
congregation will make traveling to the stadium potentially as
hectic as last week, when the largest regular-season home crowd
(35,167) in D.C. United history caused traffic jams and led to
disorderly conduct in the parking lots and long lines at the ticket
windows.
</P>
<P>
   This should be more like a typical United-Revolution game, with
D.C. setting the pace, the Revolution disrupting, and the fireworks
more likely to occur somewhere near the Revolution bench.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team has lost in regulation time this season. But
because of the Major League Soccer rule of deciding tied games,
this will not be a matchup of the top two teams in the Eastern
Conference. If the MLS abided by FIFA regulations, D.C. United
would be in first place with 8 points and the Revolution in second
with 6. Instead, United has 7 points and the Revolution have 3,
since the teams have a 1-4 record in post-match shootouts.
</P>
<P>
   Further illustrating the contradictions and complications of
what is known as ``the simplest game,'' Revolution player-coach
Walter Zenga was dismayed to discover that he is ranked third among
goalkeepers in goals-against and shutouts but among the worst in
winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are superfluous in soccer, fortunately, and
measurements of the status of a team must be otherwise determined.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have made remarkable defensive improvements, but
in two of their four games, a player has had a major dispute with
either Zenga or assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi. Following the
season-opener in Fort Lauderdale, Carlos Rocha was waived after
demonstrably rejecting Zenga's criticism. Early in the second half
of last week's game against Columbus, midfielder Edwin Gorter was
substituted and hostily encountered Galderisi on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes before, Gorter had complained in a live television
interview that he spent the first half watching the ball fly
overhead like airplanes taking off. Indeed, Gorter was hardly a
factor in a game that almost completely bypassed midfield.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorter did provide a moment of magic, sending a defender
sprawling with some sleight-of-foot, and setting up Johnny Torres
for what could have been the deciding goal. Torres, who had
converted off a Gorter feed for the tying goal against D.C. United
the week before, missed this time and the match ended 0-0 in
regulation time.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Gorter and Zenga had a lengthy discussion in the
Stadium Club. The issue did not seem completely resolved, however,
and there was speculation that Gorter could join the Miami Fusion,
which was attempting to jettison Carlos Valderrama. For now, Gorter
has regained his status as the Revolution's midfield reference
point, at least nominally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edwin has been working hard and has put everything in the
past,'' Galderisi said Friday. ``The team had a meeting on Tuesday
and he knows what is expected of him and of everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my playing career, I used to fight, too. But during the
game, I would run for you. When it came time to play, I would be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorter's complaint about the Revolution's lack of offensive
style is not likely to be easily resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively, we have to have a positive mentality,''
Galderisi said. ``We will do our best with the qualities we have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former D.C. midfielder John Harkes (right knee sprain) will be
among the Revolution reserves for the first time this season, but
his first extensive action is expected to be against Colorado at
Foxboro Stadium May 1 . . . United goalkeeper Tom Presthus is out
with the combination of a right groin strain and a fever as high as
104 degrees caused by an undetermined virus.

CITY GALS RIDE HERD ON COWS AT WYOMING RANCH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBOIS, Wyo. _ A grin coiled like a rattlesnake at the side of
the wrangler's mouth as he explained the particulars of a cattle
roundup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only thing dumber 'n' a cow,'' he drawled from atop his horse,
``is a cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a real cowboy and being real polite, he didn't carry the
conversation a step further. But as he hawked a wet wad of snoose
to the ground and studied our group of city slickers from beneath
the shadows of his broad-brimmed hat, I couldn't help wondering if
there was more to this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only thing dumber 'n' a cowboy,'' I could picture him saying,
as he sidled up to the town tavern to order a double whiskey, ``is
a bunch of latte-sucking urbanites who pay $1,200 apiece to chase
around a bunch of cows for a week in the quote-unquote Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   It's dumb, maybe, but fun.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of git-down, yeee-haw, sweaty, dirty fun a rambunctious
cowgal just can't find in the big city of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   For six days, our all-girl group of Ibuprofen-poppin'
wranglerettes put the giddy in giddy-up as we swore at cattle,
nursed saddle sores and laughed at ourselves during the fall
roundup at the Bitterroot Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch, a 640-acre spread renowned for the quality and care
of its 170-odd horses, is 18 miles up a dirt road from the frontier
town of Dubois (Doo-boys) in a sparsely populated country where
bumper stickers affixed to beater trucks read: ``Have you hugged
your hoss today?'' and ``To hell with the whale. Save the cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   We were among 19 guests: 17 women, two men. A ``dudeless
ranch,'' one woman called it. As dudeless ranches go, it was of the
horsiest variety.
</P>
<P>
   Guests averaged four to six hours daily in the saddle. Most were
experienced riders; some owned horses. Nevertheless, after the
first day, knees ached, bums were numbed and walking bow-legged
felt unnaturally natural.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention hat hair? It was squished unmercifully under the
safety helmets that are de rigueur at this ranch, thanks to
cautionary tales of bucked-off riders doing head-first landings.
One of our riders, thrown when his horse hit a badger hole at full
gallop, came back with a cracked helmet and fully functional brain.
</P>
<P>
   It turned up the spotlight on this hot fashion trend.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in a picturesque valley in the Absaroka Mountain range
near Yellowstone National Park, the 7,500-foot-high Bitterroot
Ranch is surrounded by Indian reservation and public lands,
including acreage held by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and
the Shoshone National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves a wide playing field for guests, who may head down
any of more than 100 trails. Some trails pass through beaver
marshes frequented by elk and bear, into hills where antelope leap
across the horizon like cottontails on steroids. Other trails lead
to 60 million-year-old fossil beds or climb from aspen-lined
riverbeds to hilly vistas looking out on the jagged white teeth of
the freshly frosted Absarokas.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery is starkly stunning, outlined in light and shadow
like an Ansel Adams study. It is so dry, the wind makes the grass
whisper and dirt crumbles to dust between the fingers. And it's
still wild enough that hikers venturing a quarter-mile from their
cabins may find animal bones with fresh meat still attached,
testament to after-hours feasting by coyotes or mountain lions.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a land that tolerates pretension, and the Bitterroot
Ranch doesn't attempt it. This is a dude ranch only in the
strictest sense. There are no gift shops, no golf courses, no
hayrides, no tennis courts, no paid storytellers and no organized
games.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at the Bitterroot arise to a down-home cacophony of
neighing horses, honking geese, bleating cows and timing-impaired
roosters, who cock-a-doodle-doo at all hours of the day. Guinea
fowl, peacocks, ducks and chickens run free across the yards, and a
ranch dog may slump across your cabin porch, begging a pet.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 rustic cabins, which can accommodate up to 32 guests, are
simple and comfy, clumped close to the East Fork of the Wind River
that snakes through the property. Buffet meals are fresh and
abundant, and wine flows freely at dinner. Evening entertainment
may be a hootenanny 'round the piano, a game of pool or Scrabble, a
video from the film library, a hot-tub soak under the Milky Way, or
a long after-dinner chat with ranch owners Mel and Bayard Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The chat's bound to intrigue. Mel, a lean, handsome, no-nonsense
woman who is a former Olympic-class runner, grew up on a farm in
Tanzania and spent many years working with wildlife in East Africa.
She takes great pride in the Arabian horses she breeds and trains
at the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Bayard, a mustachioed, 6-foot-4 raconteur approaching his 70th
birthday, graduated from Yale University and worked overseas for
the CIA before buying the Bitterroot in 1971. His eyes wrinkle up
like a drawstring purse as he tells exotic tales of being chased by
lions or working undercover as a diamond hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The Foxes have turned their passion for horses and traveling
into an international business called Equitour. It offers rides in
such off-beat locales as Turkey, Zimbabwe, Iceland, Wales and
France.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming ranch is one of six domestic operations. At the
Bitterroot, a typical ride climbs 3,000 feet and covers 15 miles.
Rides are split into small groups, according to riding ability.
During the cattle roundup, the more experienced riders head for
high country to roust out cattle _ leaping logs, ducking branches
and scrambling up shale cliffs _ while the least experienced
content themselves with low-country riding.
</P>
<P>
   I belonged to the low-country club. Our job was to help push the
cows back to the ranch, where they were loaded onto rigs and
shipped to lower pastures to winter.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know what to do with a cow, but my horse, a once-wild
mustang, did. All I had to do was aim this alpha male _ a half-ton
of pure guy _ and he headed after the strays, nipping them in their
thick black rumps and setting the whole herd in mooing motion.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing quite compares with sitting atop a fine, feisty horse,
micromanaging a bunch of clueless cows and breathing deep the
green, manure-stained air that attends a cattle drive. It's a raw
and raucous scene.
</P>
<P>
   Cows bawl plaintively, their eyes big black puddles of woe.
Occasionally, two belligerent bulls stop for a duel. And
inevitably, moving boy cows attempt to mount moving girl cows, with
city slickers yelling ``git'' and ``haw'' and ``Get off her, you
moron.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, I counted 12 Bitterroot guests bossing around
eight bewildered cows. The cows didn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that thought was playing beneath the broad-brimmed hat of
the snoose-chewing cowboy. Or maybe he was thinking something
altogether different as he cantered over to the scrub-brush site
where our group of cowgals dismounted after a hard day's herding.
</P>
<P>
   But being a real cowboy and being real polite, he adjusted the
hat, looked off at the craggy horizon and made a quiet
pronouncement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ya girls done good,'' he said, letting the words set a spell
in the high dry mountain air.
</P>
<P>
   We drank each word in, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   The Bitterroot Ranch offers horse lovers a choice of adventures,
from cattle roundups to pack trips. The 1999 riding season is May
23-Sept. 30, and trips begin at $1,200. For information, call
Equitour at 800-545-0019.

US OFFERS $70 MILLION TO BOOST SCHOOL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, grasping for ways to
prevent another school massacre, Friday rushed $70 million to local
communities for school-security programs and launched a new round
of gun-control initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The $70 million is expected to pay for 600 additional police
officers for school security in 336 cities and towns across the
country. In New England, 46 communities will share $6.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The funds were released three days after 12 students and a
teacher were slain at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., by
two gun-wielding students who also killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``By taking actions to prevent future acts of violence in our
schools, we can best honor the memories of those who lost their
lives,'' President Clinton said in a statement before he opened
NATO's 50th anniversary summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Justice Department will make available $1.5
million to families of the shooting victims to pay for funerals,
medical bills, lost wages, counseling and other expenses. He said
the aid, provided through the Crime Victims Trust Fund, will ``help
the communities assist the victims in their long journey toward
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, will represent the
administration Sunday at a memorial service in Littleton for the
shooting victims. Clinton will be attending the NATO summit.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up the push for stricter gun laws aimed at curbing
school shootings, the White House plans to pursue legislation that
would hold parents criminally liable if their children gain access
to household guns. The administration also will propose a lifetime
ban on gun ownership by juveniles who are convicted of violent
crimes. And Clinton will press for a law that requires
manufacturers to put child safety locks on guns.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House wants to make it illegal for
individuals under the age of 21 to buy assault-style weapons that
were manufactured before 1994, when a ban on making such weapons
took effect. Current law permits anyone over 18 to buy
assault-style weapons.
</P>
<P>
   However, each of the gun-control initiatives is expected to face
stiff opposition in the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As for the $70 million for tighter school security, Clinton said
the additional officers ``will work closely with the citizens they
serve _ with students, teachers and parents _ to improve campus
security, counsel troubled youth and medicate conflicts before they
escalate into violence.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin optional trim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts will receive $2.2 million in the current funding,
enough for 18 cities and towns to hire at least one full-time
police officer to work in the schools. Communities in the Boston
area that will receive funds include Bridgewater, Foxborough,
Framingham, Haverhill, Methuen, Newburyport, Revere, Swampscott,
and Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   Many other communities will receive aid this year as the
administration tries to meet its goal of funding 1,400 school
officers in addition to the 600 who will be hired with the money
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end optional trim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also reminded school districts they have until the end
of April to apply for $17 million in Justice Department funds to
develop programs aimed at strengthening their partnerships with
local law enforcement agencies. The programs focus on school crime,
drug use, and student discipline problems.
</P>
<P>
   Local communities also have until June 1 to apply for $180
million in federal grants from the Safe Schools-Healthy Students
program, which is aimed at reducing violence and drug abuse in the
schools.

NATO: A REALITY CHECK AT 50 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This week's NATO commemorative was planned as a
celebration of a half-century of peace and triumph over tyranny and
ethnic strife. The proceedings instead will be a mixture of
solemnity and ceremony for an organization at war _ and at a loss
to halt a new threat of ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of its history, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, founded in a downtown Washington building constructed
largely of crushed oysters, has been part military alliance, part
symbol. And though the session began Friday morning with a
three-hour meeting on the organization's military operations in the
Balkans, the real utility of the anniversary summit may be as a
symbol of how swiftly, and how dramatically, world challenges _ and
NATO's focus _ have changed in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   This is an organization whose original worry was the security of
central Europe. Now it is engaged in a war on the periphery of
Europe. This is an organization whose strategic orientation was a
major war involving rival big powers. Now it is engaged in a civil
war involving tiny ethnic enclaves and small political
principalities. This is an organization whose focus was
ideological. Now it is fighting a war that is tribal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, NATO was formed to create European solidarity. Its
greatest challenge comes now in a fight over European divisions.
</P>
<P>
   This week's meeting of more than 40 leaders is a gathering of an
organization that won the Cold War _ but is in danger of losing the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Since the original dozen nations created NATO in April 1949, the
West has prevailed in a tense confrontation with Soviet communism,
moving to the brink of war several times in tense face-offs with a
rival superpower in Europe, holding its breath over insurrections
in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, watching nervously as proxy wars
between the two blocs were fought far from Europe in Korea,
Vietnam, the cqCongo, and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, however, the great beginning being celebrated here
this weekend is far different from the reality being contemplated
here this week.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance began amid the Berlin airlift, when thousands of
Allied sorties supplied food, fuel, and mail to a city cut off by
Soviet troops, and its commemoration is being held the same week
Germans celebrated reunification by opening the Reichstag again. At
the start, NATO was an institution designed to protect and project
the United States' interests in Europe. Now it increasingly appears
to be an institution to assure that European interests are
addressed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech earlier this month, Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright said that NATO's ``core purpose'' was to act ``as a
defender of democracy, stability, and basic human decency on
European soil.''
</P>
<P>
   But American strategic interests in Europe today, on the eve of
the 21st century, are much like Britain's in the 19th century: to
assure that no single power dominates Europe. Beyond that,
administration critics argue, the United States has fashioned no
clear vision of its role in the world and no clear task for NATO to
perform. ``NATO's supporters say NATO must survive and must find
something to do,'' says Ted Galen Carpenter, a Cato Institute
diplomatic theorist. ``This is a dangerous confusion of means and
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start, the American obsession was to blunt the westward
movement of Soviet-style communism and the strength of the Warsaw
Pact. It was packaged nicely, as a bulwark of democracy and free
markets, and though its godfather was British foreign secretary
Ernest Bevin, in reality its orientation was military and its
character was American. On the surface it was, as Boston University
historian David Fromkin wrote, ``the sort of alliance Theodore
Roosevelt had espoused: like-minded nations pursuing a common
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's mission was summarized briskly and accurately by
Britain's Lord Ismay, the first NATO secretary general, as ``to
keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Americans are confused, the Russians are gone, and the
Germans are back, which helps explain the situation NATO is in at
its 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo crisis has minor significance geopolitically but
major significance morally. It threatens the stability of the
Balkans but not of Western Europe. It represents the triumph of
European interests over American interests in NATO's calculus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of Europe, this is very significant,'' says Elizabeth
Pond, author of ``The Rebirth of Europe,'' just published by the
Brookings Institution Press. ``Kosovo ceased to be a tactical
question and became a moral question. For the Germans, especially,
it meant `no more Holocaust.' There is a feeling of outrage, that
this sort of thing can start again. It's important for the
self-respect of Europeans that this not be allowed to happen again.
And because it is important to Europe, it is therefore important to
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo crisis also represents a dramatic shift in the sort
of problem NATO was designed to address. The Cold War kept a lid on
the ethnic tensions that had boiled in the Balkans for generations.
Soviet intimidation kept the established states of the region in
line even as Tito kept the ethnic groups apart in a nation whose
citizens wrote in both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, practiced
Roman Catholicism, Greek Orthodoxy, and Islam, and spoke Serb,
Croat, Slovenian, and Macedonian.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Soviet presence is gone, the strategic calculation
has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For nearly 50 years, NATO was oriented and organized to defend
and respond to an attack from the east,'' Senator Richard G. Lugar,
Republican of Indiana, said on the Senate floor this week. ``An
invasion by Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces was the primary threat
facing the alliance. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, new
threats have replaced the nightmare of Soviet armed divisions
crashing through the Fulda Gap. The proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction, rogue states, terrorism, ethnic strife, and other
potentially destabilizing elements now threaten the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO leaders celebrate the alliance's golden anniversary,
they still have not answered the questions of where NATO interests
begin and end, whether and how NATO should work with the United
Nations, and how big NATO should become. The alliance has welcomed
the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland as newcomers, but pointedly
did not invite Slovenia, a stable and democratic part of the former
Yugoslavia that would have given it an anchor in southeastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the inevitable toasts and statements of resolve, the world
leaders meeting here face a sobering thought: The tensions that
opened the century in the Balkans still have not been resolved at
century's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you have a more stable situation in the Balkans,'' says
Stanley Slovan, a former Library of Congress researcher who
specializes in European-alliance issues, ``you do not have a stable
Europe.''

JOURNALISTS OUTRAGED AT BOMBING OF TV STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ NATO's bombing of Serbia's state TV station was widely
denounced by international journalists, who say the attack puts
them in the line of fire in the increasingly bitter war between
NATO and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   While few journalists disputed NATO's claim that Radio
Television Serbia, or RTS, is controlled by Milosevic and
broadcasts propaganda for the regime, many argued that NATO had
endangered the lives of impartial journalists with an attack that
was as ineffective as it was ruthless.
</P>
<P>
   Serb authorities say about 150 people were in the building in
downtown Belgrade when it was struck by missiles. They said at
least 10 were killed. Friday night they were still digging for
about 20 others believed buried in the rubble. Six hours after the
attack, RTS was back on the air from another location.
</P>
<P>
   The International Federation of Journalists accused NATO of
breaking a promise it had given the organization earlier this week
that journalists would not be targeted in its attacks against the
Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing ``could lead to reprisals against independent
journalists and media staff who have been campaigning against media
distortion and control of information by the Milosevic regime,''
said Aidan White, general secretary of the federation, which like
NATO is based in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   White said the attack could have wider repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments who attack the media, whether in the Balkans, in
central Africa or central Asia, will now feel justified in making
journalists and all who work with them legitimate targets,'' said
White.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders said the bombing
``creates a very dangerous precedent.'' The European Broadcasting
Union, which represents TV and radio stations in 49 countries,
called the bombing pointless.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Russian Journalists, openly sympathetic to the
fellow Orthodox Slavs in Serbia, called the attack an attempt to
crush the freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who have a long tradition of denouncing the
Milosevic regime's systematic silencing of an independent press in
Serbia were critical of the NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Ann K. Cooper, executive director of the New York-based
Committee to Protect Journalists, said her organization was
``deeply disturbed'' by the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's decision to target civilian broadcast facilities not
only increases the danger for reporters now working in Yugoslavia
but permanently jeopardizes all journalists as noncombatants in
international conflicts as provided for in the Geneva Convention,''
Cooper said in a letter to NATO secretary general Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said that while her group appreciates NATO's concern
``about the role of RTS in Milosevic's propaganda campaign, we
believe hate speech and propaganda is best countered with increased
objective reporting, not with violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrystyna Lapychak, the Eastern Europe program coordinator for
the Committee to Protect Journalists, said NATO's position on RTS
was hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad enough Yugoslavia was deciding what people can and
cannot watch on television, but now NATO's done the same thing by
bombing the station,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where NATO's 50th anniversary summit is being
held this weekend, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea defended the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb TV station, he said, ``has nothing to do with
journalism.'' It was ``directly responsible for inciting
conditions'' that led to ethnic cleansing in Croatia, Bosnia and
today in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its function is to incite hatred and distort reality. It is
the same thing as a military propaganda machine,'' said Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Ursula Owen, editor in chief of the London-based Index on
Censorship, said she thought NATO's strike against RTS was
premature, saying such an attack should be a last resort and only
if there is no alternative for news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will probably surprise some people familiar with the
Index on Censorship, but I think there are instances when I would
do this. There is a case for stopping (the media) creating a
culture of hate, as happened in Rwanda,'' she said. ``But the fact
is people in Yugoslavia can get Voice of America and CNN. Besides,
to aim for a building which doesn't have any transmitters isn't
incredibly effective. They were back on the air pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   While NATO was unrepentent, and suggested further attacks could
follow, White said its tactics were futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killing journalists and media staff never wins wars or builds
democracy,'' said White. ``It only reinforces ignorance, censorship
and fear.''

LOCALS IN D.C. YIELD GROUND TO NATO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As legions of NATO officials invaded the nation's
capital Friday, the locals promptly retreated.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown area around the NATO summit was eerily quiet as
workers stayed home, scared off by the prospect of closed streets
and streams of motorcades.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic gridlock predicted for days by the local media
failed to materialize as motorists heeded the warnings to take the
subway or avoid the summit area altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also gave 90,000 workers around the
affected area the day off and many other employees opted for a long
weekend, contributing to a deserted feeling in the swath of
buildings between the White House and the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly the only people wandering around were tourists, many of
them trying to figure out how to circumvent the Federal Triangle
area where the event was held and which was off limits to all but
summit participants and the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a ghost town here,'' said Mark Hammond, visiting
from Boston. Hammond, who flew in Thursday night with friends, had
no idea that the NATO event was going on until he arrived at the
airport and noticed signs warning of closed streets.
</P>
<P>
   His friend John Andersen approved of the tight security that
often forced pedestrians to walk blocks out of their way to cross
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering they are bombing, it's probably a good idea,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police and other security forces appeared to be everywhere,
peering down from the rooftops of massive federal buildings,
guarding the street blockades and patrolling the underground Metro
stations.
</P>
<P>
   A number of major thoroughfares, including a stretch of
Pennsylvania Avenue, were closed, as was the Metro station under
Federal Triangle. However, most of the major tourist attractions,
except the Capitol, remained open.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Marie and Bob Montgomery of Albany, N.Y. , who were visiting
with their son Christopher, also said they had no idea about the
NATO meeting before they arrived Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they found the event exciting, particularly the
parade of limousines that chauffeured the leaders from the 19 NATO
nations to and from their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're guessing who's in the cars,'' said Ann Marie Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   She said they were disappointed they could not visit FBI
headquarters because it was closed. Instead, they went to Ford's
Theatre, where Abraham Lincoln was shot.
</P>
<P>
   For the Sprayberry High School Orchestra from Marietta, Ga., the
NATO meeting was a blessing and a curse. As a result of the lack of
traffic, the musicians had no trouble getting to the outdoor square
near Pennsylvania Avenue where they were scheduled to give a
lunchtime performance.
</P>
<P>
   But they also found themselves playing for only a handful of
passers-by in the normally bustling locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy to get here, but unfortunately there is nobody
here to enjoy it,'' said Tom Bennett, the parent of two orchestra
members.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A big bonus for those who defied the warnings and traveled
downtown was the ready availability of prime restaurant seats.
</P>
<P>
   The lines that normally wrap around the trendy Planet Hollywood
at lunchtime didn't materialize. Assistant General Manager Sean
Honan blamed the media for exaggerating the inconvenience that the
summit would cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press kind of made it sound like a nightmare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Simon Landless, an office worker who declined to take the day
off Friday, said the whole affair had been ``overblown.''
</P>
<P>
   He said for many of his co-workers, the NATO meeting was ``just
an excuse to take the day off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people working in our office are the foreigners who
have seen this all before,'' said Landless who is from the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   One couple visiting from England, Bill and Una Thompson, said
they did not understand why the NATO summit was being held in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the NATO nations are in Europe, and yet they have to
come all the way over here,'' said Bill Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, the couple was not terribly
inconvenienced by the three-day event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a good wander about despite this,'' he said.

ANALYSIS: NEITHER NATO NOR YUGOSLAVIA ARE CLOSE TO WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mb) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With NATO's leaders gathered behind closed doors on
Friday to consider their next moves against Yugoslavia, the
alliance's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, offered a strikingly
optimistic view of the progress so far. ``We are winning,'' he
declared. ``He is losing. And he knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO is, in fact, far from winning.
</P>
<P>
   A month into the air campaign in the Balkans, Yugoslavia has
withstood nearly 3,000 combat raids and has shown no signs yet of
breaking. President Slobodan Milosevic has succeeded in expelling
hundreds of thousands of Albanians from Kosovo, routing the rebel
force fighting for Kosovo's independence and steeling the will of
the Serbs in support of his repressive regime.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, NATO's campaign has stumbled over a series of
foreseeable and unforeseeable problems _ from political limitations
on its initial strikes to the uncooperative weather to the
surprisingly effective tactics used by the Yugoslav air defenses to
keep allied pilots guessing.
</P>
<P>
   The latter has forced NATO to alter its raids and put off the
kind of low-flying patrols that could make a real difference
against the tanks and artillery battering Kosovo's villages. The 24
Apache attack helicopters that arrived in Albania this week with
much fanfare are now not expected to begin flying combat strikes
into Kosovo for many more days or weeks, officials said, in large
part because NATO's raids have still not hit the air defenses hard
enough to make it safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's been done right here,'' said Michael
Dugan, a retired general who served as Air Force Chief of Staff.
``The air war has been carried out without much political will or
military decisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   It is very difficult, of course, to assess winners and losers
after only one month of conflict. Thirty days after Iraqi forces
seized Kuwait in August 1990, for instance, it was unclear how
Washington and its allies would evict President Saddam Hussein's
troops.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been much talk _ particularly from the British
and French in recent days _ of sending NATO ground forces into
Kosovo, none of the allies is eager to rush into a land war and
some are downright wary. There is a general understanding, however,
that if the alliance decides to send in ground troops this summer,
it needs to start preparing now.
</P>
<P>
   To commanders at NATO and the Pentagon, Milosevic's achievements
thus far are fleeting, tactical gains that have brought him little
strategic advantage. The expulsion of Albanians, which has
distracted NATO with a parallel relief operation, has only served
to harden the resolve of NATO's 19 members, who are now willing to
approve attacks on more sensitive targets, like Milosevic's homes
and Yugoslavia's state-run television.
</P>
<P>
   Officials vow to continue to grind away at Yugoslavia's military
and political leadership, insisting that time and firepower are on
NATO's side, though time may be what is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic will run out of bullets and gas long before we do,''
a Pentagon official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the United States and it allies laid out
political objectives that military commanders warned would be
difficult to achieve by bombing alone.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the air campaign had three objectives: to
underscore NATO's unity in opposing aggression; to deter Milosevic
from expelling ethnic Albanians; and, if necessary, hurt Belgrade's
ability to wage war by ``seriously diminishing its military
capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The only objective met so far is a firm display of unity.
Yugoslavia's ability to endure the strikes has left NATO no option
but to step up the size and scope of its campaign far more than
envisioned when the attacks began 31 days ago. Clark has asked the
Pentagon to provide 300 more U.S. warplanes and dozens more from
other allies, raising the total to more than 1,000, more than
doubling the number NATO had on hand when the war started.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's campaign has become a case study in gradual escalation,
reflecting Vietnam more than the Persian Gulf War in 1991, when
allied pilots flew as many as 3,000 missions a day, compared with
300 to 600 against Yugoslavia, and targeted the heart of the
political and economic machine in Baghdad from day one.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO launched its strikes, commanders warned that it could
take weeks to break Milosevic's will, although privately, some top
Clinton administration officials were convinced that Milosevic
would fold after a few days of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he became more defiant, and his forces in Kosovo
splintered into smaller groups that were harder to hit. Now many of
those forces are hunkered down in defensive positions out of NATO's
gun sights _ in forests or next to residential buildings and
churches that NATO will not bomb.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unable to eradicate Yugoslav forces in the field, NATO has taken
its attack much closer to Milosevic himself. In addition to his
house and national television, NATO also struck two electricity
transformers, cutting off no only the power to command bunkers in
Belgrade but the residential and commercial areas around them as
well. This signaled a shift to hitting strategic targets aimed at
undercutting Milosevic's popular base _ a strategy that still
relies on an uprising that has no sign of forming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have your rock concerts, but pretty soon it's going to
be Belgrade unplugged,'' the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart,
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question the attacks have hurt Yugoslavia,
destroying its indigenous oil production and shattering its
transportation network as NATO cruise missiles and aircraft pick
off highway and railroad bridges from one end of the country to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pentagon's latest damage assessment, the director of
intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Rear Adm. Thomas
Wilson, described Yugoslavia's military and police forces has badly
strained, running low on fuel and ammunition and harassed by a
down-but-not-out Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But Yugoslavia's forces have been resilient. A defense
intelligence official said the forces in the field learned from
President Saddam Hussein's mistakes in the Persian Gulf War, and
rather than confronting NATO's air power head on they have
effectively tried to slip out of its reach. ``They went to
school,'' the official said. ``They've learned how to offset our
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's leadership has been resilient, too. Milosevic's
special police have been shifting their headquarters to the
basements of various hotels in Belgrade, still functioning despite
the destruction of its headquarters three weeks ago, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   And it was only a matter of hours after American F-117 fighters
leveled the headquarters of Serbian television in Belgrade that
state-controlled programming was again being broadcast, leaving
NATO little option but to go after the backup complexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said on
Friday, openly vowing to hit keep Milosevic's propaganda off the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The question in the end is which side can outlast the other.
NATO's leaders vowed to stay the course, with some Pentagon
commanders warning the attacks could go for months, even though
they have no clear idea when or if Milosevic will relent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to gauge the level of pain that somebody is
willing to endure,'' Wilson said. ``And I don't know what President
Milosevic's level of pain is. But other parts of the society have a
level of pain which may differ. And it's getting higher all the
time. That's all I can say.''

TIMOR VIOLENCE ESCALATES AS DIPLOMATS SEEK ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Violence overshadowed diplomacy in troubled East
Timor Friday, with fighting continuing between warring factions
despite a cease-fire and a UN-mediated attempt to bring a form of
self-rule to the Indonesian-occupied land.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian government officials say they are promoting a
compromise to satisfy both sides in the bloody conflict that has
raged since Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975
and annexed it a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's rule in East Timor is not recognized by the United
Nations or most countries. Indonesian troops are blamed for 200,000
deaths during a 1976 crackdown and famine that followed, and for
human rights abuses ever since. Guerrillas have waged a 23-year
struggle for independence.
</P>
<P>
   This week's bloodshed between pro-independence and pro-Indonesia
forces does not bode well for a peaceful vote on an autonomy
package agreed to by Indonesian and Portuguese foreign ministers at
UN headquarters in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, a leaked Australian military intelligence document
accused the Indonesian army of arming, protecting and fighting
alongside pro-Jakarta militias, lending credence to those who say
the military is fanning the violence. The Indonesian army denies
any connection to the militias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The occupying armed forces are escalating the violence...to
derail the negotiations in New York and prevent a UN presence in
East Timor,'' complained Roque Rodrigues, a representative of CNRT,
the East Timor Resistance National Council. ``Without a UN
presence, they can continue to carry out mass-scale killings of
East Timor people, and they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Any solution will require a democratic and peaceful vote that
asks what people want, he said. ``A UN presence is needed to
supervise, organize and monitor'' the vote. ``In an atmosphere of
violence, it's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The UN-brokered talks led Friday to a proposal that government
sources in Jakarta say would offer East Timor's 830,000 residents
self-rule on all matters except defense, foreign affairs and fiscal
and monetary policy. The two nations expect to sign the agreement
May 5, paving the way for a vote this summer. But the deal may fail
to settle anything.
</P>
<P>
   In telephone interviews from East Timor, representatives of both
sides said they would reject autonomy at the ballot box _ either
because they want full independence or because they want rule from
Jakarta. The ballot is expected to be a yes-or-no vote on autonomy,
without any specified alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie reversed Jakarta's
long-standing hard line on East Timor in January, when he proposed
limited self-rule for East Timor, and said he would consider
independence if autonomy was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   That offer has led many to mistakenly conclude that the July
ballot is a choice between autonomy and independence. But in truth,
if autonomy is rejected by both independence supporters and those
who want to remain part of Indonesia, neither side could prove
victory for their position. Just as critical, if autonomy fails,
alternatives for East Timor's future would have to be approved by
the new parliament and the next president _ and there is no
guarantee they would approve independence.
</P>
<P>
   F.X. Lopes da Cruz, an East Timor native and adviser to Habibie,
called autonomy a ``a win-win situation'' to appease both sides and
restore peace.
</P>
<P>
   But others do not agree. After Habibie's offer seemed to tilt
the scales in favor of self-rule, Jakarta loyalists stepped up an
armed campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A human rights group in Dili, East Timor's capital, claimed
Friday that Indonesian troops and paramilitaries killed at least 40
people between January 1 and April 8, in a campaign to terrorize
independence supporters. Yayasan Hak said almost 80 people were
tortured and more than 18,000 fled their homes to escape attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen more are believed to have been killed in the last
two weeks, including 30 massacred when pro-Indonesia militas went
on a rampage last Saturday after their leaders advocated violence
at a rally attended by the Jakarta-appointed governor and local
military and police chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a jungle now,'' said Pedro Carrascalao, whose
father, former East Timor governor Mario Carrascalao, fled
Indonesia on Thursday after pro-Jakarta militias placed him on a
hit list. Mario Carrasalao's brother's home in Dili, where refugees
were sheltering, was a target in last Saturday's rampage, and his
17-year-old nephew was among 30 massacred.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador Soares, former member of parliament for East Timor from
the pro-Jakarta ruling party, said the continuing violence proves a
summer vote is premature. ``People are not ready to manage
themselves if they win autonomy....and they are not ready to accept
if their side loses.''

THE TRIAL OF REGGIE LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Through 70 depositions and countless hours of sworn testimony,
Donna Harris-Lewis has maintained a steely vigil in search, she
says, of the truth about the death of her husband, Celtics star
Reggie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Many widows would consider this process nothing short of
hideous. Yet Harris-Lewis described it Friday as cathartic, a
necessary step in her quest to prove that inadequate medical care
led to her husband's death from heart failure in 1993, at the
tender age of 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can read transcripts, but I wanted to be there to hear and
to see,'' said Harris-Lewis. ``It's been helpful to me to
understand the difference between fact and fiction. From their lips
to my ears _ that was important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis is suing Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. and three other
doctors for medical malpractice in a trial that begins Monday in
Suffolk (Mass.) Superior Court. Her motivation, she says, is
simple: She wants the truth about her husband's death. She wants to
prove that her husband should still be alive, that the
highly-touted doctors who were expected to save his life instead
allowed him to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to Reggie's family and friends, fans and
community, to continue to see the person they had watched before
their eyes,'' she said. ``We're talking about people continuing to
understand the person he really was, not what's been portrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors will allege that past cocaine use by Lewis _ and his
refusal to disclose it until shortly before he died _ made
diagnosis and treatment impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis died on July 27, 1993, while shooting a basketball at
Brandeis University, just three months after he collapsed during a
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Things between Harris-Lewis and Mudge began to get ugly in 1995,
when the Wall Street Journal reported that Mudge and other members
of Lewis's medical team strongly suspected that Lewis had used
cocaine, contributing to the heart condition that killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge is expected to testify that Lewis had told him 15 days
before he died that he had used cocaine previously, as the two
talked in a Range Rover in a Brandeis University parking lot. There
were no witnesses to the conversation. Asked whether she believes
the conversation took place, Harris-Lewis _ who is under a court
order barring her from discussing the details of the case _ shakes
her head no, and says she cannot elaborate before the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis's lawsuit has drawn critics. They point to the $10
million or more Harris-Lewis has received since Lewis's death, and
wonder what more money could possibly heal. They say Lewis's
once-exemplary reputation has already suffered and fear that a
trial will only give Mudge's allegation more air time. And some
worry, privately and publicly, that the allegation might be true,
that Lewis really did use drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has heard it all. She said she mounted her own
investigation after Mudge's claim surfaced, asking friends and
acquaintances if they knew anything about her husband that she
didn't. The answer she came away with was no.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people very close to him who I've asked, `Don't tell
me what you think I want to hear. Tell me what you know.' Because I
need to know, not just for myself but for my children. I wasn't
around him all the time. But the people who were around him, I've
asked questions. I'm more inclined to believe people who really
knew him than people who didn't really know him.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis scoffs at charges that she is motivated by greed.
No amount of money, she says, could compensate her for the loss of
her husband and the father of her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a defeated purpose from the beginning
because there's not a dollar amount that could justify what Reggie
meant to me, to our children and our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Lewis's son, Reggie Jr., is nearly 7. The daughter his
wife was carrying when he died, Reggiena, is 5. They barely know
their father was a basketball player _ though after a Bulls-Celtics
game at the FleetCenter last year, Michael Jordan told a scarcely
believing Reggie Jr. that he'd played against his dad, and that he
was a great competitor.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no such warm, sentimental moments in the trial. An
eminent cardiologist and a prideful widow are locked in a
winner-take-all battle over reputation. But in the court of public
opinion, Lewis's legacy has already suffered. Donna Harris-Lewis
may be seeking a vindication no court can bestow.

DRIVEN BY FAITH, PRIEST OFFERS REFUGE FROM GLOBAL MISERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 25)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ On this Sunday morning, the few die-hard faithful
of the tiny Christ and St. Barnabas Episcopal Church are joined by
about 18 visitors whose presence, in the Gothic oaken arches and
mellow light of the tiny church, provide the Rev. James Kenyon with
a golden moment during his sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Most are Burmese refugees. A few are Amerasian or Vietnamese.
Noticeably, a couple of men bear the scars of the long-standing
guerrilla warfare against Burma's military regime: Nyunt Win lost
part of an arm, and suffered permanent damage to his right hand,
eye and ankle during a grenade attack in 1991, he said; another
Burmese man is missing an arm and is blind.
</P>
<P>
   An Amerasian congregant, disabled since childhood by polio, had
almost been overlooked in the effort to bring the children of
American servicemen here. During a trip to Vietnam in 1994 Kenyon,
seeing him in the distance as a ``dark lump in the road,'' brought
him.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon's sermon is based on the gospel of John, in which the
Pharisees pointedly question a simple blind man whose sight was
restored by Jesus. The blind man's explanation for this miracle
``that though I was blind, now I see'' is a lesson in faith, Kenyon
preached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith is nothing less than trust that God has better plans in
mind for you and I,'' Kenyon said, ``than we do ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It is on faith that the latest refugees under the Episcopal
priest's wing are now living in the United States, beginning their
tentative steps by learning English, working the night shift as
stitchers at a mattress manufacturer and attending college.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon and his wife, Pat, approach the resettlement of refugees
with missionary zeal, but not to win converts to the church.
``We're in business to bring them to freedom,'' Kenyon said simply.
</P>
<P>
   As refugee coordinator for the Episcopal Diocese of Albany,
Kenyon since 1989 has brought more than 200 refugees to the region,
taking on the task with both compassion and realism. For nearly a
decade, the Kenyons called a turn-of-the-century mansion in
Rensselaer ``Welcome House,'' where the latest arrivals lived with
them until they could stand on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up the hotel-style life of Welcome House, the couple last
year moved to a rented condominium in the suburbs of Rensselaer,
its neutral contemporary space furnished with genteel camelback and
Empire-style sofas that seem more in keeping with an old-time
vicarage. Here, in the quiet of suburbia, it is difficult to
envision the Kenyons at the Burma-Thailand border, interviewing
potential refugees near a safe area designated for Burmese
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   But the lives of Jim and Pat Kenyon, 73 and 71, represent a
barometer of world events, usually catastrophes that have
threatened the people whose persecution allowed them here as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes facing American ambivalence about new immigrants,
undertaking a constant cycle of doctors' appointments,
apartment-hunting and social-service appointments, Kenyon has been
at this since 1956, when Hungary collapsed under the communist
crackdown. Then came Cuba and Fidel Castro, and, later, Cambodia,
Vietnam, the Ukraine, Burma and Bosnia. Before moving to Albany in
1989, Kenyon resettled refugees in Brooklyn, and before that, in
Wisconsin and Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Through an agreement with the U.S. State Department, the
Episcopal church agrees to resettle the refugees and have them
gainfully employed as soon as possible, although refugees are
entitled to food stamps, Medicaid and, in some cases, public
assistance. As defined by the Refugee Act of 1980, a refugee is
anyone with a well-founded fear of persecution or physical harm, a
status ultimately granted by the U.S. Immigration &AMP; Naturalization
Service, Kenyon said.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer agencies resettle refugees whose cases are dispersed
by the New York-based Refugee Data Center, Kenyon said. Episcopal
Migration Ministries, which oversees that church's resettlement
programs, realizes Kenyon's special interest in Burma, so it makes
those cases available. But Kenyon also is waiting for the arrival
of a Bosnian and Vietnamese as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon's ministry is supported in part by the Episcopal diocese,
by donations, as well as by churches of any denomination.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyons' drive to minister makes their resolve to help these
newcomers pretty uncomplicated. Kenyon puzzles a moment when he
thinks about why he does what he does, then reflects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that I have two spiritual gifts: one is missionary
and the other is hospitality. Those have allowed me and my wife to
bridge national lines and racial lines. Most of my work was in
black congregations. Three of our (four) adopted sons are black.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kenyon said resettling refugees has been a way to involve
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyons' work has crossed often into the personal. Once,
because of a mix-up, a young Vietnamese man was due to arrive for
resettlement at Kenyon's Brooklyn church well before the parish had
actually approved the sponsorship. Once he secured approval, Kenyon
told the parish, ``I sure am glad, because he's arriving next
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Kenyons adopted the young man.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon has a blunt, robust delivery while Pat is softly
understated. To the refugees, they are mom and dad, and that is how
they address them.
</P>
<P>
   Myint Maung Maung, 30, who is Burmese, arrived at Albany
International Airport on March 17 with his young family. The
Kenyons were among his first sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in my heart, he's not really my father, but when I see
his face, he really is my father,'' Myint Maung Maung said.
</P>
<P>
   On a chilly early April afternoon, Kenyon has come to the
Rensselaer apartment of Myint Maung Maung, his wife, Dint Tin Tin
Khing and their daughter, Pwint Phyu Hnin, almost 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Their customs still cling to the emigres like an exotic cloak.
Myint Maung Maung wears a longy, a tube-shaped sarong, and Dint has
mustard-colored makeup, worn by both Burmese men and women, applied
in circles on each cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you still chewing beetlenut?'' Kenyon asks Maung,
referring to a Burmese habit, similar to chewing tobacco. But Maung
makes a face of disgust, already believing that the habit will be
viewed here as a vice.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon is chipping away at a medical report, in anticipation of
a doctor's visit for Maung.
</P>
<P>
   In rudimentary English, and with the help of his friend Nyunt
Win, also Burmese, who lives in the same Rensselaer neighborhood
around the corner, Maung pieced together a story of resistance that
is all too familiar to Kenyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988, I demanded democracy. Many students demanded
democracy,'' he said. The massive demonstration was harshly quelled
by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Myint Maung Maung fled Rangoon, the Burmese capital. Debilitated
by wounds and poor vision, he hid in the jungles for years. He and
Nyunt Win, gravely wounded in 1991, actually had fought the
military in one significant battle. Win, here since 1995, has a
strong command of English and is studying computer information
systems at a local community college.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the typical remarks of newcomers Maung huddles, for
instance, to show his reaction to the brace of Northeast cold he
makes another comment, still typical of immigrants, and heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very glad to live in the United States of America,
because the United States has a democracy and I want the
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The priest sometimes has been greeted with apathy, even among
churchgoers, when he explains the need to help refugees. Just one
of five churches responded to his appeal last spring to help his
ministry, run just by him and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It discourages me; I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He is mindful about the latest global misery: the outpouring of
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. There is talk of a sketchy plan to
temporarily resettle 20,000 Kosovars, so his future involvement in
helping the Kosovar refugees is hypothetical. But, ``if there were
some Kosovars eligible, I'd just as soon help resettle them as
anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon likes to rely on scripture to explain his job. He
recounts the gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus, Mary and Joseph
flee to Egypt to escape Herod's murderous rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever stop to think of what it must have been like for Jesus,
Mary and Joseph when they first arrived in Egypt? Well, this is
what we do. Jesus, Mary and Joseph were the first refugees of the
Christian era.''

FANS COOL TO NHL, GREAT ONE'S EXIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever there was a time for the American hockey fan to step
forward, plop down and tune in, last Sunday afternoon was it.
</P>
<P>
   The Great One, Wayne Gretzky, was on final display, glowing like
a Roman candle for most of the country to see, right there on
fabulous Fox.
</P>
<P>
   And who among us watched, Bob and Doug McKenzie?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that's right. They're Canadian, eh? Can't blame them for not
watching, or hockey fans in Fort Worth-Dallas, for that matter. Fox
sent us the Stars game instead. As for the 82 percent of the
country that got Gretzky's going away party, well, not many of them
watched, either.
</P>
<P>
   The scary thing is that by hockey's standards, quite a few
people viewed Gretzky's NHL sendoff. The game featuring his New
York Rangers and the Pittsburgh Penguins pulled a 2.2 national TV
rating. Translated, that means that 2.2 percent of U.S. homes with
a television watched.
</P>
<P>
   That was the highest-rated NHL regular-season telecast on Fox
since March 31, 1996, and still it drew fewer viewers than the golf
tournament, the NBA game and the figure skating event that aired
that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which has been broadcasting NHL games since the 1994-95
season, has seen its ratings slide from an average of 2.0 in 1995
and 2.1 in 1996 to 1.9 in 1997, and to 1.4 in 1998 and 1999. Even
at the bargain-basement rights fee price of $155 million, that's
not much of a return on the investment.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has been losing up to $12 million a year on hockey, so it
came as no surprise that the network said good bye and good
riddance when Disney (ABC/ESPN) agreed to pay $600 million for NHL
broadcast rights for the next five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has its reasons for stepping into the quicksand that
sucked Fox downward for half a decade. The company believes that
the cross-promotional benefits between its networks will help boost
ratings, particularly as the NHL improves its fan base in the South
and West. Hockey also provides hundreds of hours of programming
each year for Disney's all-sports cable networks, and you can never
have too much live programming when you broadcast 24/7. Finally,
the NHL is still cheap when compared with the cost of rights fees
to the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Still, selling hockey on TV hasn't been an easy job, and there
is no sign it will be easier in the near future. Fox tried
high-technology tools such as a glowing puck, innovative camera
angles that brought viewers closer to the action and a group of
announcers versed enough to appeal to veteran hockey fans but
willing to educate novices.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked. Not even the final adieu from Gretzky, a poet on
skates, the Jordan of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any hope for Americans' interest in televised
hockey, it could come from a market like Fort Worth-Dallas, a place
that has just started to take to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for Stars' regular-season contests on Fox Sports
Southwest this year were up 114 percent from last year. The ratings
numbers weren't huge (a 1.5 average vs. a 0.7) but that's partly
because the cable sports channel only reaches a little more than
one-half of area households.
</P>
<P>
   Playoff hockey ratings are traditionally much better than those
of the regular season and, because first-round opponent Edmonton
has been a traditionally strong ratings draw here, this series'
numbers bear watching. Game 1 on Wednesday, which was broadcast on
KDFI/Channel 27, drew healthy enough viewer numbers, and those
ought to improve in future rounds, assuming the Stars keep on
keeping on.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics might argue that the growing interest in the Stars is
merely another sign of this area's passion for any team that wins.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're talking about hockey, a sport that attracts
fewer viewers than a routine golf tournament even when it's
showcasing its greatest player, you have to find positives where
you can.

COFFEE DIRECTORS BOUGHT COMPANY STOCK BETWEEN TAKEOVER BIDS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three directors of the Chock Full o'Nuts Corp.,
including the chairman of the board, bought company stock in the
months after they rejected an unsolicited takeover offer but before
that offer was disclosed to the public. The suitor remains
interested, however, and this week disclosed that it had approached
the company recently, sending the stock up almost 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Chock Full o'Nuts said the purchases did not
violate securities laws that forbid corporate officials from
trading on the basis of nonpublic information.
</P>
<P>
   But they were made just months after company lawyers forced one
of the three men to sell some shares because of an indisputable
conflict. Those shares had been purchased while Chock Full o'Nuts
was actively reviewing a buyout offer from the Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sara Lee disclosed that it had approached Chock
Full o'Nuts on at least four occasions over the last two years with
acquisition offers. It most recently bid $10.50 a share in Sara Lee
common stock, or about $119 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chock Full o'Nuts, which roasts and markets coffee but which has
largely missed out on the coffee bar trend that has lifted rivals
like Starbucks, issued a statement late Thursday saying that it had
rejected the offer as inadequate. The company, whose shares rose
$3.125, to $9.50, Friday, earned $5.5 million, or 53 cents a share,
on sales of $396 million in the fiscal year ended in July.
</P>
<P>
   Both profits and sales were down from the previous year because
of declining coffee prices. In the first six months of the current
fiscal year, business slumped again from its year-earlier levels,
although the company sold 10 percent more coffee, as measured in
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Chock Full o'Nuts said the takeover offer was an unfair attempt
to take advantage of the depressed coffee market to buy the company
cheaply. But Sara Lee's persistent overtures raise concerns about
whether the directors took advantage of that information to try to
profit themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Securities lawyers say the stock purchases by directors may not
violate regulations against insider trading because they came well
after an offer was made and rejected. Companies generally are not
required to disclose unsolicited takeover offers if negotiations do
not progress, lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Federal securities laws forbid someone in a position of
fiduciary responsibility with knowledge of material, nonpublic
information from trading on the basis of the information. But
interpretations of what is material information can vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed by Sara Lee with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the company contacted Chock Full o'Nuts in
August 1997 offering to negotiate a purchase. The same month, Chock
Full o'Nuts rejected the overture.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later, in July 1998, Sara Lee offered to buy Chock
Full o'Nuts for $9.50 a share in cash. The company began reviewing
the offer, and representatives of the two companies met to discuss
the proposal over the next three months. Sara Lee, which is best
known for its baked goods but also sells several popular coffee
brands in Europe, raised its offer to $10.50 a share. On Oct. 23,
Chock Full o'Nuts rejected the revised offer.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the offer nor the discussions were disclosed to
investors. Fredric Spar, a spokesman for Chock Full o'Nuts, said
Friday that the company kept the talks confidential because ``they
had not ripened to the point where they would require disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting Sara Lee's offer in October, Chock Full o'Nuts
did not hear from its suitor again until last month, Spar said. On
March 10, Sara Lee repeated its interest but lowered its offer back
to $9.50 a share, citing the company's recent poor financial
performance and its adoption of new severance agreements for some
senior executives.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee's renewed offer came two days after a group including
Norman Alexander, the nonexecutive chairman of the Chock Full
o'Nuts board, disclosed it had raised its stake in the company's
shares, to 5.3 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, the 84-year-old chief executive of the Sequa Corp., a
diversified manufacturer, bought 533,100 shares at $5 each, on Feb.
24. Half of the shares were purchased through an insurance holding
company called the Galleon Syndication Corp., which Alexander
controls. The next day, another director, Henry Salzhauer, bought
6,000 shares at $5.28 apiece. Salzhauer and a third company
director, Jerry Columbus, also bought shares in January with
Salzhauer picking up 2,500 and Columbus 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Spar, the company spokesman, said that the purchases were not a
problem because sufficient time had elapsed between this year's
purchases by directors and the October 1998 offer by Sara Lee,
which the directors had rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sara Lee abruptly broke off discussions at the end of
October,'' Spar said. ``There was nothing left on the table.''
After months of no contact whatsoever, a block of stock was offered
on the market, and the directors decided to buy some shares, he
said.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Sara Lee spokesman declined to comment on whether the
companies had any contact from October to February, but the
company's filing with the SEC describes none. The filing also
states that Sara Lee this month bought the equivalent of 5.29
percent of Chock Full o'Nuts shares.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee did not disclose its overtures to the company before
this week. Nor did it propose any directors for the company's board
or make other attempts to rally support for its offer at Chock Full
o'Nuts annual meeting in December.
</P>
<P>
   One former SEC official who now practices securities law in
Washington said that companies generally did not have a duty to
disclose unsolicited takeover offers. If an offer is pending or
being negotiated when the company is required to make a quarterly
or annual report to the SEC, it may be required to disclose the
talks. But there are exemptions based on how serious the
discussions are.
</P>
<P>
   Chock Full o'Nuts apparently had been closely watching its
directors and their stock purchases. On Aug. 21, while the
company's board was in the middle of reviewing Sara Lee's
$9.50-a-share takeover offer, Salzhauer, the director, bought 4,200
shares of the company's stock at $5.25 a share, raising his
holdings to 125,300 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, Salzhauer sold the shares for $5.08 each.
According to Spar, the sale came after Salzhauer was advised that
he was not allowed to trade during the takeover negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee disclosed in its filing this week that it had recently
raised its offer back to $10.50 a share in cash. It also said that
Chock Full o'Nuts made a counterproposal, asking for $12.50 a share
in Sara Lee stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release, Chock Full o'Nuts said it would ``continue
to consider all bona fide acquisition proposals.'' But it said that
it viewed Sara Lee's offers and its disclosure of the talks ``as
simply an attempt to take advantage of commodity price fluctuations
and depressed values for microcap stocks.''

AT 50, NATO TAKES TIME TO CELEBRATE AND TO DO SOUL-SEARCHING 
 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At an unexpectedly harrowing moment in its history,
NATO on Friday marked the 50th anniversary of what has been the
world's most successful military alliance &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But in the same gilded auditorium where the founding treaty was
signed, presidents and prime ministers of the 19 member nations
acknowledged that the fight in the Balkans with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic challenges NATO's reputation and future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebration is very hard,'' given the horrors in Kosovo,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said as each leader delivered
commemorative remarks. Almost all of them referred to the
importance of NATO solidarity in the face of attacks by Milosevic's
forces on ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We meet to honor NATO's past, to chart its future, to reaffirm
our mission in Kosovo, where NATO is defending our values and our
vision of a Europe free, undivided and at peace,'' President
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Unity, a classic rallying cry throughout NATO's history, was a
common theme as the three-day summit opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We send a clear message of unity and determination to sustain
our air campaign for as long as it takes,'' Clinton said, welcoming
fellow leaders at a working breakfast session.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the alliance won peacefully,'' French President Jacques
Chirac said at a subsequent session, ``it is because it is able to
combine freedom and solidarity. ... This alliance, which was forged
in adversity, today is confronted with a new trial, in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was marked by scattered shadows of doubt, including the
view of Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini that the NATO air
attack on Serb TV headquarters in Belgrade was ``terrible'' and
``not in the plans.'' Solana said there had been no widening of the
target list without agreement of the policymaking North Atlantic
Council.
</P>
<P>
   More prevalent were ringing declarations of ultimate victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last European dictatorship of the 20th century will not
destroy Europe's long-awaited chance to live at last together in
peace and freedom,'' Clinton said at the formal commemorative
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO cannot fail. NATO will not fail,'' said Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien. ``The world has changed in 50 years, but
our values do not change. And the need for NATO is as great as
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the enemy has changed, said Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres, who was born three weeks after the founding of
NATO and will be 50 himself next week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a country or a system or an ideology, he said, ``our
enemy is the rejection by so many in the world of the values of the
Enlightenment.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders gathered in the Andrew Mellon Auditorium, a
64-year-old neoclassical structure amid the Federal Triangle, the
capital's densest concentration of U.S. government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   On the same stage, April 4, 1949, the original 12 NATO members
signed the Treaty of Washington _ creating the United States' first
peacetime international alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The basic promise of NATO has been that an attack on any member
nation is considered an attack on all member nations. The alliance
became the principal international instrument of U.S. determination
to contain Soviet communism.
</P>
<P>
   As a symbol of the startling geopolitical changes over the last
decade, the meeting marked the first NATO summit since three former
Warsaw Pact nations _ the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland _ were
made full members of the Western alliance last month.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Europe's ``descent into darkness helped to spark NATO's
creation,'' Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Former adversaries have become friends,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   The admission of the former Soviet satellites, said Czech
President Vaclav Havel, ``signifies the real and definitive end of
the imposed division of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski said, however, that the
celebration was overshadowed by ``tragic events in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balkan events,'' he said, ``have made us all realize that
NATO membership does not only bring a feeling of comfort, it is
also about shared responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Several leaders spoke of the sheer power of the alliance's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A visionary project,'' Solana said. ``What a journey this has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is unique,'' said David Oddsson, prime minister of
Iceland. ``There is no example in history of any other military or
defense alliance of free countries which has operated for so long
and in such close harmony.''

KILLINGS PROMPT YOUNG PEOPLE TO DISCUSS OSTRACISM ON WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Md., N.Y., Ga., Ala., Calif.)  (With COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING and related stories.) 
(mb) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The electronic message was titled ``A post from an `outcast,'''
and its author, ``Swimmer K,'' sounded a theme that echoed through
cyberspace as young people reflected this week on the killings in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how they feel,'' she confessed, writing to an invisible
audience. ``Parents need to realize that a kid is not overreacting
all the time they say that no one accepts them. Also, all of the
popular conformists need to learn to accept everyone else. Why do
they shun everyone who is different?''
</P>
<P>
   A reply from 14-year-old ``Mandyjac'' came the next day. ``I
can't even begin to say all the problems with cliques,'' she wrote.
``I am seen as an `outcast' and `dork' by all of the popular people
just because of how I act.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandyjac, a high school student in Gaithersburg, Md., added:
``It hurts so much to be seen as `different' but I have learned to
get over it and move on. I think that if we had no cliques, or at
least others weren't looked down on as much, there would not be a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In classrooms and around the dinner table, teen-agers' reactions
to the latest school killings may have been dominated by fear for
their own safety and horror at the violence that ended the lives of
young people much like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet, which serves as a sounding board for
teen-agers' inner thoughts, offers a glimpse at a more painful
chord struck by the Colorado killings. In online discussions, on
World Wide Web sites and in e-mail, young people are engaging in
what amounts to a fragmented national dialogue over social
ostracism and the unforgiving hierarchies of adolescent life, all
too familiar but rarely discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the electronic empathizers were quick to repudiate
the killings. But many wrote of identifying with the harassment
that the two killers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, appear to have
been subjected to before they acted. At a time when it might be
easiest to simply dismiss the two as freaks, several young people
seemed to see pieces of their own experience reflected in that of
the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started out mostly saying, `This is so horrible,''' said
Laura Smith Kay, the online editor of Teen People, whose message
boards on America Online carried 300 responses the first day after
the shootings. ``But now they're talking more about cliques and the
treatment of outcasts and jocks, and how that interaction can
create a really unhappy and potentially dangerous atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of alienation online may be partly a result of
who uses the Internet. The medium is a refuge for many who consider
themselves ``outsiders,'' a place where subcultures of all kinds
connect. Gay teen-agers, for instance, have often reached out to
others online. And Goths, who listen to industrial music and dress
in black, take part in online discussions at Internet Relay Chat
and Web sites like www.slaughter.net. Harris also apparently spent
time online, maintaining a Web site and playing the computer game
Quake, in which the player stalks and kills opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter who is typing into the ether, the nature of the
online dialogue, which provides a sense of anonymity and safety,
also provokes the airing of feelings not so easily expressed face
to face. In the process, some teen-agers say they find the sense of
acceptance online that they cannot find elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the experts on television have been talking about the
problem in Colorado being a breakdown in community,'' said Robin
Jilton, an adolescent psychologist at New York Presbyterian
Hospital who has been monitoring Teen People's message boards on
America Online. ``I see kids coming to these bulletin boards and
forming community. It's especially helpful for kids who perhaps
have less access to a means of expressing themselves because they
have fewer friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Online observations of what it means to be an outcast are
cropping up throughout the Internet, from the current events forum
on theglobe.com, a popular Web discussion venue aimed at teen-agers
and college students, to alt.music.pearl-jam, where an anonymous
contributor wrote on Wednesday: ``HAD TO SAY _ I go to school every
day and am violated of my rights because I choose to be
`different,' and even though I would never take someone else's
life, maybe it will make people think before they opened their
mouths next time _ just a thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Belflower, 18, of Powder Springs, Ga., retooled his Web
site the day after the shootings to read, ``Neatoelito proudly
supports: THE TRENCHCOAT MAFIA,'' a reference to the group with
which Harris and Klebold were associated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were made fun of, they stood up for themselves,'' said
Belflower in a telephone interview. ``It's like in my school, the
preppier kids think they're just everything. People are constantly
harassing each other because they're different. I would never
personally do anything like that, but it did take guts.''
</P>
<P>
   On gurl.com, a popular Web site for teen-age girls, ``T.K.''
wrote, ``Hey, the kids say that they did this because they were
teased and I can understand where they are coming from and I think
that what they did to all of those kids was wrong but a person can
only take so much torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Such messages of identification online are not limited to
teen-age discussion groups. In the k12.chat.teacher forum, teachers
lamented the sense that teen-age cruelty is accepted as a fact of
life and worried over students who describe themselves as
``outcasts and weirdos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a kid with everything going for her thinks she's on the
outside, what is the kid with a troubled home environment supposed
to think?'' one contributor asked.
</P>
<P>
   Others with painful memories of adolescence also poured out
their memories online this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember purple nurples? How about wedgies?'' wrote a
29-year-old in Lawrence, Ala., of physical humiliations he
recalled. ``Until this culture actually learns to stop the out of
control behavior that is accepted by jock culture you will see a
lot more outcasts with guns.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gillian Fischer, 26, a database manager in Los Angeles and a
contributor to the alt.goth newsgroup, said fellow-students used to
spread rumors that she was a drug addict. ``I was one of those
people who would sit in a corner and read,'' Ms. Fischer said. ``It
was even worse to be a freak and be smart. There was everything
from name calling to horrible humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Adolescent alienation and Darwinist high school cliques are, of
course, nothing new. And such comments invariably came in the
context of more wide-ranging opinions. Many teen-agers used e-mail
and electronic postings to relay their support for the survivors at
Columbine High School in Littleton. Others found comfort in simply
voicing their fears, and hearing those of others.
</P>
<P>
   Messages critiquing cliquish cruelty often elicited quick
reminders from others that Harris and Klebold were not simply
victims of senseless teasing. ``They were not `cool different,'
they were racists,'' said one Georgia Tech student on
alt.pro-wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the event seemed to open a vein of troubling
introspection that is perhaps remarkable only because instead of
taking place between small circles of friends, it is on display for
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been in high school,'' said Steven Paternot,
co-chief executive of theglobe.com. ``But the Internet is the first
time you can create such a visible outlet. It's a bigger window
into someone's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether such an outlet can serve as a form of catharsis, or even
a catalyst for change, is impossible to say. But Amanda Shank, a k
a ``Mandyjac,'' said in a telephone interview that she felt it was
important to voice her views on the Teen People board to make a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my school personally, certain groups exist that are the
popular people and the jocks, then there's one group that aren't a
member of any clique, maybe 200 out of 2,000, and that's me,'' Ms.
Shank said in the interview. ``But I don't think it's right to
blame the whole clique system for what these people did. The clique
system is harsh. But it's not an excuse.''

FLIGHTS OF FANCY: GARDENING TO ATTRACT BUTTERFLIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The houses are small and nondescript, the street
quiet, just a block off bustling Van Nuys Boulevard in this suburb
of Van Nuys. There's a tree here and there, an occasional rose bush
or patch of daisies.
</P>
<P>
   Then you drive around the corner ... and wham! A riot of color
hits you in the eye. Your foot hits the brake instinctively as you
slam to a stop to marvel at what can only be described as an urban
jungle of greenery and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Purple iris. Red roses. Blue cornflowers. Pink watsonia.
Cultivated species found in proper English gardens mingle with
California native plants. Yellow and white wisteria tumble over the
backyard fence like a living waterfall. Lavender trumpet vine
drapes the garage door.
</P>
<P>
   A feast for the human eye, true. But for a butterfly, it's home
and dinner all in one.
</P>
<P>
   Through Diane Gilbert's orderly but wild-appearing yard flit
colorful butterflies, fat black bumblebees, busy honeybees and
darting hummingbirds, while two contented cats _ Gracie and Tootsie
_ watch over the lively domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my oasis, my place to relax and be in nature,'' said
Gilbert, a kindergarten teacher who began her garden a decade ago
after a boyfriend gave her a dozen bare-root rose bushes.
</P>
<P>
   And when she began teaching her students about the cycle of
life, using butterflies as an example because even little kids
aren't afraid of butterflies, she began to add more and more plants
_ cornflowers, sweet peas, verbena, milkweed, nasturtiums, dill,
black-eyed Susans and dozens of others _ that attract butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come and they go all summer,'' Gilbert said. ``It's just
so calming to look at them. Everybody says, `Your garden must take
so much work.' But it's not work, it's pleasure, being out here
with the butterflies.''
</P>
<P>
   With the flowers, a fish pond and several birdbaths filled with
water, she aims to provide a gorgeous, ever-changing habitat for
the rapidly disappearing urban butterflies, which entomologists say
are dwindling because their natural breeding grounds are being
paved over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built houses all over everything, taken out the plants
that butterflies need,'' said Margaret Huffman of Pacific
Palisades, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the North
American Butterfly Association.
</P>
<P>
   People who plant ``butterfly gardens'' filled with only bright,
splashy flowers have good intentions in trying to attract the
lively critters to their yards. But what they're really offering
isn't a habitat that helps increase the butterfly population, but a
butterfly buffet, a sort of all-you-can-eat luncheon stopover,
Huffman said. The adults stop, sip some nectar, then head off to
find native plants where they can lay their eggs; those eggs
develop into caterpillars that feed on the plants until they
metamorphose into butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners who like their yards just so are also unwittingly
contributing to the dooming of the species because many of the
plants caterpillars like to eat are considered weeds _ and
Southlanders hate to harbor a weed in their garden, Huffman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we take away all the plants that butterflies require,
they die,'' Huffman said. ``What we have is a neatness complex, and
it's very destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert has no such need for excessive tidiness and has a real
fondness for native plants, some of which, she says, produce
beautiful, delicate flowers. In both her front and back yards,
milkweed is interspersed with lantana, cornflowers with coreopsis,
verbena with sabiosa, providing both a habitat for caterpillars as
well as a feeding ground for adult butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Huffman said other gardeners plant splashy flower gardens but
reserve a small corner for native plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to go ugly and drab with everything,'' she
said. ``You could have a small area where you could have plants
that have nectar for the adults to feed on, and an area for the
caterpillars to feed on that's not quite as pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people who aren't pristine gardeners do tolerate patches of
native plants, but ironically become irate when they realize the
fat little critters are chomping away at their scanty garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `The caterpillars are eating my plants!' '' said
Huffman with a laugh. ``We say, `That's what the plants are there
for.' You see, everybody loves butterflies, but not everybody loves
caterpillars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert loves both. She fingers the remains of a passion flower
vine in her back yard that shows the equivalent of tiny caterpillar
tooth marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They eat it right down to the vine,'' Gilbert said. ``It's
amazing how much they can eat. Every summer, I think the
caterpillars have killed it, but every year I give it a good
watering, and it comes right back _ and so do the butterflies. The
butterflies love passion flower vine.''
</P>
<P>
   Passion flower is what Gilbert calls ``a sure thing.'' Plant it
and they will come.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of those kinds of plants in her yard: milkweed,
verbena, sweet peas, mint, parsley, cornflower, Queen Anne's lace,
nasturtium, carrots and dill for caterpillar food, plus so-called
nectar plants for the adults to feed on, including wisteria,
butterfly bush, forget-me-not, chives, cornflowers, honeysuckle,
trumpet vine, lantana, cosmos, iris, salvia, sage, hibiscus and
lilies.
</P>
<P>
   Huffman said caterpillars also like to feed on monkey flowers,
mallows, thistle and wild lilacs, and even sycamore and oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   Fledgling butterfly gardeners shouldn't be disappointed if they
plant the recommended flowers and native plants but don't hear the
flutter of tiny wings immediately. Butterflies have good radar, but
it's hard for them to single out one yard in an entire community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have any natural areas nearby, then it's going to
take a while for the butterflies to come by,'' Huffman said. ``But
if you're near a natural area, there's a good chance of getting
some butterflies into your yard. You just have to plant and wait.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Colorado tragedy rattles veteran reporter
 &HT;    C. Patrick Cleary
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Snow falling on flowers couldn't dampen the
crispness of emotion on display in Clement Park.
</P>
<P>
   I pulled out my pen and notebook every time that emotion crept
into my gut. I kept it at bay, easily, it seemed, just like many of
the other 300 journalists scanning like vultures for that one great
quote to make the front page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear that one girl had her journal half open in the
school library,'' one journalist said to another before one of
those elbow-to-elbow press conferences. There, apparently, on that
page, she had written something that her goal for the day was to
finish her college application.
</P>
<P>
   She never will.
</P>
<P>
   Another student said he was eating dinner in a mall restaurant
after the tragedy while wearing the school colors denoting he was
an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a trenchcoat guy in the mall last night,'' 16-year-old
Ben Oakley said to the circle of reporters inching closer as each
trembling word rolled off his parched and chapped lips. ``He looked
at me and laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of young boys kept a protective circle around two fellow
students clutched to each other in front of Rachel Scott's red
sedan. The car had become one of many monuments in the park's
parking lot. Laden with so many flowers and mementoes, the only
part visible was an accident-creased driver's door. The girl's wail
cut through the soggy night. The boy was telling her Rachel will
always be with them. The circle of friends sang a tapestry of
notes, lyrics about having a friend to lean on.
</P>
<P>
   I moved away, back toward the 11 p.m. EST newscasters ready to
tell the world that more than the two shooters might have been
involved in the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't understand the emptiness in my heart. I wrote
furiously about another dead friend, relative, nephew, dad, role
model. We all were.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emptiness is a kind of a form of deeply rooted spiritual
shock,'' my world-traveling friend, Steve Williams, told me, the
one now looking for an explanation. ``My spirit for humanity is
dampened,'' Williams continued. `` As a 'quote-unquote' world
citizen, after so many encounters with people in 68-odd countries,
I'm kind of in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control a few years ago published a
report that said the overall firearms-related death rate for
American children under 15 years of age is 12 times higher than
that in 25 other wealthy nations combined, Williams said he read.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, television, music.
</P>
<P>
   Church youth groups, softball leagues and family vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Dungeons and dragons.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   High school graduation. Tragically dead.
</P>

   ``This car, that is as close to that person these students can

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Toby Stephens is the son of Maggie Smith, and when he
was growing up in the English countryside his neighbors included
Alec Guinness, Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright. But Stephens
says his childhood was ``actually very normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up in a theater family, but that doesn't mean it
was a constant Noel Coward play,'' Stephens, 30, said in his
dressing room at the Belasco Theater, where he is starring in the
Lincoln Center Theater revival of Jean Anouilh's ``Ring Round the
Moon.'' ``My mom and dad went off to work, and they came home. I
saw a lot of plays and understood that this was what some people
did: they dressed up in funny clothes and pretended to be different
people in different periods. And they earned money from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens is dressing up, earning money and, eight times a week,
pretending to be two different people: Hugo and Frederic, identical
twins with very unidentical personalities, in the French comedy
directed by Gerald Gutierrez. His colleagues onstage include Marian
Seldes, Simon Jones, Frances Conroy, Joyce Van Patten and Fritz
Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens received critical praise this year as Nero opposite
Diana Rigg in the Almeida Theater Co. production of Racine's
``Britannicus'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and somewhat less
praise as Hippolytus with Ms. Rigg in Racine's ``Phedre,'' also at
the academy.
</P>
<P>
   In England he has frequently performed with the Royal
Shakespeare Co., most notably five years ago as Coriolanus. In The
New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote that as Nero Stephens possessed
``authority and intelligence on the stage,''and Ben Brantley of The
Times called the performance ``compellingly tormented.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black turtleneck and jeans, and possessing
matinee-idol good looks, the personable Stephens _ whose father was
Robert Stephens, a Shakespearean actor who died in 1995 _ says that
not unexpectedly his heritage and his early environment played a
crucial role in his career decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me going into the theater and becoming an actor wasn't some
kind of romantic notion that I aspired to because my dad was a
welder,'' said Stephens, who trained at the London Academy of Music
and Dramatic Art. ``It was just what I saw people do. As a kid I
did have ideas of becoming a surgeon, but I was too dumb for it. I
figured out early on that I wanted to be an actor, because it was
the only thing I could really do well. At school I was never
particularly academically brilliant. But I found that when we had
poetry competitions, I had a facility for it.''
</P>
<P>
   That facility is on view at the Belasco in Anouilh's tale of
twins who think they are in love with the same woman and of their
domineering aunt (Ms. Seldes) who knows better. Hugo, 10 minutes
older _ ``who would have thought that those 10 minutes would have
taught me so much about women,'' the character says _ is cynical,
scheming, supremely self-confident, suave, debonair and heartless,
``the one who doesn't blush.'' Frederic is shy and uncertain,
awkward and dejected, slumped and sighing, but the one with a good
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play isn't a farce, but it's almost a farce,'' Stephens
said. ``It's a comedy with serious undertones. Hugo is driven by a
kind of ennui with life, because he has this incredibly quick mind.
Frederic is obsessed by the idea of love. He's a hopeless romantic
who enjoys the pain of it: he takes a perverse pleasure in his
depression. It's like two halves of one personality, and if they
were somehow fused you'd have the most wonderful person.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing such different characters, and switching back and forth
almost instantaneously from one to the other is, Stephens said,
very much a matter of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essential not to get too involved with the differences
between them,'' he said. ``You don't want to be left with these
incredibly gnarled personalities. You just play it as it's written.
And the way you achieve facility going back and forth from one to
the other is through constant rehearsal. In rehearsal you can go as
far with a personality as you want, and then you pare it down to
the essentials. And then it becomes an instinctive thing, through
rehearsing it again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   What grounds him in each character, he says, is ``physicality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with a posture,'' he said. ``You find that
physicality in each of them, without making it grotesque or
awkward. I normally work pretty instinctively toward that. You find
the kind of gesture they would use. And then, for me, the voice and
everything else falls into that groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens' parents' marriage broke down when he was 4, and he did
not see his father for about 10 years. He called his father Robert,
he said; Dad was his stepfather, Beverley Cross, a playwright and
librettist who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   His knowledge of his father came mostly from the movies,
especially ``The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' (1969), in which the
elder Stephens portrayed Smith's lover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved to America and Canada, and I didn't see Robert for a
long time,'' he said. ``But then toward the end of his life I got
to know him at the RSC. He was in London and I was in Stratford,
and then he was in Stratford when I was in London. It wasn't a
traditional father-son relationship. We didn't go fishing or
anything like that. But we had an interest in each other's work. He
was intrigued with my acting, fascinated seeing me doing parts he
would have wanted to do when he was younger. We swapped ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The elder Stephens had a severe drinking problem through much of
his career, and after almost two decades of minor roles returned in
triumph, first as Falstaff in ``Henry IV'' in 1992 and then, in
1994, when his son was starring in ``Coriolanus,'' as Lear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to have known him before he died,'' Stephens said.
``I was incredibly proud of him, and I know he was proud of me. So
as far as it went it was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens says he is hopeful that there will be more Shakespeare
in his future. ``I would like to do `Macbeth' as soon as
possible,'' he said. ``And I think I might be doing it with
Jonathan Kent at the Almeida in London next year,'' he said of his
``Britannicus'' and ``Phedre'' director. ``It's the one part I have
an idea about, and I would like to play it while I'm still
relatively young,'' he said. ``I see him as somebody just beyond
30, in the high pitch of ambition. Everybody asks me, `When are you
going to do Hamlet?' But at the moment I don't have an idea about
the role, and if you're going to do it you have to have an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes for the offspring of actors it is parents who have
ideas their children's roles. But Stephens says that with Smith
that is not a problem. ``She loves coming to see me, and she's
brilliant about not interfering,'' he says. ``We're not the same
sex, so she can't actually say, `Well, this is how you should do
it.' Because she doesn't know. She always has an opinion of my
work, but she certainly doesn't give me notes or anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment to think of other, less lucky children of
the stars. ``I know a lot of people from acting backgrounds,'' he
said. ``And they're terrified when their parents come to see them.
They get endless notes. That for me would be a nightmare. But
what's great about our relationship is that that doesn't really
become a part of it.''

ALLIES SIGNAL FLEXIBILITY IN DEADLOCK WITH YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and the other 18 NATO leaders,
sending a signal of flexibility Friday in the grueling standoff
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, offered to suspend
allied airstrikes if Belgrade begins withdrawing troops from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The allied leaders, addressing some of Milosevic's chief
concerns, also offered for the first time to involve the U.N.
Security Council in the quest for peace and the supervision of a
postwar international security force that would enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture offers Milosevic the prospect of having his
long-time ally, Russia, in a position to exercise a veto over plans
for Kosovo within the 15-member U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The international peace force would enter the troubled province
either after Milosevic agrees to allow it in or after the allied
air campaign eliminates Yugoslav forces as a threat, according to a
statement issued after a four-hour NATO session devoted solely to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also said NATO stands ready ``to form the core of
such an international military force'' potentially under United
Nations control.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and his colleagues, gathered here for the 50th
anniversary of the Cold War-era North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), matched the carrots with a tough stick. They vowed to
intensify air strikes against Yugoslav forces and sites frequented
by Milosevic until he bows to allied demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace and humanity will prevail in Kosovo,'' Clinton told his
colleagues gathered the elegant, columned hall, called the Mellon
Auditorium, where alliance leaders signed the founding documents in
April 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last European dictatorship of the 20th century will not
destroy Europe's long-awaited chance to live at last together in
peace and freedom,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   In their three-page statement, the NATO leaders stipulated that
``there can be no compromise'' on allied demands that Yugoslavia
``ensure a verifiable stop to all military action,'' agree to ``an
international military presence'' in Kosovo, agree to the return of
1.4 million uprooted ethnic Albanian Kosovars and provide
``credible assurance'' that it is willing to work out a political
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   American Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander for
Europe, flew in from Brussels, Belgium, to brief allied leaders on
the bombing campaign that started March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're winning,'' Clark said. ``He's losing. And he knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced that 2,000 more Army troops
will be deployed to Albania to support 24 Apache helicopters being
sent to launch new attacks against Yugoslav tanks and troops.
</P>
<P>
   But the 19 leaders of the newly-expanded alliance that now
includes Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic laid out the most
pliable road map to date for ending the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is prepared to suspend its air strikes once Belgrade has
unequivocally accepted the above mentioned conditions and
demonstrably begun to withdraw its forces from Kosovo according to
a precise and rapid timetable,'' the allied leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The allies offered to go to the U.N. Security Council, where
Russia has a veto, to seek a resolution that would cover
``deployment of an international military force'' into Kosovo to
protect returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO would merely have to be a key element of the force, with
other nations, including Russia participating, the leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, NATO has shunned involving the U.N. Security
Council in its effort to force Milosevic to end the killing and
deportation of Kosovar Albanians and agree to allow an
international security force in Kosovo. NATO officials have
insisted that the military operation remain under NATO command and
that any peace enforcement units entering Kosovo be led by NATO
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The allied wariness of bringing the Kosovo operation under U.N.
Security Council jurisdiction stems from the fact that Russia is
one of five nations with the power to veto any council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO leaders did not detail the makeup or command structure
of the peace force that would protect returning ethnic Albanians
who have fled their homes in Yugoslavia's scorched-earth evictions.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders declared that Russia has ``an important role to
play in the search for a solution to the conflict in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies offered to seek a U.N. resolution that also would
require ``the demilitarization of Kosovo'' _ language designed to
allay Yugoslav concerns and force the ethnic Albanian Kosovar
Liberation Army to relinquish the weapons it has used to battle
Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO statement did not target Milosevic for prosecution as a
war criminal, vowing merely ``to support investigation'' of all
those suspected of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The allies stipulated too that while Kosovo would gain
``substantial autonomy'' within Yugoslavia under ``an international
provisional administration,'' the province would remain part of
Yugoslavia after hostilities end.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaders put it: ``We reaffirm our support for the
territorial integrity and sovereignty of all countries in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies also did not mention any invasion of Kosovo by allied
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea again discounted the necessity for
ground troops, saying that ``the winning strategy is the air
campaign.'' He added: ``Ground forces are not some kind of
alternative panacea that you can introduce at a moment's notice.''
A number of NATO allies, including the United States, remain
opposed to a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   The allied flexibility followed former Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin's day-long meeting on Thursday with Milosevic.
Chernomyrdin emerged from the session saying that the Yugoslav
leader had accepted the concept of a U.N.-controlled
``international presence'' in Kosovo in return for NATO halting the
bombing campaign and the alliance withdrawing troops from
Yugoslavia's borders.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Milosevic's commitment
was ``an encouraging sign.'' But on Thursday night a spokesman said
Clinton and Britain's Tony Blair agreed that Milosevic's offer
``fell well short of what was required to meet NATO's conditions.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBADAN, Nigeria _ Resting his feet on a table before him,
youngest of his 22 children sitting beside him, a succession of
supporters prostrating themselves beneath him, Lamidi Adedibu
looked very much the part he ascribes to himself: a Yoruba
kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The strongman of Ibadan, to use the Nigerian media's name for
him, Adedibu huddled with advisers on this recent morning to
solidify support among his ethnic kinsmen for the man Nigerian
voters had recently chosen to end 16 years of military rule:
Olusegun Obasanjo, himself a Yoruba, as well as a retired general
and former president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Yoruba,'' said Adedibu, 72, as his daughter, Tola, 5,
demanded attention. ``We are one family. We understand ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A family perhaps, but definitely a quarrelsome one. Two months
after the election of Obasanjo, a month before he is scheduled to
assume power, the Yoruba are engaged in intense debates over their
position in Africa's most populous nation and their complicated
relationship with the president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will shape this nation of 110 million people one way
or another. But it will also be watched closely in other African
nations that have struggled to foster democratic governments and,
like Nigeria, were drawn haphazardly by colonial powers and include
different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoruba, of southwest Nigeria, are one of the country's three
main ethnic groups, along with the Hausa-Fulani, of the north, and
the Ibo, of the southeast. After a Yoruba leader, Moshood K.O.
Abiola, was denied an apparent victory in the 1993 presidential
elections by Nigeria's northern military rulers, many Yoruba called
for secession. Not since the Biafran civil war three decades ago,
when the Ibo tried to break away, had Nigeria's survival been so
strongly put into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before February's elections, the country's northern
politicians agreed on a so-called power shift. To keep Nigeria
together, they would yield the presidency to the south. So the race
pitted two Yoruba candidates against each other, Obasanjo and Olu
Falae, a former finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   That the race was won by the Yoruba candidate distrusted by many
of his own people raises the question of whether ethnic ties will
prove stronger than memory as Yoruba leaders decide on their role
in an Obasanjo government. Can Obasanjo, serving as president in a
civilian government, win over the Yoruba without alienating the
country's 250 other ethnic groups?
</P>
<P>
   ``The nationality question is the most important one facing not
only Nigeria, but many other places in the world,'' said Bola Ige,
a leading Yoruba politician and former governor of the southern Oyo
state. ``That's why you have Kosovo, Indonesia, and, nearer home,
Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If General Obasanjo succeeds in settling this question, his
name will be written in gold,'' Ige, 68, said. ``His place in
Nigerian history will be assured. So the ball is in his court.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also in the court of Yoruba leaders, without whom the
president-elect will not be able to begin creating unity.
</P>
<P>
   What role the Yoruba should play in a Nigeria led by one of
their own is being debated passionately here in the
quintessentially Yoruba city of Ibadan. It is home to the nation's
first university, built in 1948 by the British, the country's
former colonial rulers, a lasting testament to the Yoruba's
position as Nigeria's best-educated ethnic group. In keeping with
the city's nickname as the ``wild, wild west,'' political
discontent has often started in Ibadan before spreading throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 27, Obasanjo won decisively nationwide, but he lost here
in Oyo state, as well as in his home state, Ogun _ in fact, he lost
in all six Yoruba states. His loss was rooted in his first
presidency. In 1976, Obasanjo found himself Nigeria's military
ruler after his superior, a northern general, was killed during an
attempted coup.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Obasanjo cemented his reputation abroad by becoming the
first military ruler to step down voluntarily from power in favor
of an elected government. But at home, the reaction was mixed. In a
close presidential race between a northerner and a revered Yoruba
politician, Obasanjo was seen by the Yoruba as having favored the
northerner. The discovery that he had cast his own ballot for the
northerner fueled the Yoruba's anger and feelings of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's close ties to a military dominated by northerners
added to the Yoruba's lasting mistrust, which deepened in recent
years when he was quoted as saying that ``Abiola is not the
messiah.'' Abiola, a billionaire businessman, was imprisoned after
his 1993 presidential victory was annulled. Once held in suspicion
by the Yoruba for his own close ties to northerners, Abiola became
in prison the living embodiment of the Yoruba's political
disenfranchisement. He died last summer, still a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Obasanjo joined the People's Democratic Party, which
was backed by the retired military elite, and ran a presidential
campaign based partly on his self-description as a de-tribalized
politician who would look after the interests of all Nigerians.
Most Yoruba, meanwhile, voted for the Alliance for Democracy, a
party that swept all the Yoruba states but made no inroads beyond
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They campaigned against Obasanjo on the fear of
marginalization and extermination of the Yoruba race,'' said Layi
Balogun, 59, a prominent Yoruba architect and businessman here.
``Under those circumstances, Obasanjo had no chance in
Yorubaland.''
</P>
<P>
   As men waite hours outside his house for an audience, Lam
Adesina, the governor-elect of Oyo state, explained how Yoruba
leaders' attitudes toward Obasanjo had softened since his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in Yorubaland that you do not send a bad child to
be eaten by a lion,'' Adesina, 61, said. ``The Yoruba leaders have
put our heads together with our obas, our kings, to see how we
could help him. We should not be seen as a race fighting against
each other. Whether Obasanjo is good or bad, he is part of the
Yoruba race. He is part of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ola Oni, a former economics professor at the University of
Ibadan who now runs a bookstore from his house, disagrees. A
onetime believer in pan-Africanism and nonethnic politics, Oni, 68,
gave up on the idea of a united Nigeria after the annulment of
Abiola's apparent presidential victory in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obasanjo still hangs on to the old idea of one Nigeria,'' Oni
said. ``I no longer believe in one Nigeria. We are calling on the
Yoruba people not to accept his government and to regard it as no
more than a transitional government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been chosen by the north to assist in realizing the
northern agenda of domination,'' Oni added, repeating the most
frequent attack against General Obasanjo during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Adedibu, the strongman of Ibadan, said it was time to move
beyond such talk. Yoruba leaders, so used to serving in the
opposition, must now learn to work in the mainstream. ``The federal
government,'' he said, ``belongs to us, too.''

DAIMLERCHRYSLER GIVES VOTE OF CONFIDENCE TO BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Betting that Brazil's car market will
recover from a steep decline in sales, DaimlerChrysler AG
inaugurated a factory Friday to produce Mercedes-Benz automobiles
in Latin America's largest country.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, which already assembles Dodge pickup trucks at
a plant in southern Brazil, hopes to produce at least 25,000
A-Class compact cars in the first year at its new $820 million
factory. If the Brazilian economy climbs out of a recession and
manages to grow next year, as many economists are now predicting,
company officials said they could almost triple annual output to
70,000 by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is passing through a difficult phase,'' said Ben
van Schaik, the president of the Mercedes-Benz Brazilian
subsidiary, in a speech at Juiz de Fora, the city in central Brazil
where the new plant was built. ``But with the help of an economic
recovery and a reduction in interest rates, we remain optimistic.`
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, along with a half-dozen other car manufacturers
including the General Motors Corp., the Honda Motor Co. and Renault
SA, has pressed forward with expansion plans in Brazil even as the
country's automobile industry struggled with its most sluggish year
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of 1.1 million vehicles are expected this year, down
substantially from the record 1.9 million units sold in 1997,
according to Anfavea, an automobile industry association. The
decline came amid an overall contraction in Brazil's economy,
though there is widespread belief that a rebound is under way.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler hopes to sell as much as 85 percent of the
output from the Juiz de Fora factory in Brazil, with the rest
destined for neighboring countries in South America. The factory is
modeled on a similar Mercedes-Benz plant in Rastatt, Germany, which
also produces the A-Class. The starting price for the compact car
is expected to be about $19,500 in Brazil, compared with $22,000 in
Germany.

BRADLEY ON THE UPBEAT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 25, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Al Gore was never going to have an
uncontested romp to the Democrats' presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But new poll numbers giving Bill Bradley a very respectable
early number _ maybe a third of the vote _ against the vice
president in New Hampshire eliminate any sense of complacency in
the Gore high command. For Bradley to be inside 20 points 10 months
out from the first primary test is heartening to Democrats who
resent the ring around the party's bathtub left by the Clinton
impeachment saga.
</P>
<P>
   Voters angry at Clinton can't get at him anymore via the ballot.
But they can take out their fury on Clinton's faithful lieutenant.
And there may be another factor at work in elevating Bradley at
Gore's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics is inextricably linked to local politics
in the two kickoff states, Iowa and New Hampshire. Once you leave
those two in the rear-view mirror, campaigns become much more
compressed, expensive, sound-bite-and-tarmac oriented, and
nationalized. But until you get past Iowa and New Hampshire, the
Scylla and Charybdis of the preliminary presidential process, you
have to deal with the local ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   And the chairman of Gore's large and impressive organization in
the Granite State is Bill Shaheen, First Husband to Governor Jeanne
Shaheen. Initially, this was a coup for Gore, who's courted the
Shaneen clan for a generation, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   But the bloom is off the gubernatorial rose. The
liberal-to-moderate Dems who formed her core constituency in two
statewide elections are bawling at her for vetoing the state income
tax scheme pushed through the House to fix the school funding
dilemma, which is now almost a crisis with teacher layoff notices
flying.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore operation is wide, deep, well-heeled, and
well-connected. But similar campaign organizations, top-heavy with
frontrunning escorts, didn't prevent the likes of Ed Muskie, Walter
Mondale, George Bush, and Bob Dole from getting winged by the
contrary New Hampshire primary participants.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gore camp, it is to be devoutly hoped that local
Democrats stirred to anger by the governor's refusal to sign the
income tax imposition don't take their ire out against the
presidentrial candidate being managed locally by the guv's spouse.
Of course, this far out, it's all inside baseball anyway. Bradley
is getting a nice parade around the paddock because he's the only
other horse Democrats can play with.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the former New Jersey senator, a bit of a sobersides on
the stump, is raising money to beat the band. He lifted $250,000 at
a Seattle fund-raiser last week, a tidy sum for a fledgling
candidate just getting off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is positioned as The Democrat Who's Against the War in
Kosovo. That may be a nice, safe spot along the rail in the summer
and fall if the war goes badly. But if it ends relatively quickly,
cleanly, or in a notably victorious fashion, Bradley's naysaying
will not wear nearly so well.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is starting to lift some endorsements from Democrats not
enamored, for whatever reason, with Clinton or Gore. Senator Paul
Wellstone (D-Minn.) toyed briefly with the idea of running against
Gore himself. He was expected to endorse Bradley this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows quite how deeply the antipathy to Clinton's
Monica-mania will cut against Gore. We'll be treated to endless
analysis of that factor; the TV gang will keep cassettes of the
beret-ed Monica hugging You-Know-Whom right at the top of their
Gore's-in-trouble file.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will also get a big boost from the media types, who
generally like him. The TV crowd will have all sorts of silly fun
with old kinescopes of Bradley playing basketball for the Knicks
and Princeton. And the anti-Clinton establishment, personified by
The Wall Street Journal, will extol Bradley's virtues, to the
detriment of Gore, all the while soft-pedaling those Bradley
positions, like support for affirmative action, that the Journal
abhors.
</P>
<P>
   But, to pilfer a roundball expression before we are all sick to
death of such, any two-man primary contest inevitably boils down to
a high-stakes game of one-on-one. As Ross Perot, Dan Quayle, and
Jack Kemp discovered, Al Gore is no cigar store Indian in televised
debate.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of wrinkles the Gore team can resort to, if
stemming Bradley's momentum becomes more of a priority. Clearly,
Bradley has to come close, if not win, either Iowa or New
Hampshire, to avoid getting rolled up early.
</P>
<P>
   With the likelihood that the whole shooting match will be over
by next St. Patrick's Day, Bradley either breaks through early, or
he gets swamped. Gore will not be outspent, out-staffed,
out-advertised, out-organized. He will have to be out-foxed or
out-classed. But there are so many advantages, of incumbency, of
national experience, of political contacts, that Team Gore enjoys,
that no matter how good a candidate Bradley becomes, the advantage
will always lie with the other guy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the savvier among those coalescing around the
Bradley challenge understand that this is the easy part. From here
on out, it only gets harder.
</P>

SONIA GANDHI PARTY'S BID TO LEAD INDIA DISSOLVES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The dream of the Congress Party to once again
govern this nation of 980 million people by itself, with a member
of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty to lead them, turned out to be a mirage
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party president, Sonia Gandhi, boldly _ and it
turns out prematurely _ declared on Wednesday that her party had
the votes to replace the nationalist coalition that collapsed last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Congress Party's 140 votes in Parliament are far
short of the 272 required for a majority, Mrs. Gandhi said more
than a dozen smaller parties would vote with a Congress government,
even without having Cabinet posts. Their votes would ensure that
Congress would win a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But two tiny Communist parties and a bigger party based in Uttar
Pradesh dashed the chances of any such arrangement Friday when they
announced that they were dead set against any government led by
Congress. Admitting that the numbers are running against Congress,
a senior party leader, Arjun Singh, said the party is willing to
consider supporting a coalition that would include many parties.
</P>
<P>
   Six days after Congress and the other opposition parties brought
down the coalition government by a single vote, they are still
struggling to come up with an alternative. If they fail, the
president is likely to call for a general election, which would be
India's third since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal blow to Congress' plans was delivered by Mulayam Singh
Yadav, the leader of the Socialist Samajwadi Party. He said his
party's 20 Parliament members would not support any government
unless they were eligible for ministerial and policy-making
positions _ and Congress was not allowed to lead it. ``If anyone
thinks of forming the government without giving due respect to a
party having 20 members, then he is living in a fool's paradise,''
said Amar Singh, a party spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Samajwadi and Congress are potential competitors for the votes
of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous and politically
powerful state. If Congress revives its winning ways by gaining
control of a national government, the Muslim voters who deserted
Congress over the past decade might drift back, political analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulayam Singh Yadav is being asked to commit suicide and he
says, `No, I'm not too keen,''' said Yogendra Yadav, a political
scientist at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress gambit was in many ways an attempt by the grand old
party that governed India for most of the past half century to have
its cake and eat it, too. Congress, which has been in sharp decline

back it up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the principal reasons Congress lost power in the first
place was its failure to accommodate the rising aspirations of
regional and caste-based forces. So it is not surprising that
Samajwadi, whose most loyal voters come from Mulayam Singh Yadav's
own cow-herders' caste, would refuse to go along with restoring
Congress to power.

 &HT;    POTENTIAL NATO LEAKS HAS U.S. GOING ITS OWN WAY ON STEALTH
MISSIONS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon has kept from its NATO allies the
details of hundreds of U.S. combat missions to Yugoslavia under a
policy designed to ensure strict American control over all strikes
by cruise missiles and radar-evading stealth bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a security firewall aimed at preventing leaks from
NATO partners that might compromise those raids, give away tactical
or technological secrets or endanger American pilots, according to
senior Air Force officials.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is a sensitive one _ military officials would
discuss it only on background _ because it reflects tensions within
the NATO alliance over the sharing of top secret information.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman confirmed, however, that the bombing
sorties flown by the stealth F-117 Nighthawks and the B-2 Spirits _
the workhorses in the precision strikes on scores of refineries,
barracks, ammunition dumps and other fixed targets deep inside
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia _ are purely American operations.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, some say, is trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't keep secrets very long in the NATO command
structure,'' said an Air Force officer with extensive experience
with alliance operations in the Balkans, referring to the prospect
of leaks. ``That's just an accepted fact.''
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton hosts the heads of state and diplomats from
the 18 other NATO countries and two dozen formal NATO partners here
this weekend, the public focus is on five decades of alliance
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away from the diplomatic gala, American pilots and
planners are waging a war within a war, screening off from their
NATO partners the stealth missions military analysts believe have
hit well over 50 percent of the major targets destroyed so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's necessary from a security standpoint,'' said a separate
senior Air Force official with command experience in NATO
operations in the Balkans. ``It is the downside of allied
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials are less explicit. They concede, however,
that the stealth bombing missions _ as well as the cruise missile
launches from B-52 aircraft and U.S. warships off the Yugoslav
coast _ are cordoned off from overall NATO operations and are
instead confined to U.S. control.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are U.S.-specific systems and technologies,'' explained
a Defense Department spokesman who was authorized to address the
issue only on the condition of anonymity. ``We don't transfer
operational control of these aircraft to NATO command.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. pilots began suspecting from the start of Operation Allied
Force that Yugoslav military and government officials were being
tipped off shortly before targets were attacked. In some cases,
barracks or other facilities appeared to be vacated just minutes
before a scheduled attack. U.S. officials have declined to discuss
these incidents publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly NATO remains very vigilant in terms of protecting the
security of its operations,'' the NATO commander, U.S. Army Gen.
Wesley Clark, told reporters in Brussels on April 13, when asked
about alleged security breaches. ``We're taking what I believe are
all necessary and appropriate measures in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government is careful not to accuse individual
countries of giving away alliance military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Chinks in the armor of NATO security, however, have long been a
major concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everybody's nightmare,'' said former CIA anti-espionage
analyst Glen Buchan(CQ), now an expert on air power with Rand
Corp., a policy think tank based in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, there are specific foundations for caution.
</P>
<P>
   Several NATO members _ including Greece, France and Italy _
retain close historical and cultural ties to Serbia, the main state
in Yugoslavia. Greece is so cozy with Russia, another close partner
to Belgrade, that some new NATO members with histories of conflict
with Moscow have openly lamented having to share security
information with the government in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, NATO's only predominantly Islamic country, has been
working to cultivate ties with its giant neighbor, Iraq. U.S.
pilots have been flying combat air patrols over Iraq since the
1990-91 Gulf War, and have been regularly bombing Iraqi targets
since last December.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels last October, U.S. intelligence
agents caught a French military officer named Pierre-Henri Bunel
passing top secret details of NATO air strike plans against
Yugoslavia to Jovan Milanovic, head of the Yugoslav diplomatic
mission at the European Union. Bunel, facing espionage charges in
France, has admitted to handing off the information.
</P>
<P>
   Clark prepared those plans as NATO was threatening air strikes
against Serbs for ongoing aggression last fall against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. In the face of those threats, Serb leader
Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, agreed to end the
repression. He later broke that promise, claiming the need to crack
down on what he said were Albanian terrorists. As his troops massed
to begin a sweep across Kosovo, NATO launched air strikes March 24.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. suspicions about NATO security were heightened four nights
later with the downing of an F-117 Nighthawk stealth bomber outside
of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first combat loss in the 18-year history of the F-117
Nighthawks, which survived thousands of Gulf War sorties unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has not released its findings over the downed F-117
_ the pilot was rescued and his name not released _ and hasn't said
publicly whether the plane was shot down or crashed because of
mechanical failure or pilot error. Six other F-117s have crashed
during training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Asked this week whether investigators had ruled out the
possibility that the F-117's flight details might have been passed
along in advance to Yugoslav forces, Air Force Maj. Gen. Bruce
Carlson declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I should comment on any of that,'' replied
Carlson, who briefed reporters at the Pentagon on stealth
operations and the F-117 investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department spokesman who commented on background
said that at no time during the air campaign have the details of
stealth flight operations been shared NATO-wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still doing business the way we started out doing
business,'' the spokesman said. ``It's been this way since day
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The non-U.S. NATO participants are by no means flying blind.
</P>
<P>
   They are privy to the advance details of scores of sorties flown
each day by U.S. pilots of conventional fighters and bombers, as
well as refueling tankers, reconnaissance aircraft and other
support planes. Such conventional craft as F-16s, F-15s and A-10s
have been hitting targets as well.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots from Britain, Canada, France, the Netherlands and other
NATO countries have flown hundreds of sorties of their own,
moreover, that are woven into the American operations to form the
alliance-wide campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. planners coordinate the American-only portion of their
operations with the NATO-wide campaign to prevent accidental
shootdowns or other mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stealth operations are kept secret from the U.S.
allies, however, and because of the large role those missions are
playing in the campaign, only the U.S. commanders and the national
command structure _ the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense
William Cohen and President Clinton _ have access to a complete
picture of the ongoing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem we anticipated coming up sometime, we just
didn't anticipate it coming up quite so soon,'' said Buchan. ``One
of the things this means as a practical matter is that the other
NATO planners don't get to contribute intellectually as much as we
had hoped. It puts a big burden on the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Waging an air campaign is a monstrous planning and coordination
challenge. NATO pilots are flying between 300 and 600 sorties every
24 hours _ as much as a major airline, but in a decidedly more
hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   Each flight must be intricately planned and carefully folded
into the overall operation to ensure that bombers get the
protection, targeting and intelligence information and refueling
support they need. It also helps prevent accidents or mistakes
among allied warplanes flying missions in crowded skies.
</P>
<P>
   The master plan for each day's operation is contained in the air
tasking order, or ATO. It is contained in a thick book put together
each day at NATO's combined air operations center at Vicenza,
Italy, and also dispatched electronically to NATO members
participating in the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive guide to each day's campaign, the ATO is a sort
of air power playbook. Instead of x's and o's, it lists:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the F-16s, A-10s, Harriers, Tomcats, Prowlers, Hornets and
other conventional warplanes that will fly into combat on a given
day;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the bombs each will carry;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the targets they will pursue;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the times of their attacks;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the sequencing of support flights;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and the call signs and radio frequencies pilots will use to
communicate and an ocean of related details.
</P>
<P>
   The ATO is so secretive that the mere mention of its existence
seals lips instantly across the spectrum of military command.
</P>
<P>
   Even more secretive are the stealth operations, which are kept
off of the ATO that goes out NATO-wide each day. Those missions are
ordered separately, by U.S.-only command, as are the cruise missile
attacks, such as those that destroyed Milosevic's Communist-era
villa on Thursday and have repeatedly struck at government
buildings in the heart of downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, NATO pilots had flown roughly 9,500 sorties as
part of Operation Allied Force, roughly one-third of which were
actual bombing runs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials won't say how many of those have been stealth
flights. It's clear, though, that those aircraft have pulled the
lion's share of the weight in the precision targeting of barracks,
ammunition depots, refineries, and headquarters buildings,
particularly in the heavily-guarded skies above cities like
Belgrade and Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   There are two dozen F-117 Nighthawks in the NATO armada. Their
all-weather capability has made them indispensable to an operation
hampered by heavy clouds and fog on two days out of every three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have capabilities that the allies lack, particularly an
all-weather capability,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon told
reporters this week. ``And, to the extent that the weather's been
bad, the emphasis has been more on American systems than on foreign
systems, or allied systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent history, moreover, suggests that the Nighthawks -- which
can hit two targets on a single flight -- have been freight haulers
in a campaign that has relied heavily on dropping the kind of
precision-guided munitions the F-117 deploys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 85 percent of the strategic targets were hit by the F-117
in the Gulf War,'' Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald told reporters
at the Pentagon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force planners distinguish between strategic targets major
fixed facilities such as barracks, command and control bunkers,
ammunition storehouses, airfields or refineries _ and tactical
targets, such as tanks, vehicles and troops deployed in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Even less has been said publicly about the operations of the B-2
Spirit, the most advanced _ and, at more than $2 billion a copy,
most expensive _ warplane in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that we have flown a significant number of sorties,''
with the B-2, said the Air Force's Carlson. ``It's doing superbly
over there now.''
</P>
<P>
   Flying solo and in pairs, the B-2s have been regular
participants in the strikes, having flown dozens of 30-hour sorties
from the plane's home base at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri
into Yugoslav airspace and back.
</P>
<P>
   Individual sorties, though, are a poor measure of the B-2s'
contributions. The planes can carry 16 precision-guided 2,000-pound
bombs on a single flight and drop them accurately through clouds
and fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the B-2 _ one sortie, 16 different targets, all
weather,'' said Wald, summing up the utility value of the plane, as
he showed aerial imagery of eight buildings destroyed at an ammo
storage facility in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one B-2 aircraft that did that,'' said Wald.
``There's probably nothing left there.''

BALKANS CONFLICT TESTS CONGRESSIONAL SPENDING DISCIPLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After outdoing each other for months in their
pledges not to fritter away the federal budget surplus, both
parties in Congress have quickly agreed that the costs of the
Balkans conflict should be an exception.
</P>
<P>
   But having opened the door to spending some of this year's
anticipated surplus of $111 billion to pay for airstrikes and
relief aid, Republicans and Democrats alike now find themselves
sorely tempted to dip deeper for other military needs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Congress is facing an early test of its willingness
to hold the line on spending the huge and growing pot of excess tax
revenues being taken in by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   All of the current fiscal year's surplus comes from excess
Social Security revenues, money that both parties have argued
should be preserved at all costs to help deal with the retirement
system's looming financial problems. (There is not expected to be a
large non-Social Security surplus for two more years). So the
choice to spend any significant amount of the surplus beyond what
is needed immediately to wage the conflict in the Balkans will be a
particularly tricky one.
</P>
<P>
   The debate so far is over whether Congress should give the
Pentagon money beyond the $6 billion requested by Clinton to
finance military and humanitarian operations in the Balkans for the
next five months. Clinton's request by anyone's definition fits
into the category of emergency spending established a decade ago to
deal with expenses including wars and natural disasters, and is
therefore not subject to normal budget rules.
</P>
<P>
   But recent history suggests that both parties could also stretch
the definition of emergency this year to justify using the surplus
both for other military needs and pressing domestic issues like aid
to hard-hit farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most amazing thing is that having been so righteously
insistent about not spending a dime of the Social Security surplus,
to suddenly add other things to the emergency money for Kosovo
shows that they are abandoning the pledge at the first
opportunity,'' said Stanley Collender, a budget analyst for
Fleischman-Hillard, a consulting firm. ``The question is whether it
will extend to things beyond defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate cost of the war at this point is unknowable, but it
seems unlikely to make much more than a dent in a surplus that is
projected to reach $133 billion next year and to grow considerably
larger in subsequent years. The bigger issue may be whether it
alters budget politics.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for example, may conclude that they should
emphasize rebuilding military strength over tax cuts as their
signature issue for the next few years, particularly since the
groundswell of public support for tax cuts they had anticipated has
not materialized. Republicans including Dick Armey of Texas, the
House majority leader, have already said they would be willing to
scale back or postpone their proposed $800 billion, 10-year tax cut
to make way for new military spending.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will have to decide how to balance calls for
additional military spending against pent-up demand within the
party for new spending on social programs and their efforts to
build a reputation for fiscal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of the war, and the related push for more military
spending, is also likely to affect how Congress and the
administration deal with the challenge of remaining within tight
spending caps for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The caps were set by the 1997 balanced budget deal as a way of
imposing fiscal discipline, and if not changed will require deep
cuts in some programs next year. The conflict in the Balkans could
provide cover for both parties if they choose to raise or eliminate
the caps next year because of a need for higher-than-anticipated
Pentagon spending.
</P>
<P>
   Or, by adding more Pentagon spending in the current fiscal year
on an emergency basis _ money that is not subject to the spending
limits _ the two parties could pare back their Pentagon budget
proposals for next year, easing the pressure on the caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current definition of an emergency is anything we can't
pay for under the caps,'' said Susan Tanaka, vice president of the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog
group.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Senate debated a Republican measure this week that
would lock away most of the surplus starting next year for debt
reduction or shoring up the Social Security system, Republicans in
the House were considering proposals for as much as $29 billion in
new military spending, to be paid for out of the surplus, during
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are unlikely to endorse a figure as high as
$29 billion, but have signaled a willingness to pass an emergency
supplemental spending bill providing the military with considerably
more than the $6 billion Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats and the White House see an opportunity
developing to brand Republicans as fiscally irresponsible, but are
wary of politicizing the debate over the money needed for the
Balkans conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hopeful the supplemental will move forward without
delay in a way that funds the urgent and immediate needs, both
military and humanitarian, that arise from the Kosovo conflict,''
said Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the White House's Office of
Management and Budget. ``This is not the place to debate other
issues that should be addressed in the context and constraints of
the normal budget process.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House itself has a history of being flexible when
it comes to adhering to strict definitions of fiscal austerity.
Last October Congress patched together _ and Clinton signed into
law _ a spending package for the current fiscal year that stayed
within the caps only by designating $20 billion of spending on
programs like farm aid as emergencies.

HOSTETTER THE POWER BEHIND AT&AMP;T'S MEDIONE OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If investors believe AT&AMP;T has offered too rich a price for
MediaOne, they can largely thank a publicity-shy Boston
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Barr Hostetter Jr., who spurred AT&AMP;T to make its bid,
pushed company executives to place a high value on MediaOne's
assets, AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong said in an interview
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetter is MediaOne's largest shareholder and a former top
executive, but he had a falling out with MediaOne management
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was careful to say that AT&AMP;T was already eyeing
MediaOne when Hostetter approached several weeks ago to propose a
merger. ``But he was able to give us a confirmation of the insights
we had about the value we could extract from the investment,''
Armstrong said in a telephone inteview. ``He was able to give us a
better understanding of the situation and of the value.''
</P>
<P>
   If its bid is accepted, AT&AMP;T will pay $4,700 for each MediaOne
subscriber, a huge increase over the $2,700 per subscriber that
AT&AMP;T paid last month when buying Tele-Communications Inc., the
nation's second-largest cable operator.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said Friday that AT&AMP;T's bid was high, and they
wondered if the company could manage the acquisition while still
absorbing TCI. Amid the doubts, AT&AMP;T shares fell almost 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said that MediaOne is worth the price because its networks
are in some of the top markets, such as Boston and Los Angeles.
MediaOne is also considered to have upgraded its network more than
other companies so that it can carry phone and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetter, 62, is a cable industry visionary. A New York City
native and graduate of Amherst College and Harvard Business School,
he co-founded Continental Cablevision in 1963, long before most
people thought the industry had a future. He built his company into
one of the nation's largest cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He truly does walk on water in this industry,'' said Leo J.
Hindery Jr., head of AT&AMP;T's cable business, during a conference
call Friday with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Cablevision was sold in 1996 and became the main
portion of MediaOne. Hostetter retained a role with the company but
quit in a falling out when MediaOne moved its headquarters to
Colorado from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   According to Armstrong, Hostetter and his sister own 13 percent
of MediaOne shares. Forbes last year listed Hostetter as among the
nation's 400 wealthiest Americans with a net worth of $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   About four weeks ago, after Comcast Corp. made an offer for
MediaOne, Hostetter asked MediaOne to free him to pursue other
offers. He quickly approached AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had already done a lot of our own thinking and work before
Amos and we sat down together,'' Armstrong said Friday. ``But he
was an early participant in understanding the potential of the
MediaOne plant,'' or cable network.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is struck, Hostetter will once again have a high
post in the industry in return for helping play matchmaker. He will
be ``non-executive chairman'' of AT&AMP;T's cable and Internet services
unit, while Hindery becomes chief executive of that unit. Hostetter
will also have a seat on the AT&AMP;T board.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does a non-executive chairman do for a living? His first
responsibility will be to support the CEO, Leo Hindery,'' Armstong
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery said he and Hostetter could successfully lead the cable
and Internet unit together. ``Nobody should infer that I didn't
want this, didn't seek it out, that I didn't encourage it,''
Hindery said. ``Having him around is a delight.''

REGULATORS EXPECTED TO BE TOUGH ON ANY AT&AMP;T-MEDIAONE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Convergence, competition, shopping on demand. For
years, high-tech executives have used buzzwords like these in
promising that consumers would soon have a wide choice of fantastic
new cable, phone and Internet services _ all at low, competitive
prices.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, the promises have been as empty as the missing
stations on the proverbial 500-channel TV dial.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, analysts said a range of new telecommunications
services might truly be on their way with the news that AT&AMP;T Corp.
wants to buy MediaOne Group. The deal would doube AT&AMP;T's cable
holdings and make it the nation's largest cable company as well as
the long-distance and cellular telephone leader.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne, which until recently was based in Boston and was
called Continental Cablevision, is the nation's No. 4 cable firm
and largest in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T made its unsolicited offer late Thursday. Its bid of $85 a
share, or $62.5 billion at Friday's stock prices, topped an offer
of less than $75 a share, or $56.5 billion that the nation's
third-largest cable operator, Comcast Corp., made several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, several analysts said AT&AMP;T's offer would likely spark a
bidding war for MediaOne, though others said AT&AMP;T had offered a
high price _ equal to or better than $4,700 for each MediaOne cable
subscriber _ that no other company would top. Comcast Friday made
no comment on whether it would boost its bid.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne also declined to comment. AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael
Armstrong said he expects a response by May 6, the deadline for the
company to evaluate competing offers to Comcast's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said that the AT&AMP;T deal, if consummated, might
draw tougher scrutiny from regulators than have other recent
telecommunications mergers.
</P>
<P>
   With cable rates already rising, it makes little sense to allow
a giant cable company to become even larger by buying one of its
potential competitors, said Gene Kimmelman, codirector of the
Washington office of Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormous amalgamation of power in one cable
company, which also owns dozens of the most popular cable
channels,'' Kimmelman said. ``We think AT&AMP;T will be in a position
to thwart the advancement of competition in the cable industry.''
He said Consumers Union would ask federal antitrust regulators and
the Federal Communications Commission to block the deal. A
prominent senator, Republican John McCain of Arizona, chairman of
the Senate Commerce Committee, also said the deal would be bad for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors also questioned whether AT&AMP;T was offering too
high a price for MediaOne, and whether AT&AMP;T could swallow the
company while still digesting other big deals, including its $59
billion buyout of cable powerhouse Tele-Communications Inc. last
month. AT&AMP;T shares fell nearly 6 percent Friday, or 3 3/8, to 53
3/8. It was the day's most actively traded US stock. MediaOne
shares rose 7 7/8 to close at 77 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the deal, AT&AMP;T's Armstrong said Friday that the
acquisition would help AT&AMP;T accelerate its revenue growth. He also
said ``we don't think there's a regulatory risk'' in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And some analysts said that regulators might favor the deal
because of its potential effect on other parts of the
telecommunications industry: local telephone and Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   It is in those arenas that the merger could bring consumers new
services at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   When the government broke up the Bell System monopoly in 1984,
it left AT&AMP;T with no direct line into homes and businesses. AT&AMP;T
became a long-distance company, but local phone lines and local
service were controlled by the new regional Bells, such as Nynex,
now Bell Atlantic, in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Now, AT&AMP;T is buying lines into homes once again _ not phone
lines this time, but cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to relatively new technology, the company plans to offer
telephone service over those cable lines, putting it in direct
competition with Bell Atlantic and other local phone providers. The
company also will sell high-speed Internet links over its cable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T will ``go on the offense after that $110 billion local
exchange opportunity that's out there, and protect the $23 billion
long-distance business,'' Armstrong told reporters. Several Baby
Bells said they took Armstrong's words seriously. Denver-based US
West, for example, slammed AT&AMP;T's claim that it would reenter the
local market that it was forced to exit in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing less than a blatant attempt by AT&AMP;T to rebuild
its monopoly _ and do it on the backs of American consumers,'' said
Mark Roellig, vice president for public policy at US West. He said
the company was also trying to ``lock in a monopoly over the
Internet'' by controlling the links to homes and businesses when it
already owns a large share of the ``backbone,'' or main pipelines,
that carry Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Offering phone, Internet, and cable services over the cable
lines falls well short of the vision of ``interactive television''
that cable executives have promised for years. They had said
consumers would be able to buy clothing, groceries and other
products through sophisticated cable TV systems, and would be able
to pick from thousands of movies at will.
</P>
<P>
   Those services never materialized, thanks to high development
costs and low customer interest in the earliest versions. But if
AT&AMP;T can offer local phone service, Internet links, and cable TV
over its cable lines, it will have taken a large step toward
creating the sophisticated network that can carry ``movies on
demand'' and other services, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal isn't about telephone and isn't about cable. It's
about the convergence of the two _ of voice, data, and video all
coming together,'' said Mike Paxton, an industry analyst with
Cahners In-Stat Group in Scottsdale, Ariz. ``These things are
already happening right now, but at such a small scale that it's
not on most peoples' radar screens.'' The AT&AMP;T deal could bring the
trend to millions of new customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, an estimated 100,000 people receive telephone service
over their cable lines, including 24,000 who buy the service from
MediaOne. That is a tiny share of the 102 million US households.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1 million people link to the Internet over high-speed
cable lines, a small share of the 40 million or so Internet
customers, Paxton said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Adamik, a telecommunications analyst with the Yankee Group
in Boston, cautioned that technological hurdles may hinder AT&AMP;T as
it tries to bring these services to more customers. ``AT&AMP;T will
command huge market share, and the question is whether its networks
can withstand that,'' he said. ``That's a question that's only been
answered in the labs.'' No company has tried yet to carry large
numbers of phone conversations over cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, however, is forced to search for revenues in these
businesses, said Boyd Peterson, also of the Yankee Group. Revenues
in the long-distance industry are flat, prices are falling and
competition is fierce. AT&AMP;T's market share is under constant
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Residential long-distance revenues now account for 42 percent of
AT&AMP;T revenues. The company wants them to account for about 15
percent by 2004, Peterson said.

 &HT;    NATO ALLIES AGREE AT SUMMIT TO PRESS AIR WAR
 &HT;    With NATO-CITY and NATO-FIREWALL.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and his NATO counterparts brushed
aside Yugoslavia's latest peace offer Friday and agreed to press
forward with their air war, shunting aside the idea of using ground
forces.
</P>
<P>
   But in a shift, the 19 leaders meeting to mark the 50th
anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization expressed
guarded optimism that Russia might be persuaded to join an
international peacekeeping force in the embattled province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With that hope in mind, the leaders said they would seek United
Nations approval of a plan to place Kosovo under international
protection, a move that would leave the door open to the use of
ground troops at some point in the future.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said the alliance would
seek a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the withdrawal
of Serb forces from Kosovo under Chapter VII of the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
   That chapter, among other things, addresses the provisions for
the authorization of ``action by air, sea, or land forces as may be
necessary to maintain or restore international peace and
security.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without such a resolution, however, the NATO leaders
vowed to continue the air campaign for as long as it takes to bring
peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow this campaign of terror to succeed,'' the
alliance members declared in a 17-point joint declaration. ``NATO
is determined to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   In a solemn ceremony in a flag-bedecked, columned auditorium,
the 19 heads of state and government walked to a podium to sign a
``vision statement'' of the challenges awaiting NATO in the next
century. It said the alliance will have to confront terrorism and
the spread of weapons of mass destruction even as it fulfills its
original mandate for collective defense.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as host of the anniversary gathering, Clinton cast the
mission to restore security to Kosovo as a vital goal for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alliance will not have meaning in the 21st century if it
permits the slaughter of innocents on its doorstep,'' Clinton said
at the Andrew Mellon Auditorium, where the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization was signed into being at the dawn of the Cold War, on
April 4, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a question of territorial conquest or political
domination, but standing for the values that made NATO possible in
the first place,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last European dictatorship of the 20th century will not
destroy Europe's long-awaited chance to live at last together in
peace and freedom,'' he said, in a reference to the regime of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   White House national security adviser Samuel Berger dismissed a
Russian-brokered peace overture from Milosevic, which essentially
amounted to a plea for a halt in the bombing in exchange for
promises to end the repression in Kosovo and negotiate further
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obviously not acceptable to us,'' said Berger. He called
the Russian effort ``constructive,'' but said, ``on the question of
our stopping bombing, it could not be on the basis simply of a
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO reiterated five conditions for halting the air strikes. It
said Milosevic must:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ensure a verifiable halt to all military action and the
immediate end of violence and repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Withdraw from Kosovo his military, police and paramilitary
forces.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agree to the stationing in Kosovo of an international military
presence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agree to the unconditional and safe return of all refugees and
displaced persons, and unhindered access to them by humanitarian
aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide credible assurance of his willingness to work for the
establishment of a political framework agreement based on the
Rambouillet accords, which call for autonomy for the majority
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Behind the lofty rhetoric _ and behind closed doors _ Clinton
met with his NATO counterparts for more than three hours in a
meeting resembling a council of war.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging consensus was clear: Serb forces that have
terrorized Kosovo for more than 15 months will face escalating air
strikes of indefinite duration, and an oil embargo of uncertain
dimensions, but will not be confronted by NATO troops on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, as I said before, the strategy is not going to
change,'' said Solana. ``We're going to continue, with
determination,
</P>
<P>
   with intensification, with the air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, delivered a
detailed briefing on the air campaign to the delegates, essentially
offering them his assurance that 30 days of air strikes had taken a
withering toll on the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, we're winning, he's losing, and he knows it,'' said
Clark. He portrayed Serb field forces as the tattered remains of a
fighting force, cut off from supplies, orphaned from their
commanders, ''lurking in villages, running back in forests, and
otherwise trying to get away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clark, ``They are vulnerable to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said he thought there was ``a reasonably good chance''
that Moscow could be persuaded to support a U.N. resolution on
Kosovo and participate in a NATO-led peace-keeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some indication that the Russians have said that they
are prepared to participate,'' said Berger. ``That would be a step
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, though, that NATO would not back down from its campaign
in the absence of such a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would seek the U.N.'s approval, and I think we would have a
reasonably good chance of getting it,'' said Berger. ``That
</P>
<P>
   doesn't mean that if we don't get it, we won't go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council with veto power, so its support would be essential to a
Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The planned ``celebration'' aspect of the anniversary was toned
down because of the ongoing war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the leaders repaired Friday night to the White House East
Room, where they feasted on soft-shell crab and lobster cakes,
lemon-flavored spring lamb, strawberry nougat glace and champagne
while enjoying the singing of opera star Jessye Norman.

TEXAS SENATE PASSES $98 BILLION BUDGET THAT INCLUDES RAISES FOR
TEACHERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Blessed with a vigorous economy and a surplus,
the Texas Senate approved a $98.3 billion balanced state budget on
Friday, devoting almost two-thirds of that to education.
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, a Senate committee authorized $1.7 billion to
increase teacher pay and benefits. But negotiations with the House
could shrink the Senate's proposed $4,000 pay raise for
minimum-paid educators in order to increase tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Containing no new taxes, and allowing for a cornucopia of
generally small tax cuts that would affect many Texas families, the
Senate's proposed spending plan for 2000-2001 should have
widespread appeal, lawmakers said. It would save roughly $20 in
sales taxes for most families outfitting their kids with
back-to-school items and take pressure off local districts to raise
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   While the budget represents a 5 percent overall increase over
current spending, House Bill 1 was described as a no-frills
document by Senate finance Chairman Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conservative,'' Ratliff insisted, noting that lawmakers
resisted the urge to dip into future tobacco settlement proceeds
and earmarked 63 percent of its non-federal income to schools and
universities. The budget does include $1.8 billion in tobacco money
set aside for the two-year period that starts Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And even though it provides about half of the $2 billion in
property tax relief sought by Gov. George W. Bush, Ratliff said it
goes a long way in helping taxpayers. He said Bush's goal was based
on an early, rosy revenue estimate that was later scaled back by
$700 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake to couch that as some sort of a failure
just because the ambitions earlier were higher,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Senate's budget plan differs substantially from the
House's version, a 10-member negotiating committee of House and
Senate members will begin meeting on Monday to iron out
differences. Although their bottom lines are $1.3 billion apart _
with the Senate's total the larger of the two _ the differences are
partly a matter of bookkeeping. The House listed some likely
expenditures on an unfunded ``wish list'' rather than adding them
to the total.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that there are any dramatic differences,''
Ratliff said. ``We put more money in higher education, but they've
got a wish list that has a lot of higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry said the budget ``clearly articulates our
priorities _ education first, basic government, services and
significant tax cuts &UR; .'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The sum includes $3 billion for increases in teacher pay and
benefits and for property tax cuts, though specific amounts are
still being negotiated. The budget also includes $945 million in
new spending at universities and $100 million for new college
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate budget provides for a 3 percent pay raise for state
law enforcement officers, but since the House put the raise merely
on a ``wish list,'' it will be renegotiated next week.
</P>
<P>
   Because deficit spending is barred by the state constitution,
the House left about $700 million unspent but also agreed to allow
almost that much in tax relief. Measures allowing sales-tax breaks
for school-related spending and some children's medicine are
pending in both chambers, as are business tax reductions and
credits.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its budget strategy, the Senate Education Committee
on Friday approved an education spending plan to allow about $1
billion in property tax relief as well as $1.7 billion for teacher
compensation. Although the plan allows for raises of up to $4,000 a
year for minimum teacher salaries, Ratliff said it's possible that
the sum will be renegotiated to about $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   It would take $6,000 to bring the average Texas teacher salary
up to national pay levels, however. And 45 percent of the state's
teachers won't get the raise because they are already paid above
minimum levels cited in the bill. &UR;

 &HT;    The suit against Coca-Cola, case by case
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here are the allegations of each plaintiff in the
discrimination lawsuit against Coca-Cola Co. Several, according to
the suit, sought the company's help in dealing with problems at its
downtown Atlanta headquarters before seeking the assistance of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and filing their lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   MOTISOLA MALIKHA ABDALLAH
</P>
<P>
   Status: Still employed
</P>
<P>
   Abdallah has worked for Coca-Cola for more than three years as
an administrative assistant. She currently works in strategic
channel marketing, a division that has only one other
African-American employee, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says for the past two years, Abdallah has asked to be
promoted to a higher-paying grade level. In 1998, when she applied
for her current administrative assistant position, she again asked
if it could be upgraded to a higher grade. Her request was refused,
the suit says. Abdallah said her predecessor, however, was given a
higher pay grade.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also says that five white managers whom Abdallah
supports have made ``inappropriate demands,'' such as asking her
and other African-American administrative assistants to ``run
personal errands and do personal chores.'' The suit says the
managers made Abdallah feel like their ``black maid.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she repeatedly sought assistance from the company's
Human Resources Division over the past year but says nothing has
changed. Abdallah also said she was retaliated against in her 1998
performance evaluation, receiving a ``meets minimum'' rating,
although earlier evaluations were more positive.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY ALLEN CLARK
</P>
<P>
   Status: Still employed
</P>
<P>
   Clark has been a security officer at Coca-Cola since 1996. The
suit says that despite his extensive education and experience, he
has been ``consistently denied promotional opportunities given to
his Caucasian counterparts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark joined Coca-Cola after working in security at Grady Health
Systems' Emergency Care Center. He also has experience as a
correctional officer at the Lorton Correctional Facility in
Virginia and as an operations manager for Crowd Control Security
Co. in Stone Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says he applied for an upgrade in his position at
Coca-Cola in June 1996, to a position in the Internal Security
Group. The position, which would have significantly increased his
responsibilities, was given to an employee with more seniority but
without a bachelor's degree, which was one of the requirements
posted.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says Clark then applied for another position, in
February 1997, as a security team leader, but did not get that
position. In April 1997, he applied for a lead officer position. In
that case, he was not invited to interview for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Also during 1997, the suit says, Clark applied for ``multiple
jobs outside of security at Coca-Cola and did not get interviews
for any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had exhausted his administrative remedies before
going to the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   LINDA INGRAM
</P>
<P>
   Status: Still employed
</P>
<P>
   Ingram began working at Coca-Cola in 1990 as a customer service
representative in Dunwoody. The suit said she was ``quickly
promoted'' to technical dispatch adviser. During that time, she
noticed ``African-Americans worked disproportionately in lower job
grades and less desirable positions, and had difficulty moving up
in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, however, was promoted in 1993 to project coordinator in
the national accounts department, where she performed data
analysis. In 1995, she was promoted to senior information analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But as a senior information analyst, the suit says, Ingram has
``never been paid what her position merits'' and is underpaid when
compared with her white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the suit says, the pay range for her position was
$37,000 to $67,000, but her pay was below $37,000, and new postings
for positions with her title had higher pay ranges. The suit also
says other workers at her grade were being paid salaries of at
least $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also says Coca-Cola ``refused'' to give Ingram adequate
work space when she became a senior information analyst, providing
her with ``a cubicle and no phone.'' White counterparts, however,
had offices. The suit says Ingram also said a supervisor yelled at
her during a team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   KIMBERLY GRAY ORTON
</P>
<P>
   Status: No longer an employee
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the company in October 1998, Orton was a 13-year
veteran of Coca-Cola. She began in 1985 in a field sales position
after holding sales positions at Proctor &AMP; Gamble and Whitehall
Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, she held account manager positions in
Seattle, St. Louis and New York, during which, the suit says, she
received good evaluations on her work.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Atlanta around 1992 as manager of Promotional
Packaging Graphics for Coca-Cola USA, supervising about 15 workers.
In 1994, she moved to Coca-Cola's corporate headquarters on North
Avenue in Atlanta as a company director.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says Orton was ``grossly underpaid'' for her work at
the company, earning ``tens of thousands'' less than her white
counterparts. It says she failed to reach even the midpoint of the
pay scale for her director's position.
</P>
<P>
   Orton said employees she supervised had salaries higher than
hers. For example, her salary of $78,000 in 1995 was overshadowed
by an employee who made $85,000, even though the employee's grade
level was lower than Orton's. In 1998, the suit says, her $99,000
salary was ``one of the lowest paid directors in the company.''

 &HT;    Delta CFO relinquishes flight freebies
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A senior Delta Air Lines executive whose children were
involved in a controversial bumping episode has given up free
flight privileges for himself and his family for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Warren Jenson announced the move in a
memo to employees Friday. He said it came after a private meeting
this week with Chief Executive Leo Mullin, who hired Jenson last
year from NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past week has been very difficult for me and my family,''
Jenson said, adding he offered ``sincere apologies'' to both
workers and customers. ``I take complete responsibility for what
happened. The blame goes no further,'' Jenson said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred March 4. Three of Jenson's children and
one of their friends were flying from Atlanta to Denver and arrived
late at the gate, accompanied by Jenson's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary had agents move seated first-class passengers to
coach so the youths could sit up front, a process that delayed
departure 24 minutes. The friend, who was traveling on a discounted
coach ticket, got a free first-class upgrade in apparent violation
of a ticketing rule crackdown championed by Jenson. The incident
later was described in a pilot union newsletter and reported last
week in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman said then that ``several mistakes'' were made,
adding Jenson had reimbursed the airline more than $1,000 for
vouchers given to the bumped passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But internal grumbling continued, prompting Jenson's memo and
the flight privilege action. A Delta spokesman said such a
suspension is within the range of penalties for employees who abuse
flight privileges.

CARDINAL SAYS BAY STATE READY TO WELCOME REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The first wave of refugees from war-torn Kosovo will
be heading to Boston within the next few weeks, and Cardinal
Bernard Law said Friday Catholic Charities will be working to
reunite refugees with relatives living in eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration on Wednesday said it will bring
20,000 Kosovar refugees to American cities instead of sending them
to the US military base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba as originally
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first responsibility of the church _ and all of us _ is to
respond with humantarian aid to the immediate needs of the
refugees,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Catholic Charities has set up a 24-hour hotline local
Albanian-Americans can use to notify officials about their
relatives and where they are being held in camps along the Kosovo
border. Law said Catholic Charities will then notify international
relief officials in the Balkans that those refugees have a place to
stay in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Under the administration's plan, refugees with relatives in the
United States will be given top priority for relocation as NATO and
its allies seek to ease the dangerous conditions confronting by the
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians who have been driven out
of Kosovo by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has a substantial Albanian population _ estimated
at about 6,000 _ centered in Worcester and South Boston. The Bay
State has been identified as a priority location for refugee
relocation as a result, Catholic Charities officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The effort by the Catholic Church to help Kosovars was endorsed
Friday by Reverend Arthur F. Liolin, chancellor of the Albanian
Orthodox Archdiocese. Liolin said the archdiocese has been focusing
its efforts on raising money to ease suffering within Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church, he said, has greater resources and far
greater expertise dealing with immigration issues and the federal
government and is better able to handle the expected inflow of
refugees than the Albanian archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Law said Friday the administration's sudden strategic shift
means charitable organizations in Boston and around the country
must quickly gear up to offer housing, counseling and other forms
of assistance to the refugees once they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Law said the still-evolving plan launched by Catholic Charities
includes the use of two church-owned houses _ in Medford and
Brighton _ for refugees who cannot find housing with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   He also said charitable groups are in need of Albanian
translators who can help the refugees _ and those seeking to help
them _ navigate the cultural gaps and language barriers that will
inevitably divide them.
</P>
<P>
   Law said reports he has received from Claire Carroll, a Catholic
Charities offical now working at a refugee camp in Macedonia, is
that those driven out of Kosovo by the Serbs dream of someday
returning to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want simply to go home and live in peace and security
with their families and loved ones,'' Law told reporters in
Brighton Friday. ``The humanitarian commitment we share cannot rest
until we help them return to their homes and regain the sanctuary
of thier hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Catholic Charities has 70 years of experience in
resettling refugees, the cardinal said the church lacks Albanian
speakers amongst its staff and appealed for help from
Albanian-Americans who speak both languages to help as translators
for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Law also said the church has very limited resources to provide
temporary housing for the refugees and asked the public to consider
opening their homes _ or homes they own _ to serve as housing for
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Although a substantial portion of the Kosovars are Muslim,
Joseph Doolin, president of the Greater Boston Catholic Charities,
said Friday the emphasis will be on family reunification _
regardless of religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not specifying Catholic refugees,'' he said. ``We are
talking about refugees who want to come to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Law and other Catholic Charities officials Friday were uncertain
when the refugees will start arriving in the Boston area. Lisa
David, interim refugee and immigration services director, said she
has been told the airlift could start as soon as next week or three
weeks from now.
</P>
<P>

Donations can be sent to Catholic Charities Kosovo Refugee Fund, 49
Franklin Street, Boston, MA 02110.)

to pay for the direct costs of the air war and some relief aid
Republicans and Democrats alike now find themselves sorely tempted

RINGING IN THE EARLY TWOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 25, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH

<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you plan to spend New Year's Eve? Put yourself in the
driver's seat, says Cathy Minehan, president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston. Look at it through the eyes of a Y2K pro.
</P>
<P>
   It's Friday night, December 31. Many of the world's markets
already have been closed for a day (although not the markets in the
United States.) They'll be closed Monday as well. There is time to
work through any unforeseen demand.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have sat through endless meetings discussing the way that
dates are handled in the the computers of your organization;
performed massive tests with customers and suppliers; conferred
with the phone, electricity, and airline companies; bought
insurance; and, if you are a bank, filed all the necessary forms
for an emergency loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet you are holding your breath, realizing that Y2K problems
anywhere in the complex and increasingly integrated world of global
finance could quickly become yours,'' says Minehan.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen? Not very much at all, says Minehan, one of the
Federal Reserve System's point persons on the Y2K problem and a
co-chair of the Fed's Century Date Change Council _ especially if
public fears about the possibilities can be allayed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Banks plan to increase their supply of ready
money to around $200 billion from their normal level of $150
billion, in expectation that many people will generally prefer to
keep a little more cash on hand through the holidays. Most ATMs are
Y2K compliant now, and the probability of banking problems is very
low.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the public mood at century's end is one of the few
variables that can't be confidently tested, measured, and modeled
in advance. Therefore, Minehan has begun speaking out on the
preparantion that have been made for history's most fraught turning
of a calendar page.
</P>
<P>
   The problem now familiarly known as Y2K had its roots in the
early punch-card days of computers in the 1940s and 1950s. Only a
little information could be put around the edge of a card; the
solution was to use just two digits for a four-digit date: 54
instead of 1954.
</P>
<P>
   The practice was carried over when computer memories went
magnetic: cost was still a problem. Core memory for IBM computers
cost about $1 per byte in 1960. But then the silicon chip was
invented; 40 years later $1 buys a million bytes of storage. The
problem could have been fixed early, but it wasn't. Only in the
last few years has it come into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Its significance for the Federal Reserve System is great. The 12
regional Federal Reserve banks process something like $2 trillion
every day _ the settlement of everything from the US government
securities market, the Eurodollar market, the dollar leg of all
other foreign exchange transactions, and many other security and
bond markets, plus handling about 66 million checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's record-keeping has been rendered completely Y2K
compliant, and tested end-to-end. ``Recognizing that nothing in
life can be fully guaranteed,'' says Minehan, ``I am as confident
that Reserve Bank systems will function without fail in the new
century as I am that they will function this afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   About the rest of the system, there are several grounds for
optimism, too, Minehan says. There's the financial industry's track
record of coping with operational challenges, for example. From
blizzards to power outages to major software failures, companies
and their regulators have ``learned from (their) errors, built
sophisticated and extensive backup capabilities, and gone on to
create a record of virtually error-free operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there was the relatively glitch-free implementation
of the Euro last January 1 _ an auspicious sign.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly there has been the massive corporate planning effort that
will have cost something like $600 billion world-wide by the time
that it is done. Extensive testing has taken place; problems that
led to failures in 1998 _ airline reservation systems, automatic
inventory programs, and the like _ have been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   And surveys by the Board's 12,0000 depository institutions, J.P.
Morgan, a special Senate committee and a presidential commission,
and any number of blue-ribbon studies have reached the same
conclusion. Most of the problems have been anticipated and will be
fixed by New year's Day. There will be no planet-wide brownout at
the millenium.
</P>
<P>
   As the study by the J.P. Morgan Bank puts it, ``The real Y2K
affect on society and the economy has been spread across a much
wider spectrum of time and is of a much more subtle form than the
overnight chaos predicted by Y2K doomsday experts. Y2K problems
have been occurring, will occur on January 1, 2000, and will
continue to occur throughout 2000 and into 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that Y2K is no longer the most pressing
problem. The spotlight is now shifting to the matter of what to
call the coming decade. All kinds of suggestions have been made,
none of them very good: the Oughts, the Noughts, the Zeroes, the
Zilches, the Ohs and the Oh-Ohs.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore consider the suggestion of my colleague Peter Hotten.
Call them, the Early Twos. That has a pretty good ring to it,
doesn't it?

YUGOSLAVIA'S LOW FLIERS WAGE TREETOP AIR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's growing armada of warplanes dominates the
skies over Yugoslavia, but only down to a few hundred feet off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Below that altitude, small, but deadly Yugoslav helicopter
gunships and ground-attack planes are waging a low-level, treetop
air war, taking advantage of the hilly, wooded terrain, and NATO's
focus on bombing armored forces, to terrorize ethnic Albanians and
blast rebel fighters in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say that effectively grounding Yugoslavia's low
fliers would require diverting scores of planes that have already
been criticized by some Air Force generals for not launching larger
waves of bombing runs and hitting more targets.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, NATO jets would have to fly much lower to target the
Yugoslav planes, putting allied pilots at greater risk from ground
fire and surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   So while refugees streaming into Albania have reported strafings
or bombings by low-flying green planes _ the signature color of
most of Yugoslavia's aircraft _ NATO commanders say the threat does
not justify dramatically altering the tactics of the allied air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they succeed in taking off, their mission has to be short,
has to be of limited size and with limited scope,'' NATO military
spokesman Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani of Italy said this week in
dismissing the significance of Yugoslavia's Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO is not ignoring this air threat, its main goal is to
attack armored forces and special police in the field, as well as
the supply lines and command bunkers north of Kosovo that support
them. NATO has also put a high priority on destroying Yugoslavia's
top-of-the-line MiG-29 and MiG-21 fighters that pose a direct
threat to allied warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Yugoslavia's Galeb and Super Galeb attack planes, and
Gazelle and Hind attack helicopters, can take off and land quickly
on remote landing strips, and cruise low enough to duck under the
gaze of AWACS radar planes. They can also operate effectively under
the same clouds and bad weather that have thwarted scores of NATO
warplanes flying above 15,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Galebs, in particular, have effectively attacked
mountain camp strongholds of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The light
attack planes are equipped with 23-millimeter guns and
anti-personnel cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, NATO reported an increase in attacks by
Yugoslav planes and helicopters, including many on Sunday. Allied
jets were not close enough to strike the Yugoslav aircraft, NATO
commanders said. But American military intelligence said Friday
that the low-flying aircraft had curtailed their missions as the
week went on.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates that allied jets have destroyed nearly
three dozen of Belgrade's low-end fighter-bombers. ``We have
reduced by probably around 50 percent his airborne ability to
conduct ground-attack operations,'' Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson,
director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
reporters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these ground-attack planes were based at airfields in
Nis, in Serbia, and in Podgorica, in Montenegro, Wilson said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because all of Yugoslavia is a combat area, allied jets are, in
effect, enforcing a no-fly zone over the entire country. But the
scope of this air campaign is much broader than what American-led
patrols are enforcing over northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The allies created no-fly zones in those two areas after the
1991 Persian Gulf War to prevent President Saddam Hussein from
attacking Kurds in the north and Shiites in the south.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, allied pilots are attacking scores of targets
every day, from fuel depots and ammunition dumps to the armored
ground forces that are expelling thousands of Kosovar Albanians
from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the main mission of pilots enforcing the no-fly
zones over Iraq is to prevent Iraqi aircraft from flying. But the
threat of being shot down by allied fliers has largely grounded
Baghdad's Air Force. Until Iraq recently stepped up a belligerent
campaign of targeting allied planes with its surface-to-air
missiles, United States pilots complained of the tedious duty of
``boring holes in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   If NATO and Yugoslavia ever negotiate a settlement over Kosovo,
the allies are not likely to repeat the mistake Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf made at the armistice meeting to end the Persian Gulf
War. At that meeting, Schwarzkopf agreed to a request by Iraq that
it be allowed to fly armed helicopters anywhere inside Iraq so long
as they were not near American forces.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq used that air power, which it claimed was necessary for
self-defense, combined with heavy ground armor that survived the
war, to kill thousands of rebellious Kurds and Shiites.

HARRIS-LEWIS DEFENDS MEMORY OF LATE BASKETBALL STAR 
</HEADLINE>

 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON -- Just days before the trial is to begin, the widow of
Celtics star Reggie Lewis said Friday that she had filed suit
against the doctors who treated her husband to clear his name after
a story in the Wall Street Journal suggested that cocaine use was a
factor in his death.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the 1995 Journal story, ``I felt that Reggie died
two deaths, a physical death and one of his name,'' Harris-Lewis
said in a telephone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't physically bring him back, but his character is
something that never dies, and this lawsuit was my way of not only
understanding the circumstances surrounding his death, but
restoring his name and good character,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has sued Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., the cardiologist
who treated Lewis, as well as three other physicians, Peter L.
Friedman, Mark A. Creager, and John D. Rutherford, charging they
failed to diagnose Lewis with a life-threatening heart condition.
Jury selection in the trial begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge says he could not accurately diagnose Lewis's condition
because Lewis withheld information on his cocaine use until two
weeks before he collapsed and died on a basketball court in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis said she was not aware of cocaine allegations until
reading the Journal story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had questions about what had happened, about how this
could have happened with a young person who had relatively good
health all his life,'' said Harris-Lewis, who had a year-old son
and was pregnant with her daughter when her husband died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, about two weeks before the retirement of Reggie's jersey
at the Boston Garden, when that article came out in the Wall Street
Journal, I read it in disbelief,'' she said. ``I had never heard
that, and it came to me as a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   After the story was published, Harris-Lewis said, she spoke with
several people who had been quoted in the story, including Mudge,
who confirmed that he had been quoted accurately.
</P>
<P>
   During that conversation, she said, Mudge ``said to me for the
very first time that there was a conversation that took place where
there was an admission of drug use by Reggie.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis said she viewed a lawsuit as her only means of
restoring her husband's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's always been a search for the truth, and the only
way I could do that is through the judicial system,'' she said.
``Upon filing this suit, my questions were, `What do I say to my
children?' I think that his mother and his brothers and his family
and his community need answers. . . . This is the system we have in
America, and that is the only way we can search for the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she had requested that evidence of alleged illicit
drug use be barred from the trial, Harris-Lewis said she believed
that drug allegations ``sensationalize and hide the true issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge ruled last week that he will decide whether to consider
any evidence of drug use when individual witnesses claiming to have
such information are called to the stand.
</P>
<P>
   As she has since the Journal story was published, Harris-Lewis
vigorously denied that her husband used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the lifestyle we led. That's not what he was
interested in,'' she said. ``He was a very productive person and
cared about his health, his profession, and his family, so he would
not do anything irresponsible to jeopardize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis noted that several factors other than drugs could
have caused the damage to Lewis's heart, including a virus, as was
recorded on his death certificate. ``But this is sexier,'' she said
of cocaine allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had considered settling the suit out of court,
Harris-Lewis declined to comment.

TO LITTETON'S CLERICS, WORDS OF EXPERIENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Ky. Ark.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One dreadful week last May, the Rev. Zane O. Wilson, pastor of
Springfield Lutheran Church in Springfield, Ore., got telephone
calls from fellow Lutheran clerics in far-off places like
Jonesboro, Ark., and Paducah, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   They were calling because they had heard on the news that a
gun-wielding adolescent had fired on classmates at a Springfield
high school, killing two and wounding others. Similar shootings had
occurred in their own communities, and they wanted to offer Wilson
support and advice.
</P>
<P>
   One caller, Wilson recalled in an interview, told him, ``You've
become a member of a club that no one wants membership in.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what they said _ that the people of his congregation
would want to find some way to be of service to their town _ was
something Wilson passed along this week when he called members of
the clergy in Littleton, Colo., scene of the school shooting on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the violence in Springfield, Wilson's congregation
threw open its doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right across the street from the doors to the emergency
room,'' he said. ``Everybody who wanted to find a place to get out
of the sun, or get a drink of water, or find a place to pray, came
in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters, parked outside the hospital, came over. The
congregation was host to a prayer service that night, drawing about
500 people to a sanctuary designed for fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that these folks do well,'' Wilson said of
his congregation, ``is they welcome the stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   One man who called him then, and who also phoned clerics in
Littleton this week, was the Rev. Laird H. Duran, pastor of Our
Saviour Lutheran Church in Jonesboro, the town where four girls and
a teacher were shot to death at Westside Middle School in March
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter he faxed this week to four Lutheran churches in
Littleton, Duran quoted Psalm 51, verse 14, which begins, ``Deliver
me from bloodshed, O God.'' Talking with one pastor, he advised
going to the school, the hospitals and meetings of parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Littleton clerics also need to take time for their own
spiritual needs, Duran said, lest they be overwhelmed. After the
shooting in Jonesboro, he said, it helped him to keep a prayer
journal on his computer, maintaining a communication with God that
ran from Job-like questions (``Why us?'') to reflections on the
Gospels' account of Jesus' suffering and Resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wilson and Duran said Littleton's clergy would have to
think about the long-term impact of the violence on the community.
In Jonesboro, Duran said, when he preaches against evil, once a
very broad concept, people now think he is talking about what
happened at Westside Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said Littleton's high school students ought to be kept
together and active.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to community, and schools provide that in this
culture,'' he said. ``And these kids have lost their school, at
least temporarily. If you're a 16-year-old at Columbine High and
your school is shut, what are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Littleton clerics who have been receiving the phone
calls is the Rev. Robert C. Barger, senior pastor at Abiding Hope
Lutheran Church. Barger got to the scene of the shooting shortly
after the police. He spent the day there, trying to comfort
students and staff members who had fled the school. ``I'm still
quite numb,'' he said in a phone interview yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Some who have called him from places where school shootings
occurred earlier have ended up crying on the phone. ``The common
thread,'' Barger said, is that each had thought the shooting in his
or her community ``would so shock the culture that things would
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiding Hope Church held a community service on Wednesday and
has begun providing space for counseling services by an agency
affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
Barger's denomination.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evening, Barger tried to take a break, driving to a
video store to look for what he called ``a redemptive movie.'' He
had in mind ``Holland's Opus,'' about a high school music teacher.
But at the store, he felt surrounded by movies with highly violent
content. He had a feeling, he said, ``of wanting to scream out,
`Don't we get it?'''
</P>
<P>
   A question he said he wanted to put before his congregation was,
``Are we willing to be peacemakers, nonviolent, and say no to the
culture?''

   BOSTON -- Just days before the trial is to begin, the widow of
Celtics star Reggie Lewis said Friday that she had filed suit
against the doctors who treated her husband to clear his name after
a story in the Wall Street Journal suggested that cocaine use was a
factor in his death.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the 1995 Journal story, ``I felt that Reggie died
two deaths, a physical death and one of his name,'' Harris-Lewis
said in a telephone interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't physically bring him back, but his character is
something that never dies, and this lawsuit was my way of not only
understanding the circumstances surrounding his death, but
restoring his name and good character,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has sued Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., the cardiologist
who treated Lewis, as well as three other physicians, Peter L.
Friedman, Mark A. Creager, and John D. Rutherford, charging they
failed to diagnose Lewis with a life-threatening heart condition.
Jury selection in the trial begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge says he could not accurately diagnose Lewis's condition
because Lewis withheld information on his cocaine use until two
weeks before he collapsed and died on a basketball court in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis said she was not aware of cocaine allegations until
reading the Journal story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had questions about what had happened, about how this
could have happened with a young person who had relatively good
health all his life,'' said Harris-Lewis, who had a year-old son
and was pregnant with her daughter when her husband died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, about two weeks before the retirement of Reggie's jersey
at the Boston Garden, when that article came out in the Wall Street
Journal, I read it in disbelief,'' she said. ``I had never heard
that, and it came to me as a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   After the story was published, Harris-Lewis said, she spoke with
several people who had been quoted in the story, including Mudge,
who confirmed that he had been quoted accurately.
</P>
<P>
   During that conversation, she said, Mudge ``said to me for the
very first time that there was a conversation that took place where
there was an admission of drug use by Reggie.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis said she viewed a lawsuit as her only means of
restoring her husband's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's always been a search for the truth, and the only
way I could do that is through the judicial system,'' she said.
``Upon filing this suit, my questions were, `What do I say to my
children?' I think that his mother and his brothers and his family
and his community need answers. . . . This is the system we have in
America, and that is the only way we can search for the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she had requested that evidence of alleged illicit
drug use be barred from the trial, Harris-Lewis said she believed
that drug allegations ``sensationalize and hide the true issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge ruled last week that he will decide whether to consider
any evidence of drug use when individual witnesses claiming to have
such information are called to the stand.
</P>
<P>
   As she has since the Journal story was published, Harris-Lewis
vigorously denied that her husband used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the lifestyle we led. That's not what he was
interested in,'' she said. ``He was a very productive person and
cared about his health, his profession, and his family, so he would
not do anything irresponsible to jeopardize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis noted that several factors other than drugs could
have caused the damage to Lewis's heart, including a virus, as was
recorded on his death certificate. ``But this is sexier,'' she said
of cocaine allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had considered settling the suit out of court,
Harris-Lewis declined to comment.

RACE IS ON TO GRAB `TRENCHCOAT' DOMAIN NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As TV screens flashed with live news reports of the school
shootings at Columbine High School on Tuesday, Jose Troche of
Taunton, Mass. rushed to his computer to register the Internet
domain names trenchcoatmafia.net, trenchcoatmafia.org., and
trenchcoatmafia.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want someone to use those names to come up with a
neo-Nazi Web page, saying `Let's blow up the world,' '' said
Troche, 29, who owns Kronix Beepers in Norton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In the 24 hours that it took to complete the transaction,
someone had beaten Troche by minutes for trenchcoatmafia.com, but
it was someone who also wanted to keep others from making money off
the name, Troche said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Colorado teens who presumably shot to death 12
classmates and a teacher before turning their guns on themselves,
belonged to group that called themselves the Trenchcoat Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   As the news stunned the nation, many looked to the Internet for
answers on what the group stood for. Others, Troche said, were
looking on ways to cash in on the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A name _ that's all it takes to make a million dollars off the
Net,'' Troche said. ``They'd have over 40,000 people a day going to
the Web page, being curious.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, two people have offered him big money for the Web
addresses. One man offered $30,000, he said. The other offered
$35,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them said he wanted to do an antiviolence Web page, but
he wanted to keep his name anonymous and pay me cash,'' Troche
said. ``The other one said he wants to keep the page out of harm's
way. I said I'm already doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Web publisher e-mailed Troche, asking him whether he could
design a Web page that serves as a memorial to the victims,
complete with poems and photographs. Troche said sure, but he would
have to approve the page before it goes live.
</P>
<P>
   Troche said he thought about registering the domain names
immediately when he saw the TV news because it was fresh in his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Troche has been something of a player in the nascent world of
registering Internet names, in which users scramble to claim new
names and buzzwords _ either to protect them, sell them, or just
frustrate others who might want them.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Troche registered a domain name for his
company. He has also registered several other domain names, most of
them relating to hip-hop music producer Sean ``Puffy'' Combs _ whom
he says he wants to annoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate Sean Combs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't like Comb's style of music and says the
entertainer does not give back enough of his money to poor
communities. Combs and his company could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   As people find out that Troche owns the Trenchcoat Mafia-related
domain names, he has been getting a flurry of calls and e-mails.
Some call him nasty names, thinking he is trying to profit off it.
Others, he said, are supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Some have even called him noble.

NATO LEADERS REMAIN STAUNCH ON DEMANDS TO MILOSEVICH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA AND ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under extraordinarily heavy security, leaders of
the 19 NATO nations Friday convened their 50th-anniversary summit
with a get-tough message for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic:
Agree to all NATO demands or face ever more intense bombing of
``central nervous system'' targets such as Serb TV.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic can expect more attacks like the ones that devastated
Serb TV on Thursday night and earlier smashed the ruling party
headquarters in Belgrade and one of Milosevic's residences. The
raid on Serb TV, which killed 10 people according to officials in
Belgrade, drew criticism from western media groups as well as from
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said NATO's current strategy is to
``strike directly at the central nervous system of Milosevic's
regime.'' He justified Serb TV as a legitimate target _ part of
Milosevic's ``propaganda machine,'' which ``bears as much
responsibility, if not more, than the Serb forces themselves for
the chaos and mayhem that we have witnessed in Yugoslavia since
1991.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments on the 31st day of the conflict Friday:
</P>
<P>
   _ The European Union imposed an oil embargo on Yugoslavia to
prevent Milosevic from importing gasoline and other fuel now that
his refineries have been heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO leaders discussed the issue of deploying ground troops
during a closed-door session, and according to a senior US official
the point was made that ``the public had a right to know that we're
looking at every option.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon said it will send 2,000 more troops to the
Balkans. Defense Secretary William Cohen approved the new
deployments in conjunction with the arrival of 24 U.S. Apache
attack helicopters. The ground-based forces will help protect the
Apaches while they are on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Geneva, the UN Commission on Human Rights denounced ``war
crimes'' by Serb forces in Kosovo. Harold Hongju Koh, a US
assistant secretary of state, accused Milosevic of having
``meticulously planned'' atrocities in Kosovo. Only Russia voted
against the resolution. NATO leaders Friday said they would seek a
UN Security Council resolution requiring the pullout of hostile
forces from Yugoslavia and the return of refugees under
international military supervision.
</P>
<P>
   _ While NATO leaders dismissed a peace overture from Milosevic
that was carried out of Yugoslavia by Russian envoy Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, officials acknowledged that it did show small
movement on Milosevic's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that over the next few days we'll have more contact
and we'll get more detail,'' said Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger, the
White House national security adviser. ``I'm not sure that the
Russians are asserting that this is a sufficient basis on which
this can end. It certainly doesn't look like that from our
perspective. But we encourage them to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, said NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO
will continue to operate from the air, where it enjoys
``mid-to-high altitude air superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic has shown a willingness to accept a high
level of damage,'' Clark said. But his forces are increasingly
``vulnerable to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark and a series of American, British, and allied officials
hammered home the same message throughout the day as NATO tried to
carry out two very different types of events _ managing a war and
conducting a celebratory weekend to mark its 50th anniversary. It
was essential, they said, that Milosevic meet all of NATO's
demands, which would mean he would pull all his forces out of
Kosovo and allow an international military force to police the
return of Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary general, Javier Solana, said once NATO
accomplished those aims it would implement a ``long-term strategy''
to stabilize southeastern Europe in cooperation with the European
Union and other governments.
</P>
<P>
   Solana pledged economic and security aid to Albania and
Macedonia, in particular. Sunday leaders of the seven countries
that are on the front-line of the Balkan conflict _ Bosnia,
Croatia, Albania, Macedonia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria _ will
meet with NATO leaders. Solana said the seven ``will be at this
point closer partners to the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Friday looked more like a ghost town than the
glittering site of the most powerful gathering of world leaders
since the funeral of President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents heeded the dire warnings of traffic gridlock and
stayed away from downtown. Some 90,000 federal workers and all
District of Columbia employees had been given a paid day off, and
public schools in Washington were closed as well.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear from the nearly deserted streets and empty
restaurants and shops on what normally would have been a
dress-down, eat-out Friday, that it wasn't only government
bureaucrats who had taken leave of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had de-emphasized the social aspects of the summit in
light of NATO's serious Kosovo business, and if not for the
extraordinarily large and visible security force and the sirens of
speeding motorcades, the big meeting might have been missed
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations in Lafayette Park and on the Mall near the
Washington Monument were low key, too. During a noontime rally
across from the White House, about 100 Albanian-Americans, many
waving or wrapped in the red, double-eagle Albanian flag, chanted
``Bomb, NATO, bomb!'' and ``Send in the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilir Zherka, executive director of the National
Albanian-American Council, said his group supports the NATO air
campaign but fears Kosovo will be lost if the alliance doesn't also
launch a ground war and arm the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army soon.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mall, war protester Daniel Ellsberg, a prominent activist
against the Vietnam War in the the 1970s, told a small gathering
that NATO's bombing has made ``a human disaster into a
catastrophe.'' Instead of celebrating a success on its 50th
anniversary, NATO had created ``its own worst nightmare,'' Ellsberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Serbian-American leaders hope to rally between 5,000
and 10,000 anti-NATO demonstrators to protest the bombing of
Yugoslavia, which is killing civilians and destroying the
republic's infrastructure, said Zoran Hodjera, president of the St.
Luke Serbian Church congregation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hodjera denied demonstrators would attempt to disrupt the NATO
meetings, an assertion made Wednesday by a NATO spokesman in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of security personnel were on hand Friday to ensure there
would be no disruptions. Law enforcement officers from every
jurisdiction _ the Park and Metropolitan Police, the Secret
Service, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,
and the Army _ kept a watchful eye on Friday's rallies and streets
around the summit meetings.

<P>
   The Ogden Corp. is paying the price for breaking the 11th
commandment, analysts say. For years, they contend, Ogden neglected
the imperative to maximize shareholder value, and though the
company seems to have finally gotten religion, it remains largely
shunned by investors.
</P>
<P>
   A New York-based conglomerate with $1.7 billion in worldwide
sales, Ogden stumbled through much of the 1990s with a confusing
collection of mediocre businesses _ from stadium concession stands
to contract manufacturing _ and with sluggish profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost their credibility,'' said Peter S. Jacobs, an
analyst with Ragen MacKenzie, a brokerage firm in Seattle.
``Earnings were in a rut, and the stock was going nowhere.''
Investors criticized R. Richard Ablon, the chief executive, and
Ogden's board as not moving quickly to find new opportunities while
growth slowed at the company's core business of waste-to-energy
power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Quintin G. Marshall, an Ogden spokesman, attributed the
company's poor stock performance to various regulatory changes in
the waste-to-energy business that hurt that industry's growth
prospects. Ogden's complexity obscured its promising business
lines, he said. ``The underlying trends of growth may not have been
readily apparent to the street,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite periods of outperformance, Ogden's shares have returned
a paltry 2.7 percent a year since 1990, on average, through March
31, compared with 18.0 percent return for the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to do something to spark interest again,'' Jacobs
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Ogden, under Ablon, hadn't done some spade work. Since
late 1995, it has sold off $1 billion of sundry operations. It
emerged with three focused businesses, analysts say, each with a
solid franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest is its energy unit, with $804 million in sales,
which develops, owns and operates 27 waste-to-energy plants as well
as other power sites. Its operating earnings will grow 10 percent
to 15 percent annually, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation services unit, with $310 million in sales, provides
cargo handling and other services to airlines and airports; its
earnings are expected to grow 15 percent to 20 percent a year. And
the entertainment division, with $486 million in sales, owns and
runs water parks among other things; its earnings are expected to
grow 15 percent to 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration with the company's share price prompted management
to announce a plan on March 11 to split Ogden into two separate
public companies. One would consist of the energy business and the
other the entertainment and aviation services units, which have
grown to a size that analysts believe will make for a viable public
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden expects an initial offering of 15 percent to 20 percent of
the entertainment and aviation services unit's shares this fall,
with the remainder to be distributed as a tax-free dividend to
shareholders by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, investors hail such strategies for unlocking
shareholder value. But in this case, Wall Street has yawned. Ogden
shares seem locked in the pre-announcement trading range of $23 to
$27 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the stock, which closed Friday at $25.875, has been
constrained by uncertainty about the new entities' capital
structures, the status of the dividend _ now a bond-like 4.83
percent _ and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service has yet to
approve the tax-free status of a spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs said the release of a definitive business plan,
expected by July, ``should go a long way to boost interest in the
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Loeb, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella, said that the
split-up signaled a shift in management philosophy, and that the
stock was undervalued relative to Ogden's assets and earnings
prospects. He values the post-split companies at $36 a share and
expects earnings of $2.50 a share for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   David Wolfe, managing director with CIBC Oppenheimer, said the
split-up would make it much easier for investors to get their hands
around Ogden's true value. ``You have two businesses _
entertainment and aviation _ growing in excess of 20 percent a
year,'' said Wolfe, ``but they're masked by the more mature energy
unit,'' which generates about 60 percent of operating earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, aviation and entertainment contributed 24 percent to
operating earnings. Next year, he expects those businesses to
contribute 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe thinks his 12-month price target of $32, or 15.7 times
projected 2000 earnings of $2.03 a share, could prove conservative.
Still, that is a total return of 27.8 percent. Jacobs expects the
stock to hit $34 in 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr, Marbach &AMP; Co., an
asset management firm in Columbus, Ind., who has owned the stock
for about two years, sees the split-up as a step in the right
direction. ``There really isn't much downside risk,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts expect management to trim the dividend but they
predict that yield will remain an important component of total
return.
</P>
<P>
   Will Ogden be able to reinvent itself? ``As I see it, cash flow
is strong, and the businesses are growing nicely,'' Jacobs said.
``The shares trade at half the market multiple, so downside is
limited, and upside is substantial. Meanwhile, I'm getting almost 5
percent to wait.''

 &HT;    Tax break welcomed by caregivers
 &HT;    EDS: EMBARGOED for Sunday, April 25
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Earnest Prather dabs rouge along the smooth, pale
ridge of his wife's cheekbone, careful to work the brush all the
way up to the corner of her eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get it high enough, she lets me know,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Prather applies his wife Beverly's make-up every morning, then
fixes her hair, the most recent of a long list of daily activities
he has had to assume for his 65-year-old wife as Alzheimer's
disease steadily robs her memory and her mental abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Prather, who is 68, must now help bathe her, feed her, dress her
and make sure she doesn't wander from their ranch home in Harrison
Twp. and into harm's way. His caregiving is a ceaseless, full-time
job, 24 hours a day every day, with much-needed breaks three times
a week, for six hours at a time, when he can take his wife to an
adult day care program and catch up on his housework.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the program is $564 a month _ a financial burden
Prather hopes he can continue to carry at least a couple more
years. ``I want to keep her home as long as I can,'' he said of his
one-time high school sweetheart. ``We've been together for 48
years. . . She waited on me hand and foot for a long time, and what
goes around comes around.''
</P>
<P>
   Prather is one of millions of Americans laboring quietly at home
for their disabled or elderly loved ones, often with little or no
outside support. Their burden in time and money is the great hidden
cost of America's health care system, a cost that could double or
triple over the next 30 to 40 years as baby boomers age and the
ranks of those needing long-term care swell.
</P>
<P>
   For every elderly person in a nursing home in America, there are
two of equal disability being tended to at home, experts say. More
than 65 percent of disabled elderly living in the community rely
exclusively on unpaid sources, usually family or friends _ a $196
billion annual price tag if government were to pay the bill,
according to a 1997 study published recently in the journal Health
Affairs .
</P>
<P>
   Many of these caregivers are themselves poor and one in three is
in relatively poor health, according to a U.S. House Ways and Means
committee report.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Clinton administration is proposing a $1,000 tax credit
for people needing long-term care, or for the relatives taking care
of them at home _ a fraction of the $50,000 a year it would cost
the government for someone in a nursing home. The package also
calls for $125 million in funding for adult day care and respite
programs to help give family caregivers a break.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was in Dayton last week touting the tax
relief, which an estimated 2 million Americans will qualify for at
a cost of $5.5 billion over five years. Some version of the
proposal is expected to come before Congress this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the tax credit plan represents a small but long
overdue recognition of the important role families and friends play
in long-term care. But critics, including financial writer Jane
Bryant Quinn, point out that the credit won't help the poor who pay
little or no taxes, that it opens the door to fraud and that it
will only speed up the day of financial reckoning for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Both critics and supporters agree the tax credit is only a
downpayment toward providing more comprehensive support for the
nation's elderly infirm and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction, but clearly there's a long
way to go,'' said Judy Turner, executive director of the Miami
Valley chapter of the Alzheimer's Association.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas McGarry, executive director of the Area Agency on Aging,
a local advocacy group for the elderly, said the proposal won't
have much of an economic impact on struggling caregivers. ``But
from an emotional standpoint, it's at least some recognition of the
valuable role that they play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the Clinton plan ``puts the discussion of
long-term care back on the table again. It gives us an opening to
talk about larger issues,'' said Judy Riggs, director of public
policy for the Alzheimer's Association in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues include the so-called ``spend-down'' requirement
for Medicaid, which forces patients to exhaust their life savings
before they can qualify for assistance, as well as Medicaid's
built-in bias for institutionalizing the infirm rather than helping
keep them at home.
</P>
<P>
   The caregivers themselves say the $1,000 annual tax credit is
welcome relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Renate Lilly, who quit her job two years
ago so she could stay home and care for both her elderly parents.
Her parents' uninsured prescription costs alone come to nearly $800
a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you require outside help, and we do, the financial burden
just becomes overwhelming,'' Lilly said. She and her husband Tom
spend $1,200 to $1,400 a month to bring in a paid caregiver three
times a week, five hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Prather said he pays to put his wife into a day care program.
``I need the time to get the housework done, and she needs the
structured activity,'' he said. ``She doesn't have anything to do
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bennett of Kettering, a single mother who stays home to
care for a 6-year-old son suffering from a rare muscle disorder,
said the Clinton tax credit should extend to caregivers of disabled
children, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of disabled kids in this country are being raised
by single mothers and mothers who are working, and none of us are
millionaires,'' she said. ``Any break the government can give us
would be appreciated, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one piece of the Clinton plan _ $125 million in funding
for adult day care and respite programs to help family caregivers _
will be considered this summer in the Senate's Subcommittee on
Aging as part of the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act.
That subcommittee is headed by U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   Charles Boesel, a spokesman for DeWine, said DeWine favors
updating the Older Americans Act ``to make it easier for families
to care for the elderly and disabled, although it may not be
identical to what the administration wants.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Is President Clinton leading or following on
Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   The question came into sharp focus in the Rose Garden this week
as Clinton and Javier Solana of Spain, NATO's secretary-general,
met reporters at the opening of the alliance's elaborate 50th
birthday celebration in Washington this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked about the possible use of American ground
troops in the Balkans, a decision that could prove the most
momentous of his presidency. Was he willing to take a look at
options for land combat in Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   His reply was jarring to an audience accustomed to American
leadership in NATO, an alliance to which the United States has
devoted hundreds of billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands
of troops since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to your first question is: I support the
secretary-general's decision to update the assessment,'' Clinton
said. ``I think it is a wise and prudent course.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say that he had pushed NATO military authorities to
begin the preparations for a ground war, should it be needed. He
did not say that Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, should
be under no illusion about NATO's willingness to employ all
available means to drive his troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the president said that Solana, not he, had made a
decision to study the possible use of ground forces, and that he
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has perfected the art of exquisite followership in many
of his domestic initiatives, accurately reading public opinion and
then offering policy solutions _ like school uniforms or a balanced
budget _ that precisely mirror the public mood.
</P>
<P>
   But it is surprising to hear this approach applied to matters of
war and peace. Clinton has bucked public opinion in foreign policy
issues earlier in his presidency _ on Haiti and on Bosnia, for
example. But on Kosovo, Clinton seems content to lag behind the
more hawkish sentiments of Solana, Prime Minister Tony Blair of
England, even his own secretary of state, Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides deny that he has suddenly reverted to the
dovishness of his anti-war youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't read more into this than meets the eye,'' said Joe
Lockhart, the White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart and others do not object to portrayals of Clinton
as a reluctant hawk, parsimonious with American blood and eager for
a quick and peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis on NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicate that the public is growing uneasy about
how the war is being conducted in the Balkans. The conflict has
brought Clinton's job-approval ratings down to their lowest point
since June 1997, long before the Monica Lewinsky revelations that
led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of Americans polled approve of airstrikes
against the Yugoslav regime, but a growing number believe that the
conflict will be concluded only after ground troops are employed, a
more aggressive stance than that so far adopted by the president.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported in a new poll from the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo has the potential of bringing the president's poll
ratings down,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew center.
``There's no reason for panic at the White House yet, but Kosovo
could change the public's evaluation of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approval rating fell from 62 percent in March to 56
percent in April, dragged down by falling confidence in his
handling of foreign policy. Only 51 percent of respondents approved
of his conduct of foreign affairs, against 39 percent who
disapproved. That represented a marked turnabout from last
September, when the public, 61 percent to 30 percent, approved of
his stewardship of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials denied that Clinton's handling of the
Kosovo crisis was affected by public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anyone sitting around worrying about the
president's personal ratings,'' Lockhart said. ``We are focused on
a difficult campaign that with persistence and determination will
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If there are people worrying about it, I'm not in
the right meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   But a presidential adviser who did not want his name revealed
said that Clinton was concerned about how the public perceived his
handling of the war and was taking pains not to appear too eager to
commit American youth to battle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president clearly shifted his position this week on the need
to consider the use of ground troops to end the conflict in
Yugoslavia. For a month, Clinton insisted that it was not even
necessary to update planning for land combat, but he has now
conceded that the time has come to dust off last year's war plans.
To disguise his shift and to signal his unease about a ground war,
Clinton allowed NATO officials and the more openly belligerent
British to announce the new policy, the presidential adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   A president seldom walks into the Rose Garden and announces he
has reversed himself, this adviser said. The allies gave Clinton
cover to change his mind on ground troops this week, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Clinton may not appear fully engaged in
Kosovo and the NATO summit this week because he is deeply concerned
about the mass killings at the high school in Littleton, Colo., and
is trying to maintain some momentum on his domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's juggling a little bit,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton revealed a bit of his state of mind at T.C. Williams
High School in Alexandria, Va., where he went late this week to
talk to students about guns, violence and rage. He said that even
mature people have trouble managing their anger because they have
not found a vocabulary for handling it.
</P>
<P>
   And he complained that he had tried since his first year in
office to pass strong gun control legislation, but had been stymied
by conservative opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to keep people alive,'' he lamented.

NATO LEADERS REMAIN STAUNCH ON DEMANDS TO MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA AND ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under extraordinarily heavy security, leaders of
the 19 NATO nations Friday convened their 50th-anniversary summit
with a get-tough message for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic:
Agree to all NATO demands or face ever more intense bombing of
``central nervous system'' targets such as Serb TV.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic can expect more attacks like the ones that devastated
Serb TV on Thursday night and earlier smashed the ruling party
headquarters in Belgrade and one of Milosevic's residences. The
raid on Serb TV, which killed 10 people according to officials in
Belgrade, drew criticism from western media groups as well as from
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said NATO's current strategy is to
``strike directly at the central nervous system of Milosevic's
regime.'' He justified Serb TV as a legitimate target _ part of
Milosevic's ``propaganda machine,'' which ``bears as much
responsibility, if not more, than the Serb forces themselves for
the chaos and mayhem that we have witnessed in Yugoslavia since
1991.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments on the 31st day of the conflict Friday:
</P>
<P>
   _ The European Union imposed an oil embargo on Yugoslavia to
prevent Milosevic from importing gasoline and other fuel now that
his refineries have been heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO leaders discussed the issue of deploying ground troops
during a closed-door session, and according to a senior US official
the point was made that ``the public had a right to know that we're
looking at every option.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon said it will send 2,000 more troops to the
Balkans. Defense Secretary William Cohen approved the new
deployments in conjunction with the arrival of 24 U.S. Apache
attack helicopters. The ground-based forces will help protect the
Apaches while they are on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Geneva, the UN Commission on Human Rights denounced ``war
crimes'' by Serb forces in Kosovo. Harold Hongju Koh, a US
assistant secretary of state, accused Milosevic of having
``meticulously planned'' atrocities in Kosovo. Only Russia voted
against the resolution. NATO leaders Friday said they would seek a
UN Security Council resolution requiring the pullout of hostile
forces from Yugoslavia and the return of refugees under
international military supervision.
</P>
<P>
   _ While NATO leaders dismissed a peace overture from Milosevic
that was carried out of Yugoslavia by Russian envoy Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, officials acknowledged that it did show small
movement on Milosevic's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that over the next few days we'll have more contact
and we'll get more detail,'' said Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger, the
White House national security adviser. ``I'm not sure that the
Russians are asserting that this is a sufficient basis on which
this can end. It certainly doesn't look like that from our
perspective. But we encourage them to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, said NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO
will continue to operate from the air, where it enjoys
``mid-to-high altitude air superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic has shown a willingness to accept a high
level of damage,'' Clark said. But his forces are increasingly
``vulnerable to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark and a series of American, British, and allied officials
hammered home the same message throughout the day as NATO tried to
carry out two very different types of events _ managing a war and
conducting a celebratory weekend to mark its 50th anniversary. It
was essential, they said, that Milosevic meet all of NATO's
demands, which would mean he would pull all his forces out of
Kosovo and allow an international military force to police the
return of Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary general, Javier Solana, said once NATO
accomplished those aims it would implement a ``long-term strategy''
to stabilize southeastern Europe in cooperation with the European
Union and other governments.
</P>
<P>
   Solana pledged economic and security aid to Albania and
Macedonia, in particular. Sunday leaders of the seven countries
that are on the front-line of the Balkan conflict _ Bosnia,
Croatia, Albania, Macedonia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria _ will
meet with NATO leaders. Solana said the seven ``will be at this
point closer partners to the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Friday looked more like a ghost town than the
glittering site of the most powerful gathering of world leaders
since the funeral of President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents heeded the dire warnings of traffic gridlock and
stayed away from downtown. Some 90,000 federal workers and all
District of Columbia employees had been given a paid day off, and
public schools in Washington were closed as well.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear from the nearly deserted streets and empty
restaurants and shops on what normally would have been a
dress-down, eat-out Friday, that it wasn't only government
bureaucrats who had taken leave of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had de-emphasized the social aspects of the summit in
light of NATO's serious Kosovo business, and if not for the
extraordinarily large and visible security force and the sirens of
speeding motorcades, the big meeting might have been missed
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations in Lafayette Park and on the Mall near the
Washington Monument were low key, too. During a noontime rally
across from the White House, about 100 Albanian-Americans, many
waving or wrapped in the red, double-eagle Albanian flag, chanted
``Bomb, NATO, bomb!'' and ``Send in the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilir Zherka, executive director of the National
Albanian-American Council, said his group supports the NATO air
campaign but fears Kosovo will be lost if the alliance doesn't also
launch a ground war and arm the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army soon.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mall, war protester Daniel Ellsberg, a prominent activist
against the Vietnam War in the the 1970s, told a small gathering
that NATO's bombing has made ``a human disaster into a
catastrophe.'' Instead of celebrating a success on its 50th
anniversary, NATO had created ``its own worst nightmare,'' Ellsberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Serbian-American leaders hope to rally between 5,000
and 10,000 anti-NATO demonstrators to protest the bombing of
Yugoslavia, which is killing civilians and destroying the
republic's infrastructure, said Zoran Hodjera, president of the St.
Luke Serbian Church congregation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hodjera denied demonstrators would attempt to disrupt the NATO
meetings, an assertion made Wednesday by a NATO spokesman in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of security personnel were on hand Friday to ensure there
would be no disruptions. Law enforcement officers from every
jurisdiction _ the Park and Metropolitan Police, the Secret
Service, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,
and the Army _ kept a watchful eye on Friday's rallies and streets
around the summit meetings.

ABRAMS STUNS TOP PAC-10 SEED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   OJAI, Calif. _ Geoff Abrams finally got the coveted invitation.
The question now is, when will he leave the party?
</P>
<P>
   By the looks of things, not anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, a Stanford junior by way of Newport Harbor High, stunned
top-seeded Robert Kendrick of Washington on Friday 6-1, 6-4 to move
into the semifinals of the Pacific-10 men's singles championship at
the 99th annual Ojai Valley Tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament was delayed twice Friday afternoon because of
rain. The first interruption came just before noon _ poor timing
for USC's Ditta Huber, who was up three match points in a
quarterfinal against Stanford's Gabriela Lastra. It took Huber
three minutes after the delay to close out the match 6-4, 6-2,
about 15 minutes before rain halted play again at 3:10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've experienced rain delays before but never at such a key
moment,'' said Huber, who is playing in her first Pac-10 singles
championship. Huber faces Teryn Ashley from Stanford in a semifinal
today at 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford has two men (Abrams and Ryan Wolters) and two women
(Ashley, along with Marissa Irvin of Harvard-Westlake) in the
semifinals, setting up a potential all-Cardinal final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, who is making his first appearance in the Pac-10 singles
tournament, will face Gustavo Marcaccio of Arizona State today at
11 a.m. Marcaccio defeated USC's Patrick Gottesleben 6-3, 6-3
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the other semifinal, Wolters faces Arizona State's Jeff
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams has played at the Ojai since he was a junior and has
competed in the Pac-10 invitational the past two years. But this
year he finally earned his way into the Pac-10 men's tournament,
the most coveted draw of the Ojai.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to make the most of an opportunity like this,''
Abrams said. ``I've always wondered about playing in (the Pac-10
tournament) at Libbey Park in front of the big crowds. Over the
years I've always been at South Libbey, so this is really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams' fast start, a consistent serve-and-volley game and
cutting down on mistakes were crucial to defeating Kendrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big. I didn't give him any free points and that
helped,'' said Abrams. ``I didn't really do anything special. I
just played my game and played consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pac-10 women's singles, Stanford's Irvin advanced to the
semifinals with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Arizona State's Allison
Bradshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was the ITA Player of the Month in February while winning
the Rolex National Indoor title, but had lost five of her past
seven matches in dual match play, slipping to third in the ITA
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back to Ojai, where she won the 14-under junior
championship in 1994 and the 16-under title in 1995, seems to have
straightened out her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long season and it's tough to maintain (a high level)
of play sometimes,'' Irvin said. ``Even the pros go through a
mini-slump from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team won the Pac-10 team championship and that was great,
but this is an individual tournament so it's really easy to get up
for. Plus I love coming to Ojai, I've been playing it since I was a
little kid.''

BOMBING ALONE WON'T BREAK SERBS, MCNAMARA TELLS STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. Robert McNamara, the earnest technocrat whose
management of the Vietnam War incensed half a generation of
Americans in the '60s, and whose mea culpas alienated the other
half in the '90s, was again trying to make that war mean something
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This century will go down as the bloodiest in history. What
should we do today to prevent the carnage?'' the former Secretary
of Defense asked a group of Brown University students born years
after the last American soldier left Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the gathering, held with international relations
students studying the war, was to launch a new book by McNamara and
several other authors called ``Argument Without End: In Search of
Answers to the Vietnam Tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on discussions between civilian and military officials
from both sides of the war between 1995 and 1998, after months of
tense negotiations with Vietnamese authorities, the book argues
that the conflict was marked by missed opportunities on both sides,
that each side failed utterly to understand the other, and that it
could have been ended, or scaled down a decade before its official
end.
</P>
<P>
   That came as no surprise to McNamara's critics _ including the
son of one of the most important figures of the Vietnam era, former
Pentagon official Daniel Ellsberg, whose leaking of the so-called
``Pentagon Papers'' unleashed a torrent of criticism of McNamara
and the war.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the official topic of Friday's discussion was the
conflict that defined a previous generation, two other themes hung
over the proceedings like low clouds: the current crisis in the
Balkans, which to some observers is eerily similar to the beginning
of the Vietnam war, with the potential to lead America into a
similar quagmire. Also in the air was a sense of McNamara's own
failings as both war strategist and apologist.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara said the new book, begun long before Slobodan Milosevic
set his sights on ethnic Albanians, has plenty to teach Americans
about Kosovo. Vietnam proved that bombing campaigns alone have
rarely been successful at breaking the will of the enemy, McNamara
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a Congressman called him Friday to ask his advice about
voting on military action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For God's sake,'' he said he told the Congressman, ``Don't
vote on any alternative till you've examined (others), don't vote
till you have it all in writing. That's what we didn't do. That's
why we made mistakes in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times op-ed piece last week, he called for ``a
Pentagon Papers-like project ...so that historians will have the
adequate raw material to identify the missed opportunities on the
road to the Balkans War.''
</P>
<P>
   But while McNamara urged an open discussion on the Kosovo
conflict, he declined to become part of it. When pressed, he
refused to be more specific about what those missed opportunities
had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong for an ex-Secretary of Defense to focus on
the mistakes,'' he said. ``I don't want to advise the US president
on how to win a war publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   The McNamara who appeared at Brown Friday seemed very much like
the former Ford motor company chief who advised Presidents John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam between 1961 and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He was dressed neatly, as ever, in gray suit and starched white
shirt, his hair combed back, his shoulders slightly hunched, his
large hands slicing arcs through the air to explain strategy, or
slamming the table to underline a message when that gravelly voice
wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   But this McNamara was different from the '60s incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1995 memoir, ``In Retrospect'' he finally conceded that
he and other war officials had made decisions that were ``wrong,
terribly wrong,'' during the war.
</P>
<P>
   That brought a visceral reaction barely seen at any time since
the war's turbulent years.
</P>
<P>
   For those who had opposed the war, McNamara's apologies had come
too late. For those who had fought in Veitnam and believed the
rhetoric with which he and the presidents he served had justified
their actions, the memoir was considered a betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   But McNamara, 82 now, is still a forceful man. He dominated
discussion at a breakfast to break the ice with the students, and
at a class on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have another damn book on Vietnam?'' he asked at the
breakfast, one arm slung over the back of his chair. So that we can
learn from our mistakes there, was his own answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who found this book interesting?'' he asked the students, as a
way of opening the class, which was being televised by C-Span. All
of the students, taught by one of McNamara's co-authors, raised
their hands. ``Now who thinks Americans will find it interesting?''
he shot at them. To which all hands were raised again.
</P>
<P>
   The students were all respectful of McNamara, barely speaking
during the breakfast, wrapping their questions in praises for the
book during the class discussion, eagerly posing for a group shot
with him afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Such reverence has been rare for McNamara since he stepped down
as Secretary of State in 1968 (``To this day, I don't know if I
quit or I was fired,'' he said Friday). The consensus, one student
said, was that McNamara had come out and admitted his mistakes, and
that in any case, her generation was sufficiently removed from the
period to see it more objectively than their parents.
</P>
<P>
   That was not true for one participant however.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ellsberg, son of Daniel Ellsberg, wanted McNamara to
answer a question many have asked before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given your interest in missed opportunities,'' said
Ellsberg,``I'm curious why you didn't explore one opportunity.
Right before you left the defense department. . .had you told
Congress what you revealed 27 years later, and spoken frankly. . .
it seems like the next seven years of the war could have been
avoided. That's a missed opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   To which McNamara gave a reply he has given several times: he
had previously testified that bombing the Vietnamese had not been
effective, and Senator Strom Thrumond had called him ``a Communist
appeaser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The record was clear as to my views, but it's important to
recognize that I was in a minority,'' McNamara said. Still, few of
his critics forgive McNamara for remaining loyal to Johnson, and
going quietly to head the World Bank in 1968 instead of speaking
out publicly against the war.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ellsberg, 21, was chagrined by that response.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously didn't tell the public what he knew, otherwise
`In Retrospect' wouldn't have been news,'' he said later. ``Why
didn't he decide to do what my dad did? My dad is very frustrated
that he didn't do it earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Ellsberg, who is writing his own memoir, praises
McNamara for coming clean now, but is disturbed that McNamara has
rebuffed his many attempts to meet with him after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because he has to tell himself it was unthinkable
to do what I did, disloyal to him and to his president to go
against the will of the executive branch to tell the truth,'' said
Daniel Ellsberg in an interview Friday. ``If he thought otherwise,
he would have to face the fact that he didn't consider doing that
and he'd have to take responsibility for the deaths of Americans
and Vietnamese.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO marked its 50th anniversary Friday with
minimal retrospective self-congratulation, focusing soberly instead
on the critical challenge it faces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the flags of all 19 members of the alliance, in
the same gilded hall where the NATO treaty was signed on April 4,
1949, President Clinton said the alliance was engaged in the
Balkans because it ``will not have meaning in the 21st century if
it permits the slaughter of innocents on its doorstep.'' He pledged
that ``when we fight, we fight to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, the NATO secretary general, described the
creation of the organization as ``a visionary project'' that had
not only espoused the values of freedom and democracy but also
acted upon them. Fifty years later, he said, ``the founding fathers
of this alliance would be proud of what we have done and what we
are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of state or government from each member nation made a
brief speech before walking to a podium to sign the Washington
Declaration, a statement of NATO's vision for the next century. It
said more about aims than means, asserting that the alliance would
have to confront terrorism and weapons of mass destruction while
continuing to provide for collective defense.
</P>
<P>
   A band played martial airs, but the mood was subdued, almost
flat, a little like a family reunion marred by the illness of a
much-loved relative. Despite assurances from allied military
leaders that ``we are winning'' in Kosovo, none of the presidents
or prime ministers could be sure when or how the conflict would end
and whether the Kosovo Albanians could reclaim their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the funeral of John F. Kennedy in 1963 have so many
leaders from so many countries assembled in Washington. In addition
to senior officials of NATO itself and its member nations, leaders
of more than 20 nations that have established partnerships with
NATO came to the capital. Only Russia and Belarus stayed away, to
protest the bombing of Serbia, their Slavic cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The city's streets were swept almost clear of traffic as
workers, fearful of security-induced snarls, stayed home or took
the subway. Helicopters and snipers augmented the usual security
forces around the Mellon Auditorium on Constitution Avenue _ a
magnificent space, six stories high, with enormous stone columns
along both sides. Known as the Departmental Auditorium in 1949, it
was renamed in 1995 to honor Andrew Mellon, the industrialist and
art collector who served as secretary of the treasury from 1921 to
1932.
</P>
<P>
   A swirl of activities filled the leaders' day. They began with a
three-hour meeting on Kosovo, a council of war at the outset of a
summit meeting celebrating NATO's keeping of the peace. They moved
on to the commemoration, then to Capitol Hill for a congressional
ceremony and finally to the White House for a dinner in the
glittering East Room. The male guests wore business suits, not
dinner jackets, lest anyone should use the word ``gala,'' which was
deemed inappropriate while allied pilots were at risk over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, things were going badly for the allies. Britain was
just ending rationing of clothing. Mao was winning in China. The
Communists were on the march in Europe, too, seizing power in
Czechoslovakia, threatening Italy and blockading Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   But at the NATO signing ceremony, President Harry Truman
remained resolute. He said this: ``For us, war is not inevitable.
We do not believe that there are blind tides of history which sweep
men one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, as Clinton recalled, William Faulkner, the great
American novelist, acknowledged the fear of nuclear annihilation
that then gripped much of the world. But he declared in his Nobel
Prize acceptance speech that ``humanity will not merely endure, it
will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Having broken ``the grip of the Cold War,'' Clinton said, NATO
is now confronted with ``the awful specter of ethnic cleansing in
southeast Europe.'' But he sounded as determined as his Democratic
predecessor half a century ago, promising that ``the last European
dictatorship of the 20th century'' _ that of President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia _ ``will not destroy Europe's long-awaited
chance to live at last together in peace and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the leaders of the three newest NATO members _ Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic _ who sounded fiercest in their
commitment to NATO. Once part of the Soviet bloc that NATO came
into being to resist, they were formally admitted to membership at
a ceremony in Independence, Mo., last month.
</P>
<P>
   President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic, a distinguished
playwright, said he spoke as a Czech, a European and ``an
inhabitant of this planet'' when he declared that ``peace among the
peoples'' could ``hardly be attained without the readiness to
defend it against the forces of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO membership marked the end of 300 years of war, partition
and misfortune for Poland, its President, Aleksander Kwasniewski,
remarked in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``In the name of liberty, the very best of our people
went under fire, onto scaffolds, or were forced into exile,
generation after generation. Today this tragic tradition is but a
memento for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   President Jose Maria Aznar of Spain remarked that ``rarely does
an alliance celebrate its 50th anniversary.'' NATO had lasted
because it stayed unified, he said, and he and others emphasized
that it remained unified on Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Offstage, however, there were signs of tension between the
hawkish northern Europeans, especially Britain and France, and the
Mediterranean nations.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who noted that his father
had fought in World War II, sounded a note of inflexibility,
telling his colleagues: ``We cannot, and we will not, stand by and
let this hideous policy of ethnic cleansing succeed. Defeating it
and reversing it is the best anniversary memorial NATO could
have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greek Prime Minister Costas Smitis warned in an informal
comment Friday morning that prolonged bombing of Yugoslavia could
turn his country against NATO and the United States. The longer the
war, he added, ``the more difficult the problems will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini called NATO's bombing of
Serbian state television ``a terrible act.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, one of NATO's longtime champions, Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., advocated keeping the door open for further
expansion, an idea not all the members accept, and called for
``rough parity'' between U.S. and European forces in future NATO
enterprises _ another controversial proposition.

THE GRAND STRATEGY: ROUND AND ROUND ON AMERICAN INTERESTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ill., Mass.)   (rk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American involvement in Kosovo has started the most furious
debate since the end of the Cold War over what constitutes U.S.
strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Persian Gulf War in 1991 have foreign policy
analysts filled the nation's airwaves, newspapers and policy
journals with such passion. ``The Kosovo crisis has sharpened and
intensified what was a largely theoretical debate within think
tanks and seminar rooms,'' said John J. Mearsheimer, a professor of
political science at the University of Chicago. ``The $64,000
question is what areas of the world and causes are worth Americans
fighting and dying for?''
</P>
<P>
   Experts call it ``grand strategy.'' During the Cold War,
containment was the grand strategy; American policy was based on
fighting any expansion of Communism. Yet almost a decade after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, there is still no consensus over how
this new world should be structured and what role the United States
should play in it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovo crisis does nothing else, Mearsheimer and others
agree, its resolution will affect whose ideas about U.S. national
interests will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Kupchan, an associate professor at Georgetown
University, says the United States has essentially been ``running
on the fumes of Cold War thinking for nearly a decade, tinkering
and making adjustments in policies left over from that era.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet before strategists could figure out what should take the
place of containment, they first had to agree on what the post-Cold
War world was shaping up to look like.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Fukuyama first gained attention by declaring we had
reached the ``end of history.'' The American victory over Communism
would usher in an era of peaceful competition among existing and
aspiring democracies, he triumphally predicted. Events quickly
overtook his theory, however, prompting Fukuyama to backtrack on
his unbridled optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Samuel Huntington of Harvard University argued that
conflict was inevitable. The next century's fault lines would be
along ``civilizational'' or ethnic and cultural divides, pitting,
say, Christian Europe against the Muslim Middle East or the
Confucian East. Although Huntington says the Balkans illustrates
his thesis, others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Kosovo shows,'' Mearsheimer says, ``the world is not
divided into civilizations. In Kosovo the Christian West is
battling Orthodox Christian Serbs on behalf of Muslim Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the ``globalizationists'' or ``mercantilists'' came along,
people like Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale School of
Management, who argued that national sovereignty is inevitably _
and happily _ eroded by global economic forces. Ideology is dead.
Long live free markets.
</P>
<P>
   Such grand visions of the world are a starting point, but as
Kupchan explains, ``they do not give much direction to American
grand strategy or foreign policy.'' It took the crisis in Kosovo to
smoke out the new competing foreign policy camps, which can roughly
be divided into three groups.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the spectrum are the ``Fortress America''
advocates. Think of Pat Buchanan, the television pundit and repeat
presidential candidate, who basically says the United States should
not get caught up in other countries' messes, whether they're
military, economic or political.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, who worked in President George Bush's
National Security Council, says the Fortress America contingent has
the advantage of being straightforward, relatively consistent and
minimalist. ``Neo-isolationists believe that the purpose of foreign
policy is to have as little of it as possible,'' he explained.
While tragic, this camp argues, the brutal effort to drive Albanian
Muslims from Kosovo is not an American problem.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end are the ``interventionists'' or
``hegemonists.'' Philip D. Zelikow, director of the Miller Center
of Public Affairs in Charlottesville, Va., and another Bush
administration veteran, however, prefers to call this camp
``expansive idealists.'' They can be either liberal or
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The interventionists have found common intellectual ground in
the idea that the United States is the only superpower left
standing and simply cannot avoid getting involved. The United
States has an obligation to do whatever it takes to create a world
where it dominates, the thinking goes. In this view, the United
States has a ``window of opportunity to shape the world in its
image,'' Fareed Zakaria, the managing editor of Foreign Affairs
magazine and a skeptic of this approach, explains.
</P>
<P>
   Interventionists on the right include Robert Kagan and William
Kristol, whose prescription for victory in the Balkan war in a
recent issue of The Weekly Standard is to ``liberate Kosovo and
drive Milosevic from power,'' using ground forces and whatever else
to ``win it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Defeat or even the perception of defeat must be avoided at all
costs. ``At stake is the single overriding question of our time,''
they write. ``Will the United States and its allies have the will
to shape the world in conformance with our interests and our
principles? Or will we allow much of the world to slip into chaos
and brutality, to be shaped by men like Milosevic and Saddam
Hussein ... and the dictators in Beijing?''
</P>
<P>
   A similar definition of national interest in the Kosovo conflict
comes from liberal or ``humanitarian interventionists,'' who argue
that preventing and stopping genocide, ``ethnic cleansing'' and
other gross violations of human rights are in the strategic
interests of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humanitarian intervention is a more important challenge than
our interventions in Korea or Iraq,'' argues Leslie Gelb, president
of the Council on Foreign Relations, ``in that it goes to the very
heart of who we are and what we think our role in the world is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's foreign policy is liberal interventionist,
many analysts on the right and left agree. He has also been intent
on obtaining cooperation and consent for American policy from the
allies. ``This administration is very Bolshevik in its use of
force,'' said Mearsheimer, in an unusual choice of words. ``Air
power is their favorite tool and they haven't been reluctant to use
it. They've bombed four separate countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Kupchan, a more liberal analyst, concurs: ``The administration
has been incredibly lucky in its interventionism until now. There
have been American troops everywhere, but except for Somalia, no
Americans have died. Clearly that can't last.'' He and other
experts say that Kosovo, particularly the decision on whether to
send in NATO ground forces, will test liberal interventionism.
``Until now,'' says Kupchan, ``we've had liberal interventionism on
the cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, like Charles Krauthammer, a conservative
columnist, say liberal interventionism will fail the test. In a
recent essay in The New Republic, he denounced President Clinton's
foreign policy as ``hopelessly utopian.''
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping or mending civil wars is not the job for a
superpower, he writes. ``It is a job for Canada.'' Forget about
multilateral agreements and consensus. A superpower should concern
itself with ``real'' threats, like the aggressive conduct of North
Korea, and not worry about what other nations think. In an
interview he called liberal interventionism ``dangerously ill
conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Krauthammer calls himself a realist; it is a label that the
majority of foreign policy experts in this third camp are probably
most fond of using (although Mearsheimer prefers to say that his
group favors ``offshore balancing,'' intervening to prevent the
emergence of potential competitors). ``Most realists are offshore
balancers,'' Mearsheimer says. ``And most of us do not see any such
threat emerging as a result of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Haass, whose book, ``Reluctant Sheriff,'' reflects and promotes
``realist'' foreign policy thinking, argues that the American role
is the ``regulation of great power relations,'' that is, to work
out ``rules of the road with other major power centers.'' Building
alliances that promote free trade, discourage the use of force and
limit the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction all advance
American strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kosovo, Haass and other realists tend to be cautious. And
they often disagree over whether strategic national interests are
at stake. Do American interests justify ``such a commitment in
blood and treasure''? he recently wrote. The United States must
``balance humane impulses with strategic imperatives.'' Liberating
all of Kosovo with military force ``is not worth the costs it would
entail.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet as Kosovo illustrates, defining an American grand strategy
or the country's national interest is not necessarily
straightforward even if one has a clear notion of how the world
should be organized. Regardless of whether Kosovo is worth fighting
for, by getting involved, the United States has created a strategic
interest there even if one didn't exist before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once America stakes its credibility on an issue, it
automatically becomes strategic,'' Zakaria says. Even those
``realists'' who disapproved of American involvement in the war
against Yugoslavia concede that having made the commitment, the
United States must pursue victory with all possible means,
including ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not all self-described realists agree. Henry
Kissinger, who presided over the Vietnam War, which cost 50,000
American lives, argues against ``the proliferation of open-ended
American commitments involving the deployment of U.S. forces.'' He
draws the line on sending American ground troops to Kosovo; the
Europeans should provide the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Until there is more of a consensus over how the United States
should respond in this changing world, it may be that the U.S.
grand strategy can best be described as muddling through.

   A New Paradox Of Corporate Spydom &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a conundrum worthy of an Ian Fleming novel: Corporate
spies are becoming more and less numerous (italics)at the same
time.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A survey of about 50 large corporations by Fuld &AMP; Co., a
consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass., found that 20 percent of
responding companies had shut down their corporate intelligence
departments, at a time when membership in a trade group, the
Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals, is reported to
be growing by 25 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Fuld found that corporate intelligence departments are often a
casualty of a management shake-up, wiped out after the lone top
executive who championed it leaves the company. Others fail
``because they do not establish plans or practical approaches to
delivering value to the company,'' Leonard M. Fuld, the firm's
founder, said in announcing the results.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, to square the findings of fewer spy shops but more
spies? No clear answer emerged in the survey results, but
suspense-novel fans will have no trouble dreaming up scenarios.
Maybe those companies only want us to (italics)think(end italics)
that they shut down their intelligence departments. ... &QL;

BOMBING ALONE WON'T BREAK SERBS, MCNAMARA TELLS STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. Robert McNamara, the earnest technocrat whose
management of the Vietnam War incensed half a generation of
Americans in the '60s, and whose mea culpas alienated the other
half in the '90s, was again trying to make that war mean something
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This century will go down as the bloodiest in history. What
should we do today to prevent the carnage?'' the former Secretary
of Defense asked a group of Brown University students born years
after the last American soldier left Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the gathering, held with international relations
students studying the war, was to launch a new book by McNamara and
several other authors called ``Argument Without End: In Search of
Answers to the Vietnam Tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on discussions between civilian and military officials
from both sides of the war between 1995 and 1998, after months of
tense negotiations with Vietnamese authorities, the book argues
that the conflict was marked by missed opportunities on both sides,
that each side failed utterly to understand the other, and that it
could have been ended, or scaled down a decade before its official
end.
</P>
<P>
   That came as no surprise to McNamara's critics _ including the
son of one of the most important figures of the Vietnam era, former
Pentagon official Daniel Ellsberg, whose leaking of the so-called
``Pentagon Papers'' unleashed a torrent of criticism of McNamara
and the war.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the official topic of Friday's discussion was the
conflict that defined a previous generation, two other themes hung
over the proceedings like low clouds: the current crisis in the
Balkans, which to some observers is eerily similar to the beginning
of the Vietnam war, with the potential to lead America into a
similar quagmire. Also in the air was a sense of McNamara's own
failings as both war strategist and apologist.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara said the new book, begun long before Slobodan Milosevic
set his sights on ethnic Albanians, has plenty to teach Americans
about Kosovo. Vietnam proved that bombing campaigns alone have
rarely been successful at breaking the will of the enemy, McNamara
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a Congressman called him Friday to ask his advice about
voting on military action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For God's sake,'' he said he told the Congressman, ``Don't
vote on any alternative till you've examined (others), don't vote
till you have it all in writing. That's what we didn't do. That's
why we made mistakes in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times op-ed piece last week, he called for ``a
Pentagon Papers-like project ...so that historians will have the
adequate raw material to identify the missed opportunities on the
road to the Balkans War.''
</P>
<P>
   But while McNamara urged an open discussion on the Kosovo
conflict, he declined to become part of it. When pressed, he
refused to be more specific about what those missed opportunities
had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong for an ex-Secretary of Defense to focus on
the mistakes,'' he said. ``I don't want to advise the US president
on how to win a war publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   The McNamara who appeared at Brown Friday seemed very much like
the former Ford motor company chief who advised Presidents John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam between 1961 and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He was dressed neatly, as ever, in gray suit and starched white
shirt, his hair combed back, his shoulders slightly hunched, his
large hands slicing arcs through the air to explain strategy, or
slamming the table to underline a message when that gravelly voice
wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   But this McNamara was different from the '60s incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1995 memoir, ``In Retrospect'' he finally conceded that
he and other war officials had made decisions that were ``wrong,
terribly wrong,'' during the war.
</P>
<P>
   That brought a visceral reaction barely seen at any time since
the war's turbulent years.
</P>
<P>
   For those who had opposed the war, McNamara's apologies had come
too late. For those who had fought in Veitnam and believed the
rhetoric with which he and the presidents he served had justified
their actions, the memoir was considered a betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   But McNamara, 82 now, is still a forceful man. He dominated
discussion at a breakfast to break the ice with the students, and
at a class on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have another damn book on Vietnam?'' he asked at the
breakfast, one arm slung over the back of his chair. So that we can
learn from our mistakes there, was his own answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who found this book interesting?'' he asked the students, as a
way of opening the class, which was being televised by C-Span. All
of the students, taught by one of McNamara's co-authors, raised
their hands. ``Now who thinks Americans will find it interesting?''
he shot at them. To which all hands were raised again.
</P>
<P>
   The students were all respectful of McNamara, barely speaking
during the breakfast, wrapping their questions in praises for the
book during the class discussion, eagerly posing for a group shot
with him afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Such reverence has been rare for McNamara since he stepped down
as Secretary of State in 1968 (``To this day, I don't know if I
quit or I was fired,'' he said Friday). The consensus, one student
said, was that McNamara had come out and admitted his mistakes, and
that in any case, her generation was sufficiently removed from the
period to see it more objectively than their parents.
</P>
<P>
   That was not true for one participant however.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ellsberg, son of Daniel Ellsberg, wanted McNamara to
answer a question many have asked before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given your interest in missed opportunities,'' said
Ellsberg,``I'm curious why you didn't explore one opportunity.
Right before you left the defense department. . .had you told
Congress what you revealed 27 years later, and spoken frankly. . .
it seems like the next seven years of the war could have been
avoided. That's a missed opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   To which McNamara gave a reply he has given several times: he
had previously testified that bombing the Vietnamese had not been
effective, and Senator Strom Thrumond had called him ``a Communist
appeaser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The record was clear as to my views, but it's important to
recognize that I was in a minority,'' McNamara said. Still, few of
his critics forgive McNamara for remaining loyal to Johnson, and
going quietly to head the World Bank in 1968 instead of speaking
out publicly against the war.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ellsberg, 21, was chagrined by that response.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously didn't tell the public what he knew, otherwise
`In Retrospect' wouldn't have been news,'' he said later. ``Why
didn't he decide to do what my dad did? My dad is very frustrated
that he didn't do it earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Ellsberg, who is writing his own memoir, praises
McNamara for coming clean now, but is disturbed that McNamara has
rebuffed his many attempts to meet with him after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because he has to tell himself it was unthinkable
to do what I did, disloyal to him and to his president to go
against the will of the executive branch to tell the truth,'' said
Daniel Ellsberg in an interview Friday. ``If he thought otherwise,
he would have to face the fact that he didn't consider doing that
and he'd have to take responsibility for the deaths of Americans
and Vietnamese.''

 &HT;    TV sweeps `Noah' in, `Nanny' out of lineup
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1998-'99 television season is one month away from the
history books, but before it ends, the networks will indulge in a
little history themselves. Big, lavish movies about legends are on
tap for the May sweeps period Thursday through May 26:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  First up is ``Noah's Ark'' (May 2-3 on NBC) with Jon Voight as
Noah and Mary Steenburgen as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ABC is touting its four-hour ``Cleopatra'' May 23-24. Leonor
Varela (``The Man in the Iron Mask'') plays the Egyptian queen,
with Timothy Dalton as Julius Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rising teen star Leelee Sobieski (``Deep Impact'') stars as
``Joan of Arc'' for CBS May 16-18. The supporting cast includes
Peter O'Toole, Maximilian Schell and Jacqueline Bisset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleopatra'' and ``Noah's Ark'' are from Robert Halmi Sr., the
producer who recently won a Peabody Award for his spectacles such
as ``Gulliver's Travels'' and ``Merlin.''
</P>
<P>
   History of another sort will be recognized as four series have
big finale episodes, some with clips reprising their pasts. There's
no ``Seinfeld'' bidding adieu to generate national hysteria, but
those achieving closure (as opposed to just getting canceled like
most shows) are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Home Improvement'' (8 p.m. May 25). Tim Allen's family
stalwart gets a 90-minute sendoff on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Melrose Place'' (8 p.m. May 24). Once one of the hottest
shows on TV, now room temperature. Fox is keeping details under
wraps.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mad About You'' (8 p.m. May 24, NBC). It, too, has faded
from its peak, but still gets an hour, with Janeane Garofalo
somehow playing Paul and Jamie's baby daughter.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Nanny'' (8 p.m. May 19, CBS) wraps its six-year run with
Fran (Fran Drescher) preparing to give birth.
</P>
<P>
   During sweeps periods in February, May, July and November,
Nielsen measures the demographics (age, gender, etc.) of local TV
stations to set ad rates. The networks say they're sick of the
scheduling headaches but keep piling up the specials to please
their affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   ABC takes a cheaper route, though, in an unusual move,
double-airing three theatrical films: ``The Rock,'' with Nicolas
Cage; ``Phenomenon,'' with John Travolta; and ``Father of the Bride
II'' each get two prime time slots.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Robbie Knievel: Grand Canyon Jump Live!'' (8 p.m. Thursday
on Fox). Note the exclamation point, to make it more exciting!
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Double Platinum'' (9 p.m. May 16 on ABC) pairs Brandy and
Diana Ross in a drama about a singing mother and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Movie'' (9 p.m. May 22 on
CBS). After canceling the series and infuriating fans, CBS makes
nice with a one-shot reprise.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeps is not all mind candy, though. CNN kicks off its 10-part
``Celebrate the Century'' retrospective May 2, and PBS'
``Masterpiece Theatre'' does ``Great Expectations'' May 9-10.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy it while it lasts. Come May 27, the networks head off for
a rerun-loaded summer vacation.

 NELSON1STTAKE25-COX &HT;    Willie Nelson, a natural, a performer who connects with
heartland
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 25.
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHREVEPORT, La. _ Everybody doesn't like something, but nobody
doesn't like Willie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Not here. Not tonight. Not even with tornadoes ripping up the
northwest Louisiana countryside all day long. It's a Saturday night
in Shreveport, for God's sake, and for the first time in nearly 40
years, the Louisiana Hayride has reconvened at the newly renovated
Municipal Auditorium, with none other than Willie Nelson himself
headlining the all-star roster.
</P>
<P>
   Before the night is done, Willie will be leading the whole gang
in a gospel sing-along. Kenny Wayne Shepherd, the hometown blues
guitarist made good, ragin' Cajun Doug Kershaw, Hank Williams'
long-lost daughter, Jett, four stately gentlemen known as the
Everready Gospel Quartet, a whole slew of silver-haired fiddlers
and guitarists in their fresh-pressed suits, bolo ties and
suspenders, all singing ``I Saw the Light.''
</P>
<P>
   There'll be time later for the garish neon temptations of the
riverboat casinos that have sparked this depressed, historic border
town back to economic life. This is a reminder of what gave the
city life to start with, back before Nashville came to music
industry prominence, back when regional radio and independent
record labels and endless tours of little nowhere towns were the
key to a country music career. Back when the Hayride was its own
kind of Opry, back when Elvis and Williams got their start, right
up on that very stage. Back when singers like Nelson, 65, were
barely out of the box, too young, in those dark and early years,
even to be legends in their own minds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, Nelson's legend is such that he doesn't even
have to be in the building to cast a spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like Jesus,'' says Karen Jordan, a youthful ``just
say I'm over 40'' fan. ``I mean, it's funky.''
</P>
<P>
   She's standing in the lobby near a display of T-shirts bearing
Nelson's suspiciously Messianic likeness. Though she prefers
Shepherd, the evening's other big name, to anything remotely like
'90s country music, she digs Willie. Big time. ``Who doesn't like
him? He's just like America. How could you not like him?''
</P>
<P>
   Something for everyone
</P>
<P>
   Just like America. That's a juicy thought. Nelson, who performs
Friday (his 66th birthday) in a headlining slot at Music Midtown,
Atlanta's annual three-day music event, is sure enough emblem-atic.
The ponytailed
songwriter-turned-singer-turned-star-turned-actor-turned-icon is,
in so many ways, a little of something for everyone: a one-man
democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   Want your counterculture hero? There's Willie, an unrepentant
marijuana smoker, rolling up a fat one during a visit to the Carter
White House. Want your heartland populist? There's Willie,
organizing FarmAid and headlining those annual benefit concerts to
help the imperiled family farmer. Want your old-fashioned good
time? There's Willie, bandanna around his head, dressed in his
everlasting bluejeans, T-shirt and sneakers, leading his band
through a set of hits _ from the opening ``Whiskey River'' to the
send-off anthem, ``On the Road Again'' _ he's been playing 200
nights a year for as long as his tour bus has been rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Want your avant-garde Daddy-O? There's Willie, cutting
brilliantly austere records like ``Spirit'' and last year's
stunning ``Teatro'' that pare his art to an essence rare for a
performer who has nothing left to prove.
</P>
<P>
   But in that way, the native Texan is like some other pure
American geniuses, like the Louis Armstrongs and Frank Sinatras,
who, in doing it their way, embody and reflect all the good things
the republic can be. They can be popular and progressive, showman
and aesthete, wild card and poet, cowboy and Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Modernized country
</P>
<P>
   ``For so many reasons, he's a key transitional figure in country
music,'' says Paul Kingsbury, editor of the Country Music Hall of
Fame's ``Encyclopedia of Country Music,'' offering a semi-official
spin on Nelson's place in the cosmos. ``He's a songwriter who
excelled in the `Nashville Sound' era. He modernized country music
working with people like Waylon Jennings in the `outlaw' years. And
in the late '70s and early '80s he reached beyond the confines of
country music to find a broader audience with albums like
`Stardust.' And he's still creating great cutting-edge country
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all the respect Nelson gets from Nashville, he could
never make it there as a solo artist. This, the man who wrote
``Crazy'' for Patsy Cline, ``Hello Walls'' for Faron Young and
``Night Life'' for Ray Price. It wasn't until he left Music City,
not coincidentally after his house burned down, that he came into
his own in the mid-1970s. As Kingsbury notes, Nelson was too
original for his time. ``Willie had a unique way of phrasing,'' he
says. ``The rhythm he set up with his singing was offbeat for
country music and kind of jazzy. Also, he was not a matinee idol.
Country caught up with his style in the '70s, and Willie came into
his own as a handsome icon when he became scruffier in the '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing with the master
</P>
<P>
   After the show in Shreveport, Willie's fans cling to the
auditorium's backstage gate, shouting his name in hopes of
receiving a handshake or an autograph. He complies, then disappears
inside his tour bus, a countryfied Biosphere and a Mecca-on-wheels
for the singer's hard-core fan base.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie talks, he's relaxed, with an easy, generous laugh,
the laugh of a Zen master who can't remember his golf handicap, or,
at least, prefers to keep it one of life's profound mysteries. ``I
lie too much,'' he says. ``Whatever I told you would be wrong.'' So
he answers questions about some other aspects of his life and
career.
</P>
<P>
   Q:When did you begin writing songs?
</P>
<P>
   A:I started writing poems before I could play the guitar, and
after I learned a few chords, well, then I started putting melodies
to the poems. So that was when I was 5 years old. It was just kind
of all there. It always was. I always knew I could make a rhyme and
write songs. And I thought everybody could. It really took awhile
to get started as a songwriter because there's a whole lot of good
songwriters out there.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I'm really impressed with your latest albums, that you're
taking chances and experimenting with things at this point in your
career. ``Spirit,'' for instance, was so minimal . . .
</P>
<P>
   A:Barren, I believe . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q:Yeah, that's right. What motivates you?
</P>
<P>
   A:I just wanted to do it. I guess I don't really have any smart
reasons. Whenever I have enough songs to go into the studio to
record then I have to decide how I want to do it. I never have any
really preconceived ideas. I knew I wanted to do the ``Spirit''
album the way it was done, with very few instruments. With
``Teatro,'' I turned it over to (producer) Daniel Lanois, and let
him do whatever he wanted to do. I had a lot of songs that I gave
to him, like 100 songs of mine, new and old. He picked 20 and then
we went in and did 15.''

 &HT;    Grandstand '99 celebrates food and fitness
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Terri Evans of Atlanta isn't shy about cooking in
front of folks. ``But usually it's in my kitchen and I have a glass
of wine,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Evans will prepare her Banana Split Pie in front of many
more than can fit in her kitchen. She'll be on a stage at Turner
Field as part of Cooking Light magazine's Grandstand '99: A
Festival for the New Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It's a two-day expo of the latest culinary and fitness trends,
complete with cooking classes taught by chefs from Atlanta and
across the country; seminars on kitchen remodeling; and fitness
activities such as a dribbling clinic and swing dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is one of 10 national finalists in a recipe contest
sponsored by Healthy Choice. They'll compete throughout the event
in a cook-off to determine who will win $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to create recipes, but this is a lark. I've never
entered a contest before,'' said Evans, 45. ``I just thought,
`Wouldn't it be nice to win $10,000 doing something I love?'''
</P>
<P>
   The festival is a first of its kind for the magazine, though the
idea took root two years ago, when Cooking Light celebrated its
10th anniversary with a street festival in its hometown of
Birmingham. The event drew more than 15,000, including readers from
across the country, South America and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking Light has gone from a style of cooking to a style of
living,'' said editor Doug Crichton. ``Our readers tell us they
have more energy and fun when they eat right and exercise. We make
that enjoyable and accessible. And that seems to be the big
spark.''
</P>
<P>
   That big spark has made Cooking Light the No. 1 magazine for
food and fitness in the nation, with an estimated 6 million
readers.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine has branched out to offer special cruises for
readers, and Crichton said the Atlanta festival could be a model
for future festivals in other cities. The event will be from 9:30
a.m to 6 p.m. today and noon to 6 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $5.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: A calculating threesome spends time assessing
the pesky airborne grains that cause so much misery
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every morning by 5:10, Atlanta's pollen patrol peers through a
microscope at hundreds of pink circular blobs. Then they sort and
count: one pine, two pine, three pine; one oak, two oak; one ash;
one sweet gum.
</P>
<P>
   How those numbers add up will make or break the day for hundreds
of thousands of allergy sufferers in the Atlanta area. The numbers
represent how thick with tree, grass and weed pollen our local air
is.
</P>
<P>
   LaWanda Day, Marie McFalls and Pam Griggs are the pollen
counters for the Atlanta Asthma &AMP; Allergy Clinic, which posts the
information daily on its pollen hotline. While this is the only
official pollen collection site in metro Atlanta, the readings
represent pollen concentrations from Cartersville to Covington.
</P>
<P>
   The more blobs on the slender glass rod under the microscope,
the higher the pollen count. Each pink spot represents a particular
pollen from a tree, grass or weed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one that resembles Mickey Mouse ears is pine,'' Day
explained, peering into the 40-power microscope. ``We have to come
up with descriptions we can easily remember. Cedar is like a circle
with a star in the middle of it. Elm we think of as having a circle
within a circle.''
</P>
<P>
   When the pollen numbers soar to record levels, as they did this
month, the job becomes even more tedious for Day, McFalls and
Griggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems I spent five hours last Monday counting it, and I
started at 4:30 that morning,'' said McFalls. On that day, April
12, Atlanta set a new record: 6,013 grains of pollen per cubic
meter of air. It was the second-highest sneeze reading in the
country that day, behind Tulsa, Okla., with a count of 6,299.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, Atlanta's pollen level had fallen to 1,286, still
10 times the amount considered ``extremely high'': 120 or above.
And that spells misery for many of the estimated 700,000 metro
Atlantans with pollen allergies of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I was shocked at how high it was,'' said McFalls of the
record-breaking day. ``But I had been doing yardwork the previous
day, and you could feel the pollen on your skin. And the air was
hazy from the pollen.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta doctors say they've never seen so many patients cram
their waiting rooms hoping for relief from the tidal wave of
allergy symptoms. And residents swear there's never before been
such a thick yellow coat of pine trees' fertilizing dust on their
cars, patio furniture, windowsills and driveways. The yellow stuff
was even blamed for causing an 18-vehicle pileup on I-285 when it
mixed with rain and oil to form goo earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   When pollen counts climb into the thousands, people who usually
suffer mild symptoms experience the irritation of severe sufferers.
And for those who become miserable when the count hovers at 50 to
100, breathing becomes a chore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been unbelievable. I can't even breathe when I sleep,''
said Kay Bargamian of Snellville. ``I have to get up and walk
around and sit a while to clear my clogged nose. Sometimes I sleep
propped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bargamian keeps her windows closed, goes outside only for short
periods and seeks relief from prescription nasal spray. ``I stay
inside,'' she declared. ``That's the price we pay for living in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Many assume that because the city is in the midst of a
bulldozing frenzy, the pollen count should decline as trees are
chopped down. According to NASA satellite data analyzed by
University of Georgia researchers, metro Atlanta is losing 50 acres
of tree cover every day to make way for new roads, residential
subdivisions, shopping malls and office parks.
</P>
<P>
   But the area's burgeoning growth doesn't really affect the
pollen count all that much, said Dr. Bob Berkowitz, research
director for the Atlanta Asthma &AMP; Allergy Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know pollen travels hundreds of miles, from sailors being
affected while out on ships,'' he said. ``Even if we blacktopped
all of Georgia, we would still get Alabama pollen.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Marietta clinic, pollen is collected in a wooden box on a
second-story roof. Inside the box is a slender, inch-long glass
spindle nestled inside a narrow metal holder.
</P>
<P>
   One side of the tube is covered with silicone grease, to which
pollen particles stick. After the sample is collected every
morning, another tube is inserted and the box is put back into
place on the roof. To get an accurate reading, the collector must
spin for 30 seconds every 10 minutes, or 72 minutes out of every 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spinning time can be critical during peak season,''
McFalls said. ``It must be carefully timed for accurate sampling.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day and night of exposure to the air, the spindle is
covered with a dusty fuzz. To identify the pollen under a micro-
</P>
<P>
   scope, the glassware is streaked with a pink stain that picks up
the proteins of each distinct pollen grain. The count begins from
one end of the dle and ends at the other. After one-third of the
surface is counted, a mathematical formula tabulates the total
count.
</P>
<P>
   Then, promptly at 6 a.m. the magic number is called into 35
radio, television and newspapers. ``If we're even a few minutes
late, they call us, '' Day said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Allergy &AMP; Asthma Clinic has provided pollen counts
since 1987. It began as a way to satisfy the curiosity of allergy
doctors, then turned into a public service. On many spring and fall
days, area residents ruminate over it with as much angst as daily
lottery numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The counts are only taken in spring and fall when pollinating
trees, plants and weeds make life miserable for many area
residents. Many depend on allergy shots to lessen their symptoms.
The shot serum is prepared by extract technicians such as Day,
McFalls, and Griggs, who mix allergy potions when not tabulating
populating pollen. This year's count began early on March 1, and
will end in June. Weed counts start Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Come rain or shine, the pollen patrol must report before sunup.
The only time they missed a day in recent memory was last April 9
when a tornado set down in Cobb County. That day's reading was
chalked up to ``mechanical failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Wind-blown pollen is how trees spread their male seed but the
pollen counters say they don't think about their livelihood in
terms of nature, science or propagation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we don't joke about it or anything like that,'' Day said.
``We pretty much take it serious. Atlanta takes the pollen very,
very seriously. This is something that to many people is vital that
they know.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sneezing and sniffling this spring, Atlantans
seem to have only two concerns: Why's it so bad? And when will the
numbers go down and stay down? ``All of this relates to the large
amount of rainfall throughout 1998,'' said Berkowitz. ``The yearly
rainfall gave the trees the high energy of a teenager when
pollinating. With that energy, and with the unusually high
temperatures of this winter, everything pollinated at the same
time. That's why we had such a high pollen count.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the warm, dry weather pattern of this winter
tricked many trees into pollinating earlier than usual. The result?
Twenty tree types budding at once.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful. And miserable. The good news, the allergy experts
say, is that trees are nearing their end of their high season and
giving way to grasses that cause fewer allergic reactions. ``The
peak is over,'' declared McFalls who has 13 years' experience on
pollen patrol. ``The trees are leafing and turning green.''
</P>
<P>
   But for at least another couple weeks, the pink blotches will be
focus of the dawn ritual for McFalls, Day or Grimes: Squint through
the scope, recite and write down: One pine, two pine, three pine,
four. One oak, two oak, three oak, four. None of Atlanta's pollen
counters, by the way, have allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Said Day: ``I was blessed, I guess. ''

</P>
<P>
   TREE POLLEN
</P>
<P>
   (x 3600): Many tree pollens, such as oak (Quercus), tend to
pollinate from February through May, causing allergy problems for
people in the Northeast, Southeast, South-

</P>
<P>
   GRASS POLLEN (Poaceae, x 1600): Grasses make up about 20 percent
of the earth's vegeta-
</P>
<P>
   tional cover. There are more than 1,200 species native to North
America; they are the primary cause of allergies from May through
October.

   SHREVEPORT, La.: in and did 15.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Were you surprised by his choices?
</P>
<P>
   A:Some of them. I was surprised that he picked out ``I Can't Let
You Say Goodbye.'' You got to watch that guy.
</P>
<P>
   Q:There are a few pretty cold songs on there, but that one _
about a man who strangles his girlfriend _ is the coldest.
</P>
<P>
   A:(Laughs.) I tried to talk him out of it. Maybe there was some
personal reason he wanted it in there. He might have been sending a
message. (Laughs again.)
</P>
<P>
   Q:I think a lot of people, when they think of your music, would
say it was romantically inspiring, with a sweetness, a soulfulness.
And yet, there are songs like ``I Never Cared for You,'' ``I Just
Destroyed the World,'' that have a piercing, bitter or despairing
imagery. What sort of things motivate you to write those?
</P>
<P>
   A:Again, each one has its own origin. Maybe some of them have no
origin at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The ones that verge on catastrophe and tragedy?
</P>
<P>
   A:Darkness on the face of the world . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q:Those have such a wallop to them, yet you never overplay it.
You let the words hang in the air. What do you think of your voice?
Do you like it?
</P>
<P>
   A:Sometimes I do. Sometimes I can actually endure it. But I hear
me a whole lot. I know when I'm not doing it right and when I think
I am.
</P>
<P>
   Q:In your life, you've become a counterculture icon on the one
hand and then kind of, with FarmAid, very much someone that people
see as a populist figure. And then you're at the Kennedy Center
getting a medal pinned on you . . .
</P>
<P>
   A:I've got somebody fooled, don't I?'' (He laughs.)
</P>
<P>
   Q:That's pretty clever. But how do you really feel about it?
</P>
<P>
   A:Naturally, I eat it up. I love it. Don't quite understand it
all, but I don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I notice how, looking over your biography, that when your
house burned down, it was time to leave Nashville, and you had your
first great success as a solo artist. Then the Internel Revenue
Service comes in (seeking $16 million-plus in back taxes), and your
career takes another interesting turn. It seems like you weather
all the ups and downs pretty well. What guides you?
</P>
<P>
   A:(Laughs.) Fortunately, we're not in control. That's the only
thing we go by out here. We know that we're not running the show,
so it doesn't matter. The why, or nothing. Don't ask no questions,
that's where I think we're all coming from. Everything's working
too good to start asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   Follow him anywhere
</P>
<P>
   After Shreveport, Willie heads for New York and the taping of a
TNT television tribute to his pal Johnny Cash. He'll join Sheryl
Crow for a version of ``Jackson'' as the cameras roll. Life is
good.
</P>
<P>
   Or as one of Willie's fans, crammed backstage before his
entrance in Shreveport, puts it: ``He's the guy who'd been around
for so long and all of that time he'd been there, nobody paid any
attention to him, and all of a sudden this song hits and you follow
him forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The song that Claudia Mayence, a 40ish civil employee in
Shreveport, refers to is ``Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain.'' But she
could mean almost any Willie song, at almost any time, because his
songs are like that. Because he's like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is,'' she exclaims, proud in a cardigan whose red, white
and blue beads are sewn in the image of Texas, her native state,
``a natural man.''
</P>
<P>
   WILD ABOUT WILLIE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Born: April 30, 1933 in Abbott, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Family: Raised by his grandparents. Married to Ann-Marie
D'Angleo since 1991. They have two children; five other children
from three previous marriages.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Odd jobs: Worked in cotton fields until he was 10, then played
guitar in local German and Czech polka bands. Also sold Bibles and
encyclopedias door-to-door, worked as disc jockey and musician and
taught Sunday School.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Education: A stint in the Air Force; attended but did not
graduate from Baylor University.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  As a songwriter: Wrote ``Crazy'' for Patsy Cline, ``Hello
Walls'' for Faron Young, ``Night Life'' for Ray Price, ``Wake Me
When It's Over'' for Andy Williams and ``Pretty Paper'' for Roy
Orbison, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A few notable movie roles: ``The Electric Horseman'' (1979),
``Honeysuckle Rose'' (1980), ``Barbarosa'' (1982), ``Songwriter''
(1984) and ``Wag the Dog'' (1997). ``I need a horse or a guitar ...
or both is better,'' Nelson says. ``Everything else doesn't matter.
Whether's there's a plot or not. I never had to act. I wouldn't
take a role that I thought I had to act in. Slim Pickens, we did
'The Electric Horseman' together, and we got to be good buddies,
somebody asked him about my acting and he said: 'Well, he plays
Willie Nelson better than anyone I know.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Honors: Inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993.
Earned Kennedy Center Honor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Selected discography: Nelson's career is summed up by the
title of his 1974 album ``Phases and Stages.'' He's been through
enough of them for several average humans, from his earliest days
as a songwriter in the 1950s and '60s _ anthologized on ``Nite
Life: Greatest Hits and Rare Tracks'' (1990) _ to such latter-day
excursions as ``Spirit'' (1996) and ``Teatro'' (1998), in which
artful arrangements strip classic material down to the pure
gestural power of the singer's autumnal baritone. And, of course,
there's the ``outlaw'' years, which include collaborations with
Waylon Jennings and the mainstream success of ``Wanted: The
Outlaws'' (1976; with Jennings, Jessi Colter and Tompall Glaser).
</P>
<P>
   Nelson rather brilliantly followed the hangdog charisma of that
project with 1978's ``Stardust.'' The glowing standards collection,
produced by Booker T. Jones, was what really made the singer a pop
star _ and ``Georgia on My Mind'' a new signature tune. The output
gets a little sketchier after this, until a sustained resurgence
that began, ironically, when he recorded a 1991 album (''Who Will
Buy My Memories'') which was sold on TV to pay millions in back
taxes. If you can find them, though, a series of duet albums (with
such greats as Ray Price, Webb Pierce, Faron Young and Hank Snow)
light up Nelson's early '80s catalog. Other titles to look for
include: ``To Lefty From Willie'' (1977), ``Me and Paul'' (1985)
and ``Across the Borderline'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Favorite songwriter: Hank Williams. ``He's my favorite singer,
too. I just thought there was none better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Guitar influences:
</P>
<P>
   Legendary ``gypsy'' guitarist Django Reinhart and Mexican border
music. ``I grew up listening to a lot of the Mexican radio
stations.. I lived across the street from a couple of families of
Mexicans and they kept the radio going all the time, 24 hours a
day. I loved all of it. And then I heard Django Reinhart, and
thought there's a guy I want to hear more of. I was about 20 when I
first heard him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If he's not playing music he's probably: Golfing on Maui.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Coming up: A new album of standards, and an instrumental blues
set.

 &HT;    Faced with massive suffering, relief workers often wonder where
God is _ or if God is
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abby Maxman peered inside the sanctuary of a rural Catholic
church in East Africa near Lake Victoria and froze.
</P>
<P>
   Piles of rotting corpses, mostly women and children, were
scattered under the church's wooden pews. Some of the babies, still
clinging to their mothers, had machete wounds in their skulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was numb. My head was spinning,'' Maxman said. ``I wanted to
throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   The women had fled to the church for refuge, Maxman was told,
but the killers didn't care. They tossed grenades inside. Then, too
tired to continue, they slit the Achilles' tendons of the survivors
so they couldn't escape. They returned the next morning to finish
their butchering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, madame, this is Rwanda,'' said Maxman's guide, a
relative of one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Maxman, 33, was in Rwanda on that March morning in 1995 as a
part of CARE, the international relief agency based in Atlanta. She
was helping the country resettle returning refugees a year after
rampaging Hutus murdered at least 500,000 Tutsis in a genocidal
fury.
</P>
<P>
   She was taken to the church by relatives of the victims, to bear
witness to their suffering. Maxman called the morning one of the
most powerful moments in her life.
</P>
<P>
   It was the day she decided that God did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I desperately want to feel sure about,'' she
said. ``Sometimes I can become fatalistic and say things happen for
a reason. But I cannot think that in these kinds of settings
because they're too big, too painful, too monumental.''
</P>
<P>
   The world is full of grim images. The latest come from the
Balkans, where photos of thousands of hungry and ill refugees
fleeing brutality in Kosovo have now become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Such images are hardly new, only the latest in a series of dark
snapshots in recent years that have included waxen corpses in
Rwanda, skeletal figures of famine victims in Sudan, dazed
survivors of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers see the worst that humans _ and Mother Nature _
offer. Some, like Maxman, say the experience has extinguished their
faith in God. Others say it has rekindled their faith. All,
however, say they have learned profound lessons about the human
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Robert MacPherson, an ex-Marine wounded in Vietnam and a member
of CARE's Emergency Group operations, has seen his share of
unforgettable images.
</P>
<P>
   He was part of an airlift operation in 1992 that ferried food to
starving refugees in Somalia. As his helicopter approached the
Somalian city of Baidoa, MacPherson, 53, said the sunbaked horizon
was filled with thousands of skeletal people.
</P>
<P>
   As the Somalians surged toward the descending helicopters,
MacPherson saw many of them collapse. Only gradually did he realize
what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the presence of the helicopters landing . . . people were
so malnourished that they died from the excitement,'' MacPherson
said.
</P>
<P>
   He's also learned that there are decent people everywhere _ even
in Kosovo, among groups labeled as evil.
</P>
<P>
   MacPherson spent last winter in the war-torn area, teaching
people about land mine safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I think the Serbs are completely bad and the others
are good people, I will come across some Serb family living in the
middle of Kosovo, scared to death,'' he said. ``They are farmers,
just like anybody else, who don't want their kids to die, just like
everybody else, and who are out of food, just like everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   CARE workers cope with the demands of their jobs in various
ways. Many share common traits _ idealism, a sense of humor and
bravado.
</P>
<P>
   But organized religion doesn't seem to play a big part for most.
Many, like MacPherson, are not regular churchgoers. They find their
inspiration in people, not piety.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Giannone, who has been with CARE for three years, said he
discovered a surprising truth while working with impoverished
people in war-ravaged countries such as Vietnam, Sudan and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad people get all the publicity,'' he said, ``but there's
a lot more good people out there and that keeps me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding joy despite pain
</P>
<P>
   Giannone, 50, who directs CARE's emergency operations, said
people living in brutal surroundings know how to find joy, even in
the harshest of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   He's seen the children of war refugees playing with toys made
out of discarded war materials. He's driven through a desert with a
group of tough Iranian men who stopped just to marvel at a patch of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   And the passionate faith he's encountered in his work has made
the Western practice of religion seem puny in comparison, Giannone
said.
</P>
<P>
   To explain this point, Giannone details an encounter he had in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   While visiting a rural village, he met a 28-year-old farmer who
had been abducted by rebels. They beat the man and threw acid into
his eyes, welding them shut.
</P>
<P>
   After talking to the farmer, Giannone drove away, turning to
look at the man one last time. The farmer was standing in a
courtyard, clutching a Bible he couldn't read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their faith becomes my faith,'' Giannone said. ``If they've
got the guts to go on, I've got the guts to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The harsh conditions CARE workers encounter often cause cultural
whiplash when they return home.
</P>
<P>
   Giannone gets excited when he shops for groceries. ``To go into
this huge place and buy any kind of meat or vegetable you want is
amazing to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Constant and prolonged travel also creates special problems.
Giannone said he's abroad about three to four months a year. Once,
when he put on his coat to go to the drugstore, his 5-year-old
daughter asked, ``Daddy, are you coming back?''
</P>
<P>
   And at times, the enormity of the job can be overwhelming. To
combat compassion fatigue, many say they focus on helping one life
_ not 30,000 _ at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mentor was a Vietnamese doctor,'' Giannone said. ``He said,
`If you can save one human being's life, you have done everything
that God expects of you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lessons in courage
</P>
<P>
   Maxman, who is Jewish, finds her inspiration in the human spirit
as well. She finds it in the most unlikely places _ even Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning she saw the corpses in the church, Maxman spotted
a woman, ashen-faced and silent. The woman's husband and her entire
extended family, save for three children, had been killed on her
wedding day. Two years later, when Maxman was leaving Rwanda, she
attended a going-away party where she saw the same woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost didn't recognize her,'' said Maxman, who is now
deputy director of CARE's East Africa and Middle East region. ``We
looked at each other and she was glowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman told Maxman that she had started a new life and had
fallen in love with a man. Maxman met other survivors in Rwanda who
were also forging ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was witnessing this in little pieces all over the country,
slowly by slowly every day,'' Maxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Such encounters restored her faith in human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned a lot about strength and courage,'' Maxman
said. But she is still searching for belief in God. The memories
from the Rwandan church linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I wish I knew,'' she said. ``Sometimes I want
that strength and power. But my beliefs are so challenged all the
time that I've not yet been able to say, `I can believe.' ''

FOR THE NEXT CHIEF OF COMPAQ COMPUTER, A TANGLED LEGACY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As it searches for a new chief executive, the Compaq Computer
Corp. will be forced to confront the question of just how complex a
business it really wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw Compaq buy Digital, we said they want to be IBM,''
a top executive of IBM recalled last week. ``We said they just
don't know hard it is to be IBM.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Eckhard Pfeiffer, who had been Compaq's chief
executive since 1991, learned just how hard it is. He was ousted
after the company said first-quarter profit would be half of what
analysts had expected, the latest in a string of earnings
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   It is only recently that even IBM figured out how to be IBM.
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., IBM's chairman and chief executive since
1993, has been fighting a long time to tame a sprawling herd of
businesses that, when he took over, resembled dinosaurs awaiting
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   He shifted to faster-growing lines like computer services. And
through the masterful ``E-Business'' advertising campaign, he found
a way to position fuddy-duddy IBM as the best way for big companies
to get hip to the Internet. The moves are paying off: Last
Wednesday, IBM announced earnings of $1.47 billion, 10 percent
above analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer chose to take on many of Gerstner's problems. By buying
the Digital Equipment Co. last year and Tandem Computers in 1997,
Compaq added a great deal of complexity to what had been a simpler,
fast-growing personal computer company.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions were meant to help it compete with IBM, selling
large computer systems and the services to help companies use them.
Pfeiffer also began an aggressive assault on the cutthroat business
of selling cheap PCs to consumers who are technology novices, a
business that has bedeviled IBM and nearly everyone else who has
tried it.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear why the new areas appealed to Compaq. ``The
traditional hardware businesses are becoming harder and harder,''
said Mike Nevens, a consultant at McKinsey &AMP; Co. ``Everyone is on a
treadmill running away from the trap of commodity products, trying
to differentiate themselves, moving into services or software.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet these new lines have been slow to take hold at Compaq, and
the effort appears to have distracted the company from its
traditional business of selling PCs to corporations, the very model
of a commodity business. Compaq found its profits wiped away by
excess inventory and unexpected price competition in PCs.
</P>
<P>
   So the challenge facing the new chief executive, who will be
selected by Benjamin M. Rosen, the chairman and a founder of the
company, is what to make of Pfeiffer's sprawling legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be whipped into shape the way IBM was by Gerstner? Or
should it strive for a pared-down business model built around
corporate PCs and servers based on PC technology, like Dell
Computer?
</P>
<P>
   While Compaq under Pfeiffer had ambitions to dominate nearly
every corner of the computer industry, Dell is defined largely by
what it doesn't do. It doesn't sell through dealers. It doesn't
spend money on research and development. It doesn't sell machines
that appeal to novice consumers who need a lot of help.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it avoids big swaths of the computer market, but
dominates segments where its build-to-order models can be
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rare company that can be all things to all people,''
said Lawrence A. Weinbach, chairman and chief executive of Unisys,
which has stopped trying. Unisys, once a full-line computer maker,
dropped out of PCs and some other lines and now gets 70 percent of
its revenue from services.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say such a tight focus is a better strategy for Compaq
than aiming at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to simplify the company,'' said Steven Milunovich,
an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``They need a stronger definition of
what Compaq stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   One place Compaq can look for simplicity is in its high-end
corporate systems. Compaq has yet to get the combined sales force
of Digital, Tandem and Compaq to sell the company's full line of
products with equal skill. Compaq will also have to decide whether
to pare even further Digital's product line and research
facilities. (Compaq has already shed a net 15,000 jobs since it
bought Digital.)
</P>
<P>
   Another question mark for the company is its consumer PC
business, a market in which leadership passes quickly to whoever
offers machines with the lowest prices. Analysts and other
manufacturers argue that this piece of the market is suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   Even Compaq, which says it now makes money even on PCs it sells
for just $600, expects that in the future it will lose money on the
cheap hardware itself but profit later by selling Internet services
and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A third potential source of simplification would be to abandon
Pfeiffer's plan to add a direct-sales capability for corporate PCs
to Compaq's traditional approach of selling through dealers. These
and other changes in the company's production process are meant to
reduce Compaq's vulnerability to excess inventory, but so far the
complex plan has not shown many results.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Rosen is saying he does not want to pull back from
Pfeiffer's strategies. All the company needs, he says, is
management that is better able to cope with the diversity of its
product line and distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   After discarding two chief executives in eight years _ Rosen
ousted the company's co-founder, Rod Canion, before elevating
Pfeiffer _ Compaq might appear to be a company that top-flight
executives would shy away from, especially since there is no
immediate prospect of Rosen's ceding the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   But John T.W. Hawkins, head of the director and chief executive
practice at Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive search firm,
thinks Compaq will have no trouble attracting strong candidates.
``It's a premier company, and the wealth-creation opportunity there
is terrific,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   And with the right executive, analysts say, there may be an
opportunity for a more favorable comparison between Compaq and Big
Blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to kill a computer company,'' said Andrew J. Neff,
an analyst at Bear, Stearns. ``The right management can turn things
around ``Look at Apple. Look at IBM.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, April 16 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: SEN BUD
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 54 to 44, the final version of
the $1.7 trillion budget for fiscal year 2000. The package, a
compromise between previously passed House and Senate bills, lays
out a blueprint for cutting taxes over the next ten years, uses the
projected Social Security surplus to either pay down the national
debt or reform Social Security and Medicare and increases spending
for defense and education. Supporters said the tremendous
non-Social Security budget surplus should be returned to the
taxpayers through the tax cuts rather than used for new social
programs, as proposed by President Clinton. Opponents said the
budget does not do enough to save Social Security and Medicare and
that there should be more spending on social programs instead of
tax cuts. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   The House on Wednesday approved, 220 to 208, the final version
of the $1.7 trillion budget for fiscal year 2000. The package, a
compromise between previously passed House and Senate bills, lays
out a blueprint for cutting taxes over the next ten years, uses the

</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CENSUS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 223-206, the Local Census
Quality Control Act, which would allow cities and towns to
challenge Census Bureau data and demand a recount of contested
areas before the final numbers are released. Supporters said the
plan would provide a more accurate population count. Opponents said
the Census Bureau lacks the resources to investigate what may be
tens of thousands of likely challenges by local governments. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

SUBTEXTS AND SUBTLETIES SHADOW THE NATO SUMMIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's bifurcated commemoration day allowed for no
diplomatic slack at the regular Yugoslav bombing briefing,
transferred from the European war theater for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is a dictator,'' the briefer, Jamie Shea, said with
palpable disrespect in one corner of NATO's elaborate 50th
anniversary celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But over in the company of statesmen, President Clinton took
care to say ``Mr.'' Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb autocrat who has
viciously routed Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, confounded NATO Friday
as its member nations opened their anniversary ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The counterpoising of ``Mr.'' and dictator, of war resolve and
diplomatic hope, was the subtext of a day that provided a study in
fury and frustration at NATO's predicament. But the day that
unfolded in the eerily crowd-free heart of this security-steeped
capital was also a reflection of considerable pride at the
alliance's past _ its rising from the ashes of World War II as a
successful redoubt against the Cold War threat of Soviet expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the dozens of darting motorcades and looms of sound bites
and diplomatic briefings, the NATO gathering offered moments of
simple, honest emotion when members _ particularly the three
newcomers from the defunct Warsaw Pact of the departed Soviet Union
_ looked back across the century of turmoil and oppression that
sparked NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my country, this is one of the most important moments in
its long and dramatic history,'' President Vaclav Havel gently
observed in hailing the guarantee of peace represented by NATO's
inducting the Czech Republic. ``Such peace can hardly be attained
without the readiness to defend it against the forces of evil,'' he
added in one of the day's sobering references to NATO's
confrontation of the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland stirred the gathering
in Mellon Auditorium, where NATO was signed into being in 1949,
when he looked back across postwar history and underlined the sheer
hope that NATO represented in the suffering Polish people's
yearning for freedom and, he emphasized, for the values now at
stake in Kosovo. ``In defense of these values, Poland will not
fail,'' he declared with obvious emotion as the audience of
dignitaries and generals broke into applause.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep and passion of the events being pondered by the
commemorative gathering, from Hitler's rise to Communism's fall to
the Kosovar agony, was touched on by Viktor Orban, prime minister
of the republic of Hungary. He beamed in open joy at joining NATO,
but he dwelled on this fading century and its harsh lessons. ``Time
is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, and
too long for those who grieve,'' he said. ``And too short for those
who rejoice.''
</P>
<P>
   A private meeting on Kosovo consumed the summit's first three
hours and the national leaders then headed for the ceremony,
preceded by a grave request to the waiting audience. ``Ladies and
gentlemen,'' boomed a voice, ``We ask you to please turn off all
cell phones and pagers.'' In a blur of obedience, one of the
best-wired throngs in diplomatic and military history saw to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski darted 10 rows up from the Congressional
VIP section to snap a quick photo of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. She hurried back to her seat before a column of soldiers
in regal dress uniforms strode forth to deliver an earsplitting
trumpet fanfare in advance of the parade of NATO flags, then the
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton found a parallel in NATO's founding and
William Faulkner's Nobel prize for literature both occurring in
1949. ``Humanity will not merely endure, it will prevail,'' he
quoted Faulkner's prediction.
</P>
<P>
   President Jose Maria Aznar of Spain went further back in
literature, noting today was the anniversary of the death of Miguel
de Cervantes. He quoted Cervantes on liberty: ``No treasures the
Earth contains or the sea conceals can be compared to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In quoting the next line, Aznar once more stirred the shadowy
implications of Kosovo falling across the NATO summit: ``For
liberty, one can rightfully risk one's life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the summit appeared nowhere near settling the question of
risking NATO lives by the commitment of ground troops. The hope
that air bombardment alone might drive the Yugoslav leader to the
negotiating table seemed to cling to each use of ``Mr.'' by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic's forces burn and loot homes and murder innocent
people,'' he declared in defending NATO's continuing bombing.
``When Mr. Milosevic's vision of the future is defeated, a better
one can rise in its place.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors who were worried that technology stocks
were in for some rough sledding can sleep easy. Last week's surge
in shares of IBM proves that the bull is back in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the news is rosy all around. Wounds from Compaq
Computer's disastrous first quarter are still fresh, as are
warnings about the current scene from Intel, Sun Microsystems and
companies that sell personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   What happened late last week was a shift in investors'
perceptions of reality. Investor optimism can cover a multitude of
sins.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face in sentiment was a result of IBM's first-quarter
earnings report. The company clocked a 15 percent increase in sales
and a 42 percent climb in earnings. The news pushed Big Blue's
shares up 16.2 percent in the final two trading days of the week,
to $199.75.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the report was good. But was it worth an extra $26 billion
in market value?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise in IBM's numbers was a rebound in the
company's sales of hardware, its largest business. Analysts
expected 2 percent growth in hardware revenues; IBM produced a 17
percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that growth came from PC sales, which typically account
for one-third of IBM's hardware sales. But the stellar performance
dims just a bit when you look closely at what it's being compared
with: In the first quarter of 1998, PC sales were a dreadful $2.4
billion, well below the $3 billion that analysts estimated were
sold in the comparable period of 1997. No wonder the $3.6 billion
for the latest quarter looked good.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the increase in sales, the company lost $89 million in
its PC business during the three months. Losses, at least in bear
markets, are typically frowned on by investors. But in bull markets
they are forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Investors ignored IBM's loss because it came in so much lower
than the $458 million the company lost in PCs in the first quarter
of 1998. Fred Hickey, editor of the High Tech Strategist, a
newsletter based in Nashua, N.H., said that all the hoopla over the
hardware recovery masked the fact that outside of PC sales,
hardware revenues were flat in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also shrugged off IBM's 20 percent drop in PC revenues
from the last quarter of 1998 to the first quarter of this year.
Sales always fall after Christmas, of course, but IBM's decline was
roughly twice the first-quarter drops recorded by the industry in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, shareholders' equity, the company's net worth,
has fallen 5.8 percent. It is down from $24 billion in 1995 to
$18.3 billion today, eroded mainly by IBM's share buyback program.
</P>
<P>
   The number of shares outstanding has declined by 22 percent
since 1995, making earnings per share look better. But the cost of
the program _ $2.1 billion in the first quarter _ is high. Since
IBM's cash flow couldn't cover it, the company borrowed to buy the
shares. Its debt has climbed from $22.6 billion in 1995 to $30
billion now.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Woods, editor of the Tech Review newsletter in Stony
Creek, Ontario, points out that for 1997 and 1998, IBM showed
average annual revenue growth of 3.7 percent, but that annual
growth in operating profit declined from 5.8 percent to 0.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock was up 150 percent during this time. ``It's a growth
stock, all right,'' Woods said. ``But is it a growth company?''

</P>
<P>
   The Clinton wealth redistribution program begins with his
Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin. The editor of The New Yorker,
David Remnick, interviewed Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman,
Sachs, last week before a well-off audience that included Laurence
A. Tisch, the co-chairman of Loews; Bruce Wasserstein, the
investment banker; John Gutfreund, the former Salomon Brothers
chief, and Mike Wallace of CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't Rubin kicking himself for missing out on Goldman's public
offering, Remnick asked, especially in view of the bills Rubin had
run up by making the Jefferson Hotel his Washington residence?
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had a joke,'' Rubin answered. ``I came to the
administration to help the middle class, and I'm going to leave as
a member of the middle class.'' Pause. ``He also finds it very
amusing. I don't.'' Another pause, before Rubin, whose
self-discipline is almost scary, lobbed one back at a president
notorious for schedule-busting behavior. ``What I say in response
is, I came to the administration knowing what punctuality meant.''

   When Harry J. Pearce, 56, the vice chairman of General Motors,
went in for his annual physical a year ago, he had every reason to
believe that his fitness program had kept him healthy. But his
white blood cell count was low. Just in case, he had a bone marrow
test. On May 26, during a meeting of GM's top executives, he was
told by phone that he had to hear the results in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelming fear was absolutely the first reaction,'' even
before his doctor confirmed that he had leukemia, Pearce said in an
interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   After chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant in September,
Pearce has managed a remarkable comeback, subject to confirmation
by follow-up tests. Except during a five-week hospital stay in the
autumn, he continued working from home until he began coming into
the office early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, who says he can now work as hard as before, has also
regained his status as a leading contender to succeed John F. Smith
Jr. as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that we not discriminate against people
who have had such a disease when they do have a full recovery,'' he
said. Two unexpected benefits: He has lost 10 pounds and kept them
off, and his temporarily impaired immune system has given him an
excuse for skipping some social events. ``I'm not wild about
cocktail parties anyway,'' he said.

   When Bernard Arnault likes a wine, he buys more than a case.
Last week, he and his company, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton,
gained control of Bordeaux's Chateau d'Yquem after years of
battling in court against Count Alexandre de Lur-Saluces, whose
family has owned d'Yquem since 1785.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet sophistication of d'Yquem, made from grapes shriveled
with noble rot, has drawn devotees from Thomas Jefferson to those
who today pay about $245 for the 1990 vintage. Arnault, who
privately bought another prime Bordeaux chateau, Cheval Blanc, with
a partner a few months ago, has eagerly posed for photographs with
a golden glass of d'Yquem in his hand. &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy for women to make it to the top of any law firm.
But it's especially daunting in New York. The percentage of female
partners at many leading New York firms still sits in the single
digits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a sign of change. The partners at New York's Hughes
Hubbard &AMP; Reed have just elected Candace Krugman Beinecke to be
chairwoman of their 300-lawyer firm. Hughes Hubbard joins just
three other firms among the nation's 100 largest that are managed
by women.
</P>
<P>
   The others are Mayer, Brown &AMP; Platt of Chicago; Pillsbury,
Madison &AMP; Sutro of San Francisco, and Goodwin, Procter &AMP; Hoar of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Beinecke, 52, says women should be tenacious, always do a
bit more than clients expect and not try to be one of the boys if
that isn't their style. She said law firms had made great strides
since she graduated from Rutgers University's School of Law in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   After applying to a New York firm she would not name, Mrs.
Beinecke said, she received a letter regretting to inform her that
``we already have our woman lawyer.''

OWN CLUTTER LED WOMAN TO ORGANIZE HER OWN COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Julie Morgenstern didn't know a to-do list from a file
folder when her daughter, Jessi, was born 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She was, in fact, a disorganized mess who fantasized that
someone would appear and magically organize her life. She called
this fantasy ``Rent-A-Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   When it took her a couple of hours to pack a diaper bag for a
walk in the park, she realized she had to change her ways.
</P>
<P>
   She started small, putting the diaper bag in order. Then she
tackled closets and rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Three years and a divorce later, Morgenstern realized that her
nighttime theater work (she has a Master of Fine Arts in directing
from Chicago's Goodman School of Drama) wasn't compatible with
single parenting. She needed a day job.
</P>
<P>
   The result is Task Masters, a more authoritative and powerful
name than Rent-A-Mom, she decided. Her firm helps people and
companies get organized.
</P>
<P>
   She was on the West Coast recently to meet with clients, sign
copies of her book, ``Organizing From the Inside Out'' (Henry Holt
Owl Books, 262 pages, $12.95), and share tips on spring cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Spring cleaning is more about getting organized and decluttering
than washing walls, Morgenstern says. This New York expert gets
$150 per hour for organizing homes, offices and lives.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenstern and her eight employees are not to be confused with
housecleaners. They don't do dust bunnies.
</P>
<P>
   They expect a clean, if cluttered, work site. Morgenstern says
she's even specified that a home be professionally cleaned before
they begin working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clutter is OK. Piles are fine. But if they're a barrier
between you and what you need, it's not good,'' she says. A drivers
license renewal form and an outdated party invitation lost in a
stack of unopened mail, for example, are bad. So is a ``misplaced''
check that leads to overdraft charges from the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge mistake to approach organizing with an
I've-got-to-get-rid-of-it mentality. It's more about identifying
what's important, then giving yourself quick and easy access to
it,'' Morgenstern says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Step back. Analyze yourself. Assess what's important to you.
What do you need to use on a daily basis?,'' she advises. She says
research has shown we use only about 20 percent of our possessions
_ 20 percent of the clothes in our closets, and 20 percent of
papers we so carefully file.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenstern recommends arranging rooms like a kindergarten
classroom, with areas for various activities. Most people store
things where they'll fit, not necessarily where they're needed. A
favorite reading chair and lamp should be near the books and
magazines, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If family paperwork is done at the kitchen table, bills,
stationery, pens and calculator should be nearby, not in a box in
the den.
</P>
<P>
   See where the piles accumulate, she says. Then get containers to
keep them attractively stacked. But make certain you buy the
container after you figure out what's staying in the pile, she
advises.
</P>
<P>
   The most common problem is paper piles that get out of hand
because there is no filing system, or maybe there's one that isn't
understood or trusted, Morgenstern says.
</P>
<P>
   She advocates filing everything in a user-friendly system. That
means one with only about five categories, each with a colored file
folder. Then alphabetize within each category.
</P>
<P>
   Financial files could be red, with personnel files in green, for
example. Then use a straight tab filing system (all tabs on the
left, or right _ not staggered). Morgenstern calls this system
``peaceful'' to look at, and a person can add or subtract files
without messing up a tab pattern.
</P>
<P>
   She says organizing skills are similar to directing: ``Theater
is about preparation, about being ready, about having everything at
your fingertips.'' And the phrase ``what's your motivation'' works
with both actors and disorganized people.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenstern doesn't work with unmotivated people. She wants only
clients who are feeling the pain of being disorganized. Then she
knows they'll be motivated to change.
</P>
<P>
   But even the highly motivated can have an experience that's a
mixed blessing. Morgenstern mentions a shopaholic New York client _
a woman with bags of new clothing stashed on closet floors
throughout her apartment. She hired Task Masters to help her get
organized.
</P>
<P>
   A second bedroom was converted into a large, walk-in closet.
Clothes were removed from their shopping bags and hung according to
function. The client was delighted to be able to see instantly what
she had to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, however, was stunned at the display.
</P>
<P>
   Waaaaay too many clothes was all he could see.

TIPS ON HOW TO GET ORGANIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Need a nudge to move into a spring-cleaning mode? Here
are tips from professional organizer Julie Morgenstern and other
experts:
</P>
<P>
   -Organize surface clutter first. Visible results will keep you
going.
</P>
<P>
   -Closets and garages are great places to clean/re-organize in
spring.
</P>
<P>
   -Organizing is not a game of catch-up. Sort, identify and place,
but don't use this time to catch up on unfinished chores.
</P>
<P>
   -Do only one area at a time.
</P>
<P>
   -Start with one corner of a room.
</P>
<P>
   -Never zigzag (work on several areas at once).
</P>
<P>
   -Work with a box or bag labeled ``goes elsewhere'' for things
that don't belong where they're found. When you're finished
organizing an area, put these misplaced pieces away.
</P>
<P>
   -Consolidate all ``To Do's'' onto one list and file away all
related paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   -Use containers _ baskets for magazines, boxes for storage, for
example. But don't shop for containers until you know the sizes and
styles needed.
</P>
<P>
   -Surround yourself with useful, inspiring things that make you
feel good.
</P>
<P>
   -Donate unneeded items, especially clothing and household goods.

EURO HAS PLENTY OF TIME TO CHALLENGE THE DOLLAR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Mass., Calif.)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Western Europe's new currency, the euro, ought to be a
powerhouse, already diminishing America's place in the global
economy. Such was the advance billing. But nearly four months into
its existence, the euro is hardly noticeable on this side of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   That is not too surprising. Even thoroughbred currencies inch
their way up rather than leaping. Children now in diapers may be
finishing college before lives are changed by the existence of the
euro. And even then, a solid American economy _ one that has
avoided the deterioration of severe recessions _ would dilute the
impact. The robust economy today keeps the focus on dollars, not
euros.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the euro's potential challenge to the dollar's dominance
is considerable. ``Establishing a European currency that will rival
the dollar is indeed one of the points of the whole exercise,''
said Peter Kenen, an international economist at Princeton
University.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the dollar finally eclipsed the British pound after
World War II has a currency had the potential to eclipse the
dollar. In the process, the euro could lift its 11 sponsoring
nations toward the top of the heap in political and economic power.
Neither the German mark nor the Japanese yen, the closest rivals
until now, represents a population or an economy as large as those
of the United States. But the euro does.
</P>
<P>
   American hegemony could give way to a 21st century in which
America and Europe vie with each other, says Martin Feldstein, the
Harvard economist. A more solidified Europe, thanks to the euro,
``creates the potential for political clash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   France might even succeed in putting one of its generals in
charge of NATO in place of an American. Feldstein argues for
diluting European power by dealing with governments there
separately, not as a union.
</P>
<P>
   The other great concern is the American trade deficit. Rather
than lend so much to Americans to help pay for imports and for
spending abroad, the world's investors could funnel some of their
money into the new haven. Euro investments in a powerful Western
European economy would become an alternative to Treasuries and
other holdings in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And Americans would find themselves scratching for overseas
loans to finance their way of life _ pushing up interest rates to
attract enough money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be surprised to see a significant shift to euro
investments when and if the marketplace focuses on the widening
American current account deficit,'' said William Cline, chief
economist at the Institute for International Finance, referring to
all of the nation's international transactions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the advance forecasts, the shift to euros was
supposed to have begun as soon as the euro was born, on Jan. 1. But
the money did not flow. The euro rose by only a penny from its
initial value of $1.17 and then fell steadily to just over $1.06.
</P>
<P>
   The means were there. Checking accounts, traveler's checks and
credit card purchases are all now available in euros, as well as in
the national currencies of Germany, France, Italy and the eight
other countries in the European Union. Hundreds of billions of
dollars in stocks, bonds and government securities are denominated
in euros. And in 2002, after the new European Central Bank begins
to issue euro coins and paper bills, the old currencies will
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   But confidence in the euro, for all its powerful backing, comes
slowly at all levels. American Express says European merchants have
sent in only 5,000 credit card charges in euros since Jan. 1, a
tiny number. Tourists report that traveler's checks in dollars are
far easier to cash in Europe than checks in euros. And central
banks continue to keep most of their foreign reserves in dollars,
hardly changing the mix since the euro's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance runs deeper. Even though they are all denominated
in euros, European government securities are still issued by the 11
different member countries, with each nation's paper bearing its
own separate risk and credit rating, just as municipal bonds issued
by different American cities do.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, euro securities may represent as huge a market as
American Treasuries and corporate bonds, but they do not constitute
as unified a market.
</P>
<P>
   ``As European financial markets grow and develop, and
demonstrate their stability and unity, the euro will gradually
rival the dollar, but over a period of decades,'' said Barry
Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The euro arrived just as the American economy completed three
years of robust economic growth and Western Europe found itself in
a slowdown _ bad timing. ``People have been saying for the longest
time, `Shouldn't we worry about the euro?''' Eichengreen said.
``And we should, if the European economy becomes the engine for the
world and we stop being the engine.'' Or if the United States
plunges into confidence-robbing troubles like those that
characterized the 1980s: inflation, rising deficits, a real estate
bubble that burst, a savings and loan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Then the alternatives were the mark and the yen, neither with
the euro's potential for luring worried investors in the event of
another dismal spell for the American economy. The 21st century
would not then be an American century, but rather a century shared
by the United States and Europe.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25)  
 (af)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an era when being biggest in any endeavor
brings hubris and hype, Barclays Global Investors stands out by
being nearly invisible to the untutored eye.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Barclays Global, not the much vaunted Vanguard Group,
that is king of the stock-market indexers _ managing $407 billion
in investors' money by mimicking the performance of major market
indexes. And it is Barclays Global, not a white-shoe bank or
insurance company, that is the world's biggest manager of funds for
institutions, like corporate pension funds and nonprofit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It even has designs on displacing the giant Fidelity
Investments, with $765 billion in its care, as the world's biggest
manager of money.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Global, a unit of the British bank Barclays PLC,
started out as part of Wells Fargo, the San Francisco bank. The
unit already has a remarkable perch, considering that it lacks a
well-known American brand name to advertise, sits far from the
biggest financial centers, was long hobbled by legal restrictions
not affecting some competitors and is led by a chairman who joined
the company as a temporary secretary because she couldn't land a
job in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even more than Vanguard, which has concentrated on
individual investors and met their demands for an array of
products, Barclays Global has ridden the indexing rage to dizzying
heights, managing a total of $619 billion at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason can be found at the nation's pension plans.
Just like small investors across the country, leaders of those
plans are often choosing the indexing route, having grown tired of
watching most mutual funds and other money managers fail to match
the performance of the overall market. After all, what can be more
unpleasant, not to mention costly, than having to face disgruntled
employees to explain their pension fund's underperformance?
</P>
<P>
   Size, too, works to Barclays Global's advantage. Bigness can be
an impediment for so-called active managers of money _ those who
use a variety of strategies and criteria to pick and choose stocks
_ but it helps an indexer. Barclays Global has so much money under
its roof that it obtains staggering economies of scale, allowing it
to charge annual fees that are in many cases less than one-tenth of
1 percent of the money being managed, half the level that wins
Vanguard so much praise for its fund indexed to the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500. And every day, Barclays Global does $1 billion in
trades among clients in house.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Barclays Global pioneered indexing and remains at its
forefront, with a couple of dozen PhDs prowling the investment
frontiers behind doors marked ``This is a secured floor.'' While it
manages some $400 billion through plain-vanilla indexing _ in
itself not always as easy as it sounds _ it also has huge sums
assigned to its computer jockeys, quantitative investors who try to
tease a bit more than market returns from more complex investment
products.
</P>
<P>
   Indexing, of course, is a rejection of what much of Wall Street
holds dear _ especially its faith in stock-picking prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what happens in this business is more justified by
hope _ and perhaps a little greed _ than by experience,'' contended
Patricia C. Dunn, 46, the chairman of Barclays Global, coolly
sipping from an ever-handy bottle of spring water. ``We get a lot
of our energy from being outsiders and challengers of investing
wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   As indexing's biggest practitioner, Barclays Global hears all
the criticisms leveled at a practice that is both popular and
threatening to many plush livelihoods. One contention is that
indexing is a fad that has looked attractive because the market has
been enamored, at least until this month, of the big stocks that
dominate the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, the benchmark for 70 percent of
indexed equity mutual funds and a good deal of institutional money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If sentiment shifts away from the big-cap stocks in the S&AMP;P,
indexing will take a powerful hit,'' said Jeremy Siegel, a
professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania. ``You leave yourself very vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Index-fund management is also inherently a commodity business;
it produced a relatively modest $83.2 million of profit last year
for Barclays Global's parent, 2 percent more than in 1997. Slender
margins put a premium on volume.
</P>
<P>
   As it aspires to become the world's No. 1 money manager,
Barclays Global faces a big challenge: protecting its institutional
turf against traditional rivals like State Street Global Advisors,
Mellon Capital and Bankers Trust while it pushes into the retail
market, especially 401(k) and other retirement savings vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Coy about its plans, Barclays Global says it will not buy a
public mutual fund group. But it rules out little else. Tom
Taggart, the company's recently hired spokesman, used the term
``instividual'' to refer to what is widely seen as a convergence of
the institutional and individual investment businesses. ``Look for
BGI leveraging its expertise in this area,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others speculate that the company might act as a subadviser to
someone else's funds, a business into which it has already dipped a
toe, or provide indexing skills in an alliance, say, with a major
brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes Barclays Global from most other money
managers is its commitment to indexing, a theory of investing built
on the idea that the stock market is a highly efficient
information-processing machine, one in which a giant web of
participants quickly incorporates every scrap of information into
prices. By the time word circulates of a predicted drop in the
quarterly profits of Gillette, to cite a recent example, the price
has already fallen.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the stock market is far different from the place
portrayed in personal finance magazines, mutual fund advertisements
and popular mythology, one in which smart or well-connected people
profit by outwitting the less smart.
</P>
<P>
   About $407 billion of the money entrusted to Barclays Global is
invested in straightforward replicas of various market averages.
But while this kind of investing is often derided as something that
could be done by a monkey, Steven Schoenfeld, a senior Barclays
Global official whose job title is index strategist _ not an
oxymoron _ knows otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Among the numerous practical problems he faces are dealing with
sudden inflows or outflows of clients' money and keeping from
running prices up on himself when buying a small-capitalization
stock.
</P>
<P>
   And when should someone in his position buy a company like
Safeway, which Standard &AMP; Poor's announced a few months ago as a
new addition to its 500 index? Should he buy as soon as the
announcement is made, or the morning of the day the company is
initially counted? Or five minutes before the market closes? Or a
day or two later? Or should he buy options instead?
</P>
<P>
   It's a constant, high-stakes game of cat and mouse in which
Barclays Global, as the world's biggest indexer, is everybody's
Sylvester. ``We have to make sure our strategy is not predictable _
or we're the suckers,'' Schoenfeld said. ``There's plenty of hedge
funds, mutual funds and brokers who would be all too happy to pick
us off.''
</P>
<P>
   Indexing gets treacherous overseas when rivals know that
Barclays Global is a near-certain buyer in a thin market with
rudimentary benchmarks. ``Once you go outside the United States,
just tracking the index is a major investment challenge,''
Schoenfeld said. ``Not just anyone could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, not surprisingly, is difficult, but so is a market like
Switzerland, which is dominated by a handful of huge companies,
mostly in finance and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Global follows more than 50 foreign markets, so ``when
you get into all the splicing and dicing, we're probably tracking
close to 1,000 different indexes,'' Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its success as a replicator of benchmarks, Barclays
Global also recognizes the human urge to try to do better than
average. The company puts about one-third of its invested money in
``tilts,'' funds that are basically index-matched but also
``enhanced'' with variations engineered to match a client's
tolerance of risk.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the product Barclays Global calls NeuAlpha _ in
investing, alpha refers to the amount by which you beat a benchmark
_ is a long-short tilt, one that, as its name implies, includes a
mix of short and long positions that reflect negative as well as
positive information the firm has uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   The detective work behind it relies heavily on immense computing
power, enough gigabytes to audit every American income-tax return
in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking at making big bets on 20 or 30 or 50
companies,'' said Blake R. Grossman, the company's chief global
investment officer. ``We're making small bets across hundreds,''
scooping up what he calls the ``nickels and dimes'' invisible to
others.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors, for example, track Wall Street's estimates of
company earnings, especially trends in analysts' revisions.
Barclays Global keeps tabs on individual analysts, combining their
forecasting records with other data to find patterns in how stocks
react to shifts by certain analysts on certain companies.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Barclays Global also tracks the buying and
selling by executives of their companies' stocks, but it evaluates
this information in the context of other facts, like how a
company's executives are managing its financial structure. For
instance, is expansion being financed with borrowing or new shares?
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Global, however, does not borrow money to invest and is
sparing in its use of futures and derivatives. ``We don't have many
funds that are leveraged,'' said Andrea Zulberti, the head of the
firm's risk-management operation.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Barclays Global's results have been sparkling, people
in the industry say. But performance for some clients has been
hampered in the last few years by the huge gulf between a relative
handful of big-capitalization stocks driving the main indexes and
the rest of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``As that top group has done better and better,'' said John F.
Casey, chairman of Barra RogersCasey, a consulting firm in Darien,
Conn., the Barclays Global approach ``is forcing them to
underweight these and to put money into the stocks that are so much
cheaper.''
nn
</P>
<P>
   But Casey said the clients he has steered toward Barclays Global
are a highly satisfied group. ``What they like,'' he said, ``is
that the research function is so rigorous that it's like bringing
out a new pharmaceutical product in testing these things.'' And he
said Barclays Global makes investment results dependably
transparent, giving clients enough information so that they can see
the source of the returns.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals acknowledge Barclays Global's trailblazing in indexing
and its aggressiveness in building its institutional business, with
clients like the pension funds of Exxon. But they don't hold
Barclays Global in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using very similar techniques,'' said Gus Sauter, who
oversees Vanguard's index and active quantitative group.
``Everyone, if they're not on the same page, then at least they're
reading from the same book.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sauter complained that so-called enhanced indexing
products, like the tilts, are not actually index funds; instead, he
said, they reflect active strategies, however closely controlled.
``There's no such thing as half pregnant or half wet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas A. Lopardo, chairman of State Street Global Advisors,
which manages $485 billion and is the No. 2 indexer, contended that
his old-line firm interacts with clients more than Barclays Global
does and noted that it had grown without acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   (In 1995, however, State Street did seek to buy Wells Fargo
Nikko Investment Advisers, as Barclays Global Investors was then
known. Negotiations failed over who would end up in charge.)
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Global's money under management has roughly tripled
over the last four years _ a result of a combination of mergers,
growing interest in outside management of investments for
companies, increased popularity of indexing and, of course, one of
the greatest bull markets on record.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the growth was at the expense of traditional active
managers; other new money came from public entities that had
previously been obliged by law to manage their funds themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The chief architect of the firm's development was Fred Grauer, a
Wells Fargo strategist who had left the bank after a short stint in
1979 and 1980 and was lured back in 1983, when the business was
floundering. He masterminded the 1990 deal in which half of Wells
Fargo's investment unit was sold to Nikko Securities, then managed
the late-1995 sale of the resulting business to Barclays, the
latter bringing $85 billion in managed money.
</P>
<P>
   If the firm is under pressure from London to contribute more to
its parent's so-so bottom line these days, nobody here will
acknowledge it.
</P>
<P>
   Grauer, citing an interest in ``brand new challenges,'' resigned
suddenly in July, leaving Ms. Dunn in charge; as co-chairman since
early 1997, she was the natural successor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the size of Barclays Global and its reputation do not
prevent it from worrying about its competitive position as it
serves a highly demanding clientele in a low-margin business.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest challenges they face in this country is
competition from the big trust banks that frequently bundle indexed
products in with their custody services,'' said Paul Holt,
president of Cambridge International Partners, an investment
management consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Custody business includes record-keeping, accounting and serving
as a transfer agent, and it opens the door to the lucrative
practice of lending securities. Such lending, mainly to investors
who wish to sell the securities now and repay them later after
repurchasing them at a hoped-for lower price, accounts for some 15
percent of Barclays Global's revenues, which totaled about $460
million in 1998, and an even larger share of its profits.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks the Barclays Global retail strategy will be to
jump into the mutual fund business or to market directly to
individual investors. That, among other things, would violate its
stated core belief that it should focus strictly on what it does
best _ managing money.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, suggested Avi Nachmany, head of research at
Strategic Insight, a New York firm that researches funds, the cost
would probably be prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Global expects to unveil an expansion plan in coming
months _ an expansion that it hopes will make it burst into public
consciousness. ``It's not soup yet,'' Ms. Dunn said of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But when it's ready, she added in an interview in her 33d-floor
office overlooking San Francisco Bay, ``we'll be shouting from the
rooftops.''

 &HT;    Lawsuit claims Coke practiced bias in pay, promotions
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First, Motisola Malikha Abdallah got frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   After working at Coca-Cola Co. headquarters as an administrative
assistant for more than three years, she said she was repeatedly
passed over for promotions because she was African-American.
</P>
<P>
   When she complained, Abdallah said, the situation only got
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt disrespected and dehumanized,'' the 44-year-old
Atlantan recalled Friday. ``I wanted to try to make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Abdallah joined two other employees and a former
executive in filing a federal lawsuit, accusing Coca-Cola of
discriminating against African-Americans in pay, promotions,
performance evaluations and terminations.
</P>
<P>
   The workers also are attempting to get a judge to give their
complaint ``class-action'' status so they can represent 1,500 other
salaried, African-American employees. The class action would
include those who have worked at the company in the United States
at any time since April 22, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discrimination represents a company-wide pattern and
practice, rather than a series of isolated incidents,'' the suit
says. ``Although Coca-Cola has carefully cultivated
African-Americans as consumers of its product by public
pronouncements, strategic alliances and specific marketing
strategies, it has failed to place the same importance on its
African-American employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coca-Cola Co. was built over time by people of all races,
colors and creeds,'' M. Douglas Ivester, the company's chairman and
chief executive, said Friday in a statement. ``Discrimination at
the Coca-Cola Co. is not tolerated. If discrimination is alleged,
we investigate it. If we find it, we act to stop it. Our goal is
the fair, equitable and honest treatment of all of our associates.
While we believe this lawsuit is without merit, we take these
allegations seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester also sent out an e-mail Friday to all U.S. employees
communicating the same idea and adding, ``As you have heard me say
many times, we will do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, makes many
serious claims against the company:
</P>
<P>
   _It says African-American employees face a ``glass ceiling'' or
barrier to equal opportunity when they try to step up the corporate
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few African-Americans advance to senior levels in the
company,'' the suit says. ``Indeed, although African-Americans make
up about 15.7 percent of the employees in the corporate
headquarters, they are under-represented at higher pay grades.''
</P>
<P>
   _Not only are there glass ceilings, the suit says, but there are
``glass walls'' that ``virtually segregate the company into
divisions where African-American leadership is acceptable, and
divisions where it is not.'' It says blacks in senior positions are
concentrated in less powerful and nonrevenue generating
departments, such as human resources and external affairs.
</P>
<P>
   _A salary review shows ``dramatic differences in pay'' between
whites and blacks at Coca-Cola's headquarters. In 1995, the suit
says, the average African-American was paid more than $19,000 less
than the average white employee. By 1998, the gap had risen to
$27,000.
</P>
<P>
   _The performance evaluation system, which affects raises,
bonuses and advancement, is biased, the suit says. ``Because of the
undue discretion of managers, African-Americans receive more low
evaluation scores than Caucasians and fewer higher scores,'' the
suit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1998, about 56 percent of white employees scored
in the three highest evaluation categories, compared with 46
percent of the black employees.
</P>
<P>
   _Black employees are involuntarily terminated at corporate
headquarters at a much higher rate than white workers, the suit
says. In 1997, blacks accounted for 37 percent of the firings at
corporate headquarters, which was more than double the rate of
their representation in the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he obtained the company statistics, plaintiffs'
attorney Cyrus Mehri replied Friday, ``We have conducted a thorough
investigation over more than six months and have obtained and
analyzed the data underlying the complaint.'' He would not be more
specific.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin said the company has not had
enough time to study the suit's statistical allegations, and,
therefore, could not comment on them.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said the company did investigate three of the employees'
complaints and found them to be without merit. The fourth employee,
he said, was terminated for allegedly violating the company's
business code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Mehri, who is based in Washington, was one of the principal
lawyers who handled the Texaco workers discrimination case in 1996.
In the largest such settlement in history, Texaco agreed to pay
plaintiffs $176 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the Coca-Cola suit, Mehri is seeking unspecified monetary
damages and court orders prohibiting Coca-Cola from engaging in
discriminatory practices.

911 TAPES RELEASED AS POLICE CONTINUE INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ ``The school's in a panic, and I'm in the
library,'' the teacher is desperately trying to explain to the
police dispatcher as she begs for help. ``I've got students down
...
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the table, kids!'' she says now, directing her attention
back to the students who, moments before, had been quietly studying
in the library at Columbine High School. ``Kids, under the table.
Kids, stay on the floor ... Oh, God. Oh, God _ kids, just stay
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher's frantic voice, heard as gunfire reverberates in
the background, was part of a tape recording made public by the
police on Friday of some of the emergency calls placed Tuesday as
two students began their lethal rampage through the school, in
which they killed 12 fellow students _ 10 of them in the library
from which the teacher placed her desperate phone call _ and one
teacher before turning the guns on themselves. The teacher on the
phone, whom police identified on Friday only by her first name,
Peggy, survived the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were made public as the police continued with dozens
of interviews aimed at finding out whether, as many investigators
here strongly believe, the two young men had help in preparing for
their attack or in bringing more than 30 home-made explosive
devices into the school. But while many of the killers' friends and
acquaintances have been questioned, no arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said on Friday that they believed the two,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, may have wandered through the school
after their initial attack in the library for up to an hour before
returning to that room to kill themselves. Some students had made
their escape while many others remained barricaded inside other
classrooms during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens, who toured the school Thursday night, said on
Friday that ``the devastation is difficult to exaggerate,'' and
said that many of the most haunting sights were the most ordinary
ones, from books left open on their desks to computers still
switched on.
</P>
<P>
   ``One young woman had been filling out an application to the
University of Denver,'' the governor said in an interview. ``Next
to it she had a to-do list. Monday was all checked off. She was
halfway through Tuesday. One of the items on the list was to write
her life story.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, the Jefferson County district
attorney, David Thomas, interrupted his briefings on the status of
the investigation to offer an emotional plea to reporters and the
nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to most of the families in this case, and they
said there has to be some meaning to this, this has to result in
something,'' Thomas said. ``These deaths cannot be in vain. We
can't walk away from here here and wait for the next incident to
occur and then go cover that incident and not learn from this.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 50, suggested that part of the problem was the easy
availability of guns in this country. ``The kinds of things that
were involved in this case were simply _ it was so simple to get
them,'' he said. ``Guns are everywhere. You can buy them on the
street. You can get them anywhere you want. You can steal them.
They're readily available. You can go to gun shows. You can have
your friends go to gun shows if you're underage. They're very easy
to acquire.''

THE TALENT'S THERE _ THE ROLES AREN'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The Oscars have never been a benchmark of
quality; Cher has won one, for goodness sake. But they are
certainly a barometer of what's going on in Hollywood, and what's
going on right now isn't good news for American actresses.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 Oscar actress nominations this year, seven went to
foreigners and three went to Americans. Of those three Yanks, two
are _ let's say _ mature (both Kathy Bates and Meryl Streep are
50). And winner Gwyneth Paltrow probably had to effect an English
accent just to get into the group.
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly an aberration either. Last year, Helen Hunt won,
beating four Brits who probably split the vote in her favor. The
story was much the same in 1997, with Frances McDormand winning for
``Fargo,'' beating three English actresses (Brenda Blethyn, Kristin
Scott Thomas and Emily Watson) and an American (Diane Keaton) whose
name was on the ballot more or less just to give it a fifth entry.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Oscar trends, Miramax president Harvey Weinstein
deserves much of the credit and blame. Miramax has perfected the
kind of period piece that tends to grab Oscar's attention, and the
studio stuffs these movies full of grand English dames and
thespians. And then they spend millions of dollars, touting their
films and performers and ... well, we digress.
</P>
<P>
   What we really want to say is: Harvey, mix in an American or
two. And let me hasten to add that we're not a bunch of xenophobes
here. We like foreign actresses just as much as the next filmgoer.
It would simply be nice to see the current generation of American
up-and-comers make some movies that challenged their minds _ not to
mention ours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good female characters in film are few and far between,'' says
Hunt, Oscar winner for ``As Good as It Gets.'' ``That's why `Mad
About You' has always been such a blessing. The show is smart,
complex and interesting. You don't find too many movies that reach
that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Oscar grande dame Streep: ``I feel lucky to see the kinds
of roles that I see. But then I think that I shouldn't feel that
way. There should be more roles and more movies featuring women. I
know the audience is there for them, but you can't convince too
many people of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics from the Screen Actors Guild show that Streep is
indeed one of the lucky ones. According to the guild's latest
employment numbers, 37 percent of men cast in films and television
shows last year were 40 or older, but only 24 percent of the women
cast came from that age group. The gap is even wider with leading
roles: Just 21 percent of female leads were actresses over 40,
compared to 34 percent for male leads.
</P>
<P>
   Couple this with the fact that men are traditionally cast in
twice as many roles as women and you have a glimpse of the enormity
of the problem. Actresses are Hollywood's most undervalued
resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who have won Academy Awards are looking for alternative
careers because there's nothing out there for them that's
interesting or worth doing,'' SAG first vice president Amy Aquino
told the Hollywood Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like this for years, and nothing is really
changing,'' Aquino adds, noting that the statistics have varied by
only one percentage point for the past seven years. ``Women who
were big stars and are now in their 40s and 50s find themselves
competing for fewer and fewer jobs, often finding themselves up for
roles against women half their age. Look at all these 60-year-old
actors matched up with women in their 20s. It's ridiculous and
heart-breaking at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation isn't that much better for young actresses,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to fight, otherwise you're just going to be the
girlfriend,'' says 23-year-old Angelina Jolie, daughter of industry
veteran Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie's best roles to date have come courtesy of cable
television, a medium many actresses are using to hone their craft.
Jolie has won two Golden Globes for HBO's ``Gia'' and TNT's
``Wallace.'' Her film career has thus far been relegated to
hit-and-miss supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to give our actresses better work? May we
humbly suggest the following:
</P>
<P>
   1) Watch the History Channel. Women in this country have done
some pretty interesting things through the years that don't involve
prostitution or contracting cancer. Let's make some movies about
these ground-breakers. (Example: Pocahontas _ but without all the
singing.)
</P>
<P>
   2) We realize that some powerful men ditch their spouses for
trophy wives. But we also know some tycoons who like women their
own age. Reflect this occasionally in movies. Better yet, make a
film about a powerful older woman with, say, Ryan Phillippe as a
madcap suitor.
</P>
<P>
   3) Less John Travolta. More Jessica Lange.
</P>
<P>
   4) Don't rely so much on the WB acting stable or its
accompanying puerile mentality. Sarah Michelle Gellar should only
be allowed to make one movie a year. Set the same limit on any
actress from ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   5) Holiday prestige title suggestion: ``Betsy Ross in Love.''

A CAREER DETOUR THAT LED TO THE CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25)

<P>
   Since 1976, when she joined Barclays Global Investors, Patricia
C. Dunn has taken a turn at nearly every job there _ the clearing
and settling of trades, portfolio management and positions in
sales, accounting, trading and administration _ none of which she
was initially qualified to do.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the fall she told a women's leadership conference at
the University of California's Haas School of Business that she
couldn't even have gotten into business school. ``My expectations
were so low,'' she said in explaining her start at Barclays Global
as a temporary secretary, ``that I can honestly say I did not have
a career ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Ms. Dunn graduated from the University of California at
Berkeley, she was unable to find a job in journalism, her first
choice. She also thought people who worked for long in corporate
America ``didn't have a life'' and recalls thinking, ``It's just
not in my future to work for a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet nobody was surprised last summer when the sudden resignation
of Fred Grauer left her the undisputed boss. The two had shared the
top job for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   She has clearly mastered the theory of Barclays Global's heavily
quantitative work _ she calls herself a ``huge believer'' that
investing should be considered science, not art. But it is
management skill and an adaptive mind that have lifted her to her
powerful job. Senior industry officials guess that she earns at
least $1.5 million a year and perhaps as much as $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to bring together the technical with the
real,'' Ms. Dunn said. ``Probably the thing that I did at the point
of my career where I advanced the most involved helping clients
figure out how to use our highly sophisticated investment services
to their advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   About the most foolish thing some investors do today, she
contends, is chase after the hottest fund managers. ``Past
performance explains nothing about the future,'' she said. ``That
search for predictive power _ you can't find it.''
</P>
<P>
   And how does it feel to be responsible for $619 billion? ``I
dream about it,'' Ms. Dunn responded. ``Sleep deprivation is an
occupational hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   But she allowed that she would probably worry just as much about
one-thousandth of that sum, which would be a mere $619 million.
``After a point,'' she said, fretting that she might sound flip,
``it gets to be zeros, doesn't it?''

Angelle Seeling proving doubters wrong 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
ENNIS, Texas _ Angelle Seeling has heard it before. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can this petite woman handle one of those powerful
drag-racing motorcycles? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was racing back home they would see me and say, `That
is a nice bike,' and ask, ``Whose is it?'' I would say that is my
bike,'' the 5-foot-2, 107-pound racer said. ``Then they thought I
owned it. But when I walked up in my leathers, they were like,
`Wow, she really does drive that bike.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seeling, a 28-year-old New Orleans resident, enters this
weekend's Castrol Nationals at the Texas Motorplex leading the
NHRA's Pro Stock Motorcycle point standings after one race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seeling, who drives for George Bryce's Star Racing, scored a
National Hot Rod Association maximum of 138 points at the
Gatornationals last month in Gainesville, Fla. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seeling won the final and was the fastest qualifier with a Pro
Stock Motorcycle national elapsed-time record of 7.21 seconds on
her 1,500cc Suzuki. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That was like the first \RNHRA\S race I ever won,'' Seeling
said. ``We were No. 1 qualifier, set a new record and won the race.
I was wondering if it was ever going to happen again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, drag racing was a hobby for Seeling as she
pursued a career as an intensive-care nurse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after racing a drag bike in Louisiana for four years,
she used some of her nursing money to attend Frank Hawley's Drag
Racing School in Gainesville. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bryce, one of the NHRA's most successful Pro Stock Motorcycle
owners and crew chiefs, taught at the school. By July 1996, Seeling
was driving for Bryce on the NHRA circuit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seeling won her first race Sept. 15, 1996, in Reading, Pa.,
becoming the sixth woman to win an NHRA national event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She won three of 14 races in 1998 and finished second to Matt
Hines in the series standings. &QL; 
``She has the combination of having the unmatched fire, desire,
goals and dreams to be a champion and be the best,'' Bryce said. &QL;

A GLOBE-GIRDLING E-MAIL SUGGESTS AND OUTLET FOR GRIEF FROM SCHOOL
SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIMBERLY DURNAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The sorrow that followed the Littleton,
Colo., school massacre may have found an outlet in a simple gesture
suggested by an Arlington man in an e-mail that traveled around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Retired educator Klaus Driessen sent a note to about 250 e-mail
addresses asking people to turn on their headlights and porch
lights Friday, Saturday and Sunday in remembrance of those who died
and in support of those who survived the Columbine High School
shooting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He also asked those receiving the e-mail to pass the message on.
It quickly snowballed into a mass-mailing that brought responses
from as far away as Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal that one person can write an e-mail and the
lights come on around the world,'' Driessen said.
</P>
<P>
   The former teacher, principal and superintendent said he was
driving past a school Thursday when he noticed the flag was flying
at half-staff. He then asked himself what he could do to show
others that he, too, felt the pain of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to turn on my lights for the families in Littleton
to show them that I care about them, that I feel the pain and hurt
and heartache,'' he wrote in his e-mail. ``I'm going to turn on my
lights for what is right about this country. I'm going to turn on
my lights against darkness, the anger and the prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, Driessen said he had received about 40
phone calls and 2,000 responses to the e-mail he had sent early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Responses came from Littleton, Japan, Germany and a variety of
places throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Marine colonel called to say he was going to forward the
e-mail to all his subordinates; secretaries for Minolta and Xerox
called to say they would forward it to all employees at their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The speed and amount in which someone's e-mail can be forwarded
is, of course, immeasurable. It depends on how soon people read
their e-mail, whether they forward it and when they forward it,
said Sajal Das, who teaches computer science at the University of
North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But just imagine if Driessen sent out 200 e-mails, and those
people sent out 200, you would have 40,000. Multiply that by
another 200 and you have 80 million, Das said, adding that even he
got a copy of Driessen's note.
</P>
<P>
   One response came from Stanci Hagans, in Littleton, Colo.,
thanking Driessen for his gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``... the continued efforts of the nation to reach out and
console and support us is incredibly touching,'' Hagans said. ``I
hope that we can all learn something from this terrible tragedy and
walk away better, more tolerant people. Our community has really
pulled together, strangers are hugging, families are realizing the
value of each other. I pray that we can carry this sense of
camaraderie with us long after the funeral services have passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Driessen said he had no idea his gesture would attract so much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken on a life of its own,'' he said. ``It's a shame
that a tragedy like this had to wake us up.''

DAUGHTER OF JOHN VOIGHT WAS BORN TO ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ When Angelina Jolie was a little girl, her
brother would point a home video camera at her and plead, ``C'mon,
Ange, give us a show!'' And Jolie would happily oblige, much to the
delight of her actress mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who would
provide the kids with costumes for elaborate performances.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie's father, actor Jon Voight, encouraged her as well. Nobody
ever told Jolie to be quiet or stop talking. Instead, as she was
growing up, she was constantly challenged to examine her feelings
and question the world around her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was being prepared to respond to other people, to listen to
other people, to express what I was feeling, to be bold, to be
really honest, to let things hurt if they hurt and not be in denial
about what was going on inside me,'' the 23-year-old Jolie says.
``And, yeah, those things have helped me as an actress but they've
also helped me live my life. Because, to me, to prepare to be a
good actor is to prepare to live life.''
</P>
<P>
   The preparation has paid handsome dividends since the beautiful
Jolie began using her talents for more than family productions. She
has stolen every movie she has appeared in, giving passionate
performances in otherwise forgettable fare like ``Hackers'' and the
recent ``Playing by Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Jolie has really made her mark is in television, winning
back-to-back Golden Globes and Emmy nods for the cable movies
``Gia'' and ``George Wallace.'' In the former, she played a doomed
fashion model; in the latter, she was the wife of an American icon.
Together, the two turns displayed an incredible range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is full of beautiful girls, but they're not Angelina
Jolie,'' says director John Frankenheimer, who worked with Jolie on
``Wallace.'' ``She's fun, honest, intelligent, gorgeous and
divinely talented. She brings a hell of a lot to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences should find cause for celebration with Jolie's
upcoming trio of movies. In the current air-traffic controller
comedy, ``Pushing Tin,'' Jolie plays an unhappy wife given to
consuming vodka by the barrel. Arriving this fall is ``Girl
Interrupted,'' the true story of a young woman wrongly placed in a
mental institution. Winona Ryder stars; Jolie plays her
schizophrenic friend.
</P>
<P>
   Still later will be ``The Bone Collector,'' a thriller that has
Jolie playing a cop partnered with Denzel Washington. On that one,
Jolie's name will appear above the title for the first time in her
young career.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as though Jolie is always working, and she readily
admits as much. She did take a break once. Jolie had just finished
``Gia,'' a part so rich and so complex that she figured she'd never
see the likes of it again. She was married, if just temporarily, to
actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met while making ``Hackers.'' And
she was achingly unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I had all the things I had always wanted in my life
and there was still something about me that was very empty,'' Jolie
says. ``I didn't know if I was going to be hungry again in my life
for certain things. And I didn't know what more I had to give.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jolie took a break. Sort of. She took writing and directing
classes at New York University, road the subways a lot and realized
_ it didn't take too long _ that she really loved acting and that
she had much more of herself to give to her profession.
</P>
<P>
   And now, she's not quite sure how to stop giving. Jolie has
worked constantly for the past 18 months and when she isn't on a
set, she's usually reading or writing or acting on the stage. She's
constantly looking for characters to play that will help her evolve
as a person. It's almost as if outside of acting, she can't find
the motivation to grow.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jolie noticed that her characters were taking
trips and going out to dinner while she always sat at home,
absorbed in the process of soaking up their fictional lives. Acting
was her professional life !ital!and!off! her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has always had a tremendous amount of energy, and the
signals were always there that she might give that to acting,''
says father Voight.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Voight must have always considered the possibility. He
and Bertrand, who divorced when Jolie was 2, purposely gave her a
middle name that could double as a surname and thus relieve her of
an unwanted burden should she choose a show-business career. Jolie
doesn't go into too many specifics about her early years with
Voight, only to say that they had a ``stormy relationship'' because
they are so much alike.
</P>
<P>
   On this subject, like so many others, she's straightforward and
yet a bit mysterious. Jolie often obliquely refers to ``things''
she has gone through and endured in her life with the unspoken
understanding that these are things you don't get to know about.
She reveals herself through her acting. And that's enough. That's
all she's willing to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, acting is a real experience,'' Jolie says. ``I choose
roles that fit where I am in my life and open up to them because
that's the way I'm opening up. I make them real and I get close to
people. I know there's a false reality to acting, but the way I do
it, it's my life and it's not fake. It's not just a movie. It's a
real experience that I remember forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Voight: ``She has a very strong, specific presence on
screen. There's a certain honesty there that I think is pretty
rare, pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie would like to keep building on that but realizes that
challenging roles for young actresses are few and far between. She
also knows the situation doesn't improve when actresses mature and
lose their status as the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never work in this business just to work,'' Jolie says.
`It would kill me to feel like I wasn't really doing anything. I'm
hoping to keep growing and changing so that I'll have more to offer
and be able to express it through my work. And if Hollywood doesn't
want to accept that or is critical of me for growing up and aging,
then that's their loss because I know there's a need for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Jolie continues, ``it might make me more aggressive
to go through that transition because it's such an important one to
express. It's what life is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Angelina Jolie, acting and life are entirely interwoven,
tangled up in a beautiful tapestry that keeps growing. &QL;

 &HT;    Preserving history with return of salt lake to public domain
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINN, Texas _ The shores of the lake sparkle, the sun glinting
off a thick layer of crystallized salt that has drawn people to
this small South Texas lake for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden in the brush country off Texas 186, La Sal Del Rey, as
the legendary salt lake is known, has melted into near-obscurity
since the last horse- and ox-drawn carts pulled loads of salt from
its banks in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time in decades, what was once the most
important lake in Texas will return to the public domain today when
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service opens roughly 40,000 acres of
its Rio Grande Valley wildlife corridor to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The lake and the land surrounding it were purchased from
longtime owners in 1992 as part of the wildlife service's 20-year
effort to create an unbroken stretch of protected land from Falcon
Dam to the Gulf of Mexico. Along with its long history _ Indians,
Spaniards, Civil War troops and early Texas settlers all mined
precious salt from its shores _ Sal Del Rey is a natural novelty, a
500-acre lake surrounded by a thick apron of 90 percent pure salt
crystals that quickly encrusts fence posts, branches, and anything
else the water touches.
</P>
<P>
   La Sal Del Rey is one of seven tracts that will open to the
public today. Another significant tract is 12,000 acres at Boca
Chica, a wide coastal plain of wetlands, tidal flats and brush near
the mouth of the Rio Grande. The site includes the Palmito Ranch
battlefield _ the last battle of the Civil War _ and was the
subject of years of legal wrangling between developers and
environmentalists before the Fish and Wildlife Service bought it a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, the agency has spent about $80 million to acquire
90,000 acres across the Rio Grande Valley. The decline of
agriculture in the area has helped agency officials approach their
eventual goal of controlling 132,500 acres to serve as habitat for
hundreds of species _ including the ocelot and jaguarundi, the two
endangered cats whose range includes South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Ditto, project leader for the agency's Lower Rio Grande
Valley National Wildlife Refuge, has seen more and more land come
up for sale near the Rio Grande as the farmers who once dominated
the local economy leave the business. Ditto has heard a list of
last straws: the extended drought in South Texas, low profits,
competition from Mexico, younger generations that just aren't
interested in carrying on the farming tradition.
</P>
<P>
   After closing a sale, the Fish and Wildlife Service pays the
farmers and ranchers to re-plant the land with native flora like
ebony, huisache, prickly pear, and retama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about anything you can name _ we put about 40 species out
here,'' Ditto said as he drove past what used to be sorghum fields
near Sal Del Rey. ``The farmers spent their life clearing this
brush so they could farm out here, and now they're helping put it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto said the restored tracts have become magnets for wildlife,
which he hopes will attract nature lovers and birders, who pour
about $90 million into the local economy each year.
</P>
<P>
   Birds such as green jays and pygmy owls that are rarely seen in
the United States have been sighted around Sal Del Rey, he said,
and the lake's shallows and the surrounding brushland are now
teeming with shorebirds, coyotes, javelina, deer, and other
wildlife. In the lake itself, only brine shrimp and a hardy breed
of water beetle can live in the super-salty water.
</P>
<P>
   The lake is one of three salt lakes in Hidalgo and Willacy
counties that the Fish and Wildlife Service purchased along with
15,000 acres of surrounding land. All three have played a central
role in the history of South Texas and northern Mexico since the
first treasure-seeking Spanish explorers stumbled upon them in the
early 1500s.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eloise Campbell, who owned La Sal Del Rey and
surrounding land for 40 years and became its most fervent
historian, Cabeza de Vaca and his men immediately claimed the lakes
for the Spanish crown _ hence its name, which in Spanish means
``the king's salt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most precious commodities at that time in
the world,'' said Campbell, who now lives in Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   The explorers had discovered a natural treasure that to this day
baffles experts. No one knows how Sal Del Rey formed or exactly how
much salt it contains, although engineers have estimated as much as
4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries before the Spaniards arrived, bands of
Coahuiltecan Indians obtained salt from Sal Del Rey and the nearby
Sal Vieja and East Lake, which are separated by a narrow isthmus.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1750s, the lakes were fixtures on Spanish maps of the
area. A salt road stretched from Sal Del Rey to Reynosa, a Spanish
outpost on the south bank of the Rio Grande that today is a teeming
border city. Salt became the first export from the Rio Grande
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, after Texas won its independence from Mexico
and then became a state, Sal Del Rey became a prized resource for
the confederacy, which began one of Texas' more unusual experiments
in commercial transport.
</P>
<P>
   Confederate leaders decided that camels would be ideally suited
as pack animals in South Texas, and began using the animals to haul
salt from Sal Del Rey to supply their troops. Campbell said the
camels could indeed carry bigger loads than other pack animals and
required less water, but they so terrified horses that riders were
sent ahead of the trains to warn people ``the camels are coming!''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the slow-moving camels made inviting targets for
salt thieves, who absconded with many loads. The experiment was
abandoned, and the camels were left to wander the brushland,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, whose father had wagonloads of salt from Sal Del Rey
delivered to his Harlingen ranch in the 1920s, bought the lake and
5,400 acres around it with her husband in the 1950s, and for 40
years, they raised cattle and farmed cotton, sorghum, and peas on
the land.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of giving her own tours to hundreds of visitors
over the years, she said she's glad to see the lake finally opening
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame to have something that historic and not have
people enjoy it,'' she said.

non-Social Security budget surplus should be returned to the
taxpayers through the tax cuts rather than used for new social
programs, as proposed by President Clinton. Opponents said the
budget does not do enough to save Social Security and Medicare and
that there should be more spending on social programs instead of
tax cuts. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   The House on Wednesday approved, 220 to 208, the final version
of the $1.7 trillion budget for fiscal year 2000. The package, a
compromise between previously passed House and Senate bills, lays
out a blueprint for cutting taxes over the next ten years, uses the
projected Social Security surplus to either pay down the national
debt or reform Social Security and Medicare and increases spending
for defense and education. Supporters said the tremendous
non-Social Security budget surplus should be returned to the
taxpayers through the tax cuts rather than be used for new social
programs, as proposed by President Clinton. Opponents said the
budget does not do enough to save Social Security and Medicare and

   2) BILL NUMBER: CENSUS

<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 223-206, the Local Census
Quality Control Act, which would allow cities and towns to
challenge Census Bureau data and demand a recount of contested
areas before the final numbers are released. Supporters said the
plan would provide a more accurate population count. Opponents said
the Census Bureau lacks the resources to investigate what may be
tens of thousands of likely challenges by local governments. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   Rotation, rotation, rotation. That, seers say, is what the stock
market needs to sustain its run. Unless stocks that have missed
most of the run-up the last year or so start to do better _ and
that is most stocks _ the market's gains rest on shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's one argument. And for a time the last two weeks,
it seemed that investors were listening. Signs of improving world
economic growth, as well as rising oil prices, sent money rushing
into the basic blocking and tackling companies that for generations
have been the backbone of the Industrial Age. Money poured out of
technology shares, the broken-field runners of the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   But technology's tailspin didn't last long. By the end of last
week, investors seemed as enamored as ever with making very
expensive stocks even more so.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas V. Reilly, chief investment officer of global value
equities at Putnam Investments, doesn't hate technology. He just
likes cyclical stocks better. And he took some time last week to
say why. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How big is the universe of cyclical stocks?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Cyclical industries make up about 40 percent of the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index. They include consumer stocks like autos and
household appliances, commodity companies, machinery companies, oil
companies of all stripes and transportation stocks. And we think
the cyclical stocks we own will have earnings growth significantly
more rapid than the average company.
</P>
<P>
   One of the really interesting things at this time is that you
can be pretty well invested and be a value investor. That's because
the market is so broadly cheap. At the moment, the S&AMP;P 500 is
trading at about 35 times earnings. But if all the stocks in the
index were unweighted, the ratio would be 16 times. That is a cheap
market. But you have to look beyond the top 20 or 30 names. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)With dividend yields as low as they are these days,
aren't most stock investors looking to buy stocks that will
grow?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No matter what company you are looking at, it's always a
matter of earnings growth. It's just a question of what price you
are willing to pay for growth and what your time horizon is.
</P>
<P>
   If a stock is expensive and doesn't meet earnings expectations,
it is going to go down a lot. Gillette and Coca-Cola went way down
last summer but then bounced back up a lot. That happened because
there was a lack of clear alternatives. At this point, that may not
be the case. A company like International Paper may not have as
many problems as it did, and its earnings might grow faster than
Coke's. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)In the final analysis, what will it take to move
money out of technology stocks?(end italics)  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sustained earnings growth from a broader array of stocks will
change the rotation. So will any question of faltering growth from
the market leaders. But at the moment, there is no sign that
investors are buying into this argument.
</P>
<P>
   The time horizon for many investors got very short last year,
and it remains that way. They are thinking they can't look out two
or three years, but need to focus on stocks that are performing
right now. So they have looked at stocks that have had great
earnings momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like International Paper or Weyerhaeuser or Dow
Chemical can't come up with earnings growth of the sort we have
been seeing from these technology companies on a sustained basis,
but they can do it for a couple of years because their earnings are
so depressed. And how much will the market pay for that spurt? A
lot more than currently, I think. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)So where are you putting your money?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, we have taken a lot of money out of technology. Last
summer, companies like Intel and Texas Instruments qualified as
value stocks. They don't any more. We still own some IBM, but we
have pared back our position some.
</P>
<P>
   We have spread that money into commodity cyclical stocks,
machinery stocks, transportation stocks and auto stocks. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Could you be more specific?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We are overweighted versus the market in stocks like Dow
Chemical and Weyerhaeuser. Those are big bets, as are General
Motors and Ford. We are overweighted in all areas of the energy
sector, including oil-service stocks like Halliburton and
Schlumberger. We love B.P.-Amoco, and like Mobil as a play into its
merger with Exxon. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What about bank stocks?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Bank stocks have been through a period of underperformance.
We still like them, and are still way overweight in the
financial-service sector. But we have spread our exposure there
around to insurance companies like Chubb and brokerage stocks like
Lehman Brothers, which is trading at an outrageously low
price-earnings multiple.
</P>
<P>
   Of the banks, we like Chase Manhattan, Bank One and PNC Bank.

<P>
   At Blanchard &AMP; Co., a gold-coin dealer in New Orleans, the
phones begin to ring in earnest when the price of gold drops to
around $280 an ounce. Investors, said Christopher W. Holton, the
vice president of marketing, ``are bargain hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, it is a switch for American investors, who
have too often been attracted to the glitter of gold when the price
was rising, only to be disappointed when a rally was followed by
another slump, a regular occurrence in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But bargain hunting is not the only reason for the spurt in
buying of the American Eagle gold bullion coins this year, Holton
said. Fear of a Year 2000 computer meltdown has given sales a big
boost, especially of the one-tenth ounce Eagle coin, which has been
singled out by many gurus of the Year 2000 survivalists.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United States Mint, 127,500 ounces of these
coins have been sold so far this year, compared with 15,000 ounces
in the corresponding period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Holton says other investors are buying because they want some
``insurance'' against a stock market reversal. And he gives credit
to the marketing program of the Mint, which announced last week
that total sales of American Eagles, first struck in 1986, have now
exceeded 10 million ounces.
</P>
<P>
   But buyers should remember that all of this has not done much
for gold prices. In 1998, the average price of an ounce of gold
fell 11 percent, to $294.09, the lowest average annual level since
1978. As of Friday, the spot price in London was down to $283.30.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, gold coin sales in the United States jumped 120
percent, to 1.84 million ounces, according to Gold Fields Mineral
Services, a London-based commodities research and consulting firm.
But those sales accounted for just 1.4 percent of the total demand
for gold in 1998. Worldwide gold coin sales were just 3 percent of
demand.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and other regions, which appear less prepared than the
United States for the computer shift into the new millennium, coin
sales fell 9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   One argument for a price spike has been that the world's central
banks will shut off their gold lending around year-end because they
are worried about Year 2000 computer problems. Because the central
banks, through their loans, supply much of the gold that is needed
in hedging by gold producers and speculating by investors, a
shutdown would send the price of gold soaring.
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Klapwijk, managing director of Gold Fields, does not
see a major Year 2000 effect on prices. Klapwijk, who talks
regularly to central bank officials, said, ``I see no evidence that
central banks won't lend over year-end.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold Fields is predicting that gold will trade in a range of
$265 to $305 an ounce for the rest of the year. So far this year,
the average spot gold price in London is down to $285.95 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this forecast is the sharp decline in the cash
cost of producing gold, which fell in 1998 to $206 an ounce, from
$250. Klapwijk argues that this much lower cost will encourage gold
producers to sell more of their gold forward, which allows them to
lock in a price now and deliver the gold in future years.
</P>
<P>
   By selling like that at gold-price peaks and earning interest on
the proceeds from the sale, gold producers can increase their
return.
</P>
<P>
   The Barrick Gold Corp. of Toronto, which owns mines in North and
South America, reported record first-quarter earnings that were
based on such strategic forward selling. While the average spot
price of gold in the first quarter was $287 an ounce, Barrick was
getting $385 an ounce from its previous forward sales.
</P>
<P>
   So if there is no Year 2000 disaster, coin investors have two
routes to losses: a lower gold price and the premium, higher than
usual this year, that many buyers have had to pay for coins.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, the Mint sold 694 million ounces of coins.
It and its authorized wholesalers charged premiums ranging from
3.25 percent, which is normal, to 5 percent on the one-ounce coins
and 9 percent to 25 percent on the one-tenth ounce coins, according
to Paul Deckert, director of trading at Blanchard.
</P>
<P>
   That is a price per ounce _ before the charges of retail dealers
like Blanchard _ of $297.04 to $358.75. That will be hard to get
back.

911 TAPES RELEASED AS POLICE CONTINUE INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (REPEATING for all needing.)  
(lh) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ ``The school's in a panic, and I'm in the
library,'' the teacher is desperately trying to explain to the
police dispatcher as she begs for help. ``I've got students down
...
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the table, kids!'' she says now, directing her attention
back to the students who, moments before, had been quietly studying
in the library at Columbine High School. ``Kids, under the table.
Kids, stay on the floor ... Oh, God. Oh, God _ kids, just stay
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher's frantic voice, heard as gunfire reverberates in
the background, was part of a tape recording made public by the
police on Friday of some of the emergency calls placed Tuesday as
two students began their lethal rampage through the school, in
which they killed 12 fellow students _ 10 of them in the library
from which the teacher placed her desperate phone call _ and one
teacher before turning the guns on themselves. The teacher on the
phone, whom police identified on Friday only by her first name,
Peggy, survived the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were made public as the police continued with dozens
of interviews aimed at finding out whether, as many investigators
here strongly believe, the two young men had help in preparing for
their attack or in bringing more than 30 home-made explosive
devices into the school. But while many of the killers' friends and
acquaintances have been questioned, no arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said on Friday that they believed the two,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, may have wandered through the school
after their initial attack in the library for up to an hour before
returning to that room to kill themselves. Some students had made
their escape while many others remained barricaded inside other
classrooms during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens, who toured the school Thursday night, said on
Friday that ``the devastation is difficult to exaggerate,'' and
said that many of the most haunting sights were the most ordinary
ones, from books left open on their desks to computers still
switched on.
</P>
<P>
   ``One young woman had been filling out an application to the
University of Denver,'' the governor said in an interview. ``Next
to it she had a to-do list. Monday was all checked off. She was
halfway through Tuesday. One of the items on the list was to write
her life story.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, the Jefferson County district
attorney, David Thomas, interrupted his briefings on the status of
the investigation to offer an emotional plea to reporters and the
nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to most of the families in this case, and they
said there has to be some meaning to this, this has to result in
something,'' Thomas said. ``These deaths cannot be in vain. We
can't walk away from here here and wait for the next incident to
occur and then go cover that incident and not learn from this.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 50, suggested that part of the problem was the easy
availability of guns in this country. ``The kinds of things that
were involved in this case were simply _ it was so simple to get
them,'' he said. ``Guns are everywhere. You can buy them on the
street. You can get them anywhere you want. You can steal them.
They're readily available. You can go to gun shows. You can have
your friends go to gun shows if you're underage. They're very easy
to acquire.''

THE WORLD'S RICHEST CONSIDER THE DEBTS OF THE WORLD'S POOREST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the number of people living in absolute
poverty on under $1 a day likely to reach 1.5 billion next year,
five major industrialized powers _ the United States, Canada,
France, Germany and Britain _ have acknowledged that a plan devised
three years ago to forgive debts of the poorest countries is not
working well.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions these countries have made for improving that plan,
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, will be
discussed at the meeting on Monday of finance ministers from the
so-called Group of Seven richest countries, which also includes
Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision on ways to change the initiative, first
disclosed in October 1996 by the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank, is expected at the Cologne meeting of heads of
government of the Group of Seven in June.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine countries have been classified eligible for relief
under the plan because their debts are more than two-and-a-half
times export earnings, average incomes are less than $925 a year
and they have carried out at least three years of economic changes
approved by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   But the debts of only two _ Uganda and Bolivia _ have been
reduced. Another five _ Burkina Faso, Guyana, Ivory Coast,
Mozambique and Mali _ are likely to receive relief this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a confidential report to member governments earlier this
month, the monetary fund acknowledged what it called the
shortcomings of the debt-relief initiative, saying it did not
adequately lower payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a consensus on the need for further steps to relieve
debt,'' Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, told a news
conference here Wednesday at the spring meeting of the monetary
fund and the World Bank. James D. Wolfensohn, president of the
World Bank, told a news conference Thursday that ``we need to do
more.''
</P>
<P>
   But a clear difference of emphasis emerged between the IMF and
World Bank approaches to easing the debt burden of impoverished
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus said he favored making more countries eligible for
relief since this would bring more developing economies under the
fund's supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn, by contrast, presented debt forgiveness as a way to
release additional money for fighting poverty, saying the number of
people living on less than $1 a day had risen from 1 billion a few
years ago to about 1.3 billion today and would probably reach 1.5
billion by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn also warned of the rising cost of granting debt
relief. The cost of the current system is estimated at $12.5
billion, and is up almost 30 percent from last summer. This is
partly because falling commodity prices have reduced the export
earnings of many poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions on increasing debt relief to be discussed at the
Group of Seven meeting Monday involve relaxing the conditions
heavily indebted countries must meet before they can receive help.
Canada and Britain are the most generous, France the least. Germany
has shifted from opposing debt relief to welcoming it following its
recent change in government.
</P>
<P>
   But many private humanitarian organizations pressing for debt
relief have criticized these suggestions. ``They are all
inadequate, though Canada's and Britain's are relatively good,''
said Veena Saddarth, a representative of the Oxfam International
aid organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debt sustainability is still linked to exports, not to
development and poverty reduction needs,'' said the Jubilee 2000
Coalition, an alliance of private aid and church organizations.

FABULOUS FIVE WITH OSCAR POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (Sidebar runs with ANGELINA-JOLIE)  
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ OK. We've already expressed our admiration for
Angelina Jolie. Here are five other young American actresses who
could join Gwyneth Paltrow in Oscar history some day.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Portman: &UR;  &LR;  Memorable in ``Heat,'' she stole our hearts
in ``Beautiful Girls.'' Took two years off to study her craft (and
her math) and play Anne Frank on Broadway. She currently graces the
cover of May's Vanity Fair. Next up: a little movie called ``Star
Wars: Episode One _ The Phantom Menace.'' Prediction: You won't
notice the digital effects when she's on screen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Christina Ricci: &UR;  &LR;  Made the near-impossible transition from
Wednesday to polished performer. Her wild turns in ``Buffalo 66''
and ``The Opposite of Sex'' established her credentials, which
she'll likely expand this year in Tim Burton's ``Sleepy Hollow.''
So good, she even stood out in ``200 Cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Renee Zellweger: &UR;  &LR;  Charmed audiences (and Tom Cruise) in
``Jerry Maguire.'' Held her own against Meryl Streep in ``One True
Thing.'' Her indie roles _ ``Deceiver'' and ``A Price Above
Rubies'' _ were noble failures, showing off her willingness to roll
the dice. She'll do just that in future projects with Neil LaBute
(``In the Company of Men'') and the Farrelly brothers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Claire Danes: &UR;  &LR;  ``My So-Called Life'' grabbed our attention
and Steven Spielberg's approval. ``William Shakespeare's Romeo +
Juliet'' made her a star. She has been adrift ever since (``The Mod
Squad''?), but the talent is not absent _ just dormant. Maybe she's
distracted by classes at Yale. Maybe those same classes will make
her all the more formidable in the future.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Drew Barrymore: &UR;  &LR;  Content for now to be a personality. (She's
not remaking ``Charlie's Angels'' to show us her chops.) But she's
only 24 and mostly concerned with having fun. The acting genes are
there. We're betting they'll kick in by the time she hits 30.

BOEING LOOKS FOR ANSWERS IN YET ANOTHER DELTA ROCKET DELAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing's Delta 3 launch team continued Friday to
troubleshoot the embarrassing failure of the company's new rocket
to take off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., Thursday night when the
countdown reached zero.
</P>
<P>
   A computer software glitch apparently caused the latest, and
certainly the most dramatic, postponement. It was the fourth time
this month that Boeing tried and failed to launch Delta 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find the problem and be back again another day,'' Jay
Witzling, a Boeing vice president in charge of the Delta 3 program,
told the Florida Today newspaper from Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   A new launch date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   The $235 million mission will place a Loral Orion communications
satellite into orbit to serve the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Boeing said a software command to ignite the
rocket's main engine never reached the vehicle and the engine did
not fire.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different software problem that caused the first Delta
3 to explode 70 seconds after launch last August from Cape
Canaveral on its maiden flight.
</P>
<P>
   That problem has been fixed, according to Boeing, but the
mission has been delayed by weather, problems with the rocket and
malfunctioning ground equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's trouble-plagued countdown was halted several
times during the 69-minute launch window while Boeing engineers
scrambled to fix minor problems with rocket systems. Twice the
countdown came within three minutes of launch and was halted. Both
times, the countdown was reset to T-minus four minutes. Finally, it
appeared the launch would take place at 7:05 p.m. Seattle time,
shortly before the window was to close. But when the countdown
reached zero, nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an engine hang fire,'' Boeing launch control said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer software controls the final 22 seconds of the
countdown. The liquid-fueled main engine on the Delta 3 is supposed
to ignite at T-minus five seconds when a computer command is sent
by a Boeing engineer. Two smaller engines ignite three seconds
later. When the countdown reaches zero, six strap-on solid rocket
boosters fire.
</P>
<P>
   Once the solids fire, the launch cannot be stopped and Delta 3
is supposed to thunder away with more than 1 million pounds of
thrust.
</P>
<P>
   But the software command to fire the main engine, which would
have triggered the final launch sequence, never reached the rocket,
Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear when a fifth launch attempt can be made, once
Boeing has fixed the latest software problem.
</P>
<P>
   That new launch date has to be established by the Air Force,
which operates the Eastern range for all rocket launches from Cape
Canaveral. It takes 48 hours to reconfigure range equipment between
launches, and an Air Force Titan rocket is scheduled to blast off
from Cape Canaveral on Friday. That means if Delta 3 cannot be
launched by Wednesday, the next available launch opportunity would
be Sunday, May 2.

 &HT;    A&AMP;P refuses to comment on report it will sell stores
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A&AMP;P is making moves to leave the metro Atlanta market,
according to a local news report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;P is selling nearly half of its 35 stores to Publix Super
Markets Inc., according to a story in the Atlanta Business
Chronicle that cited anonymous sources in the ``Atlanta real estate
community.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;P officials refused to comment, and Publix rebuffed the
report. ``We haven't bought any A&AMP;P stores,'' said Publix
spokeswoman Rita Owens. ``And we don't comment until the deal is
done.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation that A&AMP;P would give up on metro
Atlanta because it faces stiff competition from Kroger and Publix.
Last year, Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., which operates stores
in metro Atlanta as A&AMP;P, said it was closing more than 120
underperforming stores. The company also said it had a goal of
being the No. 1 or No. 2 chain in its chosen markets. A&AMP;P's
presence is nowhere near that in metro Atlanta. Kroger just opened
its 100th store, and Publix operates nearly 70 stores here.
</P>
<P>
   Publix is a likely buyer for some of the A&AMP;P stores because it
has significant cash flow, and it's also trying to close in on
Kroger.

NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS AGREE ON OIL EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the opening session of the NATO summit meeting
here on Friday, the 19 allied defense ministers agreed on a plan to
impose an oil embargo on Serbia by searching ships in the Adriatic
Sea suspected of carrying fuel for forces fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The defense ministers, acting after a three-hour session where
NATO leaders discussed the Kosovo war, also decided to order NATO
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, to carry out heavier airstrikes
against overland pipelines and railroads that carry fuel from the
ports of Montenegro to Serbia, a senior Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for carrying out the oil embargo were the most
definitive action taken at the summit which was designed to
celebrate 50 years of the alliance but which has been overshadowed
by the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the defense ministers said they would provide ships to
conduct the searches and inspections on the Adriatic, the Pentagon
official said. The effort would be intended to stop oil flowing
into the ports of Bar and Kotor Bay, on the coast of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   An oil embargo had been proposed by the United States, officials
said, after it became clear that as NATO was bombing Serbia's oil
storage and refining facilities, new oil was coming in.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing for an oil embargo against Serbia, Washington argued
that NATO needed to do more than strike the oil facilities of
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday that
``basically it didn't make a lot of sense for us to be bombing
refineries and at the same time not doing enough to prevent the
access of oil by sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are particularly focusing on oil because that is the way
that forces move around,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   But preventing oil getting to Serbia without hurting Montenegro,
the second republic in Yugoslavia which has been supportive of
NATO's war, makes the embargo difficult to impose, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how to stop the flow of oil into Montenegro
and to stop the flow out of Montenegro without hurting the
Montenegrins,'' a Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO will be careful not to hit oil storage facilities inside
Montenegro, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, NATO has been concerned as tankers
from Russia, Greece and Ukraine have docked at Montenegro ports and
unloaded oil.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's session, the leaders of the Western alliance spelled
out for the first time the conditions that Yugoslavia must accept
before the air strikes end, including a return of refugees to
Kosovo under the protection of an international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique, the 19 leaders said that if President Slobodan
Milosevic began to withdraw his forces from Kosovo according to a
set timetable, the alliance would deploy the international military
force and establish an ``international provisional administration''
in the province that would give Kosovo autonomy, but not
independence, from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO again laid out the five basic demands that it said
Milosevic must agree to before the air campaign is brought to a
halt: a ceasefire that is verifiable; withdrawal not just of the
military but also his police and para-military forces from Kosovo;
the stationing of an international military presence that would
have NATO at its core; the safe return of the ethnic Albanian
refugees and a willingness to work toward a political agreement
based on accords from the failed talks held in Rambouillet, France.
in February.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an endorsement of an international force, the
alliance pledged to seek a U.N. Security Council resolution
requiring the withdrawal of Serb forces. Both elements of the
proposal appeared aimed at drawing Russia into a diplomatic
solution.
</P>
<P>
   But also put in writing on Friday was a rejection of the recent
offers for settlement made by Milosevic. Without specifically
mentioning the latest proposal made on Thursday through Russia's
new Balkan envoy, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
communique said the Yugoslav leader's ``offers to date do not meet
this test.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO leaders' agreement on Kosovo set the stage for a
three-day summit whose celebrations of the alliance's 50th
anniversary have been considerably scaled back under the shadow of
the Balkan conflict. The ceremonial elements took a back seat to
day-long briefings on the military and economic strategies under
way as NATO keeps building pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-point communique was made public against a backdrop of
tough language. Phrases like ``resolve to see this challenge
through'' and declarations that ``NATO will prevail'' reverberated
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman, set a tone that combined
perseverance and defensiveness.``NATO has an obligation to
succeed,'' Shea said. ``We cannot afford to lose this one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a closed session of the 19 leaders, Clark, gave an upbeat
10-minute briefing on the status of the air campaign. He told them
that NATO had ``achieved air superiority at mid to high altitudes
throughout Yugoslavia,'' according to his spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   He then left to return to Brussels, Belgium, without meeting
with President Clinton. His spokeswoman said it was necessary for
him to return to his command.
</P>
<P>
   In public briefings by various NATO leaders, their ministers and
spokesmen invoked the idea of ground troops as they tried to send a
unified message _ the the notion of when and how they would enter
Kosovo was not addressed in the communique. Much of that talk
seemed aimed at Milosevic personally, since the leaders of the
alliance insist that the air campaign, in its 31st day, is
effective.
</P>
<P>
   But there was some discussion about ground troops at the closed
session, the Canadian defense minister, Art Eggleton, later said.
The talk focused on asking the military planners at NATO
headquarters to review all options, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their discussion followed a decision by NATO's Secretary
General, Javier Solana, two days ago _ at the request of the allies
_ to review all plans for sending ground troops to the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ There were the most unmagisterial comments
coming from a great many distinguished justices of the
Massachusetts Superior Court on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is incredible!'' ruled Judge John Cratsley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this, scientists of America!'' ordered Judge Thomas
Connolly in eureka-moment of delight as he spooled some viscous
strands of human DNA around a pipette as if twirling tiny spaghetti
around a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, even a ``Wow!'' could be heard among the two
dozen Superior Court judges clustered about the laboratory as they
learned to purify human DNA and perform on it a recombinant trick
or two.
</P>
<P>
   The delight was optional, however. The intent was serious.
Increasingly, in the wake of federal and state rulings, judges are
required to rule on the merits of scientific testimony, and, also
increasingly, the testimony on which they must rule involves the
fast-advancing frontiers of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   So some members of the Massachusetts bench are spending much of
Friday and Saturday at the laboratory bench. That is, at their own
behest, about one-third of all the Massachusetts Superior Court
judges came to the prestigious Whitehead Institute for Biomedical
Research here to trade their gavels for pipettes and learn
first-hand what DNA is all about.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory lessons, held for the first time this year, are
just about unique, said Philip Reilly, a lawyer and clinical
geneticist who helped educate the justices. He knows of only one
other similar program, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, it is part of a broad trend of great hunger among
judges to understand the DNA science that comes up in their
courtrooms _ and in their society at large.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Reilly said, he lectured on genetics for two hours to
280 federal bankruptcy judges, and ``they couldn't get enough of
it,'' he said. ``They realize the profound implications of genetics
for society.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Massachusetts, he said, ``The judges really came
to us about this and said, `We want to know more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And the Whitehead Institute was willing to oblige, said its
director, Gerald Fink, as part of a civic mission to spread genetic
knowledge among opinion leaders. While the institute's scientists
are wrapped up in frenetic work in areas like the Human Genome
Project, on the other hand, ``they are citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the O.J. Simpson trial, Fink noted, the lawyers dealing
with DNA evidence managed ``to befuddle everyone.'' But after a
program like this one, he said, ``I don't think a judge will be
intimidated by the science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a scientist,'' he added. ``You just have
to know what the limits are, what the issues are. They'll
understand what is black-and-white _ some things are, some aren't _
and what to allow in the courtroom, what not to allow.''
</P>
<P>
   That is just the kind of aid that several judges said they were
seeking to help them fulfill their new gatekeeper roles. Formerly,
judges were supposed to gauge expert witness testimony on the basis
of whether it conformed to current scientific consensus, but recent
rulings have loosened that standard and require judges to apply
more of their own judgment on whether something seems to be good
science. Such cases come up rarely, judges said, but often enough
to add extra urgency to their curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to almost be mini-scientists,'' said Judge Elizabeth
Donovan. ``We have to understand all of this, so any opportunity we
get to come to a seminar, we jump at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stephen Neel added, ``Obviously, this doesn't turn us into
scientists, but we get a sense of what the culture and methods
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they didn't become scientists, but significant signs of
progress among the judges could be observed as the day wore on. In
an initial lecture, after David Page, a Whitehead geneticist,
welcomed them to ``human genetics boot camp,'' there were awkward
silences when Page asked the class simple questions like how many
cells they thought there were in a human body. (The answer is 10
trillion).
</P>
<P>
   But soon enough, he had introduced his jurist-students to the
great cookbook metaphor: that the chromosome is like a cookbook,
the genome is like a whole shelf of cookbooks, the gene is like a
recipe, and the DNA base pairs are like the letters in the recipe.
And now, he told the participants, they were going to learn ``how
to shake and bake.''
</P>
<P>
   The hands-on lessons began with a paper-based exercise in
aligning cut-outs of chromosomes, work reminiscent of fitting
pieces in a puzzle, which gave the judges a visual sense of
chromosomes and the trickiness of deciphering them. But it was the
afternoon session in the laboratory that offered the judges the
direct experience with DNA they had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Guided by Whitehead graduate and postdoctoral students, they
took a test tube full of cells whose nuclei had already been broken
open to release the genetic material within; they spun the mixture
in the centrifuge to help remove the proteins; they poured off the
DNA-containing liquid into another test-tube and added ethanol to
it, and there it was. Stirring a glass rod in the test tube allowed
them to ``spool'' the gooey DNA strands onto the rod.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the course, they were to go on to learning about
amplifying the DNA using the technique called polymerase chain
reaction, and about how enzymes could be used to cut DNA strands at
specified points. But that first spooling of DNA can be emotional
milestone for young life-scientists, Page said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd like to have an existential moment, that would be a
good time,'' he told the judges.
</P>
<P>
   And while no one waxed philosophical about the nature of
humankind as the DNA was spooled, many of the judges sounded more
exultant than any bailiff has probably ever heard them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is human DNA!'' Judges Paul Chernoff exclaimed as he
contemplated the stirring rod. ``Pure DNA!''

 The Net's New Music Man
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
As a recording artist in the 1980s, Thomas Dolby hit the top of the
music charts with ``She Blinded Me With Science,'' a tech-pop song
that explored creative ways to use synthesizers in music.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dolby has reinvented himself as a Silicon Valley
entrepreneur with hopes of making a hit in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby, now known as Thomas Dolby Robertson, is co-founder of
Beatnik Inc., a San Mateo company that produces Web design software
to help businesses add music to Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Beatnik also sells technology that helps music industry artists
and publishers keep track of song licenses and royalties. Robertson
believes this particular feature will generate huge profits as the
$40 billion worldwide recording industry seeks to turn Internet
music, which is now largely available for free, into a money-making
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're laying the groundwork for a shift in the way the music
business operates,'' said Robertson, the son of a British
archaeologist. ``Music and technology have a unique partnership and
have for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, most of the attention about music on the Internet has
centered on the popular MP3. That format allows songs to be
compressed for storage on a desktop computer before they are
transmitted to the Internet where they can be downloaded and played
back.
</P>
<P>
   The market for online music is potentially huge. Forrester
Research Inc., a market research firm, estimates the sales of music
off the Internet could add about $1.1 billion more in revenues to
the worldwide recording industry by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   That potential has driven the world's five biggest record
labels, along with major technology companies such as Microsoft,
IBM and Sony, to move quickly into the emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson believes the dramatic growth of Internet music over
the next four years will give his company an opportunity to carve a
niche as a business-to-business company selling products and
services to Web designers as well as firms in the recording music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-employee company has already taken some steps in this
direction. Earlier this month, it changed its name from Headspace
Inc. to Beatnik to take advantage of the brand recognition of its
flagship product, the Beatnik Player, an audio player that can be
downloaded for free into a Web browser. A more advanced Beatnik
Player costs $19. More than 3 million free copies of the Beatnik
player have been distributed.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the company hired Lorraine Hariton, a former
executive with Network Computing Devices, as its new CEO, with
Robertson remaining as owner and chief technologist.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson declined to disclose revenue figures for the privately
held company, which is still trying to turn its first profit. The
firm generates revenue from licensing its special design software
that puts music in standard HTML code on a Web site. The Beatnik
Player can interpret the code and play the music back on the user's
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robertson, the Beatnik system allows Web sites to
play music more quickly than rival RealNetwork Inc.'s RealPlayer,
which moves sound in segments through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's firm recently caught the attention of David Bowie, a
big-name artist for whom Robertson played keyboards in the 1980s. A
page on Bowie's own Web site,  &LR; www.davidbowie.com &LR; , is configured
in such a way that his fans can use the Beatnik Player to create
their own MP3 encoded version of his hit song ``Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This new stuff he's doing with Beatnik technology is
amazing,'' Bowie said in a recent statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also cut licensing deals to include Beatnik with
Netscape Communication Corp.'s latest Communicator 4.5 browser,
Intel Corp.'s new Pentium III, Sun Microsystem Inc.'s Java 1.2
Virtual Machine and Macromedia Corp.'s Web design software.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company has helped design music into Web sites
for Sony's Columbia Tri-Star unit, MTV Online, Virgin Radio,
Imagine Media, Universal Pictures and 7Up.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also sees opportunities in making big money from
licensing Beatnik technology to download production music off the
Internet. These are original tunes composed not for consumers, but
for use in productions like commercials, broadcast productions or
corporate training videos.
</P>
<P>
   Zomba Enterprises Inc., one of the world's three largest
production music publishers, agreed last month to invest an
undisclosed amount in Beatnik. As part of the deal, Zomba will use
Beatnik technology to push Internet sales of music from its large
library of production music.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Roberts, Zomba's senior vice president of finance and
commercial operations, said the production music market generates
about $800 million in worldwide revenues annually.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said Beatnik's technology represents the first use of
the Internet to streamline the now complicated licensing process.
``We had the content, they had the technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mooradian, an analyst with Internet market research firm
Jupiter Communications Inc., said it's hard to judge just how
successful Beatnik will be since it is heading into uncharted
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Mooradian does not expect the use of songs and soundtracks on
the Web will be ``something that is going to be terribly
widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he is impressed that Beatnik has developed a
solid software tool for the music industry and that Robertson has
credibility among both artists and record labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has been involved in this space much longer than the
vast majority of musicians out there,'' Mooradian said. ``He
understands the technical underpinnings. So him being in that
business makes a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Egypt, Robertson taught himself how to play music. As a
teen, friends started calling him Dolby, after the famed San
Francisco noise reduction studio, because of his fascination with
gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   He used Dolby as his stage name after he dropped out of school
at 16 to pursue a musical career. He has since agreed to revert to
his original family name as part of a settlement of a lawsuit filed
by Dolby Laboratories Chairman Ray Dolby against him. The suit was
aimed at avoiding confusion between Dolby Laboratories and
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``She Blinded Me With Science,'' from the album ``The Golden Age
of Wireless,'' hit the top five on the pop charts in 1982. Although
subsequent albums like ``Aliens Ate My Buick'' were never as
successful as his first, Dolby as a composer gained critical praise
for work in the production of albums from singers like Joni
Mitchell and George Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Music historians credit Dolby with helping usher in a new era in
pop music by exploring new technology like synthesizers. He also
got good reviews for the soundtracks of films like George Lucas's
``Howard the Duck,'' although the movie itself was a box office
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Using his own money, Robertson and his manager co-founded
Headspace in 1993, originally to compose music for video games and
virtual reality programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always been very passionate about how music works in
different environments,'' said Robertson, his British accent
punctuating each syllable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fascinated by music in film, TV and commercials. When
interactive environments started to emerge in the 1990s, I was very
intrigued about how music would fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the technology world at the time was focused on
graphics and computing power, not on audio.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Robertson decided to turn his company into an
audio software producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appealed to the entrepreneurial side of my nature,''
Robertson said. ``If there was really this absence of tools and
technology to do this, then some company was going to make a
fortune by figuring it out. I was determined that it would be mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very strong need for both the music industry to

``Music is such a powerful medium. Everyone you talk to has a
strong personal sense of connection to music.''

<P>
   The selloff in technology and Internet stocks that climaxed last
Monday illustrated a Wall Street adage: When the tide goes out, you
can see who has been swimming naked.
</P>
<P>
   While technology stocks quickly recovered many of their losses
over the next four days, the 5.6 percent selloff on Monday in the
technology-heavy NASDAQ Composite index offered some lessons to to
fund investors. One was that the sizzling recent returns of so many
diversified funds were bought and paid for with enormous
overweighting in the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, funds have one quarter or more of their
portfolios in just a few technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Also instructive was the difference in performance among
technology-heavy funds. T. Rowe Price Science and Technology, a
sector fund bereft of internet stocks and with sizable cash
position, fell just 3.2 percent on Monday. But Robertson Stephens
Emerging Growth, which is managed by Jim Callinan and holds a large
number of new and volatile stocks, tumbled 10.9 percent. ``He
swings for the fences,'' said Michael Stolper, a San Diego
financial adviser, referring to Callinan.
</P>
<P>
   No one, of course, is surprised when technology sector funds
gyrate. However, the degree to which investors have been shoveling
money into such funds has been remarkable. Over the last five
years, total assets in high-technology funds have jumped 11-fold,
to $39.9 billion, according to Lipper Inc., the fund research firm.
</P>
<P>
   A number of star, non-sector funds saw dismal results on Monday.
Transamerica Premier Equity, which gained 30 percent in the year
ended March 31, dropped 5 percent as Dell Computer, Microsoft and
Charles Schwab fell hard. Those three stocks alone accounted for
almost 22 percent of the fund's assets at year-end. A sister fund,
Transamerica Premier Aggressive Growth, dropped 6.6 percent after
rising 59.7 percent in the year ended March 31; it was hurt by
stakes in Amazon.com and Dell _ 12.1 percent and 6.2 percent of
assets, respectively, at year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Another growth fund, TCW/DW Mid-Cap Equity, had 26.8 percent of
its assets in Internet stocks, mostly Yahoo, Amazon.com and Ebay,
at the end of November. That helps explain the fund's 80.9 percent
gain in the year ended March 31, as well as its 9.7 percent drop on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime investors in such funds ``were up so much more to begin
with, it really doesn't matter'' that they lost a lot in the
technology selloff, said Scott Cooley, an analyst at Morningstar
Inc., the Chicago fund researchers. But for people looking to put
new money to work, he said, the episode should help them ``at least
think a little bit before they hop into some of these funds that
have gone up a ton.''
</P>
<P>
   M. David Testa, chief investment officer at T. Rowe Price
Associates, the big Baltimore fund company, thinks the lack of
diversity in some diversified funds is becoming more of an issue.
``This has been a more acute problem in the short run than it has
been in umpteen years because it has been such a narrow market,''
he said, ``and the chance to stand out because of one or two stocks
has been very high.''
</P>
<P>
   One fund that has drawn much attention for concentrated stakes
in hot stocks is Legg Mason Value Trust, run by William H. Miller
III. The fund had just a 3.8 percent loss on Monday, even though
America Online and Dell made up more than 20 percent of its
portfolio last week.
</P>
<P>
   Harder-hit growth funds ``own Microsoft and Lucent and EMC and
Home Depot and had all of the classic high-multiple growth names,
and that's not what we own,'' said Miller, referring to the balance
of his portfolio. ``The rest of the stuff we own is very
conventional _ banks, mortgage insurance, stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   One top-performing fund, Vanguard Primecap, fell just 1.2
percent on Monday even though technology made up 34 percent of its
portfolio last month. Primecap owned the right type of stocks, said
Jeffrey S. Molitor, Vanguard's director of portfolio review.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't owned any of those big Internet names,'' Molitor
said. ``They've never owned Microsoft, but within tech, they've had
terrific results.''
</P>
<P>
   The selloff came as huge amounts of new money were pouring into
technology specialty funds; in the past, such surges have sometimes
signaled sector tops. Already this year, net cash flows into such
funds have surpassed $5.4 billion, with a record $1.6 billion
flowing in during the first three weeks of April, according to AMG
Data Services, a research firm in Arcata, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks may continue to surge. But Stolper said the
Monday selloff should remind investors of the sector's risks, ``If
you want to be there, you better take motion-sickness pills,'' he
said. ``This volatility isn't going to stop.''

SURVIVORS OF NATO ATTACK ON SERB TV HEADQUARTERS: LUCK, PLUCK AND
RESOLVE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ After surviving a NATO missile attack
that hit Serb state television headquarters early Friday morning,
an anchor, Zeljko Pantelic, said that he felt reborn, but not
converted.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:10 a.m., he was at the station when the missiles struck in
an attempt to silence the voice of the Yugoslav government.
Pantelic and 10 other journalists heard two explosions, one after
the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything crashed,'' he said. ``There was no way out. There
was smoke everywhere. It was terrible. People were screaming. It
was like a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 people died in the explosion, a Cabinet minister,
Goran Matic, said, and perhaps an additional 20 were missing Friday
evening, presumably buried in the rubble. Eighteen people were
badly injured and remain hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m., six hours after the missiles knocked Radio Television
Serbia off the air, the service returned, transmitting from an
alternative site prepared long ago. But emergency workers continued
their search for survivors and the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very lucky,'' Pantelic said. ``Yesterday I was born
again.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was unconvinced by the rationale for such
destruction. ``This bombing must stop now,'' he said. ``All our
people, Serbs and ethnic Albanians, now think, `Stop bombing right
now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Djuricic, 25, a sound man, was editing the news when he
heard a ``huge detonation, and everything went completely dark.''
Eight people were with him, he said Friday in the hospital where he
is being treated for wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky,'' Djuricic said. ``We tried to find an exit
with a cigarette lighter, and we finally managed to crawl outside
and get down over the rubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Svetlana Radosevic, a sports journalist for the station, was not
in the building, but she said five friends were believed to have
died there. ``If you think I lie,'' Ms. Radosevic said, ``you don't
have to kill me to prove I'm lying. I'm in shock. My workplace
doesn't exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene was an increasingly familiar one of smashed glass,
broken walls, twisted timbers, scorched paint and emotional
devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers shifted rubble in the rain, which cut gashes
through the layer of fine gray dust that seems to cover everything
after an explosion, as if spray painted.
</P>
<P>
   Passersby milled around in the park near St. Mark's Church,
overlooking the rear of the station.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish style entrance of the television station was ripped
away by the blasts, which seemed to hit the roof just under the
large girder tower that holds numerous satellite dishes. Although
the tower and blackened dishes remained, the control rooms and
studios underneath had simply disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and American officials defended the attack as an effort to
undermine the regime of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia,
which they described in unusually harsh terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb TV is as much a part of Milosevic's murder machine as his
military is,'' a spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth Bacon, said at
a a briefing in Washington. ``The media is one of the pillars of
Milosevic's power machine. It is right up there with security
forces and the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials said NATO was simply trying to destroy the
free marketplace of ideas and ensure that just one side's
``propaganda'' could be propagated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This attempt to dig out our eyes and cut off our ears so that
you will be exposed only to one side, to the factory of lies, will
not be successful,'' a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry , Nebojsa
Vujovic, said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new step to silence the truth, to monopolize the
situation and to sideline not only Yugoslav journalists, your
colleagues, but also yourselves,'' Vujovic said, noting that
foreign television journalists needed state television equipment to
file their reports.
</P>
<P>
   That is only partly true, however. The Serb authorities have
generally banned television companies from sending material through
their own equipment without censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini of Italy criticized the attack on
state television, saying, ``It is terrible, and I disapprove of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Serb journalist who is working for a Western agency
said he thought that NATO had crossed an ambiguous moral line.
``NATO began in a very precise, slow way, but now seems to have
lost the distinction between military and civilian targets and
aims,'' the journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one thinks of the content of Serb television, he added
tartly, the people who died were not responsible for creating, but
rather only for transmitting the work of others. ``The people who
were there were just doing their jobs, to eat and live,'' he said.
``They have no influence on the content or on Milosevic. I hate
Serb television.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first two years after the Tito regime fell apart, the
television operation tried to be a non-partisan outlet. But
Milosevic turned it back into an instrument of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are not Iraqis,'' he said. ``We can differentiate
between big lies and little ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Andjelko, 35, a factory worker from Rakovice, south of here,
echoed the argument and said, ``I want to change television here by
myself, not have it changed by American bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Another journalist who works for state television, and insisted
on anonymity, said that the editor in chief, Dragoljub Milanovic,
left on Thursday at 2 p.m. Despite NATO's warnings that the
television building was a target, Milanovic had made it very clear
to the night shift, the journalist said, that they would be
discharged if they did not report for work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a twist on the mood of general defiance, the main state
television news Friday night did not lead with the destruction of
its building. That report was in the 20th minute of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the first piece described the Serb government's
condemnation of the NATO attack 24 hours earlier, on an official
house of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire nation,'' the government said, ``is with our
president, Slobodan Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   How the government knows that with such precision was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs in random interviews have said they regard Milosevic
now, however much they may dislike or detest him, as the commander
in chief of a nation that is trying to protect its sovereignty in a
war against the most powerful nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on transmitters throughout Serbia have cut off
television reception in Kosovo and the northern province of
Vojvodina. NATO planes attacked at least three other transmitters
Friday, as well as additional bridges and electrical plants.
</P>
<P>
   Those targets, too, were described by NATO officials as an
integral part of the war effort, even though the electrical power
largely goes to civilians, who are also the main users of the
country's bridges.
</P>
<P>
   NATO appears to be trying to convince Milosevic of the need to
negotiate a peace settlement for Kosovo that will meet Western
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Bacon said of the Serb population, ``the broad
message is that they should put pressure on their leadership to end
this.''
</P>
<P>
   He made no suggestion, however, on how they should go about
that.

BOSNIA'S LOSS IS AN AMERICAN CITY'S GAIN

 (af)  
 By JOEL KOTKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ An unexpected side effect of the turmoil in the
Balkans has Steve Hrdlicka hopping.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, the Southern Commercial Bank branch on
Gravois Avenue, where Hrdlicka is a loan officer, was a forlorn
place, stuck in an aging neighborhood in a shrinking city. New
accounts were few, and the shuttered businesses along Gravois and
other once-bustling streets in the Bevo neighborhood of south St.
Louis suggested little hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed when a stream of new immigrants, largely
Bosnians leaving behind the ethnic conflicts in the former
Yugoslavia, began settling in this unlikely patch of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years ago when we opened this branch, we sat on our
hands most of the time _ we used to sleep quite a lot,'' recalled
Hrdlicka (pronounced HERD-lick-a), now 39, who grew up in
predominantly white, working-class south St. Louis, the
great-grandson of Czech immigrants. ``Then this place became a
rally place for Bosnians. They would come in and ask for a loan for
furniture. Then a car. Then it was a house, for themselves, their
cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely thanks to the Bosnian newcomers, who have developed a
reputation for hard work and thrift, Hrdlicka's branch has doubled
its deposits in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   For greater St. Louis, an unexpected opportunity for revival is
seen in the arrival of an estimated 15,000 Bosnian immigrants in
the 1990s _ a concentration second in size only to Chicago's _
along with smaller groups of newcomers from Mexico, Vietnam,
Ethiopia and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of story, of a critical mass of hard-working
immigrants revitalizing a sagging urban neighborhood, is a familiar
one in immigrant havens like New York or Houston. But it is big
news in St. Louis, which has largely been starved of fresh
immigration for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, new arrivals from Germany, Ireland, Italy and
Eastern Europe were building St. Louis into an industrial and
commercial metropolis to rival Chicago. But after World War II, the
city lost its appeal to ambitious newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1950, the population of the city has shriveled from
857,000 to roughly 350,000, proportionally the sharpest decline of
any major American city. The vast surrounding suburbs, home now to
roughly five times as many people, at first grew rapidly but have
since also ebbed. In the 1990s the region has lost 63,000 people to
other parts of the country and has ranked among the slowest-growing
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   One important reason is that domestic migration out of St. Louis
has not been balanced by immigration from abroad, as it has in New
York or Los Angeles. According to William H. Frey, a demographer at
the University of Michigan, the St. Louis metropolitan area, now
the nation's 18th largest, ranked just 35th in the number of
immigrants who settled there between 1990 and 1998, below much
smaller cities like Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The paucity of immigrants locked St. Louis into what Frey calls
a Rust Belt pattern of decay, which was easy to discern on the
south side, historically an immigrant district. Old brick
owner-occupied homes were gradually becoming rentals, and thriving
commercial districts were slowly being abandoned. Prices for homes,
stores, factory buildings and warehouses plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   But those depressed conditions have made possible the current
upsurge in Bosnian immigration, according to Ann Crosslin,
president of the International Institute of St. Louis, a nonprofit
group that aids refugees and promotes international cultural
programs in the city.
</P>
<P>
   She said the small first wave of refugees, in the early 1990s,
found housing costs so low _ a two-bedroom apartment in Bevo rents
for roughly $400 a month, and $50,000 buys a decent house _ that
the area soon attracted fellow Bosnians who had first landed in
other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Louis is seen as a cheap place to live,'' noted Jasna
Mruckovski, a refugee from Banja Luka, the Bosnian Serb capital,
who arrived in St. Louis in 1994. ``People come from California,
Chicago and Florida, where it's more expensive. Bosnians don't care
if they start by buying the smallest, ugliest house. At least they
feel they have something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mruckovski (pronounced muh-ruh-KOV-ski), 25, should know. By
day a translator in Southern Commercial's Bevo branch, she
moonlights as a real estate agent and has helped sell 33 homes in
the area over the last year, all but one to Bosnian buyers. In many
cases, she said, whole families including children pooled wages to
buy those homes.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of Bosnian immigrants to work hard at two or
even three jobs is becoming legendary among local employers. With
unemployment in the region only slightly over 3 percent,
opportunities abound. At Willert Home Products, a local maker of
mothballs and potpourri, a third of the 320 employees are
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to find employees with a good work ethic, and the
refugees are about the best,'' said W.D. Willert, president of the
company. ``We now have 12 nationalities here, and when we need more
workers we know the Bosnians will call their cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost no immigrants in the St. Louis area are on welfare. Of
the estimated 17,000 families receiving benefits through Aid to
Families with Dependent Children, the largest welfare program, just
40 are foreign-born, according to Ms. Crosslin.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other immigrant groups before them, the Bosnians will
probably have an increasing impact on their new home as business
owners. Bosnian immigrants have already started a trucking company
and dozens of Bosnian restaurants, shops and grocery stores,
Hrdlicka, the banker, said.
</P>
<P>
   One of these new entrepreneurs is Alem Boric, 27, who came here
from Sarajevo in 1995. He started as a laborer, first at a pipe
company and later at a battery maker. Using his savings, he opened
Europa Market last year, selling mainly Balkan specialties to local
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Boric (pronounced BOW-rick), who owned a casino in Sarajevo
and left only when Bosnian Serbs began shelling the city, has
bigger plans: video distribution and wholesaling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great place to start a business, because it's cheap
and there's a lot of opportunity,'' he said. ``St. Louis is also
going to be a great place to make a lot of money.'' &QL;

SOCIAL SECURITY STILL ON GOP AGENDA, SPEAKER SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Dennis Hastert insisted Friday that
Republicans still saw an opportunity to reach a bipartisan
agreement on shoring up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Denying a report in The New York Times on Friday that Republican
leaders in the House had abandoned efforts to deal with Social
Security before the next election, Hastert said he wanted to
encourage both Republicans and Democrats to come forward with ideas
and to find common ground that might lead to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that over time even more ideas emerge and make
their way into the public dialogue so that eventually a bipartisan
solution to strengthening Social Security can be found,'' Hastert,
R-Ill., said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article reported that Republicans in the House had
said that their leaders had decided not to push for passage of the
main piece of legislation drawn up within the party to deal with
Social Security. That bill is being completed by Rep. Bill Archer
of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Clay
Shaw Jr. of Florida, chairman of the Social Security subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who had spoken with the party's leadership said they
had been told that in recent polls, many more of those who felt
strongly about Social Security viewed the Republican approach
skeptically than favorably. The Republican approach is built around
private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans said they had also been told there was little
point in taking the political risk of voting for changes in a plan
that Democrats have long used to their political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday if Hastert was supporting the Archer-Shaw bill,
Pete Jeffries, a spokesman for the speaker, said, ``We are not
going to get locked into any one specific proposal at this time,''
and that Hastert wanted to encourage both Democrats and Republicans
to come forward with ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican leadership and President Clinton now appear
to agree that it is counterproductive to put forward competing,
detailed partisan plans, and that only through some sort of
bipartisan negotiation, perhaps out of public sight, is there any
chance of reaching a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and members of both parties on Capitol
Hill said the prospects for such a deal were dim, especially with
the 2000 elections drawing nearer, the war in the Balkans
distracting both parties and Social Security still expected to show
a surplus for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article also reported that Sen. William Roth, R-Del.,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, had told colleagues that
he did not intend to move Social Security legislation this year.
Assistants to two Republican senators on Roth's committee said they
had been told by their bosses that Roth had no intention of
bringing up Social Security legislation this year. But a
spokeswoman for Roth, Virginia Flynn, said Friday that Roth had not
made such statements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seized on the suggestion that Republicans might be
backing away from dealing with Social Security to call for further
efforts to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have proposed concrete steps to bolster Social Security and
offered time and again to work with Congress in a bipartisan way to
make the tough choices needed to secure the trust fund over the
long term,'' Clinton said. ``Republican leaders have yet to
consider my proposals or advance any of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while Republicans have endorsed only the general notion
of private accounts as the centerpiece of a redesigned Social
Security system, they have spent considerable time considering
Clinton's proposals, and have rejected them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Clinton's plan to bolster the retirement
system's finances through an accounting mechanism linked to
reducing the national debt was nothing more than a gimmick that
would still leave future generations of taxpayers on the hook for
benefit payments. And they said Clinton's proposal to allow the
Social Security trust fund to invest a portion of its reserves in
the stock market would amount to government meddling in private
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser, said, ``If
elements of the Republican leadership now want to put aside the
sniping and truly be constructive on finding bipartisan common
ground, the president said from the start that that's what he'd
like to engage in.''

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SETTLES WITH LAWYER IN BANK FRAUD CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The U.S. Department of Justice has reached a $500,000
settlement _ and could be liable for millions more _ in a case in
which a federal prosecutor and an FBI agent allegedly lied to grand
jurors to win indictments in a mammoth bank fraud case.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Paul Licata received the payment April 16,
three years after U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt acquitted him
and nine others of fraud and conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt found that prosecutors had lied and suppressed evidence
favorable to the defense during grand jury proceedings and after
the indictments were issued.
</P>
<P>
   Although documents state the settlement is not an admission of
guilt, the Justice Department could be vulnerable to malicious
prosecution claims by Licata's co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for at least one has sent a demand letter to the
Justice Department _ the required precursor to a civil lawsuit.
However, another attorney in the case said the statute of
limitations could thwart further action.
</P>
<P>
   Licata's 1997 civil lawsuit said Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia
Hyman lied and withheld exculpatory evidence from the grand jury,
then made at least 66 false statements in the resulting indictment.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agent Thomas Conlon allegedly made at least 10
misleading statements during his testimony. He even created the
impression he had extensive experience as a white-collar crime
investigator, when it was actually his first case, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been one of the most frightening experiences of my
life, seeing what goes on inside the grand jury proceedings,'' said
Leonard Simon, Licata's attorney. ``What she (Hyman) did in that
grand jury room, the hatchet job, was an abuse. She basically lied
to the grand jury and there is no protection against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon refused further comment, saying Licata fears that
statements to the media would result in government retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyman said she has been vilified for doing her job.
</P>
<P>
   An internal investigation by the Justice Department's Office of
Professional Responsibility not only found no wrongdoing, but
confirmed that she acted appropriately. Although internal
investigation findings are normally secret, Hyman said the Justice
Department may issue public findings because of the high-profile
nature of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents said Licata's legal expenses exceeded $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors and agents have been almost impervious to
claims of misconduct, because of the secrecy surrounding
investigations and grand jury proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But public outcry about the tactics of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr and claims by former FBI chemist Frederic Whitehurst
that FBI lab reports were altered to win convictions have raised
concerns that prosecutors and agents breach the boundaries of law
and ethics to justify long and costly investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department attorneys agreed to settle Licata's suit
after a three-day bench trial in December _ before U.S. District
Judge Lynn Hughes rendered a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy and malicious prosecution arose from the criminal
investigation of two failed banks: Memorial and Village Green
National.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had contended the banks were in danger of being
closed during the late 1980s and that 10 men schemed to conceal the
institutions' financial problems from regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Licata maintained that Hyman and Conlon assumed that criminal
activity was involved in the banks' demise, then tailored the
evidence and their remarks to the grand jury to fit that
perception.
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorneys united in asserting that the men had
merely devised an innovative _ and legitimate _ plan to keep the
banks viable.

COMCAST NOT PLANNING ON BIDDING WAR OVER MEDIAONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (rk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors who had hoped that the Comcast Corp. would touch off a
bidding war with a counter offer for Mediaone after Thursday
night's surprise bid from the AT&AMP;T Corp. may be be disappointed.
Comcast executives Friday privately told several Wall Street
executives that it was unlikely the company would sweeten its
initial offer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who had talked with the company did not completely rule
out the possibility that Comcast might yet team up with a
deep-pocket partner to raise the bidding. Friday the company and
its bankers, Salomon Smith Barney, were still exploring options.
</P>
<P>
   But any potential partner would need cash. AT&AMP;T's offer of
roughly $58 billion for Mediaone included about $20 billion in
cash, with the balance in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the offer 17 percent higher than Comcast's all-stock
bid, based on Thursday's closing prices, but it has a ``collar,'' a
guarantee that if the value of its stock drops, AT&AMP;T will cover up
to a 10 percent decline with additional cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect Comcast to counter-offer for the Mediaone
properties,'' said Fred Moran, who follows cable for ING Barings
Furman Selz. ``The AT&AMP;T offer not only represents almost a 20
percent premium to Comcast's offer but also comes with a
substantial cash portion and a collar to protect against downside
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Comcast would have trouble raising cash anywhere near AT&AMP;T's
level. It has roughly $4 billion in debt, against $987 million in
annual cash flow, according to estimates by Jessica Reif, who
follows the company for Merrill Lynch Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's fifth largest cable company, Comcast could raise
some cash by selling assets: it owns a total of about $6.3 billion
in shares of AT&AMP;T, NTLI, SprintPCS and At-Home. But those sales
would trigger heavy capital gains taxes, and would come nowhere
near the the $20 billion in cash AT&AMP;T is offering.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, top Comcast executives, hunkered down on conference
calls between its headquarters in Philadelphia and Salomon Smith
Barney in New York, did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has invested $1 billion in Comcast and could easily
put up more, perhaps by buying newly issued stock. But several
industry experts saw that scenario as unlikely. Besides, they
pointed out, Comcast would walk away from a failed offer, with a
$1.5 billion fee.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast's stock closed down 37.5 cents a share Friday, at
$65.8125. Mediaone's shares jumped $7.875, to $77.375, while AT&AMP;T
fell $3.375 to close at $53.375.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts warned Friday that Comcast stock would surely
be hurt if it raised its offer for Mediaone, since investors had
viewed its initial bid as a full price.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alan Gould, who follows cable for Gerard Klauer Mattison, said
Microsoft's goal when it put $1 billion into Comcast was to
accelerate the cable industry's deployment of high-speed data
services and to improve the chances that Windows CE, a
stripped-down version of its industry-standard operating system,
would be used in the next generation of cable set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft joins Comcast in a losing enhanced bid for
Mediaone, it could jeopardize its chances in the set-top box
market, which will be increasingly dominated by AT&AMP;T. Through its
ownership of Tele-Communications Inc., AT&AMP;T already has 10.7
million subscribers and passes some 18 million homes, and through
TCI's joint ventures with other cable companies, it reaches several
million more. A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has stipulated that no
single cable company may serve more than one third of the 95
million U.S. homes that can receive cable.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T completes the deal for Mediaone, it might pass that
level. Indeed, when AT&AMP;T announced the purchase of TCI last year,
AT&AMP;T's chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, boasted that his company was
gaining access to one third of all cable households, recalled Bruce
Leichtman, who follows AT&AMP;T for The Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is now saying that its purchase of Mediaone would reach 26
percent or 27 percent of homes able to receive cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have simply eliminated the joint ventures,'' Leichtman
said of deals with smaller cable providers like Falcon, Lenfest and
Cablevision . ``They are using the TCI numbers and the Mediaone
number _ about 8.5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T spokeswoman said the affiliates did not count for cable
regulatory measures since TCI did not own and operate them.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Comcast and its bankers and lawyers are tracking the
regulatory issues. But whether they could block the deal is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will certainly raise the eyebrows at the FCC,''
said Leichtman. ``It depends on how much the FCC wants to focus on
cable as opposed to the competition it creates in the phone market
and potentially in the data market.''
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, the appeal of the deal is the opportunity to offer
local telephone service over a large portion of the United States,
competing with the Baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   For Comcast, the AT&AMP;T bid appears to have destroyed a strategy
of becoming one of the three large cable companies along with
AT&AMP;T/TCI, and Time Warner. Comcast, which is controlled by the
Roberts family, has been competing with the Baby Bells to offer
high-speed access to the internet. In an ironic twist, it is doing
that by large-scale implementation of the At-Home cable modem
service, whose largest owner is now AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast could attempt to team up with another cable company, but
several industry experts said Friday that in the end, most cable
operators would probably prefer to strike deals with AT&AMP;T to
deliver local telephone services under the AT&AMP;T brand.

 &HT;    911 tapes reveal more of horrifying Littleton scene
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ With gunshots booming in the background, a
frightened teacher shouted for her students to take cover under the
library tables. ``He's right outside in the hall,'' the frantic
woman told a 911 police dispatcher in tapes of the Columbine High
School shooting rampage released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the tables, kids, heads under the table,'' she shouted,
her voice edged with terror. ``Oh, God. Oh, God ... I've got the
kids under the table here ... On the floor, everybody, stay on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The panic in her voice helped draw a stark new portrait of
Tuesday's horror, in which students Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan
Klebold, 17, gunned down 12 of their classmates and a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Police released the short excerpts from the four-hour ordeal as
their painstaking investigation continued. After completing 500
interviews with witnesses, about 150 investigators met Friday to
begin the laborious process of sorting through the information,
matching accounts and weighing the credibility of the sources.
</P>
<P>
   Police still wonder whether others might have helped the two
boys, either in preparing for the melee or by helping carry more
than a dozen home-made bombs into the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one, we've been hearing from the students there may
have been a third party,'' Jefferson County Sheriff's Sgt. Jim Parr
said.
</P>
<P>
   But police either don't have any individuals under suspicion, or
if they do, they haven't released that information, Parr said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have not yet reviewed images from the school's video
security cameras, which may shed light on the student accounts of
an additional accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to earlier reports, there were no cameras in the school
library, where much of the killing took place, sheriff's spokesman
Steve Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the first of many memorial services for the slain
students was held, with family and friends of 16-year-old John
Tomlin gathering at Foothills Baptist Church in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'd do anything for me, but we were going to my prom
and he said dancing was going to be so hard,'' said Tomlin's
girlfriend, Michelle Oetter. ``I miss him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin, who loved his pickup truck and did missionary work in
Mexico for his church, will be buried in his native Wisconsin. More
services are scheduled for the coming days, with a large public
memorial in Denver on Sunday. Vice President Al Gore plans to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy's impact continued to ripple across the country,
with schools in several states reporting bomb threats, hate calls
and other incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The national debate over what parents and educators can do to
stop future school violence intensified.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced an initiative that will bring more
police officers to schools. He also made $1.5 million available to
help Littleton schools and law enforcement agencies in the
aftermath of the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Mayor Wellington Webb called on the National Rifle
Association, the nation's largest gun lobby, to cancel its upcoming
meeting scheduled in the Colorado capital. The group had offered to
scale the meeting back from three days to one, but Webb said that
wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   He angrily dismissed NRA President Charlton Heston's comment
that the Columbine tragedy could have been avoided if armed guards
had been stationed outside the school. The mayor said the Hollywood
actor's statements didn't deserve the dignity of a response.
</P>
<P>
   A few more details emerged in reports about the shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Former friends describe Eric Harris as a shy preteen when he
lived in Plattsburgh, N.Y., in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to reports that Harris targeted athletes and
minorities in his shooting frenzy, ``That's not the kid I
remember,'' Mike Condo, who played Little League baseball with
Harris, told the Denver Post. ``His best friends back then were ...
an Asian kid ... and a black kid. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A Littleton girl who dated Harris four years ago said he and his
friends in the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' were hassled at school in the
past year by athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere they went, they were taunted and teased about how
they dressed, about being gay,'' Tiffany Typher said. ``You could
tell he'd get upset by it.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports that Harris was gay, but apparently
that reference was used as an insult by some students.
</P>
<P>
   Typher recalled that Harris behaved in a weird fashion when she
broke up with him. A mutual friend called her to his house, she
said, where he lay in the back yard with fake blood spattered
around him, as if he had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shook me up,'' she admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend told television reporters that Harris' life ``in
a shambles'' because he hadn't been accepted by any college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric wasn't very happy with everything that was going on in
his life,'' Pat McDuffee, 17, said on the ``Leeza'' talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have a girlfriend. I don't think he was getting
along with his parents. I think he just got fired from his job. His
life was pretty much in a shambles, and I think he conned Dylan
into going in with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The two boys worked together as cooks at the Blackjack Pizza
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Harris also reportedly wrote an essay for a psychology class
detailing a dream in which he and Klebold went on a shooting
rampage in their school.
</P>
<P>
   The essay was an eerie parallel to a video the two made for
another class, in which they used play guns to shoot other students
in the school hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had an older brother who was apparently a successful
athlete at Columbine and went on to college, friends said.
Psychologists say that growing up in the shadow of a successful
older sibling can be difficult on teen-agers. In fact, in at least
two of the other recent school tragedies, the shooters were less
successful younger brothers of popular siblings.
</P>
<P>
   School officials announced Friday that Columbine students would
finish their academic year at nearby Chatfield High School,
attending afternoon sessions after the Chatfield students have
departed.
</P>
<P>
   Classes will begin next Thursday, in what is certain to be an
emotional reunion for the shaken students and staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that it is very important that they are together,
that they are there to support each other,'' Jefferson County
Schools Superintendent Jane Hammond said.

   NASDAQ CONTINUES TO CLIMB ON STRONG EARNINGS REPORTS
</P>
<P>
   After setting a high Thursday, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index slid 1.97 points, to 1,356.85. The Dow Jones industrial
average dropped 37.51 points, to 10,689.67. The Nasdaq composite
index, which includes many computer companies, climbed 29.08
points, or 1.14 percent, to 2,590.69, capping its second-best
four-day gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   Computer shares rallied for a fourth day on optimism about
profits, while AT&AMP;T pulled the Dow Jones industrial average lower
on concern that the phone company's $58 billion bid for Mediaone
would hurt earnings. IBM soared over 200 before settling at 199},
up 5\. The computer maker gained $28 billion in market value this
week after reporting higher-than-expected profit and sales.
</P>
<P>
   CHOCK FULL O'NUTS SHARES ACQUIRED
</P>
<P>
   Three directors of Chock Full o'Nuts, including the 84-year-old
chairman, bought company stock in the months after they rejected an
unsolicited takeover offer from Sara Lee, but before that offer was
disclosed to the public. The suitor remains interested, however,
and this week disclosed that it had approached the company
recently, sending the stock up almost 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   MERCK PROFITS INCREASE 12 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter earnings at Merck &AMP; Co. jumped 12 percent, to $1.3
billion, on gains in the sale of key prescription products and
growth of its drug benefits business. Sales rose 24 percent, to
$7.5 billion.

<P>
   MERCEDES OPENS A PLANT IN BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler opened a factory to produce Mercedes-Benz cars
in Brazil. DaimlerChrysler, which already assembles Dodge pickup
trucks at a plant in southern Brazil, hopes to produce at least
25,000 A-Class compact cars in the first year at its $820 million
factory. If the Brazilian economy manages to grow next year,
company officials said they could almost triple annual output to
70,000 by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   DEBT-RELIEF PLAN IS NOT WORKING
</P>
<P>
   With the number of people living on under $1 a day likely to
reach 1.5 billion next year, five major industrialized powers _ the
United States, Canada, France, Germany and Britain _ have
acknowledged that a plan devised three years ago to forgive debts
of the poorest countries is not working well.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOROS DECLARES FINANCIAL CRISIS OVER
</P>
<P>
   Financier George Soros declared the global financial crisis over
and said that Brazil's $2-billion bond sale showed that the world's
financial markets had recovered after their recent turmoil.
Brazil's sale of five-year bonds marked the first time the country
tapped international capital markets since last April. The bonds
were priced on Thursday to yield 11.88 percent, 6.75 percentage
points more than United States Treasury securities of comparable
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   LOSSES AT JAPAN'S BROKERAGE FIRMS
</P>
<P>
   Japan's biggest brokerage firms reported huge losses for the
year. Nomura Securities cited a $3.3-billion loss on its overseas
bond trading and aid to an affiliate. Daiwa Securities, Japan's
second-biggest brokerage firm, and Nikko Securities also reported
losses for a third year, as they too wrote off bad loans at
financing affiliates and closed most of their overseas operations.

2 INDUSTRIES AT LOGGERHEADS OVER MAKING MUSIC PIRATE-PROOF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The recording industry and electronics
manufacturers are trying to hammer out a universal, pirate-proof
technology for distributing commercial music to a new generation of
portable digital music players. But the two sides are at such
loggerheads that it may not be possible for manufacturers to meet
the record industry's goal of getting authorized players onto store
shelves for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a losing proposition for the recording industry.
Several electronics manufacturers said they would ship players
anyway, without safeguards against illegal copying. And analysts
predict that with or without a secure standard, American consumers
will buy about 1 million of the devices, which enable users to
record music off their computers, largely from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As powerful computers and high-speed Internet connections become
common among consumers, the recording industry has seen direct
electronic distribution as a potent new market. But as with the
emergence of earlier products _ the video cassette recorder, audio
cassette decks and digital audiotape _ the entertainment industry
is concerned about losing sales because of unauthorized copying.
</P>
<P>
   Its fears have been realized with the emergence of a technology
called MP3, which packs a great deal of music into a relatively
small computer file but offers no protection against unauthorized
copying. Quickly spreading from college campuses to a broad base of
Internet users, MP3 has become something of a de facto standard for
distributing music, legally or otherwise, on the Internet. That
makes it the bane of the recording industry, which fears that
increasing numbers of computer users will copy their favorite CDs
to MP3 files and pass them out free online or transfer them to MP3
players that are already on the market.
</P>
<P>
   It was that fear that prompted the Recording Industry
Association of America, which represents the major music labels, to
launch a counteroffensive. Its Secure Digital Music Initiative is a
consortium of computer companies, electronics manufacturers and
major record labels formed to create a secure way to deliver music
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That is turning out to be a tricky quest. At a meeting last week
in Los Angeles, several participants said, it became clear that
consumer electronics companies were bent on developing a class of
portable music devices that would be free of restrictions and easy
to use, while the recording industry wanted a player that one
participant from the online industry described as a digital Fort
Knox.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the music consortium is to have these secure,
approved portable players in stores by Christmas, which means
giving electronics manufacturers specifications by June 30. Last
week, after their third meeting with record company
representatives, some manufacturers were already expressing
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   A number of issues divide the two industries, participants said.
Among the most contentious was whether the new devices should be
able to play not just music recorded with a new secure standard but
also recordings made with the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   While participants from both sides were interviewed for this
article, most refused to allow their names to be used, saying the
industry association has pressured them to keep details of the
negotiations from leaking.
</P>
<P>
   One consumer electronics industry executive involved in the
negotiations, alluding to the fee participants must pay the
industry association to be a part of the consortium, said: ``They
said, `Pay us $50,000 and present your proposal, and we'll get back
to you with something.' This isn't a democratic standards
organization. This is the music industry acting out of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The major labels deny that they are running scared and insist
that negotiations are running smoothly. Still, they find themselves
in uncharted territory as they struggle to restrict or supplant
MP3, which is already available to a mass market.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry has substantial leverage in the form of what
both sides refer to as ``content'' _ vast archives of music by most
of the century's best-known artists.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics manufacturers say they assume that once the major
record labels agree to release their music on the Internet, the
nascent market for digitally distributed music will increase
exponentially. By joining the consortium, they are hoping to temper
the music business' more restrictive proposals and come up with a
compromise that will be easy to sell to consumers. But at the same
time, they are impatient with what they see as an overly cautious
recording industry terrified of losing its lock on distribution.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Creative Labs, whose SoundBlaster card became a de
facto standard for computer audio in the early 1990s, is a
consortium member, but it is not sitting around waiting for a green
light from the recording industry. The company is well into
development of its own portable MP3 player, the Nomad, which it
plans to begin selling this summer. As for releasing a player by
Christmas that is compliant with the digital music initiative, the
company now says it is undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely interested,'' said Hock Leow, vice president
of Creative Labs' multimedia division. ``But it depends on how
difficult it is to implement their specification. If it's very hard
for consumers to use, or cost prohibitive, I don't think we'll
manufacture it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are areas where both sides feel compromise may be
possible. For example, on the MP3 front, one proposal is a sunset
model, which would result in players that would initially play
unprotected MP3 files but would stop playing them after some
agreed-upon time, perhaps 18 months. This plan assumes that future
formats _ with the wrapper of the new security standard around them
_ will supplant MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Another contentious issue is that the recording industry wants a
prohibition on microphone inputs. By connecting the audio output of
one digital device to the microphone input of another, commercial
recordings could be copied just as they are copied to cassette
tapes now, except that the digital copies would be closer in
quality to the originals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another issue in the negotiations is whether there should be
restrictions on computer users' access to the software that will
enable them to digitally encode, or record, music using the new
standard. Such software for the MP3 standard is freely available
and widely used.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, many members in both industries wonder aloud
whether anyone will comply with a secure standard if the rules for
using it are too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the digital music consortium, as an initiative of the
Recording Industry Association of America, is supported by the
major labels, but it does not control them. If a standard is
released, it does not necessarily follow that every major label
will comply. Those attending the meetings said that the most active
voice in the negotiations was Universal Seagram. The company is
expected to announce, in partnership with the BMG label and the
rights management company Intertrust, its own secure digital
distribution system, which could become an essential component of
the new standard. BMG is a unit of Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Sony has maintained a greater distance from the
talks, working with IBM on a separate digital music distribution
model. But unlike the owners of other major labels, Sony is also
one of the world's largest consumer electronics manufacturers and
holds lucrative patents on CD technology. The two other major
labels _ Time Warner and, particularly, EMI _ have been involved
more as onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   None of the labels would agree to provide a spokesman for this
article. For music consumers already familiar with the free MP3
format and the portable MP3 players already in stores, buying a
restricted player _ which could be more expensive than MP3 players
because of the additional security technology required _ might not
be a popular holiday choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the recording industry comfortable having a portable player
that's SDMI compliant yet can play an MP3 file that is not
secured?'' asked David Watkins, a consortium member and the Diamond
Multimedia executive who oversaw development of the Rio, the first
portable MP3 player. ``In an ideal world, no. Our belief is that
we'll come up with something that gives content owners a sense that
their rights are being protected, and labels will get their
compensation, yet consumers will be able to operate it without
requiring a Ph.D. But there's a long way to go before substantial
consensus is reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Diamond Multimedia is a friendly member of the music
initiative process, it has been enmeshed in a lawsuit filed by the
Recording Industry Association of America claiming that Diamond's
Rio is illegal because it violates copyright laws and encourages
music piracy. Last Thursday, a California appeals court heard the
industry association's appeal of a judge's refusal to issue a
preliminary injunction banning the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, members of the consumer electronics industry
say that the industry association's legal argument undermines the
digital music initiative process by asserting that all portable
players that extract music from computers are in violation of the
Audio Home Recording Act, a 1992 federal law enacted as digital
audiotape, or DAT recorders, were introduced to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when the cassette and DAT were introduced, the
industry embarked on similar antipiracy campaigns and initiatives.
The difference this time is that piracy is not the issue so much as
losing control over the distribution of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the SDMI arena says you should be able to take a
CD, put it in your computer in an SDMI-protected file format and
transfer it into a portable player,'' said Ron Moore, a lawyer for
Diamond Multimedia, referring to the digital music initiative. But
in the recording industry association's lawsuit, ``they say that
making a copy to your hard drive and then putting it into your
portable player is prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the industry association responded, ``It's not
about selective enforcement of the law, it's about trying to move
forward together on voluntary standards that are consistent with
copyright protection principles but also fair to the technology
industry.''

$41 MILLION AWARDED IN 1997 TRAFFIC PILE-UP 

</HEADLINE>

c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A jury awarded $41.2 million in damages Friday over a
deadly highway pileup and primarily blamed a construction company,
saying it failed to post adequate warnings that could have
prevented the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The British company, Balfour Beatty Construction, was found 75
percent liable for the Jan. 27, 1997, accident on Interstate 10 in
Chambers County that killed two Colorado men and caused brain
injury to their friend.
</P>
<P>
   The trio _ computer engineers and entrepreneurs _ were driving
to Houston to catch a flight home after watching the Super Bowl in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated for about 11/2 days before returning their
10-2 verdict in state district court.
</P>
<P>
   About $34 million was awarded to the brain-injured man, Stephen
Eugene Parkhouse, 32, of Highlands Ranch, Colo., co-founder of a
computer consulting company. The remainder of the award went to the
three men's families.
</P>
<P>
   The four-vehicle pileup killed Michael Scott Ragsdale, 32, of
Littleton and Michael George Devoy, 38, of Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might now ease their plight,'' said lead plaintiffs'
attorney Kevin Krist, who called the verdict one of the largest in
state history for only actual damages.
</P>
<P>
   Krist's father, Ronald, who helped represent the plaintiffs,
said the verdict sends a message that ``when taxpayers pay millions
of dollars for highway construction and the construction company
does not provide the safety measures it is required to provide, the
injured parties will be compensated.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury assessed the remaining 25 percent of the award against
Peter Reagan, driver of a tractor-trailer that plowed into the
men's rental minivan, and his employer, Luciano Refrigerated
Transport of Houma, La.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, of Eades, Tenn., was driving his 18-wheeler too fast for
the congested conditions, the jury said.

911 TAPES RELEASED AS POLICE CONTINUE INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct slug; no other changes)  (lh) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ ``The school's in a panic, and I'm in the
library,'' the teacher is desperately trying to explain to the
police dispatcher as she begs for help. ``I've got students down
...
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the table, kids!'' she says now, directing her attention
back to the students who, moments before, had been quietly studying
in the library at Columbine High School. ``Kids, under the table.
Kids, stay on the floor ... Oh, God. Oh, God _ kids, just stay
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher's frantic voice, heard as gunfire reverberates in
the background, was part of a tape recording made public by the
police on Friday of some of the emergency calls placed Tuesday as
two students began their lethal rampage through the school, in
which they killed 12 fellow students _ 10 of them in the library
from which the teacher placed her desperate phone call _ and one
teacher before turning the guns on themselves. The teacher on the
phone, whom police identified on Friday only by her first name,
Peggy, survived the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were made public as the police continued with dozens
of interviews aimed at finding out whether, as many investigators
here strongly believe, the two young men had help in preparing for
their attack or in bringing more than 30 home-made explosive
devices into the school. But while many of the killers' friends and
acquaintances have been questioned, no arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said on Friday that they believed the two,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, may have wandered through the school
after their initial attack in the library for up to an hour before
returning to that room to kill themselves. Some students had made
their escape while many others remained barricaded inside other
classrooms during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens, who toured the school Thursday night, said on
Friday that ``the devastation is difficult to exaggerate,'' and
said that many of the most haunting sights were the most ordinary
ones, from books left open on their desks to computers still
switched on.
</P>
<P>
   ``One young woman had been filling out an application to the
University of Denver,'' the governor said in an interview. ``Next
to it she had a to-do list. Monday was all checked off. She was
halfway through Tuesday. One of the items on the list was to write
her life story.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, the Jefferson County district
attorney, David Thomas, interrupted his briefings on the status of
the investigation to offer an emotional plea to reporters and the
nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to most of the families in this case, and they
said there has to be some meaning to this, this has to result in
something,'' Thomas said. ``These deaths cannot be in vain. We
can't walk away from here here and wait for the next incident to
occur and then go cover that incident and not learn from this.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 50, suggested that part of the problem was the easy
availability of guns in this country. ``The kinds of things that
were involved in this case were simply _ it was so simple to get
them,'' he said. ``Guns are everywhere. You can buy them on the
street. You can get them anywhere you want. You can steal them.
They're readily available. You can go to gun shows. You can have
your friends go to gun shows if you're underage. They're very easy
to acquire.''

LAKERS LOWER GREAT EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis is the first one to admit it: The Lakers are
no longer talking about, least of all expecting, a championship
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, the goal is still there. But the Lakers' sights are
set on a decidedly more realistic objective _ improving. It's been
Rambis' mantra for the last week, and he's standing by it. As for
the once-talked-about championship?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we started off the season with a team that had a
good chance to go to that level,'' he said. ``With all of the
changes that happened, I think the expectations of the team had to
change, because you have to go through an adjustment period of
getting all these new guys on the ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all the disruptions that we went through, it's just not
fair to stick the same expectations on the team that started the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony here, of course, is that those very ``disruptions'' _
the signing of Dennis Rodman, the firing of coach Del Harris, the
trade that brought Glen Rice _ were supposed to be moves that would
improve the Lakers' championship prospects. Now those same moves
are acknowledged as hindrances to reaching that goal.
</P>
<P>
   So with six games left in the regular season, the Lakers in
fifth place in the Western Conference and about to face the two
teams just ahead of them (San Antonio and Houston), Rambis
continues to preach that victories are of secondary importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in a state of growth and improvement. I don't know
why that's a hard thing to understand,'' he said. ``I'm not gonna
panic _ `Oh, we have to win a championship, therefore we have to be
playing perfect basketball by tomorrow.' I mean, you can't put that
type of pressure on a team to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the basketball games to me are not near as important
as improvement. The best example I can give is, if (the opponent's)
whole starting five goes out and we win the basketball game but we
play (poorly), that doesn't do us any good. So that's the way I
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The players have bought into the new mindset, painful as it may
be to lower their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard,'' Shaquille O'Neal admitted.
</P>
<P>
   And he hesitated when asked if the Lakers could still win a
championship this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we just have to get better. It's still too early,'' he
said. ``We just have to get better and play smart. We play like we
played the last couple games, no. But if we play smart, then
yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Rick Fox, out the last three games because of a
sore right knee, did not travel with the team to San Antonio on
Friday. He was sent to the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic for an
MRI. Results were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't certain if Fox would rejoin the team on this trip,
which ends Monday night in Houston.

911 TAPE   TELLS CHLLING TALE OF MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The horror inside Columbine High School came
chillingly to life Friday as authorities released a ``911'' tape in
which a faculty member pleads for help and tries desperately to
protect students in the library just before it became a killing
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, authorities said surveillance videos from a camera
near the school's cafeteria might help investigators determine
whether presumed killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had help in
their killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have said they doubted Harris and
Klebold alone could have hauled into the school four guns and more
than 30 bombs, ranging from homemade hand grenades to specially
rigged 20-pound propane tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said Friday in interviews they saw a third
gunman, and at least two media outlets reported that officials had
identified a third suspect. Authorities, however, continued to
maintain they have no evidence of co-conspirators and were still
reviewing the surveillance tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal authorities said one of the guns used in the
massacre was a semi-automatic pistol whose manufacture has been
banned by federal law. The gun is the TEC DC-9, a foot-long weapon
with magazines that can carry up to 32 cartridges. Though illegal
to manufacture, sales of existing weapons are legal.
</P>
<P>
   The other weapons used were two illegal sawed-off shotguns and a
9mm semiautomatic carbine, officials said. The same type of gun was
used in last year's Jonesboro, Ark., schoolyard massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Sheriff Steve Davis said federal authorities have traced
the pistol and the carbine to their original owners, but have not
tracked subsequent sales. No links have been found to the presumed
killers or their families. Tracking the shotguns will be more
difficult, he said, because they might have been manufactured as
long ago as the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``911'' tape, a faculty member identified only as Peggy
tells a dispatcher that an armed intruder is approaching the
library, and she and her students are hiding under tables. ``Oh
God, oh God, he's right outside!...I am on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you've the kids there?'' the dispatcher asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got every student in this library on the floor,'' she
says, her breaths growing short and her voice frantic as she calls
to the students: ``And you better stay on the floor!''
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher asks: ``Is there any way you can lock the
doors?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, smoke is coming from out there, and I'm a little ...,''
Peggy says. Just then, seven gunshots ring out. ``My God, the gun
is right outside the library door! ... I don't think I'm going to
go out there, OK. I've got three children, OK...''
</P>
<P>
   Dispatcher: ``We have paramedics and we have fire and we have
police en route.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape ends, but there was little question what happened
shortly thereafter. Ten of the 13 victims died in the library,
where witnesses say the gunmen first told athletes to stand up and
then targeted a black student, Isaiah Shoels, for execution. Harris
and Klebold also died in the library, apparently from
self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy, the faculty member, apparently suffered a shoulder
injury, either from flying glass or debris before the shooters
entered the library.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also released the tape of a 911 call from an
unidentified female student outside the school in which she asks
for help and describes a chaotic scene. ``Some girl is on the
ground. I think she's paralyzed,'' the girl says. ``People are
running out of the school like mad right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're out of the way of danger, aren't you?'' the dispatcher
asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe so, I don't know,'' she answers. Davis said the
young caller was uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators spent much of Friday meeting to review their
findings, sharing notes from the crime scene and more than 500
interviews with witnesses, victims' families, and others. More than
150 officers from local, state, and federal agencies remained on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Among the investigators in Littleton Friday were two Los Angeles
sheriff's deputies who were invited by local authorities to help
evaluate the response of Colorado SWAT teams. Those teams have
faced criticism over their decision Tuesday to wait until the
shooting inside the school stopped _ roughly an hour after it began
_ before entering in force. Officials here have defended their
tactics, noting that it was not a hostage situation and suggesting
that an ill-timed assault might have caused even more deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a second day of heavy wet snow, a steady stream of
mourners continued making their way to the school grounds,
traipsing through slushy, muddy patches of grass to place flowers,
leave a teddy bear, or pause to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Several visitors Friday cried when discussing reports that one
of the victims, 17-year-old Cassie Bernall, engaged in a brief,
tragic colloquy with her killer. He reportedly asked, ``Do you
believe in God,'' punctuating his question by pointing a gun at
her. She answered, ``Yes, I believe in God.'' He responded,
``Why?'' then shot her dead before she could respond.
</P>
<P>
   The Foothills Bible Church was packed with more than 900
mourners Friday as the first memorial service was held for one of
the victims, 16-year-old sophomore John Tomlin, whose beloved Chevy
pickup truck has become a shrine in the school parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   His deeply religious parents, a sister, and a brother sat in the
front pew, dressed in black and looking exhausted. A funeral for
Tomlin will be held in his native Wisconsin. ``In September, I
don't know why, I guess God just put it on my mind. I asked John,
if you died, where would you want to be buried? And he told me,
Wisconsin, of course, Mom,'' his mother told the mourners.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said Friday that Columbine would not reopen
before the end of the school year. Students will finish the
semester at Chatfield High School, where students have embraced
their crosstown rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, authorities released reports written on Harris and
Klebold upon their completion of an 11-month juvenile diversion
program. The two were required to undergo the program after being
charged with first-degree criminal trespass, theft, and criminal
mischief, for allegedly breaking into a car March 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, written just two months ago, were glowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in
life,'' an unidentified officer wrote of Harris. ``He is
intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he stays on
task and remains motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   The report on Klebold called him ``solid'' and ``motivated,''
adding: ``Dylan is a bright young man with a great deal of
potential. If he is able to tap his potential and become
self-motivated, he should do well in life.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the diversion program, both also were required to
perform 45 hours of community service, the details of which were
not disclosed. They also underwent regular testing for alcohol and
drugs. District Attorney Dave Thomas said he did not know the
results of those tests, but believed that their success in
completing the program indicated they tested clean.
</P>
<P>
   Harris also was required to undergo individual counseling; the
records were not clear on what mental health evaluations were
required for Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the officer who wrote the report is ``anguishing
over what happened here.'' Thomas declined to name him.
</P>
<P>
   Information from numerous media sources also shed new light on
their families and backgrounds. Klebold, who other students said
professed admiration for Adolph Hitler, was the great-grandson of a
Jewish philanthropist from Ohio, the late Leo Yassenoff. Klebold's
father, Thomas, 52, is a former geophysicist who runs a mortgage
management business. His wife, Susan, works for the Colorado
community-college system, helping disabled students.
</P>
<P>
   Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y. His
father, Wayne, was an Air Force pilot who now works in a
flight-safety business. His mother, Katherine, worked for a
catering company, according to court documents and media reports.
</P>
<P>
   In televised interviews Friday, members of the ``Trench Coat
Mafia,'' the outcast group to which Harris and Klebold belonged,
sought to distance themselves from the shootings and explain the
killers' actions. ``We were just a group of friends who hung out
like anyone else,'' said group member Joseph Stair. ``We received a
lot of persecution from the athletes in the school. I guess they
just got pushed too far.''

911 CALLS TELL OF TERROR IN HIGH SCHOOL 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ A frantic, breathless teacher tried to keep
students safe in a school library while calling 911 for help as two
other students door blasted classmates with gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God (deep breath). Oh, God. Kids, just stay down!'' the
teacher, identified only as Peggy, said while talking to emergency
dispatchers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County Sheriff's Department released Friday a
recording of the teacher's desperate call for help, along with
another 911 call and recordings of police radio transmissions
during the siege at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher was in the library at 11:20 a.m. Tuesday when Eric
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, stormed the school spraying
gunfire and igniting homemade bombs. They killed 12 students and a
faculty member, then fatally shot themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were found in the cafeteria and library
along with the bodies of Harris and Klebold, members of a clique
known as the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   As the emergency dispatch operator tried to calm the panicked
teacher, at least six gunshots were recorded in the background of
the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anyone been injured?'' the dispatcher asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes and the school is in a panic, and I'm in the library,
and I've got... (yelling at the students) Get down under the table,
kids! Heads under the tables!'' the teacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Recomposing herself, the teacher continued: ``Kids are screaming
and the teachers are, you know, trying to take control of things.
We need police here.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher assured her help was on the way and tried to get
a better description of who was shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who the student is,'' the teacher said. ``I was
on hall duty. I saw a gun. I said, `What's going on out there?' And
a kid that was probably from video production told me it's a joke.
And I said, `Well, I don't think that's a good idea,' and I went
walking outside to see what was going on. He turned the gun
straight at us and shot, and my God, the window went out. And the
kid standing there, I think he got hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher told the dispatcher the shooter was right outside
the library door and alarms were going off in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's smoke,'' she said. ``My God, smoke is, like, coming
into this room. I've got the kids under the table here. I don't
know what's going on in the rest of the building. I'm sure someone
must be calling 911 besides me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County officials said at 11:21 a.m. they received five
calls reporting an explosion in the area of the school located in
this suburban community southwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:25 a.m. a Columbine High School custodian told
Jefferson County officer Neil Gardner, who was on duty at the
school, that an explosion had occurred in the southwest parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 10 minutes, a number of callers, including the
teacher, clogged the county's emergency center lines.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher was able to give authorities a chilling account of
what was happening as the dispatcher tried to calm her fears while
asking for detailed descriptions to pass along to officers arriving
at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatcher: ``We need to know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher: ``OK. I am on the floor and I've got every student in
this library on the floor _ (shouts at students) You guys stay on
the floor!''
</P>
<P>
   Dispatcher: ``Is there any way you can lock the door?''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher: ``Smoke is coming in from out there, and I'm a (shot
goes off) little afraid (two more shots) the gun (three more shots)
is right outside the library door. I don't think I'm going to go
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds of the tape were inaudible, but the teacher
decided to try to get to the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to go to the door, just to the door,'' she said.
``OK, I've got the kids on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not release the rest of the teacher's call but
said she was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first calls emergency workers received was from a
Columbine student who reported a girl was hurt in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The student, who was not identified, calmly gave information
about where students were fleeing from the building. She told
dispatchers she did not see what happened, but saw students running
and went to the phone to call for help for the injured girl.
</P>
<P>
   The other recording released by the sheriff's department
contained a series of police radio transmissions, mostly officers
arriving at the location and seeing one of the gunmen in a trench
coat on the second floor of the school.
</P>
<P>
   It also contained Gardner's account of exchanging gunfire with
one of the suspects in a parking lot as the assault began, and the
dispatcher telling other officers that Gardner was under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was not wounded and apparently did not hit either of the
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a couple of shots off at the shooter,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   He later told the dispatcher, ``It's a big gun.`` &QL;

BELIEF IN GOD MAY HAVE COST STUDENT HER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ She walked into Columbine high school on
Tuesday morning, a promising student. She was carried out more then
24 hours later a Christian Martyr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe in God?'' one of the heavily armed gunman asked
the shy blonde girl reading her Bible in the library Tuesday
morning while her school was under siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I believe in God,'' she replied in a voice strong enought
to be heard by classmates cowering under nearby tables and desks.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman in the long black trenchcoat laughed. ``Why?'' he
asked mockingly. Then he raised his gun and shot and killed
17-year-old Cassie Bernall.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of the final moments of Cassie's life echo with the
history of early Christendom, when a profession of faith could be a
fatal act.
</P>
<P>
   Her story is being told and retold in the church basements rec
rooms and parish halls where so many of the young survivors of the
Columbine massacre have spent the last few days clinging to one
another and to their deep religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   In her death, Cassie has become both symbol and prophet, her
martyrdom seemingly foretold in a poem written after church
services last Sunday. It was discovered on her desk by her younger
brother, Chris, Tuesday night when it became clear that she would
not be coming home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now I have given up
</P>
<P>
   on everything else - I have found it
</P>
<P>
   to be the only way to really know
</P>
<P>
   Christ and to experience the
</P>
<P>
   mighty power that brought
</P>
<P>
   him back to life again, and to find
</P>
<P>
   out what it means to suffer and to
</P>
<P>
   die with him.
</P>
<P>
   So, whatever it takes
</P>
<P>
   I will be one who lives in the fresh
</P>
<P>
   newness of life of those who are
</P>
<P>
   alive from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than any other image from this scene of carnage _ more than
the flowers deep as the snow in Clement Park, more than the blue
and silver ribons on every lapel _ the most affecting is the sight
of strapping young men and gracious young women on their knees in
prayer everywhere one looks in this prairie suburb at the foothills
of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved Cassie and we will miss her, but we know she is in a
better place,'' said Ryan Long, who belongs to the youth group at
West Bolles Community Church, where Cassie Bernall was an active
member. ``She died for her faith.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Cassie's grandmother who first called the camera-shy
highschool junior a martyr, recalled Dave McPherson, the youth
group director. ``I was with the family Tuesday. They waited all
night, praying that she was hiding in a closet. When we first heard
from Crystal about Cassie's last words her grandmother said : ``My
God, my granddaughter was a martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal is Crystal Woodman, a youth group member who, with
Cassie, did outreach work among Denver's homeless population. She
was hiding with Cassie in the library during the rampage that
claimed the lives of 12 students, one teacher, and the two presumed
killers, Eric Harris 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, both Columbine
students. When she heard the exchange between the gunman and
Cassie, Crystal was certain of what she was witnessing: her friend
was laying down her life for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 200 members of the youth group at West Bolles Community
Church, 40 attended Columbine. Among them is a shared certainty
that God is using the shooting victums as a vehicle to spread a
message of faith. To that end, the teenagers are eager to speak
about the circumstances of Cassie's death in hopes of bombarding
the secular _ some might say godless _ media with a religious
interpretation of this week's tragic events. Some have even
appeared on MTV, which McPherson puts among the corrosive cultural
influences which contribute to the hardening of the hearts of so
many young people.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual life of so many of Columbine High's teenagers is
evident in the crosses they wear around their necks and the
bracelets asking WWJD (What would Jesus Do?) that they wear on
their wrists. Theirs is the largest school-based Bible club in the
school district.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not only the children who are finding solace in
religion. Cassie's parents, Misty and Brad Bernall, issued a
statement celebrating their daughters spritual courage. ``Cassie's
response does not suprise us. Cassie's life was rightly centered on
Jesus Christ.'' The Bernalls appealed to parents to become more
involved in the lives of their children. They urged teenagers to
find their way to church. ``Don't let my daughter's death be for
nothing. Make your stand, if you are not in a local church group,
try it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing pious or sanctimonious about the faith of these
teenagers. They are actively engaged in the world around them.
Cassie had told friends recently that she intended to cut her long
blonde hair so that her silky locks could be made into wigs for
children undergoing chemotherapy. At Cassie's funeral on Monday,
several pews will be filled with members of Victory Outreach, an
inner-city storefront church in one of Denver's roughest
neighborhoods. Cassie and her fiends shared dinner every few weeks
with the prostitutes and drug addicts who make up that
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   John and Stephen Cohen, brothers who also are members of the
youth group will sing a song for Cassie and the other fallen
students at her funeral. The boys said they had completed the
guitar music some time ago but had been waiting for inspiration for
the lyrics. They found it this week. The song is called:
``Columbine, Friend of Mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Duran, the pastor of Victory Outreach said that when he
heard Cassie had been slain he told McPherson, `` She graduated,
but we still have assignments to complete.''
</P>
<P>
   The last assignment Cassie completed on this earth was a reading
that was to have been discussed at a youth group meeting the night
she died. The book is called ``Seeking Peace.'' In a chapter
entitled ``No Life Without Death,'' the author quotes the Gospel of
John: ``Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it
remains only a single seed. But when it dies, it produces many
seeds.''

 &HT;    Pain of loss won't go away easily for slain teen's family,
friends
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The first picture in the photo montage was of
John and his little brother, Patrick, wearing blanket sleepers and
grinning at the camera. John was maybe 6 and Patrick, 4.
</P>
<P>
   They looked rosy-cheeked and ready for bed, the grins letting
whichever parent was holding the camera know they wouldn't make
going to bed easy that night.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years, John Robert Tomlin's grin hadn't changed much _ it
still was wide and generous and let people know that he was a nice
guy but he wouldn't make going to bed easy.
</P>
<P>
   The photo montage of John's life that flashed across screens in
the chapel of Foothills Bible Church on Friday morning was part of
his memorial service, the first of 12 that will be held over the
next week. He will be buried next week in Kenosha, Wis., where he
was born and lived until age 12.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin was one of 12 students murdered Tuesday morning at
Columbine High School. He was 16. The two boys who shot the 12
students _ Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris _ also died, apparently
from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. A teacher, Dave Sanders, was
killed in the attack as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was a 16-year-old killed simply because he went to school
Tuesday morning,'' said Rev. Bill Oudemolen, senior pastor at
Foothills Bible Church. ``Even though we know the facts, we may
never be able to make sense of this senseless slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday John's family and friends seemed weighed down by that
idea, that this may never make sense. They bent against the
persistent snow that fell all morning as they entered the church,
wiping their eyes and trying not to slip in the slush. Several men
attacked the snow on the sidewalks with a fervor that comes from
desperately needing to have something _ anything _ to do.
</P>
<P>
   The chapel filled quickly with friends from John's church youth
group, extended family members, people who knew him from school.
They sat close and touched each other often, needing the comfort of
human contact. A woman patrolled the aisles, handing out full boxes
of tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Before the family entered the chapel, Garth Brooks' song ``The
Dance'' played over the chapel's audio system, and people knew what
Brooks meant when he sang, ``For a moment, all the world was right,
how could I ever have known you'd say goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   John left so quickly they didn't hear him go, just heard the
echo of his leaving.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, John and Doreen, clung to each other as they
entered the chapel. Patrick trailed behind them, his young face
crumpled in grief, looking older than 14 in a black suit. John's
sister, Ashley, 11, carried a light brown teddy bear and sobbed.
Other people followed, including John's best friend, Brandon Sokol,
18, and girlfriend, Michelle Oetter, 18, who carried John's Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible symbolized what people said was John's absolute
devotion to God. Last summer he went on a mission trip to Juarez,
Mexico, to help build houses for the people there ``and after that
trip, and the Lord's working on him, John recommitted his life to
Jesus Christ,'' Oudemolen said. ``He told his friends he wanted to
dedicate his life to serving God.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Youngblood, one of John's good friends, said John was a
hard worker ``who set an example for me to get a job done right,''
he said. ``He was very courteous and thoughtful and always extended
a helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll never forget the first time I met him at (Arapahoe
Acres). The first thing he said to me was, 'Ford or Chevy?' I said
Ford, and I think he was ashamed of me,'' Youngblood added,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   John loved Chevys, particularly his _ a yellow-orange colored
truck, tough like an old junkyard dog. In honor of his friend and
the times they spent driving around to dealerships looking at
Chevys, Brandon wore a black baseball cap with a red Chevy insignia
on it to the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``John had a grin that you couldn't help smiling when you saw
him smiling,'' Michelle said. ``I thank God for allowing me to be
part of his life, and I'm grateful for how John's life and death
brought so many people together and to Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the service was over, the more than 600 people in
attendance filed past his family, hugging them, crying with them
and offering to do anything, anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't leave the church with answers _ nobody knows why
what happened did, why a 16-year-old with an I-won't-go-to-bed-easy
grin lost his life when the whole thing still stretched unwritten
before him, why the emptiness and hurt and heartsickness weren't
going away.
</P>
<P>
   But they knew their lives were better for having known John
Robert Tomlin, the boy who loved Chevys.

`THESE DEATHS CANNOT BE IN VAIN' 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Emotionally drained and admittedly troubled
by what he's seen this week, the district attorney here pleaded
Friday that the massacre at Columbine High School be used as a
spark for cultural changes in a country where violent crime
committed by children has become horrifyingly common.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to most of the families involved in this case, and
they've said there has to be some meaning to this,'' said Jefferson
County District Attorney Dave Thomas. ``This has to result in
something, and I guess that's what I'm trying to express today for
some of those families, is, these deaths cannot be in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't walk away from here and wait for the next incident to
occur, and then go cover that incident and not learn from this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we as Americans can't seize this moment I'm not sure what
else will wake us up. ... Fifteen people met their death on Tuesday
of this week in what I believe is one of the most tragic events in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my community ... to be remembered forever as the
place where that terrible tragedy occurred. I want it to be known
as a place where we started to change in this country.``
</P>
<P>
   Thomas carries a personal sense of loss over the Columbine
shootings. His two grown children attended Columbine High School,
and two of his staff members lost family members in the massacre.
Thomas had to walk into the carnage in the school library to help
identify the grandchild of one of his office investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent 26 years in the law enforcement profession, and I
have never experienced anything like this,'' said Thomas, who is
also a district attorney adviser on the Jon Benet Ramsey murder
case in which a young beauty pageant winner was found dead in her
home.
</P>
<P>
   He called the school shootings here one of the single most
tragic events in the nation's history and said it was a serious
commentary on American society. Thomas said he's been asking the
same questions others, particularly parents, have been asking about
factors that may have contributed to or bolstered the shooters'
violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think it's about is cultural change, frankly, and I
think it's a huge problem.``
</P>
<P>
   He said he was talking about a percentage of young people,
however small, who can commit violent acts without any empathy,
without any feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've seen some of these kids who can talk about blowing
somebody's head off without any feeling of what that means. That's
the kind of cultural change I'm talking about,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow we've allowed to grow within our communities some
people without feelings, with the ability to go into a school and
literally plan to destroy the entire building. I don't know if
that's difficult for you to grasp. That's very difficult for me to
grasp.``
</P>
<P>
   He asked for cooperation from the nation's news media, and
called for a locally generated cooperative effort between Littleton
and other communities which have been rocked by school shootings to
research solutions to school violence.

911 TAPES RELEASED AS POLICE CONTINUE INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for additions; graf 4 has been updated and graf 5 is now; 2nd
take is all new.)

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ ``The school's in a panic, and I'm in the
library,'' the teacher is desperately trying to explain to the
police dispatcher as she begs for help. ``I've got students down
...
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the table, kids!'' she says now, directing her attention
back to the students who, moments before, had been quietly studying
in the library at Columbine High School. ``Kids, under the table.
Kids, stay on the floor ... Oh, God. Oh, God _ kids, just stay
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher's frantic voice, heard as gunfire reverberates in
the background, was part of a tape recording made public by the
police on Friday of some of the emergency calls placed Tuesday as
two students began their lethal rampage through the school, in
which they killed 12 fellow students _ 10 of them in the library
from which the teacher placed her desperate phone call _ and one
teacher before turning the guns on themselves. The teacher on the
phone, whom police identified on Friday only by her first name,
Peggy, survived the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were made public as the police continued with dozens
of interviews on Friday aimed at finding out _ as many
investigators here strongly believe _ whether the two young men had
some kind of help in preparing for their attack or in bringing more
than 30 home-made explosive devices into the school.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. John Kiekbusch, of the Jefferson County Sheriff's office
said there were others involved who seemed to have had ``if not
direct participation, limited participation, knowledge'' related to
the two youths. Another Sheriff's Department official said Friday
night that investigators now had the names of a few ``possible
suspects,'' at least one of whom had not yet been located for
questioning. While many of the pair's friends and acquaintances
have been interviewed, so far no arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said on Friday that they believed the two,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, may have wandered through the school
after their initial attack in the library for up to an hour before
returning to that room to kill themselves. Some students had made
their escape while many others remained barricaded inside other
classrooms during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens, who toured the school Thursday night, said on
Friday that ``the devastation is difficult to exaggerate,'' and
said that many of the most haunting sights were the most ordinary
ones, from books left open on their desks to computers still
switched on.
</P>
<P>
   ``One young woman had been filling out an application to the
University of Denver,'' the governor said in an interview. ``Next
to it she had a to-do list. Monday was all checked off. She was
halfway through Tuesday. One of the items on the list was to write
her life story.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, the Jefferson County district
attorney, David Thomas, interrupted his briefings on the status of
the investigation to offer an emotional plea to reporters and the
nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to most of the families in this case, and they
said there has to be some meaning to this, this has to result in
something,'' Thomas said. ``These deaths cannot be in vain. We
can't walk away from here here and wait for the next incident to
occur and then go cover that incident and not learn from this.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 50, suggested that part of the problem was the easy
availability of guns in this country. ``The kinds of things that
were involved in this case were simply _ it was so simple to get
them,'' he said. ``Guns are everywhere. You can buy them on the
street. You can get them anywhere you want. You can steal them.
They're readily available. You can go to gun shows. You can have
your friends go to gun shows if you're underage. They're very easy
to acquire.''

   Patricia B. Holloway, who as chairwoman of the Jefferson County
Board of Commissioners is expected to help set up a gubernatorial
task force on school violence, said in an interview on Friday: ``We
have got to make parents responsible. Parents have got to start
communicating. They've got to take control. Some of these children
are so belligerent. They've been given free rein. Everyone's afraid
to stand up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Littleton, the first of more than a dozen memorial and
funeral services that this community will have to cope with took
place Friday morning, when John Robert Tomlin Jr., a 16-year-old
sophomore who was murdered in the library, was mourned by a crowd
of 500 people at Foothills Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend, Michelle Oetter, tried to speak at the service.
``He had a grin. You just couldn't help smiling when he smiled,''
she said. ``He treated me like I was the queen of the world. He
spent so much money driving back and forth to my house, but he told
me I was worth it.'' But then she broke down into deep, shaking
sobs and was helped away from the front of the church by two of
Tomlin's best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Bill Oudemolen addressed the family and friends of
Tomlin, telling them: ``A 16-year-old was killed simply because he
went to school in the morning. Kids are not supposed to kill kids.
Schools are supposed to be safe zones, not killing fields.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tomlin Sr., the dead boy's father, spoke briefly to
reporters afterward and conveyed this message: ``For the families
of the children who did this, we are praying for them. We feel no
hatred for them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the mourning continued, there was some news of recovery.
Mikai Hall, a junior wounded in the leg by a shotgun blasts,
appeared with his parents on Friday and spoke briefly at St.
Anthony Central Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know that I am going to get better,'' said
Hall. Expressing bewilderment at the incident, he said of Klebold,
one of the perpetrators who killed himself: ``Dylan was in French
class of mine. Dylan, I thought he was an all-right guy. I worked
with him sometimes. He is not the kind of person he is being
portrayed as. He was a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering an account that paralleled that of the audiotapes made
public, Hall said: ``I remember a teacher running into the library
screaming that some kids had guns, so everyone got under their
desks pretty quick. A few minutes after that, two people came in
and started shooting. They fired a number of shots, and one hit me
and I laid on the ground. They moved towards me. That's all I can
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   County officials released the tapes in part to address questions
raised by students, parents and reporters about whether the
building could have been secured any earlier, possibly leading to
earlier rescues of students who lay grievously wounded inside.
Police officials have resolutely defended their response to the
incident, saying they surrounded the building but held off entering
for fear that they might have set off a new gunfight that could
have led to even more deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes came with a timeline indicating that first sheriff's
deputies on the scene were there within three minutes of the first
emergency call.
</P>
<P>
   They were responding to a call from an unidentified student who
said she believed there was someone with a gun loose in the school.
``I just saw everyone running out,'' she said on the tape. ``People
are running out of the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the call from the teacher, who said there were two
gunmen. ``I do not know them,'' she said, her voice rising in fear.
``He turned the gun straight at him ... and I think he got hit in
the right shoulder. Oh, God! Oh, God.!''

NFL BACKS DEAL FOR $250M STADIUM AT FOXBOROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Going on offense in their drive to keep the New
England Patriots in Massachusetts, National Football League
officials met with Beacon Hill leaders Friday to negotiate a plan
for a new Foxborough stadium that they hope will make it past the
tough fiscal defense of House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for the state to provide about $75 million in
infrastructure improvements along Route 1 but no public money for
the facility itself, people close to the talks said. In return, New
England Patriots owner Robert Kraft would build a $250 million
open-air stadium, partially funded with a loan from the league that
would be backed by sales of luxury seats.
</P>
<P>
   NFL negotiators also discussed whether an easement could be
granted on land Kraft owns around the existing Foxboro Stadium,
allowing the state to make infrastructure improvements on private
property, those familiar with the preliminary plan said.
</P>
<P>
   The league, worried about the loss of broadcast revenues, wants
to keep the Patriots in the Boston television market, the nation's
sixth largest, by offering Kraft an alternative to his planned move
to Hartford, which ranks just 27th in viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Its plan for a new Patriots home in Foxborough is similar to a
bill approved last year by the Senate, with one key difference: It
does not call for the use of public money to buy land around
Foxboro. The Senate included that provision a year ago to get
around restrictions against using public money to make improvements
to a privately owned site.
</P>
<P>
   But that Senate bill was rejected by House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran, prompting Kraft to enter talks with Connecticut. The
Nutmeg State, eager to lure an NFL franchise, agreed to build a
$374 million stadium in Hartford, the plushest deal to date for a
team owner.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, working with a group of Boston civic leaders, has
gained yardage in formulating a stadium pitch acceptable to
legislators. Kraft has refused to comment; he is restricted by his
Connecticut deal from negotiating with other states.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still not known whether Finneran would approve $75
million in taxpayer funds to improve roads, lighting, and other
infrastructure in Foxborough. His final offer last year was $57
million for such work. The Senate plan would have provided $52
million for infrastructure and $20 million for land, which Kraft
would have leased back and on which the state would have built
access ramps to the stadium for luxury box owners.
</P>
<P>
   At a State House press conference late Friday after meeting with
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue for nearly an hour, Finneran said
he would not discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to conduct negotiations or discussions
(publicly) . . . on this new chapter,'' Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tagliabue clearly went to Finneran's office in search of
finding a middle ground. Even Governor Paul Cellucci conceded that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a bill that would provide necessary
infrastructure. It would go a little bit beyond that, but we're
trying to respond to the speaker's principles,'' Cellucci said
after a 25-minute discussion in his office with Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner left the governor's office and met with Senate
Ways and Means chairman Mark Montigny for about half an hour.
Tagliabue later huddled with Finneran, devoting nearly an hour the
talks behind closed doors. The speaker and NFL executives have
tentatively agreed to confer again next week to solidify a
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, who was a political science major in college, emerged
from his meeting with Finneran deferential and vague about any
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a series of very constructive meetings dealing with
a novel subject here. We indicated a strong willingness to be
respectful to the speaker's concerns,'' Tagliabue said. ``Our
differences are being narrowed.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's day began at an informal meeting with the
Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce's executive committee.
BankBoston Corp.'s chief executive, Charles Gifford _ a close
friend of Kraft and chairman of the chamber's board _ hosted the
event.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen of the city's business leaders listened to
Paul Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman, as he
explained why he was spearheading the effort to keep the team. They
also heard from Reverend J. Donald Monan, Boston College's
chancellor, who gave a mini-history lesson on Boston's civic
divisiveness. And they listened to Tagliabue, who said league
financing would depend on corporate sponsorship and luxury seating
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said he received unanimous support from the room, but
joked about not having draft cards with him to close on any luxury
suit sales. Tagliabue also said that the Hartford stadium deal is
still the team's ``first option'' but a facility in Greater Boston
would be ``optimal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to develop an alternative'' to Hartford, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The league wants to have a proposal together by May 2 when Kraft
must decide whether to continue pursuing a Hartford deal. The NFL
recently passed a new rule that would allow it to finance at least
one third of the privately funded portion of a major-market stadium
through a loan _ as long as the public sector contributes to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Kraft would abandon the lucrative Connecticut deal for a
stadium he would effectively pay to build in Foxborough -- or
Boston -- would largely be based on whether his heart is with
Massachusetts or the money.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Kraft is anxious about whether the goal of moving
the Patriots by 2002 is realistic because of the complexities of
clearing the contaminated site along the Connecticut River. The
date has already been pushed back from the initial target of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately the league has until the week of May 24, when the
NFL owners could vote on the Patriots move. As expected, the team
Friday filed with the league its application to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The team called the filing ``an extremely significant step
towards our goal of playing football in a new state-of-the-art
facility in Hartford beginning with the 2002 football season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were required to make the filing within 30 days of
an owners meeting in order to put the matter on their agenda. The
owners could postpone a vote, however.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Autumn Hettinger, 18, and her mother, Cheryl,
baked a cake Friday to celebrate Shakespeare's birthday, just as
Autumn had planned to do all along for her advanced-placement
English class. She wore her special English class famous writers
T-shirt that says Homer on the front and lists everyone from
Chaucer to Wordsworth on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Autumn is fighting to reclaim her senior year at Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night she joined a crowd of Columbine teachers and
students in shouting the school cheer and singing the school fight
song (``Fight on for CHS, for we will win over all the rest'') at a
rally at the West Bowles Community Church here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole feeling was that two gunmen took our school, and
we're going to take it back,'' Autumn said. The two gunmen, who
ended their bloody rampage by committing suicide, were two of her
classmates, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Autumn had had Dylan in
her second-period calculus class this semester, and Eric in
third-period philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Autumn and her fellow seniors would have been the first class to
graduate from a renovated and modernized Columbine, but now their
school, bullet-riddled and blood-stained, has been closed
indefinitely. The seniors learned Friday that they, along with
everyone else, will finish out the year at a neighboring high
school. But Autumn, who was on the pom squad her junior year,
declared: ``Columbine is more than just the name of our school.
It's our community. I'm still graduating from Columbine. I'm still
a senior.''
</P>
<P>
   Like seniors everywhere, the Columbine Class of '99 had waited a
long time for this year, when finally they would be on top at their
school, when they got some of the best teachers, when they could
get a space in the parking lot, when after all the hard work and
pushing to get into college they could finally kick back and cruise
toward graduation.
</P>
<P>
   They had already gotten their blue and silver class sweat
shirts, with the names of all 443 seniors, including Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold, on the back. They had danced the night away at
the prom on Saturday night, and played carnival games at the
traditional after-prom party in the gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   They had selected their class flower (tiger lily), the class
colors (yellow and purple) and the class song (``Time of Your
Life'' by Green Day). They had chosen the class mom, Cheryl Lucas,
an English teacher, and the class dad, Troy Manuello, who teaches
physics. They were looking forward to Class Day, May 21, when the
class mom and dad give inspirational speeches, and awards are
handed out for best smile, best hair, cutest couple, worst driver.
(Autumn had a hunch her friends had put her in for the Mario
Andretti award, though she says she does not speed in her 1989
Honda Civic.) They were counting down the days till May 22,
Graduation Day.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in the aftermath of the massacre that left 15 among
them dead, including the two gunmen and a teacher, the anticipation
of the final rituals of the waning senior year, the parties, the
yearbook signing, the graduation ceremony itself, the
postgraduation senior trip to Mexico, has given way to prayer
services and funerals, to a media encampment and daily updates on a
huge police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Haney, a senior who sings in the concert choir and was in
the choir room when the shooting began, was crying on Thursday as
she stood in the wet snow beside the memorial piles of flowers and
cards outside the high school with her mother, Teri Haney, and her
grandmother, Pat Brewster. She was mourning not only the dead but
the irrevocably altered collective history of her class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad,'' she said. ``Everything was going so great, but
now all anyone is going to remember is this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Haney said she and her daughter had had their own ritual
for marking the days left in the school year. ``She would call me
at work every Monday and say only five more Mondays till
graduation, only four more Mondays, only three more Mondays,'' said
Mrs. Haney, who handles tax reports in a mutual funds office.
</P>
<P>
   For Mindy, who will attend Harding University in Arkansas in the
fall, it had been a carefree time. ``I knew where I was going to
college,'' she said. ``I didn't have to worry about all that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her best friend, Janelle Behan, also a senior, and a
member of the concert choir, were planning a post-graduation road
trip to Arizona, Mindy's first to that state, to visit Janelle's
cousins. With the days flying past, Mindy still could hardly
believe she was a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always looked forward to being a senior,'' she said. ``It
always seemed like they were so cool. They just all stuck together,
and they were all friends, and they seemed so old. It seems so
weird that now we're seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   As they listened to her talk, Mindy's mother and grandmother
said they remembered their own senior years, Mrs. Haney's at
Arapahoe High School in Littleton 23 years ago, Mrs. Brewster's at
Will Rogers High School in Tulsa, Okla., 42 years ago. All these
years later, both women said, they remembered it as a perfect time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just make sure hers is still special,'' Mrs. Brewster
said, wrapping her arm around her granddaughter. A graduation
barbecue is in the works, with relatives coming from all over
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another senior, Dan Holsey, brought a bouquet of flowers to lay
on the sprawling memorial, soaked with rain and snow. ``I really
didn't get to finish my senior year,'' he said. ``Even if school
did start up again, I don't think I could go back in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan, a shy, polite 18-year-old who was shivering in the cold in
his short-sleeved shirt, said he had waited a long time to be a
senior. ``I feel like everyone's looking up to me,'' he said. He
said sometimes underclassmen left soda cans in the cafeteria. ``I
told them to clean up, you don't want our school looking trashy.''
</P>
<P>
   And after working hard all year, he was able to relax this
semester. His classes included video productions, psychology,
physics, international foods and bowling. Bowling? ``Yeah, it's a
class,'' Dan said with a sheepish smile.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead he was honoring was Lauren Townsend, a senior who
had been the captain of the volleyball team and a National Merit
Scholar and who, rumor had it, was bound to be class valedictorian.
Lauren was in Autumn Hettinger's advanced-placement English class,
and they had both been in the group that had gone to England in
March on the English class trip. Autumn's mother had gone along as
a chaperone. ``Lauren came to Windsor Castle with my mom and me,''
said Autumn, who will attend the University of Colorado at Boulder
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to remember Windsor Castle, she said, and all the
other highlights from her senior year: the boys' and girls' soccer
teams going to the state finals, the school play, ``Oklahoma,'' the
prom. ``I wore a black dress with spaghetti straps and a train,''
Autumn said. ``We had a limo. I felt like a princess.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as anyone knows, graduation is still scheduled for May 22
in the usual place, the Fiddlers Green amphitheater. ``We don't
want Columbine to be remembered for the massacre,'' Autumn said.
``We want to be remembered for how we stuck together. We want to be
remembered for the love we have for each other.''

COPYCAT THREATS LEAD TO SWIFT RESPONSES ACROSS U.S .
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Md., Pa., Wash., Calif., Texas, N.Y., Conn.)  (With COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A wave of copycat threats of violence prompted by the Tuesday
massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., led school
and law-enforcement officials across the country to respond quickly
to any new sign of trouble, even if the threats were pranks brought
on by a dose of youthful spring fever.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of students were suspended, some for wearing black trench
coats like those worn by the two Columbine seniors who killed a
dozen classmates and a teacher before turning their guns on
themselves. Others were arrested for more serious offenses, such as
calling in bomb threats to force the closing of schools, carrying
guns and threatening students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The trench coat issue became so sensitive in Colorado that
officials banned students from wearing them in schools in Denver
and most other districts amid fears that the coats could help
conceal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In Cherry Hill, N.J., three teen-agers who wore black trench
coats to school, then stood in the hallway pantomiming gunfire,
were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take tough discipline against anyone showing bad
judgment, serious or not,'' said Morton Sherman, the superintendent
of schools in Cherry Hill.
</P>
<P>
   At numerous other high schools, gestures and threats related to
the Colorado massacre have been far more serious.
</P>
<P>
   A high school in Laurel, Md., a Washington-area suburb, sent
home 2,000 students Friday morning after a note was found in the
boys' restroom saying there was a bomb in the building, Reuters
reported. No bomb was found.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency
reported 19 bomb threats at schools in 17 counties, The Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating these copycat threats can be difficult, said David
Walsh, director of the National Institute on Media and the Family
in Minneapolis. ``It's a challenge to walk the middle line and not
go to the extreme so that every kid who wears a black jacket
becomes a suspect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some threats, however, are clearly serious and have been quickly
prosecuted by law-enforcement officials. In south-central
Washington state, a 14-year-old high school student in Prosser was
arrested for threatening to blow up the high school there.
Investigators said the boy told another student that he ``would
like to position anti-personnel mines in every class, set them off
simultaneously and kill everyone in the school,'' according to
documents filed Thursday in Benton County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   In Spotswood, N.J., an 18-year-old senior, Russell Saul, was
being held on $10,000 bail at the Middlesex County Adult Correction
Center Friday after threatening to blow up the Spotswood High
School. He was arrested Tuesday after he told a teacher in a rage
that he wanted to kill her and another teacher and blow up the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials in Palmdale, Calif., reported the
arrest of two students who said they were members of a trench coat
mafia, threatened a fellow student and talked about making a bomb.
The Palmdale police said that one of the suspects was said to have
told a girl that he thought the Littleton attack was funny. ``He
told her that if he ever began to act crazy like the two killers in
Colorado, she would be the first he would kill,'' said Palmdale
Deputy Sheriff Steve Owen.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesquite, Texas, outside Dallas, a seventh-grade girl was
suspended after she is said to have shown classmates a list of
names of 35 students she wished were dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, what happened in Colorado has caused every district
to re-examine the way they handle possible threats and security
issues,'' said Ian Halper, spokesman for the Mesquite Independent
School District. ``Things that previously were taken lightly or
ignored will now be re-examined.''
</P>
<P>
   In Yonkers, N.Y., a 16-year-old boy was arrested for bringing a
gun to Gorton High School, and two of his classmates were accused
of helping him hide the gun.
</P>
<P>
   In Waterbury, Conn., four boys were arrested for making two fake
bomb threats in the North End Middle School, using a classmate's
cellular phone. State police said a 911 operator heard what sounded
like children laughing in the background. The school was closed for
half a day while police conducted a search.

 &HT;    Youth minister hopes to offer grievers ``something solid,
tangible''
 &HT;    C. Patrick Cleary

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The sign on the office door simply said
Reach.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the calls were flooding in from as far away as Sydney,
Australia, London, England, Atwater, Calif., and Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The janitors Friday were in the adjacent gym, mopping the floor
in cadence with the religious rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   It's healing time in Littleton as a community turns full-tilt to
its churches to help bury its dead.
</P>
<P>
   The vigils and prayer services are becoming funerals and
memorial services.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's sermons will be about life ever after, forgiveness and
moving to a more spiritual level.
</P>
<P>
   The students and their families are flocking to the pews and
crisis rooms for at least some sort of temporary protection.
</P>
<P>
   At least one youth minister hopes it's happening across the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are running to the churches looking for hope and an
answer,'' said Jim Beckman, youth minister at St. Francis of
Cabrini Catholic Parish in Littleton. ``That is what motivates
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Four students in Beckman's Life Teen program died Tuesday. They
were Dan Mauser, 15; Matt Kechter, 16; Kelly Fleming, 16; and
Lauren Townsend, 18. A funeral for Mauser, Kechter and Fleming will
will be held at 5:15 p.m. Sunday evening, the mass offered by
Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want love and are looking for answers, I want to give
them something solid, something tangible,'' Beckman said.
``Otherwise, we miss an incredible opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckman, a youth minister for 15 years, said he hopes those who
lead youth nationwide will capture the opportunity presented by
circumstances such as the tragedy at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   With 700 members, Life Teen is one of the largest youth groups
among the Catholic community in the Denver diocese.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Francis parish has 7,000 members, with 40 new families
added to the parish roll each month. The youth group is connected
to 550 other youth groups in the Western United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many had been calling since Tuesday asking what they could do to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Beckman said members of his youth group started coming up to him
as soon as they could Tuesday, looking for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid said you have been telling us about this for a long
time,'' Beckman said. ``You have been telling us to get ready for a
mass conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Families must make their own choices about how they deal with
tragedy and where they find solace, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beckman's message for those who come his way is one of a God who
meets a person exactly where that person is at and makes them
comfortable in that place.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the Columbine High School students who need
comfort right now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beckman has already organized efforts to print 2,500 T-shirts
for distribution, to students, faculty and staff to wear, if they
choose, on the first day back in class.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts say: ``We survived. We will prevail. We have hope to
carry on.''

SLAIN TEEN'S LOVE OF CHEVY TRUCKS FONDLY RECALLED AT FUNERAL

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ His voice shaky, his eyes red and puffy,
Jacob Youngblood stood before hundreds of mourners Friday and
recalled the first time he met his friend John Tomlin, a victim of
the Columbine High School massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing he ever asked me was `Ford or Chevy?'''
Youngblood said. ``I said 'Ford,' and got myself on his bad side
for the rest of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a brief moment of poignant levity in an otherwise
profoundly sad tribute to the 16-year-old sophomore who was
remembered as a ``perfect son'' who loved Chevy trucks, country
music and God.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin will be buried in his native Wisconsin next week, but the
memorial service on Friday at the Foothills Bible Church where he
and his family worshipped was the first of many traumatic rituals
that will take place during the next few days as this community
begins burying its dead.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen people, including a popular teacher, were murdered
Tuesday when two students at the school assaulted the building with
semiautomatic weapons and homemade pipe bombs. After their rampage,
the two students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, committed suicide
in the school's library.
</P>
<P>
   While the music of Garth Brooks filled the church Friday,
Tomlin's parents, two siblings and extended family were led to
their seats to begin a service marked by tearful remembrances, a
strong sermon on the power of good over evil and the quiet sobbing
of those who had braved cold, snowy weather to pay their final
respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today in our country, today in our state, today in our
community, today in our church, families are grieving,'' said
Pastor Bill Oudemolen. ``They are grieving because a 16-year-old
was killed simply because he went to school Tuesday. Schools are
supposed to be safe zones _ not killing fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the lobby, on a table, lay the cherished artifacts of
a teen-age boy's life: His drawings of a hummingbird and a bass
taking a lure; 4 x 4 and Field &AMP; Stream magazines; a Green Bay
Packers jacket; a Chevy Racing Team cap; photographs of him with
his family and his girlfriend; and the familiar `cheesehead' hat of
a Packers fan.
</P>
<P>
   Inside between prayers and music, the life of John Robert
Tomlin, the son of John and Doreen Tomlin, the brother of Ashley
and Pat, was described through the words of those who loved him.
</P>
<P>
   They talked of his deep faith in God, of how he was ``the
perfect son.'' They described how last year he and his father had
traveled on a church mission to Juarez, Mexico, to build a house
for the poor. They showed pictures of him as a small child holding
his infant sister Ashley, now an 11-year-old at Bear Creek
Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend, Micelle Oetter, who attends nearby Ponderosa
High School, said through her tears there were no words to describe
what Tomlin meant to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would do anything in the world to make me smile and to make
me happy,'' she said. ``He treated me like I was the queen of the
world. He spent so much money driving back and forth to my house,
but he said I was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngblood said that after Tomlin forgave him for his choice of
vehicles, they became good friends. Tomlin, he said, was always
respectful and courteous, quick to extend his hand in greeting to
strangers, a boy whose goodness and faith in God assured him a
place in heaven, where he and all those he left behind would
ultimately be reunited.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, I'm on my way,'' Youngblood sobbed. ``You just beat me
there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the service, at which neither of them spoke, Tomlin's
deeply devout parents pointed to a decline in piety as a reason for
many of the problems in today's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are disintegrating, partly because prayer has been
removed from them,'' said Doreen Tomlin.

NFL BACKS DEAL FOR $250M STADIUM AT FOXBOROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects basis for market rank to broadcast revenues sted viewers;
a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Going on offense in their drive to keep the New
England Patriots in Massachusetts, National Football League
officials met with Beacon Hill leaders Friday to negotiate a plan
for a new Foxborough stadium that they hope will make it past the
tough fiscal defense of House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for the state to provide about $75 million in
infrastructure improvements along Route 1 but no public money for
the facility itself, people close to the talks said. In return, New
England Patriots owner Robert Kraft would build a $250 million
open-air stadium, partially funded with a loan from the league that
would be backed by sales of luxury seats.
</P>
<P>
   NFL negotiators also discussed whether an easement could be
granted on land Kraft owns around the existing Foxboro Stadium,
allowing the state to make infrastructure improvements on private
property, those familiar with the preliminary plan said.
</P>
<P>
   The league, worried about the loss of broadcast revenues, wants
to keep the Patriots in the Boston television market, the nation's
sixth largest, by offering Kraft an alternative to his planned move
to Hartford, which ranks just 27th in broadcast revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Its plan for a new Patriots home in Foxborough is similar to a
bill approved last year by the Senate, with one key difference: It
does not call for the use of public money to buy land around
Foxboro. The Senate included that provision a year ago to get
around restrictions against using public money to make improvements
to a privately owned site.
</P>
<P>
   But that Senate bill was rejected by House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran, prompting Kraft to enter talks with Connecticut. The
Nutmeg State, eager to lure an NFL franchise, agreed to build a
$374 million stadium in Hartford, the plushest deal to date for a
team owner.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, working with a group of Boston civic leaders, has
gained yardage in formulating a stadium pitch acceptable to
legislators. Kraft has refused to comment; he is restricted by his
Connecticut deal from negotiating with other states.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still not known whether Finneran would approve $75
million in taxpayer funds to improve roads, lighting, and other
infrastructure in Foxborough. His final offer last year was $57
million for such work. The Senate plan would have provided $52
million for infrastructure and $20 million for land, which Kraft
would have leased back and on which the state would have built
access ramps to the stadium for luxury box owners.
</P>
<P>
   At a State House press conference late Friday after meeting with
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue for nearly an hour, Finneran said
he would not discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to conduct negotiations or discussions
(publicly) . . . on this new chapter,'' Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tagliabue clearly went to Finneran's office in search of
finding a middle ground. Even Governor Paul Cellucci conceded that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a bill that would provide necessary
infrastructure. It would go a little bit beyond that, but we're
trying to respond to the speaker's principles,'' Cellucci said
after a 25-minute discussion in his office with Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner left the governor's office and met with Senate
Ways and Means chairman Mark Montigny for about half an hour.
Tagliabue later huddled with Finneran, devoting nearly an hour the
talks behind closed doors. The speaker and NFL executives have
tentatively agreed to confer again next week to solidify a
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, who was a political science major in college, emerged
from his meeting with Finneran deferential and vague about any
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a series of very constructive meetings dealing with
a novel subject here. We indicated a strong willingness to be
respectful to the speaker's concerns,'' Tagliabue said. ``Our
differences are being narrowed.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's day began at an informal meeting with the
Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce's executive committee.
BankBoston Corp.'s chief executive, Charles Gifford _ a close
friend of Kraft and chairman of the chamber's board _ hosted the
event.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen of the city's business leaders listened to
Paul Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman, as he
explained why he was spearheading the effort to keep the team. They
also heard from Reverend J. Donald Monan, Boston College's
chancellor, who gave a mini-history lesson on Boston's civic
divisiveness. And they listened to Tagliabue, who said league
financing would depend on corporate sponsorship and luxury seating
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said he received unanimous support from the room, but
joked about not having draft cards with him to close on any luxury
suit sales. Tagliabue also said that the Hartford stadium deal is
still the team's ``first option'' but a facility in Greater Boston
would be ``optimal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to develop an alternative'' to Hartford, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The league wants to have a proposal together by May 2 when Kraft
must decide whether to continue pursuing a Hartford deal. The NFL
recently passed a new rule that would allow it to finance at least
one third of the privately funded portion of a major-market stadium
through a loan _ as long as the public sector contributes to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Kraft would abandon the lucrative Connecticut deal for a
stadium he would effectively pay to build in Foxborough -- or
Boston -- would largely be based on whether his heart is with
Massachusetts or the money.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Kraft is anxious about whether the goal of moving
the Patriots by 2002 is realistic because of the complexities of
clearing the contaminated site along the Connecticut River. The
date has already been pushed back from the initial target of 2001.

<P>
   But ultimately the league has until the week of May 24, when the
NFL owners could vote on the Patriots move. As expected, the team
Friday filed with the league its application to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The team called the filing ``an extremely significant step
towards our goal of playing football in a new state-of-the-art
facility in Hartford beginning with the 2002 football season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were required to make the filing within 30 days of
an owners meeting in order to put the matter on their agenda. The
owners could postpone a vote, however.

`VISIONARY' KRAFT MIGHT JETTISON CONN. DEAL, TAGLIABUE SAYS

<P>
   BOSTON -- Who would walk away from a deal that over time is
guaranteed to be worth more than $1 billion _ and instead pay $250
million out of his own pocket?
</P>
<P>
   National Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Friday
he believed New England Patriots Robert Kraft would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine anyone even considering it, but I think
Bob Kraft is a visionary and so would be willing to,'' Tagliabue
said in an interview. ``He has a very deep loyalty to
Massachusetts, and a strong orientation to the league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if a sound alternative to Connecticut can be
developed, he would consider those loyalties, and in the long run
put Patriots fans and the league's interests over his own,''
Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue was in Boston to meet with political and business
leaders in a last-minute effort to develop a plan that could keep
the Patriots in Massachusetts rather than move to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics question whether the NFL and local business leaders
like national Democratic Party powerhouse Paul Kirk and advertising
executive John J. Connors can come up with an agreement that
satisfies House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran. But Tagliabue believes
it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's real momentum here. The league is not only researching
whether any realistic options for keeping the team in Massachusetts
exists, we are working to develop them,'' Tagliabue said.``And if
that happens, I think Massachusetts has a clear advantage over a
new venue in terms of its historic fan base.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue added: ``It's not a dollar-for-dollar proposition.
Massachusetts does not have to match Connecticut's offer. No one is
even talking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nutmeg State has agreed to provide the Patriots with a $374
million stadium package. But the deal, signed by Kraft and Conn.
Governor John Rowland earlier this year, is worth more. A lot more.
</P>
<P>
   To woo the Patriots to move from Foxborough to Hartford, Conn

NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS AGREE ON OIL EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the opening session of the NATO summit meeting
here on Friday, the 19 allied defense ministers agreed on a plan to
impose an oil embargo on Serbia by searching ships in the Adriatic
Sea suspected of carrying fuel for forces fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The defense ministers, acting after a three-hour session where
NATO leaders discussed the Kosovo war, also decided to order NATO
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, to carry out heavier airstrikes
against overland pipelines and railroads that carry fuel from the
ports of Montenegro to Serbia, a senior Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for carrying out the oil embargo were the most
definitive action taken at the summit which was designed to
celebrate 50 years of the alliance but which has been overshadowed
by the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the defense ministers said they would provide ships to
conduct the searches and inspections on the Adriatic, the Pentagon
official said. The effort would be intended to stop oil flowing
into the ports of Bar and Kotor Bay, on the coast of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   An oil embargo had been proposed by the United States, officials
said, after it became clear that as NATO was bombing Serbia's oil
storage and refining facilities, new oil was coming in.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing for an oil embargo against Serbia, Washington argued
that NATO needed to do more than strike the oil facilities of
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday that
``basically it didn't make a lot of sense for us to be bombing
refineries and at the same time not doing enough to prevent the
access of oil by sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are particularly focusing on oil because that is the way
that forces move around,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   But preventing oil getting to Serbia without hurting Montenegro,
the second republic in Yugoslavia which has been supportive of
NATO's war, makes the embargo difficult to impose, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how to stop the flow of oil into Montenegro
and to stop the flow out of Montenegro without hurting the
Montenegrins,'' a Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO will be careful not to hit oil storage facilities inside
Montenegro, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, NATO has been concerned as tankers
from Russia, Greece and Ukraine have docked at Montenegro ports and
unloaded oil.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's session, the leaders of the Western alliance spelled
out for the first time the conditions that Yugoslavia must accept
before the air strikes end, including a return of refugees to
Kosovo under the protection of an international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique, the 19 leaders said that if President Slobodan
Milosevic began to withdraw his forces from Kosovo according to a
set timetable, the alliance would deploy the international military
force and establish an ``international provisional administration''
in the province that would give Kosovo autonomy, but not
independence, from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO again laid out the five basic demands that it said
Milosevic must agree to before the air campaign is brought to a
halt: a ceasefire that is verifiable; withdrawal not just of the
military but also his police and para-military forces from Kosovo;
the stationing of an international military presence that would
have NATO at its core; the safe return of the ethnic Albanian
refugees and a willingness to work toward a political agreement
based on accords from the failed talks held in Rambouillet, France.
in February.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an endorsement of an international force, the
alliance pledged to seek a U.N. Security Council resolution
requiring the withdrawal of Serb forces. Both elements of the
proposal appeared aimed at drawing Russia into a diplomatic
solution.
</P>
<P>
   But also put in writing on Friday was a rejection of the recent
offers for settlement made by Milosevic. Without specifically
mentioning the latest proposal made on Thursday through Russia's
new Balkan envoy, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
communique said the Yugoslav leader's ``offers to date do not meet
this test.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO leaders' agreement on Kosovo set the stage for a
three-day summit whose celebrations of the alliance's 50th
anniversary have been considerably scaled back under the shadow of
the Balkan conflict. The ceremonial elements took a back seat to
day-long briefings on the military and economic strategies under
way as NATO keeps building pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-point communique was made public against a backdrop of
tough language. Phrases like ``resolve to see this challenge
through'' and declarations that ``NATO will prevail'' reverberated
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman, set a tone that combined
perseverance and defensiveness.``NATO has an obligation to
succeed,'' Shea said. ``We cannot afford to lose this one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a closed session of the 19 leaders, Clark, gave an upbeat
10-minute briefing on the status of the air campaign. He told them
that NATO had ``achieved air superiority at mid to high altitudes
throughout Yugoslavia,'' according to his spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   He then left to return to Brussels, Belgium, without meeting
with President Clinton. His spokeswoman said it was necessary for
him to return to his command.
</P>
<P>
   In public briefings by various NATO leaders, their ministers and
spokesmen invoked the idea of ground troops as they tried to send a
unified message _ the the notion of when and how they would enter
Kosovo was not addressed in the communique. Much of that talk
seemed aimed at Milosevic personally, since the leaders of the
alliance insist that the air campaign, in its 31st day, is
effective.
</P>
<P>
   But there was some discussion about ground troops at the closed
session, the Canadian defense minister, Art Eggleton, later said.
The talk focused on asking the military planners at NATO
headquarters to review all options, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their discussion followed a decision by NATO's Secretary
General, Javier Solana, two days ago _ at the request of the allies
_ to review all plans for sending ground troops to the region.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The British, who have been the most vocal on the subject of
ground troops, repeated on Friday that they envisioned a situation
in which troops could enter Kosovo after Serb forces had been
heavily punished and in which Milosevic had not given his consent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Prime Minister Tony Blair spent 2{ hours
with Clinton in a private dinner at the White House, trying to
convince him of the necessity of being prepared to send in troops
after Serbian forces had been severely weakened, British officials
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's defense chief, Gen. Charles Guthrie, repeated this
theme at a news conference. ``President Milosevic's war machine has
been seriously weakened,'' Guthrie said. ``It's going to be
weakened again, day after day, week after week. And we will be able
to choose our time'' about going into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were currently about 19,000 allied troops in
Macedonia and Albania and that more be sent in the coming weeks to
be ready ``to take the refugees back.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie said would not say how many troops would be needed for
the operation, although he offered a figure of more than the 30,000
proposed as a security force in Kosovo before the air attacks
began. The British officials emphasized that none of the allies
would agree to ground troops fighting their way into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about an invasion force,'' said British
Defense Minister George Robertson. ``Ground troops are fundamental
to the end game in Kosovo and they always have been. And that is
why Britain and other countries are now putting more forces into
the area because there will be a requirement for an international
military force to be in Kosovo after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Friday night that about 2,300 more
troops, accompanied by heavy armor, were being sent to Albania,
adding to the 3,000 American soldiers already there.
</P>
<P>
   The new troops were being dispatched with 15 tanks, 14 Bradley
armored vehicles, eight Howitzers and a company of soldiers armed
with anti tank weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany said on Friday
that the issue of ground troops had been taken off NATO's agenda
for now, a spokesman later said that Shroeder was only trying to
explain to the media that NATO intended to continue its current air
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate on ground troops is no longer on the table,'' he
was quoted as saying. ``There will be no change in the strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, national security adviser to Schroeder, said:
``What he said was that there is no reason to change the strategy.
You have to prove your steadiness. and I think that is exactly what
came out of today's discussion.''

 &HT;    Police release tape of frantic 911 call
 &HT;    Chris Barker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The shootings that left 15 dead at Columbine
High School snapped into horrifying focus Friday, as an audio tape
of a 911 call released by authorities revealed a scene of
panic-filled seconds before two students cut a bloody slaughter
through the school's library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the tables, get your heads under the table!'' screams a
teacher identified only as Peggy.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, six gunshots ring out in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-minute tape contains a recording of the teacher and a
female student who called for help from inside the building. Also,
several minutes of radio chatter between officers and dispatchers
details the first minutes after authorities arrived at the high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve students and a teacher were killed in the shooting on
Tuesday. Authorities believe two students, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold, carried out the rampage before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that others participated in the crime had not
been ruled out as of Friday. Authorities believe the two gunmen
might have had help carrying in several homemade bombs that were
used during the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one we've been hearing from the students that there
may have been a third party,'' said Sgt. Jim Parr, a Jefferson
County Sheriff's Office spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Rocky Mountain News reported Friday that one
Columbine student and the parent of another said they had been
questioned by police about a teen-ager suspected of lugging duffel
bags of bombs into the school and fleeing before the assault.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement source confirmed that police are seeking a
third suspect, the News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance tapes from the security cameras at the school may
show whether the two gunmen had accomplices, investigators said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the center of the slaughter _ the second-story library,
where nearly all of the dead were found _ had no cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally they would show the movement and also the actual
placement perhaps of some of the explosive devices, prior to the
incident,'' said Jefferson County sheriff's Lt. John Kiekbusch.
</P>
<P>
   They are time-lapse cameras, meaning they periodically take
pictures instead of running continuously. Each tape goes back about
a week. Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said the tapes have not yet
been viewed.
</P>
<P>
   While hundreds of students from all over the Denver area
continued to visit makeshift memorials to the dead in nearby
Clement Park, Jefferson County School District officials announced
that classes would begin in less than a week at neighboring
Chatfield High School.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 Columbine students will split schedules with
Chatfield students starting April 29, and school activities and
athletic events will be held as planned, said district
Superintendent Jane Hammond.
</P>
<P>
   All district schools will continue to have beefed-up security,
including additional supervision at all school entrances and events
like spring proms, Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking out for the first time, Columbine Principal Frank
DeAngelis recognized the sacrifice of Dave Sanders, the only
teacher who died.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders ran out of the teacher lounge to help students after he
heard gunshots, DeAngelis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his life, but saved the lives of hundreds of our
students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold had never been disciplined for any behavioral
problem at Columbine, DeAngelis said. He added that he had no
knowledge of a video the pair reportedly made in school that
depicted them shooting students.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 federal, state and local investigators exchanged
information on Friday, including material gathered over the course
of 500 interviews that have been conducted since the shooting,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb squads plan to begin the task of checking over 2000 student
lockers today.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings released Friday brought home the terror of
Tuesday's violence, which began shortly before the first 911 call
at about 11:25 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy, the teacher in the library, told the dispatcher that
students were screaming and said she saw a student with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went walking out to see what was going on,'' Peggy said.
``He turned the gun straight at us and shot and a guy at the window
went out. And the kid standing there, I think he got hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dispatchers in constant radio contact with the first officers at
the school documented a chaotic scene at Columbine. Students poured
out of the building as a deputy exchanged fire with a gunman
wearing a black trenchcoat and firing a large caliber gun, officers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Thomas, district attorney for the area that includes
Columbine, said the shooting should spark serious reflection about
American society. Columbine should be a benchmark for change, not
just another school shooting, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it to be known as a place where we started a change in
this country,'' he said.

TICKETS FOR `PHANTOM MENACE' WILL BE AVAILABLE WEEK BEFORE OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - Cancel those plans to camp out in line, at least
during the week before ``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace''
opens on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for ``Phantom Menace,'' the most anticipated movie since
``Gone With the Wind,'' will go on sale a week before its May 19
opening. Tickets will be available through theater box offices and
the MovieFone credit-card ticket service on May 12, beginning at
noon local time.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to sell advance tickets is a significant
concession by ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas and 20th Century
Fox, who asked a month ago for a ban on presales during for the
first two weeks of showings in order to discourage scalping.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an exhibition point of view, one week for advance sales
is a good compromise,'' said Richard Fay, president of AMC Film
Marketing. ``We're in the business of satisfying customers and this
goes a long way toward that goal. It makes our job a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The news is also good for dozens of hard-core fans who set up
camp in early April outside Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and
theaters in the Westwood Village section of Los Angeles so they
could be the first to buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater owners have agreed to make every reasonable effort to
first accommodate those fans already standing in line,'' Fox said
in a statement posted on the starwars.com site.
</P>
<P>
   MovieFone, which provides advance sales for more than 18,000 of
the nation's 34,000 screens, said that to discourage scalping it
would allow only two six-ticket transactions on a single credit
card within a one-week period. Theaters will also be required to
limit customers to 12 tickets per purchase, Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fox hopes theaters will not allow customers to make
multiple purchases within a short period although Fox executive Tom
Sherak acknowledged that enforcing that condition could be
problematical.
</P>
<P>
   MovieFone spokeswoman Christine Facundiny said the percentages
of tickets allocated for phone vs. box-office sales have not been
decided since contracts to play ``Phantom Menace'' won't be signed
until early May. Agreements over how many tickets MovieFone can
sell vary from theater to theater, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabedian, president of the Exhibitor Relations Co.
tracking service, said theater chains will welcome the decision to
allow advance sales. ``I'm sure they're happy because presales will
act as a pressure release valve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has said he expects ``Phantom Menace,'' the first new
``Star Wars'' film in 16 years, to gross $400 million domestically,
but some trackers believe it will beat ``Titanic's'' $600 million
record.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas and Fox have asked for unprecedented terms from theaters
before allowing them to screen ``Phantom Menace.'' Theaters will
have to guarantee that the film will play for at least eight weeks
in the building's largest auditorium, that trailers before the film
will be limited to a total of eight minutes and that the theater
will only get as little as 20 percent of the gross box office
revenue in the first weeks.!dlim! &UR; !end! &QL;

EUROPEAN GROUP CITES EVIDENCE OF WAR CRIMES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said Friday that it had collected testimony
and other evidence that Serbian paramilitary forces and bands of
armed civilians had raped, killed and mutilated ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   In its first official statement on the situation in Kosovo since
its observers were evacuated from the province on March 20, the
agency said that corroborating accounts and other evidence made the
testimonies highly credible. None of the evidence has been
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The statement released Friday was based on an internal report.
The organization's human rights staff members have been compiling
the evidence from hours of interviews with ethnic Albanian refugees
from Kosovo, who are now living in camps and villages in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The material, which covers events since March 20, will be made
available to the international War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague,
said Jorgen Grunnet, an organization spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
   The statement says ``displacement of ethnic Albanians'' is the
most prevalent violation of human rights that has been reported,
but it also lists killings, executions, rape, physical abuse,
intimidation, harassment, assaults, pillage, shelling, robbery and
the burning of houses. Reports of mutilation and sexual assaults of
the dead have also been recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The report said those interviewed identified those responsible
for the abuses as large groups of Yugoslav army and police forces
and groups of paramilitary forces or armed Serbian civilians. Many
referred to them as ``Arkan's men'' or ``Seselj's men.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkan, whose real name is Zeljko Raznatovic, heads a
paramilitary force known as the Tigers and has been indicted on
charges of war crimes by the tribunal in connection with his
previous activities in Bosnia. Vojislav Seselj is a Serbian deputy
prime minister and leader of the Radical Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``In several cases interviewees were able to give precise
descriptions of the uniforms and insignia worn by these groups,''
the statement said. ``A substantial number of perpetrators could be
identified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The interviews have been done in a very meticulous and
systematic way,'' the organization's spokesman said, adding that
some interviews took hours to complete. ``We are only saying what
we are absolutely certain about.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugee accounts painted ``a picture of total lawlessness and an
almost complete absence of any form of protection for ethnic
Albanians,'' the statement reads. The action would generally begin
with attacks from the Yugoslav army on civilians and their
property, and then be followed by operations by the police,
paramilitary forces and armed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often executions are reported as being done in front of family
members or villagers,'' it said. ``Sometimes the victims are
separated from the group and are later found dead or not accounted
for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of rapes of groups of women is increasing,'' it
continued. ``Other reports include torture, ill-treatment,
harassment, intimidation and use of groups of people as human
shields.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization also recorded many reports of mutilations and
maiming of victims. ``Reports include throat cutting, cutting out
of eyes, cutting off breast, nose, fingers, hands, and/or feet,
slicing of body parts, and carving of Serb nationalistic marks on
the chest, forehead or other parts of the body,'' the statement
said.

NFL BACKS DEAL FOR $250M STADIUM AT FOXBOROUGH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON -- Going on offense in their drive to keep the New
England Patriots in Massachusetts, National Football League
officials met with Beacon Hill leaders Friday to negotiate a plan
for a new Foxborough stadium that they hope will make it past the
tough fiscal defense of House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for the state to provide about $75 million in
infrastructure improvements along Route 1 but no public money for
the facility itself, people close to the talks said. In return, New
England Patriots owner Robert Kraft would build a $250 million
open-air stadium, partially funded with a loan from the league that
would be backed by sales of luxury seats.
</P>
<P>
   NFL negotiators also discussed whether an easement could be
granted on land Kraft owns around the existing Foxboro Stadium,
allowing the state to make infrastructure improvements on private
property, those familiar with the preliminary plan said.
</P>
<P>
   The league, worried about the loss of broadcast revenues, wants
to keep the Patriots in the Boston television market, the nation's
sixth largest, by offering Kraft an alternative to his planned move
to Hartford, which ranks just 27th in broadcast revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Its plan for a new Patriots home in Foxborough is similar to a
bill approved last year by the Senate, with one key difference: It
does not call for the use of public money to buy land around
Foxboro. The Senate included that provision a year ago to get
around restrictions against using public money to make improvements
to a privately owned site.
</P>
<P>
   But that Senate bill was rejected by House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran, prompting Kraft to enter talks with Connecticut. The
Nutmeg State, eager to lure an NFL franchise, agreed to build a
$374 million stadium in Hartford, the plushest deal to date for a
team owner.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, working with a group of Boston civic leaders, has
gained yardage in formulating a stadium pitch acceptable to
legislators. Kraft has refused to comment; he is restricted by his
Connecticut deal from negotiating with other states.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still not known whether Finneran would approve $75
million in taxpayer funds to improve roads, lighting, and other
infrastructure in Foxborough. His final offer last year was $57
million for such work. The Senate plan would have provided $52
million for infrastructure and $20 million for land, which Kraft
would have leased back and on which the state would have built
access ramps to the stadium for luxury box owners.
</P>
<P>
   At a State House press conference late Friday after meeting with
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue for nearly an hour, Finneran said
he would not discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to conduct negotiations or discussions
(publicly) . . . on this new chapter,'' Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tagliabue clearly went to Finneran's office in search of
finding a middle ground. Even Governor Paul Cellucci conceded that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a bill that would provide necessary
infrastructure. It would go a little bit beyond that, but we're
trying to respond to the speaker's principles,'' Cellucci said
after a 25-minute discussion in his office with Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner left the governor's office and met with Senate
Ways and Means chairman Mark Montigny for about half an hour.
Tagliabue later huddled with Finneran, devoting nearly an hour the
talks behind closed doors. The speaker and NFL executives have
tentatively agreed to confer again next week to solidify a
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, who was a political science major in college, emerged
from his meeting with Finneran deferential and vague about any
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a series of very constructive meetings dealing with
a novel subject here. We indicated a strong willingness to be
respectful to the speaker's concerns,'' Tagliabue said. ``Our
differences are being narrowed.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's day began at an informal meeting with the
Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce's executive committee.
BankBoston Corp.'s chief executive, Charles Gifford _ a close
friend of Kraft and chairman of the chamber's board _ hosted the
event.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen of the city's business leaders listened to
Paul Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman, as he
explained why he was spearheading the effort to keep the team. They
also heard from Reverend J. Donald Monan, Boston College's
chancellor, who gave a mini-history lesson on Boston's civic
divisiveness. And they listened to Tagliabue, who said league
financing would depend on corporate sponsorship and luxury seating
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said he received unanimous support from the room, but
joked about not having draft cards with him to close on any luxury
suit sales. Tagliabue also said that the Hartford stadium deal is
still the team's ``first option'' but a facility in Greater Boston
would be ``optimal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to develop an alternative'' to Hartford, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The league wants to have a proposal together by May 2 when Kraft
must decide whether to continue pursuing a Hartford deal. The NFL
recently passed a new rule that would allow it to finance at least
one third of the privately funded portion of a major-market stadium
through a loan _ as long as the public sector contributes to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Kraft would abandon the lucrative Connecticut deal for a
stadium he would effectively pay to build in Foxborough -- or
Boston -- would largely be based on whether his heart is with
Massachusetts or the money.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Kraft is anxious about whether the goal of moving
the Patriots by 2002 is realistic because of the complexities of
clearing the contaminated site along the Connecticut River. The
date has already been pushed back from the initial target of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately the league has until the week of May 24, when the
NFL owners could vote on the Patriots move. As expected, the team
Friday filed with the league its application to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The team called the filing ``an extremely significant step
towards our goal of playing football in a new state-of-the-art
facility in Hartford beginning with the 2002 football season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were required to make the filing within 30 days of
an owners meeting in order to put the matter on their agenda. The
owners could postpone a vote, however.

TICKETS FOR `PHANTOM MENACE' WILL BE AVAILABLE WEEK BEFORE OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - Cancel those plans to camp out in line, at least
during the week before ``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace''
opens on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for ``Phantom Menace,'' the most anticipated movie since
``Gone With the Wind,'' will go on sale a week before its May 19
opening. Tickets will be available through theater box offices and
the MovieFone credit-card ticket service on May 12, beginning at
noon local time.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to sell advance tickets is a significant
concession by ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas and 20th Century
Fox, who asked a month ago for a ban on presales during for the
first two weeks of showings in order to discourage scalping.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an exhibition point of view, one week for advance sales
is a good compromise,'' said Richard Fay, president of AMC Film
Marketing. ``We're in the business of satisfying customers and this
goes a long way toward that goal. It makes our job a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The news is also good for dozens of hard-core fans who set up
camp in early April outside Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and
theaters in the Westwood Village section of Los Angeles so they
could be the first to buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater owners have agreed to make every reasonable effort to
first accommodate those fans already standing in line,'' Fox said
in a statement posted on the starwars.com site.
</P>
<P>
   MovieFone, which provides advance sales for more than 18,000 of
the nation's 34,000 screens, said that to discourage scalping it
would allow only two six-ticket transactions on a single credit
card within a one-week period. Theaters will also be required to
limit customers to 12 tickets per purchase, Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fox hopes theaters will not allow customers to make
multiple purchases within a short period although Fox executive Tom
Sherak acknowledged that enforcing that condition could be
problematical.
</P>
<P>
   MovieFone spokeswoman Christine Facundiny said the percentages
of tickets allocated for phone vs. box-office sales have not been
decided since contracts to play ``Phantom Menace'' won't be signed
until early May. Agreements over how many tickets MovieFone can
sell vary from theater to theater, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabedian, president of the Exhibitor Relations Co.
tracking service, said theater chains will welcome the decision to
allow advance sales. ``I'm sure they're happy because presales will
act as a pressure release valve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has said he expects ``Phantom Menace,'' the first new
``Star Wars'' film in 16 years, to gross $400 million domestically,
but some trackers believe it will beat ``Titanic's'' $600 million
record.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas and Fox have asked for unprecedented terms from theaters
before allowing them to screen ``Phantom Menace.'' Theaters will
have to guarantee that the film will play for at least eight weeks
in the building's largest auditorium, that trailers before the film
will be limited to a total of eight minutes and that the theater
will only get as little as 20 percent of the gross box office
revenue in the first weeks.!dlim! &UR; !end! &QL;

`VISIONARY' KRAFT MIGHT JETTISON CONN. DEAL, TAGLIABUE SAYS

<P>
   BOSTON -- Who would walk away from a deal that over time is
guaranteed to be worth more than $1 billion _ and instead pay $250
million out of his own pocket?
</P>
<P>
   National Football League commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Friday
he believed New England Patriots Robert Kraft would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine anyone even considering it, but I think
Bob Kraft is a visionary and so would be willing to,'' Tagliabue
said in an interview. ``He has a very deep loyalty to
Massachusetts, and a strong orientation to the league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if a sound alternative to Connecticut can be
developed, he would consider those loyalties, and in the long run
put Patriots fans and the league's interests over his own,''
Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue was in Boston to meet with political and business
leaders in a last-minute effort to develop a plan that could keep
the Patriots in Massachusetts rather than move to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics question whether the NFL and local business leaders
like national Democratic Party powerhouse Paul Kirk and advertising
executive John J. Connors can come up with an agreement that
satisfies House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran. But Tagliabue believes
it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's real momentum here. The league is not only researching
whether any realistic options for keeping the team in Massachusetts
exists, we are working to develop them,'' Tagliabue said.``And if
that happens, I think Massachusetts has a clear advantage over a
new venue in terms of its historic fan base.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue added: ``It's not a dollar-for-dollar proposition.
Massachusetts does not have to match Connecticut's offer. No one is
even talking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nutmeg State has agreed to provide the Patriots with a $374
million stadium package. But the deal, signed by Kraft and Conn.
Governor John Rowland earlier this year, is worth more. A lot more.

911 CALLS TELL OF TERROR IN HIGH SCHOOL 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ A frantic, breathless teacher tried to keep
students safe in a school library while calling 911 for help as two
other students blasted classmates with gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God (deep breath). Oh, God. Kids, just stay down!'' the
teacher, identified only as Peggy, said while talking to emergency
dispatchers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County Sheriff's Department released Friday a
recording of the teacher's desperate call for help, along with
another 911 call and recordings of police radio transmissions
during the siege at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher was in the library at 11:20 a.m. Tuesday when Eric
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, stormed the school spraying
gunfire and igniting homemade bombs. They killed 12 students and a
faculty member, then fatally shot themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were found in the cafeteria and library
along with the bodies of Harris and Klebold, members of a clique
known as the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   As the emergency dispatch operator tried to calm the panicked
teacher, at least six gunshots were recorded in the background of
the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anyone been injured?'' the dispatcher asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes and the school is in a panic, and I'm in the library,
and I've got... (yelling at the students) Get down under the table,
kids! Heads under the tables!'' the teacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Recomposing herself, the teacher continued: ``Kids are screaming
and the teachers are, you know, trying to take control of things.
We need police here.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher assured her help was on the way and tried to get
a better description of who was shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who the student is,'' the teacher said. ``I was
on hall duty. I saw a gun. I said, `What's going on out there?' And
a kid that was probably from video production told me it's a joke.
And I said, `Well, I don't think that's a good idea,' and I went
walking outside to see what was going on. He turned the gun
straight at us and shot, and my God, the window went out. And the
kid standing there, I think he got hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher told the dispatcher the shooter was right outside
the library door and alarms were going off in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's smoke,'' she said. ``My God, smoke is, like, coming
into this room. I've got the kids under the table here. I don't
know what's going on in the rest of the building. I'm sure someone
must be calling 911 besides me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County officials said at 11:21 a.m. they received five
calls reporting an explosion in the area of the school located in
this suburban community southwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:25 a.m. a Columbine High School custodian told
Jefferson County officer Neil Gardner, who was on duty at the
school, that an explosion had occurred in the southwest parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 10 minutes, a number of callers, including the
teacher, clogged the county's emergency center lines.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher was able to give authorities a chilling account of
what was happening as the dispatcher tried to calm her fears while
asking for detailed descriptions to pass along to officers arriving
at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatcher: ``We need to know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher: ``OK. I am on the floor and I've got every student in
this library on the floor _ (shouts at students) You guys stay on
the floor!''
</P>
<P>
   Dispatcher: ``Is there any way you can lock the door?''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher: ``Smoke is coming in from out there, and I'm a (shot
goes off) little afraid (two more shots) the gun (three more shots)
is right outside the library door. I don't think I'm going to go
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds of the tape were inaudible, but the teacher
decided to try to get to the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to go to the door, just to the door,'' she said.
``OK, I've got the kids on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not release the rest of the teacher's call but
said she was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first calls emergency workers received was from a
Columbine student who reported a girl was hurt in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The student, who was not identified, calmly gave information
about where students were fleeing from the building. She told
dispatchers she did not see what happened, but saw students running
and went to the phone to call for help for the injured girl.
</P>
<P>
   The other recording released by the sheriff's department
contained a series of police radio transmissions, mostly officers
arriving at the location and seeing one of the gunmen in a trench
coat on the second floor of the school.
</P>
<P>
   It also contained Gardner's account of exchanging gunfire with
one of the suspects in a parking lot as the assault began, and the
dispatcher telling other officers that Gardner was under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was not wounded and apparently did not hit either of the
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a couple of shots off at the shooter,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   He later told the dispatcher, ``It's a big gun.`` &QL;

YUGOSLAVIA'S LOW FLIERS WAGE TREETOP AIR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Clarifies criticism in third graph, subs 8th graph.)  (jw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's growing armada of warplanes dominates the
skies over Yugoslavia, but only down to a few hundred feet off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Below that altitude, small, but deadly Yugoslav helicopter
gunships and ground-attack planes are waging a low-level, treetop
air war, taking advantage of the hilly, wooded terrain, and NATO's
focus on bombing armored forces, to terrorize ethnic Albanians and
blast rebel fighters in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say that effectively grounding Yugoslavia's low
fliers would require diverting scores of planes from a campaign
that has already been criticized by some Air Force generals for not
launching larger waves of bombing runs and hitting more targets.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, NATO jets would have to fly much lower to target the
Yugoslav planes, putting allied pilots at greater risk from ground
fire and surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   So while refugees streaming into Albania have reported strafings
or bombings by low-flying green planes _ the signature color of
most of Yugoslavia's aircraft _ NATO commanders say the threat does
not justify dramatically altering the tactics of the allied air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they succeed in taking off, their mission has to be short,
has to be of limited size and with limited scope,'' NATO military
spokesman Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani of Italy said this week in
dismissing the significance of Yugoslavia's Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO is not ignoring this air threat, its main goal is to
attack armored forces and special police in the field, as well as
the supply lines and command bunkers north of Kosovo that support
them. NATO has also put a high priority on destroying Yugoslavia's
top-of-the-line MiG-29 and MiG-21 fighters that pose a direct
threat to allied warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Yugoslav aircraft can take off and land quickly on
remote landing strips, and cruise low enough to duck under the gaze
of Awacs radar planes: the Galeb and Super Galeb attack planes and
the Gazelle and Hind attack helicopters. These aircraft can also
operate effectively under the same clouds and bad weather that have
thwarted scores of NATO warplanes flying above 15,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Galebs, in particular, have effectively attacked
mountain camp strongholds of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The light
attack planes are equipped with 23-millimeter guns and
anti-personnel cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, NATO reported an increase in attacks by
Yugoslav planes and helicopters, including many on Sunday. Allied
jets were not close enough to strike the Yugoslav aircraft, NATO
commanders said. But American military intelligence said Friday
that the low-flying aircraft had curtailed their missions as the
week went on.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates that allied jets have destroyed nearly
three dozen of Belgrade's low-end fighter-bombers. ``We have
reduced by probably around 50 percent his airborne ability to
conduct ground-attack operations,'' Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson,
director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
reporters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these ground-attack planes were based at airfields in
Nis, in Serbia, and in Podgorica, in Montenegro, Wilson said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because all of Yugoslavia is a combat area, allied jets are, in
effect, enforcing a no-fly zone over the entire country. But the
scope of this air campaign is much broader than what American-led
patrols are enforcing over northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The allies created no-fly zones in those two areas after the
1991 Persian Gulf War to prevent President Saddam Hussein from
attacking Kurds in the north and Shiites in the south.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, allied pilots are attacking scores of targets
every day, from fuel depots and ammunition dumps to the armored
ground forces that are expelling thousands of Kosovar Albanians
from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the main mission of pilots enforcing the no-fly
zones over Iraq is to prevent Iraqi aircraft from flying. But the
threat of being shot down by allied fliers has largely grounded
Baghdad's Air Force. Until Iraq recently stepped up a belligerent
campaign of targeting allied planes with its surface-to-air
missiles, United States pilots complained of the tedious duty of
``boring holes in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   If NATO and Yugoslavia ever negotiate a settlement over Kosovo,
the allies are not likely to repeat the mistake Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf made at the armistice meeting to end the Persian Gulf
War. At that meeting, Schwarzkopf agreed to a request by Iraq that
it be allowed to fly armed helicopters anywhere inside Iraq so long
as they were not near American forces.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq used that air power, which it claimed was necessary for
self-defense, combined with heavy ground armor that survived the
war, to kill thousands of rebellious Kurds and Shiites.

U.S. INCREASES TROOP COMMITMENT TO ALBANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (jw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon announced Friday night that it was
sending sizable armored combat units _ equipped with tanks and
howitzers _ to Albania to back up the Apache helicopter gunships
that began to arrive there with much fanfare this week.
</P>
<P>
   Once these soldiers join the fight, they will operate within
miles of Yugoslavia's mountainous border with Albania, well within
range of Yugoslav forces, raising the prospect of clashes on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The additional deployment further deepens the commitment of
American troops in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of 2,350 troops will nearly double the number of
American soldiers that were expected to be based in Albania when
NATO and the Pentagon approved the use of the Apaches three weeks
ago. More significant, the new forces are to include many more
heavy weapons: 15 Abrams M1-A1 tanks, 8 howitzers capable of
lobbing shells nearly eight miles and 14 Bradley fighting vehicles
in addition to the 14 that already have been sent.
</P>
<P>
   The American force in Albania now numbers about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Col. Richard Bridges, said the force was
in no way a vanguard of ground troops to invade Yugoslavia. He said
the purpose of the heavy weapons was to protect the Apaches, which
are now arriving at Albania's capital, Tirana, after several
logistical delays.
</P>
<P>
   Although based in Tirana, the Apaches will operate from
positions close to the border. From those spots, they will dart
into Kosovo, using barrages of rockets fired from the rear as
cover.
</P>
<P>
   The tanks and Bradleys _ part of the 1st Armored Division based
in Bad Kreuznach, Germany _ will protect these forward positions
from any Yugoslav counterattack. In addition, the deployment
includes more rocket batteries and a company of vehicles equipped
with anti-tank missiles from Fort Bragg, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to want some force protection when these forces
get close to the border,'' Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup is expected to begin next week and take some time.
That could further delay the use of the Apaches against Yugoslav
forces. Officials at the Pentagon said the Apaches may not fly into
combat for many more days or weeks.

NATO LEADERS SPURN MILOSEVIC'S LATEST OFFER 
 
JOHN C. HENRY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sitting as a war council, NATO leaders on Friday
rejected Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's latest peace offer
and vowed to step up bombing and economic pressure until he yields
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow this campaign of terror to succeed. NATO is
determined to prevail,'' the 19 allied leaders declared in a
communique following a three-hour meeting devoted to the Balkan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from alliance leaders, in Washington to celebrate
the 50th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
promised to end the bombing campaign, now in its fifth week, only
after Milosevic ends atrocities against non-Serbian ethnic groups
and withdraws his forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With no equivocation, summit leaders pledged to expand the air
attacks unless Milosevic stops all violence, agrees to an
international military force, permits the safe return of all
refugees and accepts autonomy for Kosovo, a rebellious province in
southern Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no compromise on these conditions,'' the
three-page communique said.
</P>
<P>
   The document also pledged to beef up economic sanctions against
Yugoslavia and embraced an oil embargo pushed by the European
Union. NATO leaders stopped short of endorsing a U.S.-proposed
naval blockade. The communique also did not target Milosevic for
prosecution as a war criminal, but it vowed ``to support
investigation'' of all those suspected of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The allies dismissed a proposal from Milosevic, relayed to
Washington through Russia's Balkan envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, to
allow an international military force in the Yugoslav province if
NATO would stop the bombing. Officials in Belgrade later
backpedaled, saying Milosevic had mentioned only the possibility of
an unarmed contingent from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac called the offer ``totally
insufficient.``
</P>
<P>
   Friday's communique did not mention the possibility of sending
ground troops into battle, a topic dividing the alliance's member
nations in how to force Milosevic to surrender in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate on ground troops is no longer on the table'' during
the summit, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Pentagon confirmed plans to send 2,000 more
troops to the Balkans over the next several days to help protect
the 24 Apache attack helicopters while they are on the ground in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment increases the number of U.S. military personnel
in the region to 5,350. Also being shipped to Albania are 15 Abrams
tanks, a battery of eight 155mm howitzers, several truck-mounted
missile launchers and 14 Bradley fighting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, Defense Secretary William Cohen has been
working up a proposal that would involve calling up an additional
33,000 Reserve troops, a decision that must be cleared by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has ordered a
review of the alliance's military assessments of the forces that
would be required for a ground offensive or for enforcing any
cease-fire in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Wesley Clark
said air attacks have paid off. Yugoslav air defenses have been
rendered ineffective, Serb forces are hiding from NATO aircraft and
a fuel crisis has forced Milosevic to suspend military operations
in Kosovo three times, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, we're winning, he's losing, and he knows it,`` Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO and U.S. military officials defended the attack
early Friday at the Belgrade headquarters of Serbia's state-run
television network, a precision missile strike that Serb officials
say killed at least 10, injured 19, and left 20 others buried in
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Radio and Television Serbia was broadcasting an interview with
Milosevic, which had been taped by Houston's KHOU-TV, when
sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles struck, knocking it off the
air early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When told that RTS had resumed broadcasting six hours after the
attack, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon indicated NATO forces
could soon draw another bead on the network. ``Stay tuned, is all I
can say,'' Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to bomb the network building and main transmitter
was made after a lengthy debate among Clinton aides and NATO
officials. Concerns over possible civilian casualties gave way to
the argument that the war is being prolonged by the one-sided diet
of pro-Milosevic propaganda aired by RTS and its refusal to carry
reports of systematic killings, rapes and burnings in ethnic
Albanian villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb TV is as much a part of Milosevic's murder machine as his
military is,'' Bacon said, calling RTS transmitters and nearby
electrical power sites ``a new class of targets'' in the Balkan
war.

 &HT;    Shaw dealt to Browns
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former LBJ High School star running back Sedrick
Shaw was traded Thursday from the New England Patriots to the
Cleveland Browns for a player to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   The trade will allow Shaw, the third-year player who had fallen
out of favor with the Patriots' coaching staff, a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good situation for Sedrick to go with a new team and
new coaches,'' said Ed Cunningham, Shaw's Austin-based agent.
``There wasn't a problem with New England. He's just more valuable
to Cleveland than he was to New England.''
</P>
<P>
   New England selected Shaw with the first pick of the third round
of the 1997 NFL draft. Coaches had hoped he would be able to step
in for Curtis Martin, the Patriots' star runner who became a free
agent in 1998 and signed with the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw never excelled with the Patriots. He did not have a
carry his rookie season. Once Martin left New England in 1998, Shaw
was beaten out by rookie Robert Edwards, the Patriots' first-round
pick. Shaw started one game and gained 237 yards last season.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards suffered a knee and leg injury in January that could end
his career, but the Patriots, rather than relying on Shaw to fill
the void, drafted Louisiana State tailback Kevin Faulk in the
second round of last Saturday's draft to fill Edwards' spot.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw flew from Austin to Cleveland after the trade was completed
Thursday and was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Browns have six running backs on their roster. The
only one with any NFL experience is former San Francisco 49er Terry
Kirby.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's 99-yard touchdown gallop for LBJ in 1990 is the longest
run from scrimmage in Austin Independent School District history.
He left Iowa in 1996 as the Hawkeyes' career rushing leader with
4,156 yards. His 1,477 yards in 1995 set an Iowa single-season
record, and he became only the eighth back in Big Ten history to
rush for 1,000 yards in three consecutive seasons.

NRC TRIES TO AVOID FINANCING FALLOUT DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J., N.Y., Ohio)  (Exclusive) 
(rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has quietly
backed away from its offer to give states with nuclear power plants
stockpiles of a drug that cuts the risk of thyroid cancer in people
exposed to fallout in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The commission decided in July 1997 to pay for the drug,
potassium iodide. But on Thursday it approved a document that calls
for trying to shift the cost to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of stocking the drug say the commission's move will
only prolong a policy debate that dates from 1986, when health
authorities in Europe distributed potassium iodide after the
accident at Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in that debate: whether it would be worthwhile for the
nation to have regional stockpiles of the drug _ already available
in many states for distribution to emergency workers _ large enough
that it could be distributed to the general population in the event
of a nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to fund the purchase, and repurchase when the
shelf life ran out,'' William F. McNutt, a senior policy adviser at
the emergency management agency and chairman of a multi-agency
subcommittee on potassium iodide, said of the NRC ``Those
rascals.''
</P>
<P>
   McNutt said his agency had made no plans to finance the
purchase, variously estimated at a few hundred thousand dollars a
year to a little over $3 million, but could ask Congress to make it
part of the agency's Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program.
That program is fully financed by charges to utilities, the same
source that pays for the nuclear commission's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Peter G. Crane, an NRC lawyer whose lobbying as a private
citizen led the commission to agree to pay for the drug, complained
Friday that ``the NRC has reneged on its promise.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael T. Jamgochian, a senior nuclear engineer at the
commission who is in charge of policy on the drug, said the promise
had only been modified: the commission will pay for the drug, he
said, if the emergency agency cannot. The document approved by the
commissioners on Thursday, without announcement, was a memorandum
from them to their staff. It said the commission's budget ``has
continued to decrease and offers little margin for the commission
to divert resources to new initiatives.'' So, it said, the
commission will try to get the emergency agency to pay for the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, a year after agreeing to pay for the potassium
iodide, the commissioners, approving a longstanding petition from
Crane, said they would require utilities to consider stockpiling
potassium iodide for public use. On Thursday, the commissioners
noted that Crane's petition, calling on them to impose such a
requirement, had not asked them to pay for the purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But Crane said today that ``my petition was premised on the fact
they'd already promised it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all my fault,'' he said, ``for having trusted their
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Many states already stock potassium iodide, but only enough for
use by police officers, firefighters, other emergency workers and
``captive populations'' like nursing home residents or prisoners,
who could not be easily moved in case of accident. Several states
with such policies had begun considering larger stockpiles because
of the NRC's offer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one such state, New Jersey, the chief radiation safety
officer, Gerald P. Nicholls, said Friday that if they wanted to,
officials there could presumably afford to buy the drug on their
own. But, he said, the NRC's decision ``seems convoluted,'' since
utilities would ultimately be bearing the cost whether it was the
nuclear commission or the emergency agency that paid for the
program.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, which has held hearings on whether to expand its
stockpile, officials said they were surprised. ``Everything Ohio
has been doing was based on the premise that the NRC was going to
pay for the potassium iodide,'' said Randy Hertzer, a spokesman for
the state's Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   New York has also considered an expansion but is making no
change. Officials in Albany, as in some other states, said that
they were concerned about the effect of giving the drug to people
with unknown medical histories and that they feared that some
people who had taken the pill, feeling invulnerable, might then
refuse orders to flee their homes in the event of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has also been considering a larger stockpile, but a
spokesman at the Health Department in Hartford was not able to say
what effect the NRC's decision would have.

Brown giving relative ride in fast lane
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ALAN TRUEX
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ENNIS, Texas _ Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Troy Vincent has a
passion for motorcycles. He owns six of them, and he would like to
race them, but his NFL contract prohibits that sort of hazardous
activity.
</P>
<P>
   So Vincent did the next best thing. He organized a Pro Stock
Bike team and hired his wife's cousin to be the rider.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Antron Brown, 23, a sophomore on the National Hot Rod
Association circuit, has not disappointed. He ranked seventh in the
series last year and has improved since.
</P>
<P>
   He was fourth in his first event this year _ the Gatornationals
at Gainesville, Fla. And he set an elapsed-time track record of
7.39 seconds Friday in time trials in his second event _ the
Castrol Nationals at the Texas Motorplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy started riding street bikes when he played for Miami
(Dolphins),'' Brown said. ``But he got away from street-bike racing
because he saw how people got hurt. So he decided to get involved
in drag racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he and Vincent ``are like brothers. A lot of people
think we are brothers because we look a lot alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is very much an athlete. While earning an associate degree
in business administration at Mercer County Junior College in New
Jersey, he ran track and ranked No. 1 nationally at 55 meters.
</P>
<P>
   But he prefers riding bikes to running. He rode a dirt bike when
he was 5, and by 13 he was competing nationally in amateur
motocross.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad raced drag bikes when he was growing up, and my uncle
raced two super stock cars,'' Brown said. ``My dream was to race
pro stock bikes when I retired from motocross, which is not a
longevity sport. I had several injuries, because in that sport
you're falling all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Vincent called to ask if he'd like to take early retirement
from motocross, Brown couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy wanted a new face; he didn't want to take a rider who
already was out there,'' said Brown, who is from Chesterfield, N.J.
``He knew motocross is good training for a lot of other motor
sports. It's easy to go from there to road racing and Pro Stock
Bike racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were a new team, and we had to feel everything
out. But we're a contender for the championship this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday afternoon's session, he reached a speed of 180.5 mph
in setting the elapsed-time mark. Conditions were far from ideal,
with 80-degree temperatures, 70 percent humidity and a crosswind.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the first time pro bikes have raced here since
1991, so improved technology made up for problematic weather.
</P>
<P>
   Brown expects his record to be broken in today's time trials,
``as soon as the wind lets up a little. When the wind is coming
across the track, the bike is like a sail; it gets blown. The front
end of the bike is floating. You have to lean into it and pull hard
to keep the bike straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to success in his sport is reaction time. The driver
must achieve ideal positioning and operate the gears while
withstanding dramatic shifts of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you let the clutch out, you feel so much power in the
seat,'' Brown said. ``I've seen a lot of people flip off the back
of the bike when they let the clutch out. The bike goes forward so
fast and they don't react. It's like having a horse saddle on a
rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the sport is safer than playing in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fall ratio on these bikes is actually very low,'' Brown
said. ``And the leather suits we wear are so good that you can fall
on the track and you won't even get a skin rash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had an accident in seven years on the national
circuit, since Dave (Schultz) fell off in Dallas. He broke his
pinkie, but that was all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave is 51 and a six-time world champion. So basically you can
race until you're ready to get off. I want to ride until I'm 50
years old and then retire and watch my kids grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of career would make Vincent happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells me all the time that he's living a dream through
me,'' Brown said.

911 TAPES RELEASED AS POLICE CONTINUE INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for final add-on; last six grafs are new.)

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ ``The school's in a panic, and I'm in the
library,'' the teacher is desperately trying to explain to the
police dispatcher as she begs for help. ``I've got students down
...
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the table, kids!'' she says now, directing her attention
back to the students who, moments before, had been quietly studying
in the library at Columbine High School. ``Kids, under the table.
Kids, stay on the floor ... Oh, God. Oh, God _ kids, just stay
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher's frantic voice, heard as gunfire reverberates in
the background, was part of a tape recording made public by the
police on Friday of some of the emergency calls placed Tuesday as
two students began their lethal rampage through the school, in
which they killed 12 fellow students _ 10 of them in the library
from which the teacher placed her desperate phone call _ and one
teacher before turning the guns on themselves. The teacher on the
phone, whom police identified on Friday only by her first name,
Peggy, survived the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were made public as the police continued with dozens
of interviews on Friday aimed at finding out _ as many
investigators here strongly believe _ whether the two young men had
some kind of help in preparing for their attack or in bringing more
than 30 home-made explosive devices into the school.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. John Kiekbusch, of the Jefferson County sheriff's office
said there were others involved who seemed to have had ``if not
direct participation, limited participation, knowledge'' related to
the two youths. Another Sheriff's Department official said Friday
night that investigators now had the names of a few ``possible
suspects,'' at least one of whom had not yet been located for
questioning. While many of the pair's friends and acquaintances
have been interviewed, so far no arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said on Friday that they believed the two,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, may have wandered through the school
after their initial attack in the library for up to an hour before
returning to that room to kill themselves. Some students had made
their escape while many others remained barricaded inside other
classrooms during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens, who toured the school Thursday night, said on
Friday that ``the devastation is difficult to exaggerate,'' and
said that many of the most haunting sights were the most ordinary
ones, from books left open on their desks to computers still
switched on.
</P>
<P>
   ``One young woman had been filling out an application to the
University of Denver,'' the governor said in an interview. ``Next
to it she had a to-do list. Monday was all checked off. She was
halfway through Tuesday. One of the items on the list was to write
her life story.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, the Jefferson County district
attorney, David Thomas, interrupted his briefings on the status of
the investigation to offer an emotional plea to reporters and the
nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to most of the families in this case, and they
said there has to be some meaning to this, this has to result in
something,'' Thomas said. ``These deaths cannot be in vain. We
can't walk away from here here and wait for the next incident to
occur and then go cover that incident and not learn from this.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 50, suggested that part of the problem was the easy
availability of guns in this country. ``The kinds of things that
were involved in this case were simply _ it was so simple to get
them,'' he said. ``Guns are everywhere. You can buy them on the
street. You can get them anywhere you want. You can steal them.
They're readily available. You can go to gun shows. You can have
your friends go to gun shows if you're underage. They're very easy
to acquire.''

   Patricia B. Holloway, who as chairwoman of the Jefferson County
Board of Commissioners is expected to help set up a gubernatorial
task force on school violence, said in an interview on Friday: ``We
have got to make parents responsible. Parents have got to start
communicating. They've got to take control. Some of these children
are so belligerent. They've been given free rein. Everyone's afraid
to stand up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Littleton, the first of more than a dozen memorial and
funeral services that this community will have to cope with took
place Friday morning, when John Robert Tomlin Jr., a 16-year-old
sophomore who was murdered in the library, was mourned by a crowd
of 500 people at Foothills Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend, Michelle Oetter, tried to speak at the service.
``He had a grin. You just couldn't help smiling when he smiled,''
she said. ``He treated me like I was the queen of the world. He
spent so much money driving back and forth to my house, but he told
me I was worth it.'' But then she broke down into deep, shaking
sobs and was helped away from the front of the church by two of
Tomlin's best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Bill Oudemolen addressed the family and friends of
Tomlin, telling them: ``A 16-year-old was killed simply because he
went to school in the morning. Kids are not supposed to kill kids.
Schools are supposed to be safe zones, not killing fields.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tomlin Sr., the dead boy's father, spoke briefly to
reporters afterward and conveyed this message: ``For the families
of the children who did this, we are praying for them. We feel no
hatred for them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the mourning continued, there was some news of recovery.
Mikai Hall, a junior wounded in the leg by a shotgun blasts,
appeared with his parents on Friday and spoke briefly at St.
Anthony Central Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know that I am going to get better,'' said
Hall. Expressing bewilderment at the incident, he said of Klebold,
one of the perpetrators who killed himself: ``Dylan was in French
class of mine. Dylan, I thought he was an all-right guy. I worked
with him sometimes. He is not the kind of person he is being
portrayed as. He was a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering an account that paralleled that of the audiotapes made
public, Hall said: ``I remember a teacher running into the library
screaming that some kids had guns, so everyone got under their
desks pretty quick. A few minutes after that, two people came in
and started shooting. They fired a number of shots, and one hit me
and I laid on the ground. They moved towards me. That's all I can
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   County officials released the tapes in part to address questions
raised by students, parents and reporters about whether the
building could have been secured any earlier, possibly leading to
earlier rescues of students who lay grievously wounded inside.
Police officials have resolutely defended their response to the
incident, saying they surrounded the building but held off entering
for fear that they might have set off a new gunfight that could
have led to even more deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes came with a timeline indicating that first sheriff's
deputies on the scene were there within three minutes of the first
emergency call.
</P>
<P>
   They were responding to a call from an unidentified student who
said she believed there was someone with a gun loose in the school.
``I just saw everyone running out,'' she said on the tape. ``People
are running out of the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the call from the teacher, who said there were two
gunmen. ``I do not know them,'' she said, her voice rising in fear.
``He turned the gun straight at him ... and I think he got hit in
the right shoulder. Oh, God! Oh, God.!''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more agonizing scenes was that of a bleeding youth
who wriggled out of a second-story window and let himself fall in a
desperate attempt to escape. He was identified on Friday as Patrick
Ireland, a 17-year-old senior, who is in intensive care with
gunshots wounds to the head and foot.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at St. Anthony told reporters that Ireland was suffering
from weakness on the right side of his body and was having
difficulty speaking and comprehending, the effects of the bullet to
his head. He is expected to live, but doctors said they could not
predict his course of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The local superintendent of schools, Dr. Jane Hammond, announced
that students from Columbine High School would finish the term at
another high school in the district. But she vowed that Columbine
would reopen next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not considered leaving the school closed,'' Dr.
Hammond said Friday. ``We have not been asked by any group of
community members or anyone not to reopen the school. We absolutely
will be reopening.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students have said this week that they would feel fear or
revulsion returning to the building. But Frank DeAngelis, the
Columbine principal, said many more students had told him that they
wanted to return because abandoning the school would represent an
intolerable concession to the killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me,'' the principal said, ``do not let them take
Columbine from us.''

NERVY McDONALD'S INTRODUCES McBAGELS IN McYORK  
(ART ADV: A photo is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eli Zabar stands over the specimen, like a coroner on
his first autopsy of the day. He pokes and pinches and cuts, and
bends close to take a sniff, and then straightens to render his
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a true bagel,'' says Zabar, 55, who, as one of New
York's foremost food merchants, would know. ``This is a roll in the
shape of a bagel.''
</P>
<P>
   After some three centuries of culinary history, it has come to
this for the ubiquitous bagel: McDonald's is selling them.
</P>
<P>
   To be more precise, Friday, after months of testing, McDonald's
officially unveiled _ in 6,000 stores across the Midwest and
Northeast, including New York and New Jersey _ three new ``bagel
breakfast sandwiches.''
</P>
<P>
   Ana Madan-Russo, president of McDonald's New York Tri-State
Owners and Operators association, says franchise owners are excited
about selling bagel sandwiches ``in the bagel capital of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Zabar, dissecting a McDonald's steak, egg and
cheese bagel in Eli's, his market on the Upper East Side. A true
bagel, he asserts, must be boiled, then baked to achieve
authenticity. ``This one,'' he says regretfully, ``has been
steamed, not boiled.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes the wimpy crust and the soft inside that pulls apart
without a fight. ``It's like Wonder Bread in a circle,'' he says.
``A New York bagel fights with you. It's tough on the outside, and
chewy on the inside, and you struggle with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elena Ramos, marketing director for McDonald's in New York,
dismisses as irrelevant whether McDonald's bagels are steamed or
boiled, or treated with any special preservatives. ``I'm not sure
if the customers buying them up get into all that,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The company has no plans to sell bagel sandwiches in its other
7,000 restaurants outside the Midwest and Northeast, and Ms. Ramos
says it is too soon to tell whether the McDonald's bagels will
catch on with New York City's sizable population of bagel nuts.
But, she notes, they sold briskly in several test markets,
including Hartford, Conn. In addition to the steak bagel,
McDonald's is offering a Spanish omelet bagel and one with ham, egg
and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the customers love them as much as we do,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   For some New York food aficionados, who view the bagel as the
city's cultural equivalent to Paris' baguette, the notion of a ham,
egg and cheese bagel topped with McDonald's special ``breakfast
sauce'' may seem like pastrami with mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Levine, author of ``New York Eats (More),'' bemoans the
McDonald's bagel invasion as ``a scary proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be that this is the logical extension of the
commodification of bagels,'' he says. ``A bagel used to have
character. Now anything that's vaguely round, that's puffed up with
a hole in it, can be called a bagel. I knew this was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   He worries that in the age of fast food chains and relentless
mass marketing, McDonald's $2.49 bagel sandwiches will diminish a
durable New York icon. ``I'm nostalgic, but many people will taste
McDonald bagels and think they're fine,'' he says. ``They've made
the bagel into a neutral food. They used to be made with malt and
have a crust. Now even many New Yorkers don't want their bagels
with a crust.''
</P>
<P>
   New York didn't invent the bagel. According to one popular
legend, that honor dates to 1683, when some Viennese bakers cooked
up a few in tribute to Jan Sobieski, the king of Poland. Bagels
made their way to New York in the early part of this century, with
Eastern European Jewish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bagel is everywhere. In Canada, Toronto holds a weekly
Bagel Bash. Mattoon, Ill., sponsors Bagelfest! In Boston, there's a
New Year's Eve Bagel-Off. Some of New York's most established bagel
makers have done their share to spread bagels to the masses. Yet
Helmer Toro, owner of H &AMP; H Bagels, in Manhattan is crushing in his
response to McDonald's product: ``They're not a quality product.''
</P>
<P>
   The reviews are more generous in Zabar's, another New York bagel
landmark. The owner, Saul Zabar, 70, is the older brother of Eli
Zabar. Just as his brother dissected the steak bagel, Saul Zabar
dissects the Spanish omelet bagel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, these bagels aren't bad,'' he says, tasting first the
egg, then the sausage patty and then the bagel itself. ``My God, I
think it's remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rick Feinberg, eating a Zabar's bagel with Nova and cream
cheese at the counter, makes a sheepish concession: If he were on
the highway in some strange place, and if he were really hungry, he
might stop at a McDonald's and try one _ though he probably would
stick with an Egg McMuffin.

COMMENTARY: ISRAELI ELECTIONS AS ANTHROPOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel)   (jw) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ ``An election in Israel is not just about
politics,'' Shlomo Ben-Ami said. ``It is anthropology: one more
chapter in the Kulturkampf,'' the conflict of cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami, a leading figure in Israel's Labor Party, was
explaining why it is hard to predict the result of the upcoming
election. Israel, he said, does not have ``a real democratic
pendulum'' _ masses of voters swinging away from a politician when
his policies are seen to fail, as the French elected the
conservative Jacques Chirac and then swung to the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weight of tradition, religion, tribalism is so great
here,'' he said. ``People will vote for a bad government because it
is theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's voters are almost equally divided between left and
right. Benjamin Netanyahu, the candidate of the right, was elected
prime minister in 1996 by just 16,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   By ordinary democratic standards, Netanyahu should be in
desperate political trouble. Four of his former senior Cabinet
members are campaigning against him now. His zigzags in the peace
process _ yielding, then stalling _ have cost him trust on all
sides. The police are investigating possible crimes by his foreign
minister, the minister of justice and the prime minister himself.
Most political commentators scorn him for what Gideon Samet of
Haaretz called ``his serial bungling.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is Israel, with its seemingly immutable politics of
tribalism. Netanyahu relied in 1996, and can still rely, on the
support of three major groups in addition to his own nationalist
conservatives:
</P>
<P>
   -- Russian immigrants, who make up about 1 million of Israel's
population of 6 million. Having suffered under a Communist regime,
they incline to the political right here _ at least at first.
</P>
<P>
   -- Orthodox Jews, whose political parties won 19 percent of the
seats in the last Knesset. Many were traditionally anti-Zionist,
but most have moved to become passionate nationalists allied with
the right.
</P>
<P>
   -- So-called Oriental or Sephardic Jews, especially immigrants
from North Africa. They harbor resentment of the formerly dominant
Jews of European origin.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is skillful at appealing to all three groups as
victims of unfair treatment _ and identifying himself with them.
His version of Bill Clinton's ``I feel your pain'' amounts to:
``The elite discriminate against you, and they treat me badly
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear is another important element in Netanyahu's electoral
technique. It is effective, as professor Yaron Ezrahi of the Israel
Democracy Institute explains: ``If there is a people that has
trouble being optimistic, it is the Jewish people _ for good
reason. So the politics of pessimism has greater energy here.
Netanyahu appeals to the part of us that says, `The world is full
of enemies.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign statements, Netanyahu warns against a
Palestinian state with a large army ``equipped with tanks, missiles
and artillery'' _ something to which no imaginable Israeli
government would agree. He hints that his principal opponent, the
Labor Party's Ehud Barak, is supported by Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's main campaign theme is that Israel needs change. That
seems to fit the public mood. There is a sense of economic
insecurity, notably among lower-income people hit by rising
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether policy interests can overcome political
loyalties _ or to put it another way, whether tribal politics is
really immutable. Some say there are signs of more flexibility, for
example among younger members of the various groups.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben-Ami himself bridges the divisions. An immigrant from
Morocco in 1955, he has risen far and fast. He has a Ph.D. from
Oxford, is a scholar of modern Spanish history, has published nine
books, was Israel's ambassador to Spain. In 1996 he was elected to
the Knesset. After just three years there, polls show him to be the
most popular figure in the Labor Party. He is a symbol of an
optimistic Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Polls now show Barak slightly ahead of Netanyahu. But there are
other candidates, and none is likely to win the required majority
on May 17. Then there will be a runoff _ when much will depend on
how many members of the various groups turn out to vote. As Ben-Ami
said, ``It's such an unpredictable country.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ About 75 fans stood behind metal barricades beside
the players' entrance at Yankee Stadium Friday, the rain slapping
their disappointed faces while Yankee after Yankee sprinted by.
This was too dreary a day for stopping to sign autographs, but the
fans waited because they are fans and because David Wells was
certain to appear.
</P>
<P>
   When a luxury bus finally arrived, the fans pressed closer to
the barricades. One, two, three Blue Jays exited the bus. Then
Wells stepped onto the sidewalk and walked that lefty swagger of
his. The fans howled as if Derek Jeter had just tossed them
autographed baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   Even Wells seemed touched by the boisterous adulation. He lifted
his right arm, looked down at his shoes and then looked back at the
fans again. He had a small smile on his chubby face and a glazed
look in his eyes. If Wells was curious about how the fans were
going to treat him as the enemy, he found out instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Is Wells even the enemy? The Toronto left-hander received a
one-minute standing ovation when he sauntered to the mound in the
first inning, and the raucous bleacher fans chanted, ``David Wells,
David Wells,'' making an opponent part of their roll call for the
first time. Wells motioned to his ``people'' in right before
tossing his second pitch.
</P>
<P>
   One poster along the left-field line had pictures of Joe
DiMaggio and Wells and read: ``Two Great Yankee Losses, We Miss You
Both.'' A 20-year-old fan in the bleachers wore a Wells T-shirt and
could have passed for Wells' brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my idol,'' said the fan, John Farley. ``People tell me I
look like him. This is my 20th birthday. When I found out he was
pitching, I had to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Farley continued to speak glowingly about Wells, Paul
O'Brien, one row ahead of him, interjected and said, ``He's on the
other team, so he's the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   As rainy a night as it was, it was definitely Wells' night.
Wells had longed for this night for two months, talking about it
like a 17-year-old who is playing against the high school of his
ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. To Wells, it is all about showing
who is tougher and about the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Wells loves the attention; Wells craves the attention. A Yankee
in 1997 and 1998, he loved talking with Howard Stern, loved
bouncing from bar to bar in Manhattan and loved embellishing the
supposedly rebellious image of the pierced and tattooed son of a
woman who dated members of Hell's Angels. When Wells arrived in New
York on Thursday, a day ahead of the rest of the Blue Jays, he had
dinner with Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Wells deserved last night. He won 22 games, including four in
the postseason, for a team that won an unprecedented total of 125
games, and the magic of last year would not have been as magical
without him. Still, embracing the attention and creating even more
attention is another one of the reasons the Yankees are better off
having traded Wells for Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be distractions in Yankeeland. See George
Steinbrenner, Hideki Irabu, Darryl Strawberry and maybe even
Clemens someday. But the Yankees, who know that duplicating 1998
will be almost impossible, must control as many of these annoyances
as they can. So when a five-time Cy Young Award winner like Clemens
became available, Wells became expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Wells is 8-1 in the postseason, but he is also the
pitcher who criticized manager Joe Torre before Game 1 of the 1998
American League Championship Series for not starting him until Game
3 a year earlier, and he is the pitcher who predicted a sweep over
San Diego in the World Series. The remarks did not hamper the
Yankees, but they were risky.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday, Wells started his pre-game preparations about 30
seconds after reporters were permitted into the clubhouse. That
meant that Wells, wearing shorts and a sleeveless T-shirt and
looking thicker than 240 pounds, played a Metallica compact disk,
turned the volume up to 10 and began stretching.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Enter Sandman'' was over, Tony Fernandez lowered the
volume. Wells snapped, ``My day, my day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said, ``Your day?''
</P>
<P>
   Wells repeated, ``My day,'' and hiked the volume back to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Because of who Wells is and who he can be and who Clemens is and
who he can be, no Yankees have lamented the departure of Wells.
Even David Cone, Wells' closest friend, essentially admitted that
the Yankees are superior with Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you not feel good about Roger Clemens being on your
team?'' Cone asked. ``We traded the best left-hander in the league
for the Cy Young Award winner and the best right-hander. Time will
tell, but I think everybody in here likes the fact that Roger is on
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone went on to claim that ``some of us probably wish we could
have Boomer and Roger.'' But that was merely his attempt to be
diplomatic. Sorry, it was too late.

DID KILLERS ACT ALONE? SURVEILLANCE TAPE MAY HOLD ANSWER

c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Investigators looked to a cafeteria
surveillance camera to settle suspicions that two gun-toting
students did not act alone in their deadly attack at Columbine High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are analyzing videotape from the time-lapse camera,
which runs intermittently but holds a tape that goes back about a
week, in their painstaking search of the scorched and bloodstained
school.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, stormed in late Tuesday
morning with semiautomatic weapons, shotguns and handmade bombs.
They fired more than 100 rounds and detonated bombs wrapped with
nails, killing 12 students and one teacher before fatally shooting
themselves in a second floor library.
</P>
<P>
   Left behind were at least 30 homemade bombs, some on timers.
Investigators questioned whether the two teen-agers could have
carried them all inside without help from others.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Gov. Bill Owens toured the school Friday and called the
damage ``stunning'' and the evidence unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are backpacks with bombs in there everywhere,'' Owens
told The Associated Press. ``The officers in there are convinced
there had to be more people involved. There's just too much stuff
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Though authorities have found no motive for the massacre, the
two seniors were self-described outcasts who professed a hatred of
minorities and athletes. They belonged to a social group called the
``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' known for members' long black coats.
</P>
<P>
   Harris maintained a Web page on the Internet referring to plans
to kill enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine Principal Frank DeAngelis on Friday denied claims that
a parent of another student warned him about Harris and Klebold.
DeAngelis said he had known nothing about them before the shooting
other than that they were students. He said they had never done
anything at the school requiring disciplining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I heard of the Trenchcoat Mafia was when it was
brought out Tuesday,'' DeAngelis said.
</P>
<P>
   The two wounded 23 people including Patrick Ireland, 17, whose
dramatic escape through the library window after being shot in the
head was aired on television as the attack ensued. Ireland and 12
others remain in hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said Friday that Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents have traced a High Point
semiautomatic rifle and a Tek 9 semiautomatic handgun used in the
attack to their original buyers. He declined to give further
details but said there was no connection between the gunmen and the
original registered owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many times those guns had changed hands
before getting into the hands of the suspects,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   He said ATF agents were having a tougher time finding the
original registered owners of the shotguns. Those guns may be
nearly 40 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teams of investigators are scouring the school for
evidence in an ``inch-by-inch'' search of every room. While about
50 investigators searched the school, another 20 conducted
interviews with students, teachers and people who knew the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Among those already questioned were former members of the
Trenchcoat Mafia. Most of the group's members, believed to have
numbered as many as 15, graduated last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the planning required, including building the bombs,
the two either mapped out their plans over a long period of time or
had accomplices, police believe.
</P>
<P>
   Some students have told investigators they saw a third gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard it now more than once, that's why we're paying a
little more attention,'' said Davis. ``Some of the students did say
there were three people. We've been looking for three people, but
so far we've only been able to find two,'' said Sgt. Jim Parr,
sheriff's spokesman.
</P>

   Investigators believe that if a third gunman was involved, spent

there's a female on the ground paralyzed. OK, I'm sorry. Can you

lot.

SPORTS COLUMN: VARYING PATHS FOR HORNETS AND KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks have been dissected beyond recognition;
the only way to understand the franchise is to examine its opposite
_ the Charlotte Hornets. The Hornets have done a lot with not very
much and apparently have found a way out of no way.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought a month ago that in mid-April the Knicks
and Hornets would be headed in opposite directions, and that
Charlotte would be the team going the right way?
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, the Hornets had lost their fifth straight game and
seemed to need a miracle to make the playoffs. Eddie Jones, who had
recently joined the Hornets in a trade from Los Angeles, said,
joking, ``I guess we're going to have to go on an 18-game winning
streak.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets are halfway there. Entering Friday night's game at
Madison Square Garden, Charlotte had won nine consecutive games in
a streak that began on April 7 with a rout of the Knicks. The
Knicks' house of cards appears to be collapsing, but the Hornets
have gone from five and a half games out of a playoff spot to
contention for the final berth in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The focal points of the respective turnabouts are two old
buddies. Paul Silas, now the Hornets' head coach, and Knicks coach
Jeff Van Gundy shared space on the bench as assistants to Pat Riley
when Riley coached the Knicks earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Silas' career followed the meandering, often frustrating, path
of the permanent assistant. Van Gundy hung in there and hung in
there and received a well-earned inheritance in 1996 when he
replaced Don Nelson, who had replaced Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Odd how things work out. Now Silas, 55, is soaring and Van
Gundy, 37, appears to be headed for the gallows, just a few steps
behind Ernie Grunfeld, who was moved out on Wednesday. Silas was
asked Friday if, all things considered, he would want to be the
Knicks' head coach now.
</P>
<P>
   Silas recoiled. ``Oh, no,'' he said. ``No no no no no no no. Oh,
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Van Gundy, he said: ``I love him to death. We came
in together, remained close friends. He's in a tough situation.
He's done a good job here, and there will be other job openings for
him.'' Silas caught himself and added a disclaimer: ``If something
happens to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and the Hornets were faced with similar puzzles this
season: the Hornets solved theirs, the Knicks have not. The Hornets
had a hodgepodge of injured, mismatched players. They traded Glen
Rice and J.R. Reid to the Lakers for Jones and center Elden
Campbell in a deal that has turned out to be a steal.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was given Marcus Camby to replace Charles Oakley and
Latrell Sprewell to replace John Starks and Chris Mills. Not bad
players, but the Knicks have found neither rhyme nor reason. The
Hornets are firing on all cylinders. Why?
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets have a signature; the Knicks do not, and this gets
to the core of the Knicks' problems. Coaches develop a stamp over a
period of time. Silas developed his as a NBA player _ a tough,
no-nonsense approach featuring muscle and hard work. But in his
first head coaching job, in 1980 with a rotten San Diego Clippers
team, it was all he could do to put a team on the court. He was
dismissed in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets rallied around Silas, who they know is getting a
long overdue second chance. Last year Silas interviewed in Seattle,
Chicago and Sacramento. There were previous attempts at jobs in New
Jersey and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Silas got his shot, on an interim basis, when Dave Cowens
stepped down on March 8. Like Silas, many of the Charlotte players
_ David Wesley, Charlotte's starting point guard; Campbell, the
center, and Bobby Phills, a guard-forward _ have something to
prove. The Knicks have all been paid, and you get the sense that
for some that alone is the proof.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets merged into one personality, the Knicks have no
collective personality. Perhaps Van Gundy's greatest failure is
that he hasn't been an effective alchemist. For all the blame put
on Grunfeld _ and this is not an attempt to absolve him completely
_ the fact is that Van Gundy was given All-Star caliber players and
they didn't fit his mold or his philosophy. He hasn't been willing
or able to break the mold and cast a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Silas picked up the pieces of a shattered season and created a
playoff contender. But the scars of 10 years as an assistant erased
any illusions he had of longevity and reward. He said he was sorry
to see his friend Grunfeld go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for him, but this is the NBA,'' Silas said. ``These
things happen and it's all a part of it. When you sign your
contract, you sign your resignation.''

 &HT;    Glavine 0-3 after 9-1 loss
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Tom Glavine's quest for his first win of 1999 _ the
first since winning 20 games last year along with a Cy Young Award
_ continues.
</P>
<P>
   It started at Turner Field with matchups against Curt Schilling
and Randy Johnson. It was delayed for a day in Philadelphia because
of rain and another day in Colorado because of snow. It nearly
ended, oddly enough, in Colorado before disappearing into thin air
when John Rocker blew a save in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The odyssey passed through Pro Player Stadium Friday night in a
9-1 loss to the Marlins, the one team that has given Glavine more
fits than any other team in its short existence.
</P>
<P>
   It may be fitting, then, that Florida is the team to give
Glavine his first 0-3 start since his rookie year in 1988. His ERA
climbed to 5.61 after he allowed four runs in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   He is 0-4 in his last five games against the Marlins. Florida
hasn't lost to Glavine in a regular-season game since July of 1996
and is the only team to have a winning record against Glavine in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   It's an odd team to give him trouble, especially given that the
Marlins came into the game with a 4-11 record. Odd players on that
team to do it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Redmond, who was hitting .118 entering the game,
got three of his career-high four hits off Glavine, drove in a run
and scored another. Pitcher Livan Hernandez took Glavine deep for
his first major-league home run and finished with four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever John Hudek provided no help as he gave up five runs on
four hits and a pair of walks _ all in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The first three innings went smoothly enough for Glavine after
he gave up three hits and a walk but managed to strand all four
runners. But then the Marlins made him pay in the fourth and sixth
with two runs in each inning, including Hernandez's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dunwoody and Kevin Orie both singled to bring up Redmond
with one out. Redmond slapped a grounder just past Randall Simon
down the first-base line, driving in his first run of the season.
It was his second hit of the game and only the fourth of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   It put Orie at third and in position to score on a sacrifice fly
by Hernandez. That gave the Marlins a 2-1 lead on Glavine. It
doubled two innings later when Redmond came up again. With two
outs, he singled softly to center and scored when Hernandez pulled
a pitch to left field for a two-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, the 22-year-old right-hander who ruined the Braves
1997 NLCS with his 3-hit complete game gem in a 2-1 win, didn't do
too shabby on the mound either. He was little trouble for the
Braves last year as they beat him twice in three starts. But on
Friday he was mixing his pitches nicely.

 &HT;    Nixon 16th ever to steal 600
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Otis Nixon wasted no time picking up career stolen base
No. 600.
</P>
<P>
   He drew a walk from Livan Hernandez in the first inning Friday
night and then stole second base, sliding in head-first to beat the
throw from Marlins catcher Mike Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't pick up the base.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had joked earlier this week that when he reached this
milestone he would pick up the base and show it to the fans like
Rickey Henderson did when he broke Ty Cobb's record for career
stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 other players in major league history have reached the
600 mark, only seven since World War II. Nixon, 40, who's in his
17th major league season, ranks 16th all-time in stolen bases. He
has averaged 37 a year. He had his best year on the bases in 1991,
stealing 72 for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who leads the Braves with six steals, was thrown out in
the seventh inning Friday, the first time he's been caught this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Too much time off, Cox says
</P>
<P>
   The fourth and fifth members of the Braves rotation are in the
process of regrouping after rough outings the last trip through the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood said his focus now is on making some minor
mechanical adjustments. For Odalis Perez, his problems may be
solved by getting back into regular work since he was skipped the
previous time through the rotation because of off-days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in Millwood and Perez's case they probably had to sit
too long for young kids,'' manager Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood had his first side session Friday since his 5-4 loss in
L.A. when he walked four and gave up a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a couple small mechanical things I can
change that will make me better,'' Millwood said. ``I don't think
it's going to be an overnight fix-it thing. It's a trial-and-error
kind of thing.... I can't get too caught up in how things have
gone. I've got to work on my stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood has allowed four runs in each of his three starts, the
last of which didn't even last four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun to go out and pitch like that,'' Millwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez looked uncharacteristically wild in his start on Wednesday
night in L.A. when he had five walks in four innings. He left after
throwing 99 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pitch the way I'm supposed to pitch, maybe because I
was not in a routine,'' Perez said. ``Too many walks, too
</P>
<P>
   many pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez pays a visit to Galarraga
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez spent Thursday's off-day visiting with
cancer-stricken Andres Galarraga at his home in West Palm Beach.
Galarraga received his latest chemotherapy treatment a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said the only thing that looked different about Galarraga
was his shaved head. He lost a patch of his hair because of the
treatment and decided to shave the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not feeling so bad,'' Perez said. ``He doesn't look like
he's got something.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said Galarraga had some problems last week when a vein
used for treatment became irritated but otherwise is doing well. He
may drop by Pro Player Stadium for a visit while the Braves are in
town through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly...
</P>
<P>
   Running out a pinch-hit infield single in the 10th inning
Wednesday night may not have set Ryan Klesko back, but he's still
not ready to return to the lineup because of his sore hamstring.
Klesko has been taking batting practice but he's still not done any
work at first base. ... Tonight's game will start at 7:15 p.m.
instead of 7:05 because of a pregame ceremony and first pitch by
Hank Aaron, as part of his continuing year-long celebration of the
25th anniversary of career home run No. 715. ... Reliever Russ
Springer made his first appearance for Class AAA Richmond on
Wednesday in Indianapolis, pitching a perfect inning in his
rehabilitation assignment as he makes a comeback from back surgery.

 &HT;    Martin too slow for field in Busch
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Something's missing from today's Touchstone
Energy 300 Busch series race at Talladega Superspeedway: Mark
Martin failed to make a Busch event for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the all-time winningest driver in the series with 36
victories, was too slow in the No. 60 Ford to make the Touchstone
field. His second-round qualifying effort Friday, 188.801 mph (or
50.720 seconds around the 2.66-mile track), was even slower than
his best lap of 188.913 mph in first-round qualifying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't among the 36 fastest cars and is ineligible for one of
the seven provisional spots since he's high in Winston Cup points
(third). Cup veteran Ken Schrader is on the pole.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Martin failed to qualify for a Busch race was in
1993 at Daytona but he drove Dale Jarrett's car in the race with
his own sponsorship. This year, Martin has six Busch starts with
two wins, three top-fives and is 12th in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran three-tenths faster in practice this morning than we
qualified,'' Martin said. ``I felt pretty confident we would be OK
to make the race. Just before our run, the sun came out and it got
really humid. I was surprised we slowed down so much from what we
ran earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's disappointment had to be filtered by his disdain for
Talladega. He is uncomfortable with the speeds generated by
superspeedways but was scheduled to race three times on the track
this weekend: in the Busch race, the International Race of
Champions today and Sunday's Winston Cup DieHard 500.
</P>
<P>
   With Martin out of the race, there's only one Ford in it. But
only three had tried to qualify. There are 38 Chevrolets in the
field.

 &HT;    Andretti becomes honorary Alabaman
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ The Gang's here after all. It just took was a
state proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's DieHard 500 has been lamented as the first Winston Cup
race at Talladega Superspeedway without a home-grown driver. There
are no Alabama drivers entered in the 60th Cup event at the
30-year-old track.
</P>
<P>
   The state will be represented by John Andretti, driving the No.
43 Pontiac. Andretti is a native of Bethlehem, Pa. But the Alabama
House of Representatives fell for a publicity ploy and voted to
grant Andretti honorary citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Andretti's publicist Chip Williams tried to
get the City of Talladega to adopt Andretti. Track officials
discouraged the move, claiming it might embarrass a couple of
Alabama drivers still seeking a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti was happily surprised by the House proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I got in unanimously or like by one vote,
50-49, or something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't trying to embarrass anyone from Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole deal was just something to honor Alabama and to
honor the `Alabama Gang.' Bobby Allison, Donnie Allison, Davey
Allison, Neil Bonnett, Red Farmer and the rest, they just meant a
lot to me and meant a lot to how much I enjoyed stock car racing,''
Andretti said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the track honored the Gang by announcing it will build
the new 22,000-seat Allison Grandstand, named for Bobby and Donnie,
replacing current grandstands on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   Bama's in the Busch
</P>
<P>
   The state won't be represented by a ringer in Saturday's
Touchstone Energy 300 Busch race. Birmingham native Jimmy Kitchens,
who drives the No. 22 Chevrolet, made the race by standing on his
Thursday lap of 189.010 mph. He'll start 33rd in the 43-car event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud to make a NASCAR race here at our home
track,'' he said. ``I really wish we could've been in the top 10. I
felt like we had a strong enough car to do that. We had a little
engine problem yesterday that hurt us in first-round qualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens has made four earlier races, wrecked in two, and has a
best finish of 29th at Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Fast start, no stop
</P>
<P>
   Chad Little was the first out to qualify Friday and after
dashing around Talladega Superspeedway in 48.841 seconds (196.065
mph), he looked like he might just keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody pulls their brake pads back to qualify,'' Little
said. ``That's kind of a given, a little less resistance. Usually,
you pump them a half-dozen times and you get your pedal back. I
started pumping them going down the back straightaway like the
normal deal and about the time I got into turn 3 I was still
pumping them and there was no sign of anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got real serious about it between 3 and 4 when I still
didn't feel anything. And then coming out of turn 4 when I still
didn't have any pedals, I figured, `I'm in trouble here.' So I just
put it in gear and let the compressor slow the car down.

 &HT;    Schrader answers challenge by winning pole
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Richard Petty's stable of Pontiacs aren't the
only race cars making a strong push lately on NASCAR'S Winston Cup
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet owner Andy Petree, who all but put his drivers on the
spot with some strong statements last week, watched his top driver,
16-year veteran Ken Schrader, win the pole for Sunday's DieHard 500
at Talladega Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, who earned his first Winston Cup victory here in July
1988, covered the 2.66-mile oval in 48.421 seconds, an average
speed of 197.765 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader's speed was faster than all but three of the top
qualifying attempts in the 24 races at Talladega since NASCAR
introduced restrictor plates in 1987. It also was the fastest here
in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, who is 16th in points and 373 behind leader Jeff
Burton, followed last week's ninth-place finish at Martinsville,
Va., with his first pole of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole lot of people pretty disappointed (with the
season so far), and I'm one of them,'' Schrader said. ``I heard
(Petree's quotes) were in one of the newspapers and I read it when
I got home. That wasn't anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy said he was disappointed in the way Kenny Wallace and Ken
Schrader were running. If he'd pulled me and Kenny and the two crew
chiefs into the truck, we would have said the same thing. Nobody's
neck is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader's No. 33 Chevrolet was one of only nine cars to eclipse
an average speed of 196 mph in one of two qualifying laps. Bobby
Labonte will start second, while Burton, Joe Nemechek and Rusty
Wallace round out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't turn anything around,'' Schrader said. ``We had a
good run last week at Martinsville and we happened to come to a
restrictor-plate race this week. We've always had a good
restrictor-plate program.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, the only driver who finished in the top 10 in each of
the last six races, will make his fourth top-5 start in eight
events this year. He was one of several Ford drivers who made great
strides from a year ago. In last year's DieHard 500, Fords needed
six of the seven provisionals.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's first-round qualifying, Ford took 11 of the top 25
spots, including five of the first 10. Chevy had three top-10 cars,
while Pontiac owner Joe Gibbs had two

 &HT;    Paulk an old-fashioned hitter
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hard to learn much from rookie minicamp, but
after the Falcons' nine draft choices and eight rookie free agents
worked out Friday for the first time, one thing was clear. The
nickname ``Jurassic Paulk'' fits Atlanta's rookie fullback.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Paulk, a third-round pick from Arizona State, picked up
that moniker as a freshman at ASU, ostensibly for his heavy-handed
methods.
</P>
<P>
   Players wore just cleats, shorts, jerseys and helmets Friday,
but somebody forgot to tell the 6-foot, 245-pound Paulk to avoid
contact. While running routes, he repeatedly smashed into
linebackers in one-on-one drills. Though he was primarily a
blocking back and caught only two passes in college, Paulk said the
Falcons ``told me they are going to try to incorporate me into the
passing game. I don't think that's too big a leap.''
</P>
<P>
   Test results
</P>
<P>
   After physical exams, rookies were tested in a variety of
drills, including the 40-yard dash, broad jump and vertical jump.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Rondel Menendez, a seventh-round pick from Eastern
Kentucky, was the top tester. He had the best time in the 40, 4.48
seconds, and the best broad jump _ 10 feet, 4 inches. Safety
Johndale Carter, a fourth-round pick from Utah State, was second
with a jump of 10 feet, 3 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Patrick Kerney, the first-round pick from
Virginia, ran the 40 in 4.82 seconds. The best vertical jump was 38
1/2 inches, turned in by wide receiver Eugene Baker, a fifth-round
pick from Kent. Menendez and Carty had 38-inch verticals.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking redemption
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Lamont Green is out to prove people wrong. The linebacker
from Florida State was first team All-ACC last season, though he
missed four games with a dislocated elbow.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-3, 230-pounder was not drafted, and signed a free
agent contract with Atlanta. It was a letdown for the former USA
Today national defensive player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult coming from a very highly regarded program to
not getting drafted,'' Green said. ``I got calls from a lot of
teams, but I signed with a team that went to the Super Bowl. I
think it's a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll work initially at weakside linebacker, behind Keith
Brooking. Early in his career at FSU, Green backed up Henri
Crockett, the Falcons' starter at strongside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett was at practice Friday, helping coach Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's instinctive,'' Crockett said. ``He's going to make it; I
won't let him slip up.

Nowitzki living up to advance billing 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The first 10 weeks of Dirk Nowitzki's
introduction to American basketball were agonizing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nowitzki couldn't beat Tiny Tim off the dribble, couldn't defend
little Johnny next door and couldn't rebound with the Munchkins of
``Wizard of Oz'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, Nowitzki started attacking the basket and
muscling inside for rebounds, and his outside shot finally found
its intended target.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nowitzki's defense remains suspect, at least he's
approaching gamesaggressively, which is why Mavericks coach Don
Nelson decided to give him more minutes. Nowitzki likes to refer to
the past two weeks as a rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good two weeks for me,'' Nowitzki said.
``\RNelson\S gave me a second chance, and it's worked our pretty
good, and I try to play aggressive every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they want my points, and I should play aggressive
on the offensive end. It's a lot of ups and downs still, but I'm
just trying to bring some consistency to the court.''
</P>
<P>
   In his past seven games, Nowitzki averaged 15 points and 6.3
rebounds and shot 48.7 percent. In his past five games, he averaged
17.8 points and 5.6 rebounds and shot 54.2 percent..
</P>
<P>
   That includes a career-high 29 points April 16 against Phoenix
when Nowitzki converted 10 of 16 shots. And it includes a 22-point,
10-of-13 from the field effort in Wednesday's 109-95 victory in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been good for a lot of games,'' Nelson said. ``All we can
do is just keep talking to him and try to teach him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson admits he made a mistake by declaring Nowitzki a
rookie-of-the-year candidate before this season started.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a chance at the beginning of the season, and it
didn't really work out,'' said Nowitzki, who started the Mavericks'
first nine games. ``I did so many things wrong, and he had to take
me out of the starting five, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki said he didn't face physical players on a game-by-game
basis in Germany like he does in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to play physical ball in Germany, because I'd
score my points anyway,'' Nowitzki said. ``We had some big guys in
Germany, but they were not as strong as the centers and power
forwards over here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so physical over here everywhere _ even under the basket
or outside _ and everybody plays more aggressive. That's what I
know you've got to play with every night in order to make something
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki's teammates say they like his aggressive play and want
to see it every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten some confidence, and I think guys are taking him
lightly and not understanding that he can do a lot of things,''
guard Erick Strickland said. ``They're not being aggressive on him,
and he's taking it right to them like he should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being aggressive, and he looks real fluid now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki's early struggles haunt him. His game was like the
stock market _ up and down _ and Nelson didn't even bother playing
him in an April 1 home game against the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the whole season I was frustrated and disappointed,
and I didn't play really good when I was on the court,'' Nowitzki
said. ``The whole season was pretty tough for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so glad that coach gave me a second chance, and I
want to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing tall Mavericks rookie Dirk Nowitzki is averaging 7.5

NORTHRIDGE NARROWS AD SEARCH TO FIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The five finalists for the athletic director post
at Cal State Northridge present a breadth of experience.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate _ Myles Corrigan, assistant athletic director at
the University of Washington _ has the best football background.
That may make him the favorite when the university announces the
new athletic director in mid-May. Interim AD Sam Jankovich is
signed to a contract that ends at the beginning of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an opportunity that is unique,'' said Corrigan, a 1977
CSUN graduate who went on to become an assistant football coach at
Washington from 1987-93. ``The job presents a variety of
challenges. It's an opportunity to make a real mark on a program
that is certainly in need of an identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The other finalists announced by the school on Friday are Robert
Arias, a Los Angeles civic leader; Richard Dull, a former athletic
director at the University of Maryland; William Lide, athletic
director at North Carolina Central University; and Brian Quinn,
Loyola Marymount's athletic director from 1985-98.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges facing the new athletic director _ inadequate
facilities, a shoestring budget and the looming threat of being
jilted by the Big Sky Conference in football if a new on-campus
stadium is not approved _ are daunting.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the issues the candidates could face in
scheduled, one-hour public forums. That's the mandate the school
has attached to the finalists' interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The five men will have very little downtime in their whirlwind
campus visits, which start with Lide on Tuesday and end with Arias
on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Finney, CSUN's sports information director, said public
meetings with athletic director candidates is nothing new to CSUN _
the university did the same thing when former AD Paul Bubb was
hired in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of the community, even from the corporate world that
could possibly be current sponsors or future sponsors, would have
an opportunity to meet the candidates and ask them questions,''
Finney said. ``It's the same with the (football) stadium issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Finney said finalists will get a break of ``about 15 minutes''
between meetings on the days they interview.
</P>
<P>
   Dull, Corrigan and Quinn have the most experience at the
Division I level. Dull, athletic director at Moravian College, a
Division III school in Bethlehem, Pa., was the AD at Maryland from
1981-86.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn has the most experience as an athletic director _ he
headed the department at LMU for 13{ years before being promoted to
executive director of athletic development and promotion in June
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Arias, a 1973 graduate of CSUN, was AD at LMU in the year prior
to Quinn. He is now president of One to One/Los Angeles Communities
in Schools, a position he has held since January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lide has been director of intercollegiate athletics at North
Carolina Central, a Division II school in Durham. He was also AD at
Salisbury State (Md.) from 1987-93 and West Chester University
(Pa.) from 1993-95. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

ORDONEZ COMES OFF BENCH TO HELP METS BEAT CUBS, 6-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Mets' game began Friday with the wind blowing in
at Wrigley Field, a bright sun in right field and the Gold Glove
shortstop Rey Ordonez on the bench for the second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez said it was the first time he could remember missing two
consecutive starts while healthy. But no matter how much manager
Bobby Valentine might have been trying to teach his shortstop a
lesson, the game came down to an Ordonez at-bat. He lofted a ball
to right field, an area that belittled the Mets all day.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez's sacrifice fly came with the bases loaded in the ninth
and broke a 5-5 tie. And after John Franco set the Cubs down in
order to finish off his seventh save in seven attempts, the Mets
had a strange 6-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Never in his major league career had Bobby Jones opened a season
4-0. A 29-year-old right-hander, Jones had never even been 3-0
before this season. But then, Jones _ 8-1 against Chicago in his
career with a 3.53 earned run average _had also never lost to the
Cubs at Wrigley Field, where he was 5-0 with a 3.42 ERA coming in.
</P>
<P>
   So it figured something just might give Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, however, the wind, and that was fortunate for Jones.
But a bright sun ended up costing the pitcher dearly, and making
the afternoon one Jermaine Allensworth would probably just as soon
forget.
</P>
<P>
   Allensworth entered the game in the bottom of the sixth with the
Mets ahead by 1-0. Lance Johnson began the inning with a single,
and stole second. Mickey Morandini followed with a tricky liner to
right.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had inserted Allensworth for Bobby Bonilla after
Bonilla lost a ball in the sun, turning an apparent out into a
double by Benito Santiago. When Allensworth caught Morandini's
ball, there was one out _ and Valentine looked especially smart.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa was next and he grounded a ball between short and
third. Luis Lopez, making his second straight start at short in
place of Ordonez, attempted an Ordonez-like move by sliding for the
ball. But the ball looked as if it nicked the outfield grass,
kicking over Lopez's glove.
</P>
<P>
   So Lopez, who had driven in a run and who later would drive in
another run, had just now missed a ball. Three pitches later, Mark
Grace knocked a sacrifice fly to center to tie the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   When Henry Rodriguez hit a two-out single to right, Sosa
advanced to third. And then the sun came into play for Santiago
again. With Jones ahead in the count, 1-2, Santiago reached out for
a sharp curve and blooped the ball to right. Allensworth charged in
and attempted an awkward stop. At the last moment, the defensive
replacement thrust out his glove, but the ball nearly hit him in
the face.
</P>
<P>
   It dropped for a two-run triple and a 3-1 Cubs lead. An
aggravated Jones nearly threw away Manny Alexander's comebacker
before getting the final out of the inning on his final pitch of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley was not finished with Allensworth. After Lopez singled
home Brian McRae in the seventh to make the score 3-2, the Cubs
scored twice in the bottom of the inning for a three-run lead. The
key hit off the reliever Dennis Cook was a triple just inside the
right-field line by Johnson. It was a triple because Allensworth
slipped and fell as he was attempting to field the ball near the
brick wall along the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson scored on a safety squeeze by Morandini, the Mets
were down by three runs. But nothing is safe at Wrigley. And the
Mets rallied for three runs in the eighth, with Allensworth getting
a single, Robin Ventura a run-scoring double and Todd Pratt a
two-run single with the bases loaded that kicked off both the mound
and Morandini's glove.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets _ on another bizarre afternoon at Wrigley _ had
somehow tied the score at 5-5 to get Jones off the hook and set the
stage for Ordonez to become a hero.

COMMENTARY: ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL AS CITY STALLS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ed Phelan took a vow of poverty when he joined the
Christian Brothers, a Roman Catholic religious order. He is in no
danger of breaking that sacred promise. He runs the Highbridge
Community Life Center in the Bronx, directing an 80-person staff
that provides welfare recipients and high school dropouts with
counseling, job training and an education. It's front-line social
service work that gives him more psychic income than the green kind
would.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he opened a line of credit to sustain successful
training programs financed last year through the federal
empowerment zone in the South Bronx. A $494,000 grant for the
second year of staff salaries and program costs has been held up,
because the empowerment zone board has not met to approve any
projects. Brother Ed, whose group trained almost 70 people for jobs
as nurse's aides or package deliverers last year, had entered the
new year borrowing money and shifting other grants, thinking the
money would be approved quickly. But the empowerment zone seems
like the Twilight Zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people on my staff who say, `Ed, you took a vow of
poverty, but I don't have to live it,' '' he said. ``This has
sapped all of my energy trying to find money, worrying about it and
trying to keep the message from our staff that it's panicville.''
</P>
<P>
   The board was to have met last February, but the meeting was
canceled when Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, who represents the
city, asked for more information on zone projects in Harlem. While
another meeting is scheduled for next month, Brother Ed has tried
without luck to shake loose his group's share of the money a little
earlier. He said Washington has yet to respond to his entreaties.
</P>
<P>
   Payrolls can't wait, and Brother Ed had to take out $230,000 in
bank loans at 8 percent interest. Although only six staff members
are affected by the impasse in financing, his entire staff may have
to take pay cuts to keep the programs running.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going from day to day,'' Brother Ed said. ``We need to
bring pressure on Rudy Washington to approve this contract. The
city talks about the importance of people getting off public
assistance and into jobs. Their delays are killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Washington did not respond to a request for
comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ithier, the president of the Bronx Overall Economic
Development Corp. and a member of the zone's board, said the
Highbridge group was not the only project affected by the delay in
convening the board. He said that several businesses that had
applied for grants and loans to open up in the zone have had plans
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could tell us they're going to Jersey where things move
fast,'' Ithier said. ``The empowerment zone is supposed to cut red
tape. What we're doing is adding to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving anywhere is not an option for Brother Ed. He has stayed
in this hilly corner of the Bronx for years, even when some of his
friends joked that it seemed the landscape got bleaker the longer
he was there. Things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are working together,'' Brother Ed said.
``It's not about having a lot of awards or nice-looking buildings.
It's about the struggle of people. It's about helping.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not want people to get lost in the quagmire over budgets
and grants. Every day he sees his neighbors from Highbridge sitting
at computers or filing into classrooms ready to learn new skills.
Dorenda Gibbons was there last Monday, studying for her high school
equivalency diploma. She used to be stuck at home, surviving on
welfare and feeling sorry for herself because of chronic bursitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get off public assistance,'' she said. ``I can't
take it anymore. If I can get my diploma, I'm good to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Betty Mitchell was taking a break from her first day of
nurse's aide training. She already earned her high school diploma
at Highbridge, now she wanted to find a job in a nursing home to
help care for the elderly. She got the idea for that recently, when
her parents died from cancer months apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many people show emotion when they care for old people,''
she said. ``It's just a job to them. I want to make a difference in
somebody's life. We're all going to get old. We all need somebody
to help us eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Brother Ed nodded. He understood her perfectly well. Especially
on payday.

 U.S. INCREASES TROOP COMMITMENT TO ALBANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Fixes location of Fort Bragg, third graph from end.)  (jw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon announced Friday night that it was
sending sizable armored combat units _ equipped with tanks and
howitzers _ to Albania to back up the Apache helicopter gunships
that began to arrive there with much fanfare this week.
</P>
<P>
   Once these soldiers join the fight, they will operate within
miles of Yugoslavia's mountainous border with Albania, well within
range of Yugoslav forces, raising the prospect of clashes on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The additional deployment further deepens the commitment of
American troops in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of 2,350 troops will nearly double the number of
American soldiers that were expected to be based in Albania when
NATO and the Pentagon approved the use of the Apaches three weeks
ago. More significant, the new forces are to include many more
heavy weapons: 15 Abrams M1-A1 tanks, 8 howitzers capable of
lobbing shells nearly eight miles and 14 Bradley fighting vehicles
in addition to the 14 that already have been sent.
</P>
<P>
   The American force in Albania now numbers about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Col. Richard Bridges, said the force was
in no way a vanguard of ground troops to invade Yugoslavia. He said
the purpose of the heavy weapons was to protect the Apaches, which
are now arriving at Albania's capital, Tirana, after several
logistical delays.
</P>
<P>
   Although based in Tirana, the Apaches will operate from
positions close to the border. From those spots, they will dart
into Kosovo, using barrages of rockets fired from the rear as
cover.
</P>
<P>
   The tanks and Bradleys _ part of the 1st Armored Division based
in Bad Kreuznach, Germany _ will protect these forward positions
from any Yugoslav counterattack. In addition, the deployment
includes more rocket batteries and a company of vehicles equipped
with anti-tank missiles from Fort Bragg, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to want some force protection when these forces
get close to the border,'' Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup is expected to begin next week and take some time.
That could further delay the use of the Apaches against Yugoslav
forces. Officials at the Pentagon said the Apaches may not fly into
combat for many more days or weeks.

   WASHINGTON _ Officials said four weapons were involved in the
Littleton shootings _ a 9-millimeter pistol and a carbine, both of
which were initially bought in Colorado, and two older sawed-off
shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law-enforcement officials said the pistol was a Tech DC
9 with a large capacity magazine made by Intratec Firearms, of
Miami. The manufacture of this semiautomatic weapon was banned in
the 1994 anti-crime law, but the weapon still can be sold. Buyers
must be 21 years old, with no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The pistol was bought at a store in the Denver area, but not by
either of the two teen-agers accused of going on a murderous
rampage at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., on Tuesday,
officials said. The officials almost certainly can identify the
original buyer, but they are withholding the information pending
their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Hi-Point carbine, also a semiautomatic, is a widely
available weapon that may legally be sold to anyone over 18 without
a criminal record. This gun was also bought at a store in the
Denver area, but not by either of the teen-agers, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two 12-gauge shotguns, one is a pump-action Mossberg and
the other is double-barreled. It is unclear who bought them. A
shotgun may be legally purchased by anyone over 18.

SCENARIOS FOR RESOLUTION OF STRAWBERRY'S STATUS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Darryl Strawberry's baseball career in jeopardy,
his standing with Major League Baseball could be resolved within
the next two days, according to a baseball official.
</P>
<P>
   Results from drug tests Strawberry took subsequent to his arrest
for cocaine possession and solicitation of prostitution on April 14
were expected late this week, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the charges, the test results could have an impact on
Strawberry's future.
</P>
<P>
   There likely are three possible resolutions to Strawberry's
case:
</P>
<P>
   _ Strawberry could be subject to some sort of penalty. As a
second-time offender in 1995, Strawberry was suspended for 60 days.
If he is found to have violated the rules of baseball's after-care
program a third time, he could receive an even greater penalty.
However, if baseball officials discern mitigating circumstances _
Strawberry is being treated for colon cancer and, like most
recovering cancer patients, has suffered from depression _ the
suspension could be less than 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Major League Baseball would not comment on
Strawberry's case. However, if the case is resolved within the next
two days _ before his charges in Tampa, Fla., are settled _ then
logic would suggest he faces some sort of penalty.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strawberry could agree to take counseling with either no
penalty or a minimal penalty.
</P>
<P>
   _ Major League Baseball could take the unusual step of
announcing that Strawberry passed all of his drug tests. Baseball
typically does not announce the results of drug tests that are
passed, but Strawberry's case has drawn such attention that
officials may feel the need to clarify Strawberry's status.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the resolution, Strawberry's career could already
be finished. If he is penalized in any way, the Yankees could
attempt to void his contract based on very strict behavioral
clauses. If Strawberry is cleared, he would still have to overcome
his legal case, which could drag on for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said Friday that he
had no idea when Strawberry would resume working out. ``We're
taking it day by day, while he's dealing with his personal
issues,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   Four things must happen before Strawberry returns to the field
for the Yankees: he must be cleared by Major League Baseball; he
must hurdle his legal issues; he must be forgiven by George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, and he must prove he is
in good enough condition to play. &QL;

MAYOR'S ACCORD WITH CITY COUNCIL SPEAKER WOULD END NEW YORK CITY
SCHOOL BOARD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich.)   (rk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After years of criticizing the Board of Education
from separate corners in City Hall, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone have agreed to pursue legislation
that would abolish the board and replace it with a system more
beholden to the mayor and the City Council, representatives from
both sides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They have not yet ironed out the details of a specific proposal,
but are looking at various options, including systems already in
place in Chicago and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Anthony P. Coles, a senior adviser to the
mayor, Giuliani and Vallone agree that any new system would
probably include a commissioner of education, appointed by the
mayor with the advice and the consent of the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Coles said that Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew would be the
mayor's first choice for commissioner. A spokeswoman for Crew said
Friday that the chancellor's office was unaware of the plan by
Giuliani and Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the proposal are still under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Consensus in City Hall hardly ensures, however, that the plan
will receive the necessary approval of the state Legislature.
Although both sides said that they had the general support of Gov.
George Pataki, they acknowledged that they would have a difficult
time convincing the Democrat-controlled Assembly of the merit of
their plan.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver _
who is not an ally of either the mayor or the speaker _ confirmed
Friday that they had reason for concern, saying that the Assembly
was predisposed against any plan to give the mayor control of the
school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who is sitting in City Hall,'' she said.
``It is just a philosophical approach to education. It should be an
independent school board.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education is a semi-autonomous body that oversees
the education of 1.1 million children in more than 1,100 schools
throughout the city. Its seven members include two mayoral
appointees and a representative from each of the city's five
boroughs. Its chancellor is appointed by the board, but mayors,
including Giuliani, have traditionally had significant input in the
selection.

 LAVISH MEMORIAL FOR DiMAGGIO DRAWS THE FAMOUS AND THE FANS  
(ART ADV: A photo is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most private of men, Joe DiMaggio, was
memorialized Friday in the most public of places, St. Patrick's
Cathedral, where his teammates from the Yankee glory years joined
Manhattan's celebrity elite and baseball die-hards from the outer
boroughs to say goodbye to a bona fide hero.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was as diverse as the city that was DiMaggio's
baseball home through 10 pennants, 9 championships, 3 most valuable
player awards and a legendary hitting streak. As contradictory as
the peerless center fielder, who was the son of an immigrant
fisherman and the husband of a Hollywood star.
</P>
<P>
   Who else but DiMaggio could draw a crowd that included Henry A.
Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and Frank Petrizzo, a
court reporter from Staten Island? Or E.L. Doctorow, the author of
``Ragtime,'' and Jim McGonigle, a Queens cabbie? Or Mort Zuckerman,
the owner of The Daily News, and Tim Curley, a eighth grader from
Brooklyn's Xavarian High School?
</P>
<P>
   John Cardinal O'Connor, who presided at the prayer service with
a bandage on his nose after minor surgery, welcomed them all to the
splendid cathedral where Yankee greats Babe Ruth, Billy Martin and
Roger Maris also had been mourned. Quoting his father, the cardinal
offered the first of many tributes to DiMaggio's athletic prowess
and personal grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father liked Joe DiMaggio,'' O'Connor said simply. ``He had
tremendous respect for him. And he paid him the highest accolade
you can give anyone. He said DiMaggio seemed to be a very decent
fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   This very decent fellow guarded his privacy, begging that no
daily medical bulletins be issued during his long siege of lung
cancer and choosing a small, private funeral, which took place in
his hometown of San Francisco last month. But Friday, at the
insistence of friends who thought a hero deserved a hero's tribute,
the reclusive Yankee Clipper was celebrated in the grandest, and at
times the gaudiest, way.
</P>
<P>
   The formal eulogies were delivered by Dr. Bobby Brown,
DiMaggio's teammate and a former American League president, and
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a lifelong Yankee fan.
</P>
<P>
   Brown spoke of DiMaggio's quiet leadership, through deeds not
words, and his physical gifts, in the batter's box, on the base
paths and in the yawning space of center field, much larger then
than now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't lead in the modern sense,'' Brown said, scoffing at
team meetings, pep talks and clubhouse chemistry. ``What Joe did
each and every day is set for himself the highest standards and
give you no choice but to try and emulate him.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor spoke of DiMaggio's influence as a role model for
other Italian-Americans, especially during World War II, and the
luster he added to the place where he played from 1936 to 1951.
``He graced our city with style, dignity and class that made New
York even better than it actually is,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The informal eulogies came from the 2,000-odd people who nearly
filled the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a strong man with great character,'' said Kissinger,
who shared the first pew with the mayor; Yogi Berra and his wife,
Carmen, and George M. Steinbrenner III, the Yankee owner. ``He was
as close to perfection as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Romano, a 62-year-old retiree from Union, N.J., echoed that
sentiment. ``Joe DiMaggio was a gentleman,'' he said. ``With him,
there was no baloney. He never looked for glory, but it was there
for him. So I'm here to honor Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the current Yankees were spotted in the huge crowd, and
Steinbrenner said they had stayed away because they had a game last
night and would have a chance to honor DiMaggio in another ceremony
at the stadium on Sunday afternoon. But the difference between
today's ballplayers and those of DiMaggio's era was a motif of the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, for instance, noted in his eulogy that DiMaggio never
argued with umpires, never watched the flight of his own home-run
balls, never danced clownishly around the bases, never left the
dugout for a curtain call. With DiMaggio, he said, there were no
alibis when he played poorly, no theatrics when he played well and
no efforts to ``enhance his own status or reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He set the tone for everyone else's behavior,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL MATERIALS FOLLOWS
</P>
<P>
   Friday's memorial events stood in contrast to last month's
unimposing family funeral for DiMaggio, whose record-breaking
56-game hitting streak and marriage to Marilyn Monroe made him one
of the most famous men of this century. His contemporaries said
that he would have approved of the stately memorial service, even
though he insisted that he did not want one. But the festivities
afterward, an invitation-only brunch at Le Cirque 2000, skipped by
many of the baseball old-timers, would likely have left him coiled
up in shyness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have been against the wall in the corner,'' said Tim
McCarver, the baseball announcer who switched from the Mets to the
Yankees this season. ``In the most obscure part of the room, like
he always was.''

PRACTICE OF JOLTING HORSES BECOMES KENTUCKY DERBY TOPIC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Ark., Texas, La., Mass., Pa., Ariz., Ill.)   (jw) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ It is sometimes referred to as ``plugging in''
a race horse _ the act of shocking the animal with a crude,
hand-held electrical device to prod it to go faster. Though it is
prohibited and reviled within the industry, the longtime practice
has become one of the seamier, and bizarre, story lines as American
thoroughbred racing's grandest moment approaches.
</P>
<P>
   A gelding named Valhol churns the Churchill Downs oval in the
morning along with other race horses preparing for next Saturday's
Kentucky Derby. The strapping 3-year-old earned his chance to
compete in the nation's premier race by winning the Arkansas Derby
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But how Valhol won is in question, as well as whether he will be
eligible for the Kentucky Derby. The Arkansas Racing Commission has
withheld the $300,000 winning purse and alleged that there was
evidence that Valhol's jockey, Billy Patin, was in possession of an
illegal electrical device when the horse romped to a 4{-length
victory as a 30-1 long shot at Oaklawn Park on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The jockey, a 36-year-old Louisiana native, has denied the
allegation, as has the trainer, Dallas Keen. Valhol's owner, Jim
Jackson, said he believed his rider, although he acknowledged that
a video replay of the race showed something dropping from Patin's
hand shortly after Valhol crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson also believes that the Arkansas Racing Commission is
improperly withholding Valhol's winning purse in an effort to keep
the horse out of the Kentucky Derby. The race is limited to 20
horses, and the entry criteria include money earned in stakes
races. Without the $300,000 from the Arkansas Derby, Valhol
probably will not make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am frustrated by the uncertainty of it all and how long it
is taking,'' said Jackson, who owns Valhalla Farm in Texas. ``Why
am I being held accountable? I did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   What Jackson has done, however, is notify racing officials in
Arkansas and Kentucky that he will use the courts, if necessary, to
press his way into the 125th running of the Derby. Friday, his
lawyers submitted a demand to Arkansas officials for payment of the
$300,000 purse, arguing that the racing commission's own rules
require payment no later than 96 hours after the race. Arkansas
officials rejected the demand, however, arguing that in
circumstances such as this one, the commission was allowed to
overrule itself.
</P>
<P>
   But that was hardly the last word, since one of Jackson's
lawyers, Bill Rambicure, said he and his associates were ``prepared
to do whatever we need to o'' to get the $300,000 released,
including seeking a quick injunction in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Patin's lawyers successfully asked that an Arkansas
hearing on the buzzer allegations be delayed. It will now be held
on May 5, which is four days after the Derby, rather than on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the controversy has had an impact on the storied
backside of Churchill Downs, where Valhol munches hay and takes
sponge baths while his human connections pace the shed row and
answer questions about an investigation that has put them virtually
in quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the pre-race atmosphere is buoyant with the talk of
who will canter off with the Derby's blanket of roses. But instead,
trainers, testily, and jockeys, sometimes angrily, have had to
address a lightly publicized but very unappealing aspect of their
sport.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer Nick Zito, a two-time winner of the Derby, jumped
from a chair in his small office and marched down to the stalls of
his two current contenders, Stephen Got Even and Adonis. He waved
his hands at his horses and said: ``Who would want to do something
like that to these beautiful animals? Would you stick something on
his neck? If somebody did this to one of my horses, there would be
no need for a security investigation. I'd go tear them apart
myself!''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a well-documented history in racing of
the use of the devices, often referred to as buzzers or batteries
or machines. The device is about the size of a disposable lighter
with an exposed end that delivers a jolt to a horse's neck while
the rider has the reins in his hand. It is exceedingly hard to spot
such a tactic, because the rider is hunched over and often shielded
by other horses and jockeys. Decades ago, before track security was
improved, they were sometimes built into the jockey's whip.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1974 there have been at least 242 instances in which
racing commissions have investigated and taken action against
jockeys, trainers, grooms or escort riders for infractions
involving the devices, according to documents obtained from the
Association of Racing Commissioners International, a racing-data
clearinghouse in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the 1990s alone, there have been 42 buzzer cases at race
tracks, most of them on minor tracks like Suffolk Downs in
Massachusetts, Turf Paradise in Phoenix, Philadelphia Park and all
four Louisiana tracks.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 the Illinois Racing Board issued a lifetime
ban against a jockey, Patrick Boxie, for ``possessing and
conspiring to use an electrical device'' at Fairmount Park. ``There
is no place for these devices in racing,'' said Gina DiCaro, a
spokesman for the board. ``We take it very, very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Arkansas Derby victory, Patin had never been accused
of using an electrical device, and there is a feeling shared by
Valhol's owner, trainer and jockey that they have been subjected to
extra scrutiny because of their modest backgrounds. It is the first
Kentucky Derby for all three, and their horse had never won a race
until the Arkansas triumph.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, before the Arkansas Derby, Patin had never won a graded
stakes race over a 20-year career spent for the most part on the
minor tracks of Louisiana, which have a colorful, but not always
spotless, reputation. Last summer, for example, Louisiana racing
officials reinstated Sylvester Carmouche, the notorious ``fog
jockey'' who was suspended in 1990. In a race shrouded in fog at
tiny Delta Downs, Carmouche stopped his horse, hid while his
competitors continued racing, then when he heard them come back
around, restarted his horse and scored a short-lived victory.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Valhol does get into the Derby, it is likely Patin will
not be the rider because of the cloud hanging over him. Still,
Patin remains here to exercise Valhol. ``It's breaking my heart,''
he said of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   And Keen, a trainer for 13 years, has glumly gone about the work
of readying a horse that may never get to the starting gate. He,
too, has never been accused of using an electrical device.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been much fun,'' said Keen, who after days of delay
was finally given an official Derby saddlecloth for Valhol and a
courtesy car. ``Our horse wasn't buzzed. There's not a mark on
him.'' &QL;

HAROLD E. SAMUEL, MUSIC LIBRARIAN AND PROFESSOR AT YALE, DIES AT
75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Minn., Germany, Switzerland, Texas)   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold E. Samuel, a former music librarian and professor at the
Yale University School of Music, died after a long illness on
Tuesday at his home in Hamden, Conn. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   He died of congestive heart failure, said his son Hector.
</P>
<P>
   Though Samuel was a well-regarded professor and scholar, he was
most noted for his 23-year tenure as music librarian at Yale, from
which he retired in 1994. Largely through his perseverance and
vision the library acquired major new collections and archives of
materials that made it a leading research center, particularly in
four areas: American composers; Germany between the two world wars;
composers and musicians in jazz and musical theater, and composers
associated with Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel negotiated for and acquired collections of manuscripts,
papers, letters and private recordings of, among others, Kurt Weill
and Lotte Lenya, Vladimir and Wanda Horowitz, Carl Ruggles, Virgil
Thomson and Leroy Anderson. Chief among his acquisitions was the
collection of Benny Goodman, the jazz clarinetist and band leader,
who bequeathed master tapes, 1,500 arrangements, 40 scrapbooks,
5,000 photographs and other papers.
</P>
<P>
   He also supervised the commercial release of 10 compact disks on
the Music Masters label drawn from Goodman's private recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel was born on April 12, 1924, in Hudson, Wis. His college
education was interrupted by service in the U.S. Army Infantry in
Europe from 1943 to 1946, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star.
He then received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the
University of Minnesota, continued his studies in Erlangen,
Germany, and Zurich and was awarded a doctorate by Cornell
University in 1963. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From 1953 until 1971 he taught at Cornell. An offer to lead the
music library at Yale took him to New Haven in 1971. The building
of a new library became an immediate priority, which 23 years later
and three years after his retirement finally bore success when the
Irving S. Gilmore Music Library at Yale was dedicated last year and
Samuel was showered with tributes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, who lives in Hamden, he is survived by
his wife, Hella; another son, Mark, of Greenwich, Conn.; a
daughter, Hester Weigand of Austin, Texas, and five grandchildren. &QL;

 &HT;    Senate plan puts focus on teachers
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pressured by Democrats to give more to teachers,
the Senate Education Committee on Friday agreed to put $1.7 billion
in new money toward educators' compensation and about $1 billion to
cut local school property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would mean at least $840 million in guaranteed pay
raises for teachers. But individual raises could vary from as much
as $4,000 to nothing depending on teachers' current salaries and
how school districts handle the new money.
</P>
<P>
   While hailing the new focus on teachers, one teacher group
pronounced the raise insufficient and called on lawmakers to drop
the tax cut idea completely in favor of a $6,000 pay hike.
</P>
<P>
   The pay-raise and tax-cut plan, a compromise forced by
Democrats, is a near flip-flop from the $2 billion that GOP Gov.
George W. Bush proposed for property tax cuts and $1 billion he
wanted to give schools to distribute among teachers. Bush, a likely
candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, is likely to
face criticism for not getting his wishes from the
Republican-controlled Senate. The GOP holds 16 of the 31 Senate
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, led by Sens. David Cain of Dallas and Eliot Shapleigh
of El Paso, said they might be the minority party in the Senate,
``but we represent the majority of the thought of the State of
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An overwhelming majority of Texans are most interested in the
education system,'' Cain said.
</P>
<P>
   Cain said Democrats also want property tax cuts but say they
think teacher pay raises should come first. ``It's just a shifting
of the priorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Shapleigh, ``People want to invest in kids. We tried to
use whatever influence we had in this body to direct the thinking
in the Senate to those priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The influence boiled down to votes. Senate rules require two out
of three members to agree to even debate a bill. Neither the
governor's plan nor a Republican-backed alternative had enough
support from Democrats to reach the 21 votes needed to get
consideration. The compromise bill is expected to come up for
debate as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' money includes $1.4 billion intended for pay
raises. At least 60 percent of that, $840 million, must go directly
to teachers. Committee Chairman Sen. Teel Bivins (R-Amarillo) said
he believes school districts will face enormous pressure to give
all of the money to teachers. But to require that would leave
schools without money to pay for other costs created by the raises,
including local input to teachers' retirement benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although $840 million would be guaranteed, raises for each
teacher would vary. That's because the $1.4 billion would be used
to increase the minimum teacher salary schedule by $4,000. That
means teachers paid at the minimum level will get $4,000 raises,
Bivins said.
</P>
<P>
   But because more than half of the state's teachers are paid
above the minimum salary level, some might not get anything. In a
rough estimate, however, Cain said the plan _ and the requirement
that at least 60 percent goes directly to teachers _ means more
than half of the state's teachers would get at least an average
raise of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The committee-adopted version of Senate Bill 4 also could mean
good news for retiring teachers. The $1.7 billion includes $110
million for higher retirement benefits and $170 million to help
schools adjust to the new teachers' salaries. The bill also would
increase the percentage of a retiring teacher's service used to
calculate retirement benefits from 2 percent to 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Cole of the Texas Federation of Teachers applauded the
effort to raise teacher salaries but said more money still is
needed. TFT and other groups have argued that teachers should get
across-the-board raises of $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have to settle for $4,000 if you decide you need
another property tax relief bill like we had last session. Once you
get that idea out of your head, then the $6,000 is doable,'' Cole
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tax cuts and teacher raises, the bill
includes Lt. Gov. Rick Perry's Master Reader Teacher proposal. That
would give teachers extra pay if they get advanced training in
teaching reading courses. They would get even more if they used
those skills in low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would force cuts to local school property taxes by
having the state take over more of the cost of old and new school
buildings. Much of local school tax rates go to pay for buildings
and would have to be reduced if the state paid more toward that
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts also would be forced by more money flowing to
fast-growing schools and $100 million in continued tax exemptions
for residential property.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Paul Sadler (D-Henderson) has delayed
decision-making on the issue by his Public Education Committee in
hopes of seeing what the Senate can accomplish. He said he still
wants more for teachers but needs to look at the Senate bill and
other ideas before moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to give a teacher pay raise, we ought to assure
that every school district gets the money but that the money flow
directly to every teacher in the state,'' Sadler said. ``That's
different from moving the minimum salary schedule. I think we can
do that.''

TOP FUEL POINTS LEADER CONTINUES RUN THROUGH TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNIS _ Larry Dixon's ``True To Texas'' Tour continues to be a
qualified success.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon became the first NHRA Top Fuel driver to crack the
4.5-second barrier when he ran 4.486 seconds during qualifications
for the O'Reilly Nationals at Houston Raceway Park in Baytown on
April 9. The national elapsed-time record-holder based upon that
lap, Dixon lowered the event record for the third annual Castrol
Nationals with a 4.545-second pass at the Texas Motorplex last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, of San Diego, topped a list of four Top Fuel drivers who
cranked out 4.5-second laps during the second session as the sun
went down and track temperatures cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Five-time Top Fuel champion Joe Amato began the barrage with a
4.592-second pass that eventually positioned the Tenneco/Keystone
Dragster fourth. Gary Scelzi, the two-time series champion who
failed to qualify for the first time in his 48-race career at
Baytown, rebounded with a 4.581-second pass at 321.54 mph to place
third on the 16-car ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looked like Scelzi had the pole, Tony Schumacher
reeled off a pass at 4.569 seconds and a track-record 323.62 mph in
the Exide Batteries Dragster. Moments later, Dixon one-upped them
all in search of his third consecutive No. 1 position.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we smoked the tires on the first run, we were just
looking to get a clean second run and get in the field,'' said
Dixon, driver of the Miller Lite Dragster owned by Don Prudhomme.
``I thought if we could run in the mid-4.50s it would be nice. We
weren't trying to do another 4.40.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, who ran 316.12 mph on his lap, said he felt his ET would
be in jeopardy today, especially with Scelzi and owner/tuner Alan
Johnson apparently back on line.
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi, the Top Fuel champion in 1997 and 1998, served notice
that his first career DNQ might be his last in the Team Winston
Dragster. He clocked laps in 4.613 seconds and 321.77 mph _ the
latter tying Cory McClenathan's former track record _ and followed
with his stout 4.581/321.54.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we've been trying to do with this five-disc
clutch thing,'' Scelzi said. ``It looks like maybe we're headed in
the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Whit Bazemore of Indianapolis is the provisional leader in Funny
Car, with the Brothers Pedregon occupying spots two through four.
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore, third in the points chase to Team Castrol's John Force
and Tony Pedregon, ran 4.921 seconds at 304.15 mph on his second
pass in the Kendall Chevrolet Camaro Z/28. And he deleted some of
car owner Chuck Etchell's engine inventory to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hurting pistons, and finally blew it up at the
end,'' said Bazemore, who qualified No. 1 at Gainesville, Fla.,
last month. ``But when you're going for No. 1, you have to make a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz Pedregon, the 1992 NHRA Funny Car champion, is No. 2 at
4.936 seconds and 310.34 mph in the Interstate Batteries Firebird.
Frank Pedregon is third at 4.947 seconds and 309.27 mph in Jim
Dunn's Penthouse-sponsored Pontiac, followed by brother Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Pedregon's car suffered extensive fire damage on its second
pass, but is fourth overall based on his first-round lap of 4.967
seconds and 308.95 mph. Pedregon rolled his Castrol Syntec Ford
Mustang to a stop with flames engulfing the front wheel wells and
the top of the imitation engine compartment. Pedregon scrambled out
unhurt, although he said he did inhale ``a big gulp of smoke''
after he lifted the front of the car's fiberglass body to help
fight the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Force, the eight-time series champion and winner of three of
four events this year, is 15th after two rounds of tire-smoking
laps and a best ET of 5.718 seconds in the Castrol GTX Ford.
</P>
<P>
   In Pro Stock, Warren Johnson of Sugar Hill, Ga., is the
provisional leader in the GM Goodwrench Service Plus Pontiac after
a lap of 6.989 seconds and 198.28 mph. If Johnson retains the No. 1
spot at the end of today, he will have qualified No. 1 in all four
events this year and five in a row dating to last year's season
finale.

EXPERTS QUICK TO OFFER THEIR HELP IN WAKE OF COLORADO TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, sociology
Professor Bill Gibson was quoted in the media as an expert on the
motivations of paramilitary extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Current events have again prompted the California State
University-Long Beach professor to jump back into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tuesday's rampage in Littleton, Colo., Gibson, author of
``Warrior Dreams: Violence and Manhood in Post-Vietnam America,''
has actively sought opportunities to air his opinions on what drove
two students to enter Columbine High School with guns blazing.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings are a parent's nightmare. The media coverage is a
publicist's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, newsrooms are being deluged with e-mail,
faxes and phone calls from professional experts, many of whom
employ polished public relations professionals to help get their
names in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe they have information that could help the public
understand events.
</P>
<P>
   Others have a book to sell, a training tape to market or a need
to make points with a university tenure committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is public-relations people responding to a
situation in which they can enhance their message,''said Kurt
Wildermuth, who teaches public relations at the University of
Missouri School of Journalism. ``A good public relations person is
watching the world to see what's happening and if an opportunity
presents itself will jump on it.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is a press release titled ``Atlanta psychiatrist
reveals solution for decreasing violence in schools'' that offers
interviews with Lyndon Waugh, author of ``Tired of Yelling _
Teaching Children to Resolve Conflict,'' (Hardcover, $22.95, May
1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at this as, the news media needs expert
sources,'' said Amy Burton, publicity manager at Marietta,
Ga.-based Longstreet Press, which e-mailed about 300 major-market
newspapers and television stations Wednesday afternoon to promote
Waugh's book. ``This story probably has a strong window of three or
four days... This is one of our front-list books for the season,
and we just jumped on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said she received 20 ``positive replies'' to her e-mail
and five requests for interviews with Waugh.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the media needs to be chased. Reporters look
instinctively for expert sources in situations such as this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is twofold,'' said Fred Blevens, who teaches
journalism at Southwest Texas State University. ``The first reason
is perspective. The second would be knowledge. The problem is that
journalists have to be experts on different subjects on different
days, weeks, months or years. And the only way to become an expert
is by talking to experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Profnet, an Internet-based expert-finder for journalists, has
had about 20 queries for experts on violence in schools in the past
few days, says Ellen Levine, Profnet's search editor. Profnet's
searchable database is made up of experts from colleges, think
tanks, and the occasional random person fronted by a
public-relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a dozen queries about this already today,'' Levine
said Thursday afternoon. ``We've had just a tremendous volume on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   All manner of advocates have been trying to get their messages
across, from academics such as Gibson to Terri Lynn, who does
public relations for the Florida-based Ryce Foundation, a group
that helps parents whose children have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail was titled: ``Experts available _ My child was
murdered.'' The parents, the e-mail said, ``can share their
experiences about how they deal with grief, cope and endure on a
daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   A call to the publicist quickly got reporters in touch with the
parents, who hadn't yet contacted any parents in Littleton, Colo.,
but were willing to talk to the media about the mourning process.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Gibson contacted Profnet himself.
</P>
<P>
   Even a Seattle agency, more than 1,000 miles away from
Littleton, has gotten into the act of offering experts to the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the recent tragedy in Littleton, Colo., I'm
writing to offer Family Services as a resource to you in the
completion of follow-up stories,'' wrote Karen Brandvick-Baker,
director of communications for Family Services, a Seattle-area
non-profit counseling agency. Brandvick-Baker faxed her offer to
the media Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have counselors on staff who work with troubled teens and
can offer ideas around prevention and listening to their kids, as
well as grief counselors who can speak to how such a tragedy can
affect surviving teens in the aftermath.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would say Brandvick-Baker was just doing her job.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do in public relations is be advocates,'' Missouri's
Wildermuth said. ``And maybe we advocate a good position or not.
Maybe we just want to help you write a story, but down the road,
remember, we're advocates, and we want the story told from our
position.''

YZERMAN HAS PLAYOFF TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Steve Yzerman won the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the
1998 Stanley Cup playoffs, and the Detroit captain has picked up
right where he left off.
</P>
<P>
   He had a hat trick in Game 1 after being cut by Steve Rucchin's
stick early in the first period. Friday night he assisted on the
Red Wings' first goal and scored their fifth, on a deflection
midway through the second.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered a one-dimensional offensive player, Yzerman has
become one of the league's top two-way players. According to
Detroit winger Darren McCarty, Yzerman doesn't say much _ but when
he speaks, everyone in the dressing room listens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything stops,'' McCarty said. ``Because you know he's the
first guy to block a shot or take a hit to make a play. If he's
doing it, we should too. He's like a father figure to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman's hat trick Wednesday night was the fourth of his
playoff career. Only Wayne Gretzky (10), Maurice Richard (7), Jari
Kurri (7), Dino Ciccarelli (6) and Mike Bossy (5) have more.
</P>
<P>
   Short on experience:Compared to the Red Wings, the Ducks are
mere babes when it comes to playoff experience. Coming into the
series, eight Ducks had yet to play in a playoff game, two others
had played only one and four had played less than 10.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Sandstrom, the only Duck to own a Stanley Cup ring, has
played in 136 postseason games, but he would rank only fourth on
the Red Wings behind Larry Murphy (191), Chris Chelios (164) and
Jamie Macoun (158).
</P>
<P>
   Eight Red Wings have played in 100 or more playoff games and 17
have more postseason experience than the second-most experienced
Duck, Kevin Haller, who has played in 61 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Friday's game, Sandstrom had 32 playoff goals; the
rest of the Ducks had combined for 38.
</P>
<P>
   Tough guy:As he sat in front of his locker after Friday's
morning skate, Anaheim's Jason Marshall looked as though he had
already played 20 playoff games. He was pale and had a black eye,
stitches and an ice bag on his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   But the Anaheim defenseman couldn't have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparison to the regular season,'' he said.
``There is more intensity, the crowd is into it... it's what you
dream about doing all season long.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Steve Rucchin's three assists in Game 1 doubled his career
playoff scoring total. The Anaheim center had only one goal and
three points in eight games during the 1997 playoffs, when he was
hampered by a back injury.... Friday night's crowd of 19,983 marked
the 132nd consecutive game that Detroit fans have filled Joe Louis
Arena to capacity. The Red Wings have sold out 180 of their last
186 home games.

 &HT;    Cecil ``The Diesel'' cheered in Dolphins debut
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Most of the Miami Dolphins' players already had
gotten out of the heat and headed back into the training facility.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Collins, however, was busy with some extra-credit work.
</P>
<P>
   When the first practice of the Dolphins' mini-camp ended Friday,
the community relations department had gone searching for
volunteers to sign autographs. Veteran running back Karim
Abdul-Jabbar patted Collins on the back, volunteering the rookie
running back.
</P>
<P>
   So Collins stood by the fence near the bleachers at the team's
training facility, signing scraps of paper, T-shirts, hats and
balls, until after about 15 minutes a member of the public
relations staff came over and said, ``Sorry folks, but Cecil has to
get to a team meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   As Collins trotted back to the training facility, the fans
shouted encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil, we want you out there, man!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil, you're the man!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil, I can't wait to see you starting next year!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very impressive, Cecil. Very impressive!''
</P>
<P>
   A couple hours earlier, Collins had wondered what kind of
greeting he would receive the first time he stepped on a field
wearing a Dolphins practice jersey with No. 34 on it.
</P>
<P>
   Would they voice their displeasure with the Dolphins for
drafting someone who was kicked off two college teams, failed three
drug tests and pleaded guilty to charges he fondled two women in
their apartments?
</P>
<P>
   Or would they cheer and hope Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson had
found a future star in the fifth round?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Collins said. ``Maybe some cheering, maybe
some booing. That's going to come with it. I know there's going to
be some negative reaction out there.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 fans showed up to watch the players work out in
shorts and helmets. And when Collins took a handoff from Dan Marino
and burst downfield untouched, they didn't seem to care about his
past _ or the fact that he was untouched because hitting isn't
allowed in mini-camp.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted with cheers and shouts of his nickname, Cecil
``The Diesel.''
</P>
<P>
   For Collins, the cheers were merely a bonus added to something
he had been looking forward to for seven months _ being on a
football field again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road,'' he said before practice. ``I'm just
ready to get all this over with and go out there and play
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins hadn't played football, other than to perform for
scouts, since last September. He was at McNeese State, his first
stop after being kicked out of Louisiana State for the first of his
two arrests. But two games into his stint at McNeese, he failed a
drug test, a violation of a bond agreement, and ended up in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Those 27 days, he said Friday, were the turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jail will change a lot,'' he said with a slight laugh. ``When
I went in there, I tried to find the Lord a lot more. I had strayed
away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he wanted the fans to know about him, he said:
``Well, on the field I'm a great player, 110 percent. Off the
field, I made some mistakes in life, but I accept that. I don't
blame that on anyone else. I put that all behind me. I'm just ready
to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   As he tries to do that, he will have plenty of company.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is one of 12 running backs in camp. This off-season, the
Dolphins traded for Tyrone Wheatley, signed Roosevelt Potts, then
drafted Mississippi State's James Johnson, Collins and Syracuse
fullback Rob Konrad.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of new competition brought a shrug from the
incumbent, Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   He has been through this before. Last year the Dolphins used
their No. 1 pick to draft John Avery. And when this off-season
began, Jimmy Johnson sat him down and said the team planned to
search for a big running back who could solve the short-yardage
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to always have people coming after you when
you're a champion, you're a starter or No. 1 in anything,''
Abdul-Jabbar said, managing to find a positive in the competition.
``You think you can reach your potential when you're alone, but
sometimes you need a push.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly will have that this year.
</P>
<P>
   After the first practice, Johnson gave the new backs rave
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Johnson is a big back who's extremely smooth,'' he said.
``And you can see where Cecil's going to break a lot of tackles.
But they're in shorts. So we don't want to get too excited.''
