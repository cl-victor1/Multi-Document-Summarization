EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S UNDERSTAFFED COURTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 23:
</P>
<P>
   There are many problems in the criminal justice system that
yield no easy answer. But there is a fairly simple solution to the
flood of cases that is overwhelming New York City's criminal
courts. It is to hire enough judges, defense attorneys and
prosecutors to handle the workload created by the steep rise in the
number of arrests for minor offenses made by a Police Department
that has responded energetically to the Giuliani administration's
quality-of-life campaign. Unfortunately, Gov. George Pataki and
Republican and Democratic legislative leaders in Albany are not yet
paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Major crime has fallen. But the city's criminal courts are
swamped with cases involving minor assaults, fare-beating on the
subways, disorderly conduct, shoplifting and other misdemeanors
involving sentences of less than a year. The reasons are plain
enough. Although the number of misdemeanor cases has soared by 85
percent since the early 1990s, the number of judges has remained
roughly the same.
</P>
<P>
   Court administrators have done a good job of making the
arraignment process more efficient to cope with the record number
of arrests. Likewise, district attorneys' offices and the Legal Aid
Society have shifted staff and resources to handle the crush. But
Albany has not seen fit to provide new resources to keep the rest
of the system up to speed. As a result, the disposition of cases is
often delayed, or handled in a cursory manner, thereby eroding
respect for the judicial process while imposing hardships on
defendants, victims and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some offenders are able to escape punishment
altogether because of the shortage of trial capacity and the
limited menu of appropriate sanctions short of incarceration now
available to harried judges.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani could help matters by picking up the pace
in filling criminal court vacancies. But the main bottleneck
remains Albany. For two years running, Pataki and state lawmakers
have ignored Chief Judge Judith Kaye's sensible reorganization plan
that would give court administrators new flexibility to assign
judges to places where they are most needed. She will soon resubmit
her plan. Meanwhile, there is a pressing need for more judges, not
just in New York City but throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   It should be possible for Pataki, along with the Senate majority
leader, Joseph Bruno, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to strike
a quick deal to provide the necessary manpower for the courts. The
question, as usual, is whether they can rise above partisan
squabbling over who should control the judicial appointments. A
little statesmanship on both sides could mean a lot more effective
law enforcement.

EDITORIAL: THE HILLARY BOOMLET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 23:
</P>
<P>
   There is something familiar about the Hillary-mania that has
overtaken the media. By virtue of her announcement that she is
officially thinking about whether to run for the Senate from New
York, Mrs. Clinton has gotten herself on the cover of both Time and
Newsweek. She was the obsession of almost all the talking heads in
Washington on Sunday and probably half the Saturday night dinner
parties in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   It was February 1993 all over again, when the first lady became
chairwoman of the Clinton administration's task force on health
care. Mrs. Clinton made the cover of Newsweek then, was reported to
be a better newsstand attraction than Princess Diana, and made a
much-discussed call on Senate leaders that left everyone burbling
dutifully about her intelligence and knowledge of policy. ``She's
sharp, she's on the ball and I can't tell you what a real pleasure
it is . . . to be able to sit there and talk about your concerns
with her and call her Hillary,'' reported Howard Metzenbaum of
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The health care plan's ignominious end, Travelgate, Filegate and
other first-term disasters made it apparent that mixing the roles
of first lady and administration strategist/lightning rod was not
easy. For many people, the idea of Hillary Clinton for Senate is
attractive just because it could allow her to untangle herself from
the political side of her marriage and compete for a power base
that is all her own.
</P>
<P>
   Many women might ante up a campaign contribution just in the
hopes of seeing Mrs. Clinton sworn in on the day that her husband
becomes unemployed. She has spent her adult life mainly in the role
of supportive wife _ albeit in a very modern version of that part.
If the president announces that it is now Hillary's turn to shine,
and his to take on the jobs of campaign cheerleader and family
breadwinner, even many of the couple's critics would agree it is
about time.
</P>
<P>
   At this early stage in the political season, our only interest
is in encouraging races that will be competitive and enlightening
for the voters. Any race involving so well known, knowledgeable and
polarizing a figure as Mrs. Clinton would fill those requirements.
But if she does decide to run, she will be giving up some of the
insulation and deference that go with being a resident of the White
House. Her policy speeches will have to become more focused, her
relations with the press more open. Her adversarial attitude toward
the media might be understandable for a first lady whose marriage
has been under such intense and embarrassing scrutiny, but as a
Senate candidate she would be expected to be available, and to
answer the questions put to her.
</P>
<P>
   The New York media may sometimes get more credit for feistiness
than they deserve, but competitive elections in New York are
exhausting, high-pressure affairs in which relatively minor
mistakes can flare into crises for untested candidates. That was
part of the message delivered by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in his
weekend attack on Mrs. Clinton's endorsement of Palestinian
statehood. The mayor was saying, with typical subtlety: We'd love
to have you play tennis with us. Here's how hard we hit the ball _
when we're warming up.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton is, at this stage, the potential candidate that
Geraldine Ferraro wanted to be _ a celebrity-icon so powerful that
her entrance into the race would unleash a flood of campaign
contributions and a respectful retreat by other potential
Democratic candidates. Mrs. Clinton can learn from Ms. Ferraro's
errors. These days, nobody captures an open Senate seat in New York
simply by showing up. At least, no one has done it yet.

BOYS RANCH UNLIKELY TO SEE QUICK LICENSE RENEWAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Boys Ranch wants its operating license renewed
immediately based on an overhaul of controversial youth-training
policies, but a key state official says the request won't be
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not feasible for us to issue a license by Friday,''
said James Hart, assistant director of the Arizona Department of
Economic Security.
</P>
<P>
   A formal response to Boys Ranch is expected by midweek, Hart
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement released late Monday, Boys Ranch board
chairman Robert Johnson said the importance of immediate renewal
``cannot be overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys Ranch's population has dwindled to fewer than 40 after the
death of a youth last year, forcing staff layoffs. The program once
had 600 troubled youths from several states placed at its rural
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect the renewal of the license, derailed after the
death, to help them get youths back into the program.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 18 letter to DES, Johnson said the completion of a
consultants' report proposing changes, and a detailed
implementation plan for those changes, should be enough to earn
Boys Ranch a new license. He asked DES to move by Friday for
immediate renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be clear that the Ranch has responded positively,
vigorously and with a cooperative spirit to improving its
operations and ensuring the safety and health of troubled juveniles
in its care,'' Johnson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Important changes cited by Johnson include better communication
with, and closer monitoring by state regulators; new policies and
safeguards emphasizing ``zero tolerance for abuse''; and expanded
board oversight of Boys Ranch activities.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators at DES are reviewing the new policies and Boys
Ranch's plan to put them into effect. Some changes already are
under way, but some will not be made until later this spring or
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said the state will consider a new license only when all
proposed changes have been made and regulators have had time to see
them in action. While the state is mindful of Boys Ranch's
financial concerns, Hart said it has not set a deadline for a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more important to us is the safety of children,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, DES refused to renew Boys Ranch's license, citing a
culture of abuse that led to the March 1998 death of 16-year-old
Nicholaus Contreraz. The California youth died while being punished
at a boot camp in Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   A DES investigation revealed that Contreraz was suffering from a
severe lung ailment that went untreated for days. He died while
being forced to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Five former Boys Ranch employees, including a Boys Ranch nurse,
were indicted in October in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Though Boys Ranch officials appealed last year's decision not to
renew its license, administrative hearings were postponed under an
October settlement agreement. It calls for changes in Boys Ranch
management and in how the program treats troubled teens referred to
it by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also required independent consultants to pore over Boys
Ranch and its programs, and to recommend changes that would
permanently alter the abusive culture that DES concluded led to
Contreraz's death.
</P>
<P>
   Boys Ranch continues to operate on what amounts to a temporary
extension of its old license.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said respected national consultants produced a thick report
of detailed proposals for change, some of which already have been
put into effect. For example, top administrators were replaced, new
board members with experience in the field have been named, an
ombudsman's office was created and filled, and explicit new
policies have been written to guide interaction between teens and
Boys Ranch staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenor of the discussions . . . has been very amicable,''
Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Since some changes are still on the drawing board, however, Hart
said DES must see them at work before considering a new license.
Even if all the conditions were met today, he said, the renewal
process would take more time than Boys Ranch envisions. &QL;

GERTRUDE ELION, DRUG DEVELOPER, DIES AT 81 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gertrude B. Elion, a pioneer in drug research who shared a Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988, died on Sunday in Chapel
Hill, N.C., where she lived. She was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elion developed drugs for use in a vast array of conditions.
They included drugs for herpes, leukemia, malaria, gout, immune
disorders, and AIDS, and immune suppressants to overcome rejection
of donated organs in transplant surgery. In perfecting one compound
after another, Ms. Elion worked for four decades with Dr. George H.
Hitchings, who died a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elion broke down gender barriers in the male-dominated world
of scientific research, becoming one of the rare women to win a
Nobel Prize and, even rarer, a scientist who did not have a
doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elion shared the Prize with Hitchings, who hired her as a
$50-a-week assistant in 1944. Also sharing the Prize was Sir James
Black of Britain, who discovered two classes of drugs, beta
blockers, for high blood pressure and heart disease, and H-2
antagonists, for ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom does the Nobel committee in Stockholm honor employees of
pharmaceutical companies, but all three that year worked or had
worked for such a company. Ms. Elion and Hitchings throughout their
careers collaborated at the company known today as Glaxo Wellcome.
In awarding the Prize to the three scientists, the Nobel committee
said their work ``had a more fundamental significance than their
discovery of individual drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elion was noted for her precise work, intellectual
brilliance and ability to work with others.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists matched the wide array of drugs that Ms. Elion
and Hitchings developed. The drugs include acyclovir (Zovirax) for
herpes; azathioprine (Imuran) to help prevent rejection of
transplanted organs and in treatment of severe rheumatoid
arthritis; allopurinol (Zyloprim) for gout; pyrimethamine
(Daraprim) for malaria and trimethoprim (a component of Septra) for
bacterial infections.
</P>
<P>
   The two worked in lock step for much of their careers, but
Hitchings was always one step ahead of Ms. Elion; as he moved into
a new job, she filled the old one.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists wrote many papers together, sometimes with
her name first, sometimes his. As Ms. Elion said, ``He had two arms
of research and I was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, President George Bush awarded Ms. Elion a National
Medal of Science, saying her work had ``transformed the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Belle Elion was born in New York City on Jan. 23, 1918,
and graduated with highest honors in chemistry from Hunter College
in 1937. Ms. Elion decided to go into medical research as a
teen-ager after her grandfather died of cancer and her father, a
dentist and Lithuanian immigrant, encouraged her to develop a
career. Her mother was from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But unable to find a laboratory position because she was a
woman, Ms. Elion took a succession of jobs. First, she worked as a
laboratory assistant in biochemistry. Then she worked as a food
analyst, checking the acidity of pickles and making sure the
berries slated for jam were not moldy. Next, she taught chemistry
and physics in the New York City school system before earning a
master's degree in chemistry at New York University in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   After working for Johnson &AMP; Johnson for two years, Ms. Elion,
helped by labor shortages in World War II, joined what was then
Wellcome Research Laboratories, in Tuckahoe, N.Y., as a biochemist.
Ms. Elion later became head of the company's experimental therapy
department.
</P>
<P>
   She retired in 1983, but continued working, helping to oversee
work on the development of AZT as the first drug against HIV, the
AIDS virus. Ms. Elion also served on the faculty of Duke University
and the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   While working for the drug company, Ms. Elion felt that her lack
of a doctorate was a disadvantage, so she began a Ph.D. program at
Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. She took courses at night,
commuting an hour and a half each way. But she eventually had to
quit because she was told she would have to attend school full time
to get a Ph.D., and she could not afford to give up her job.
</P>
<P>
   When she gave her first scientific paper at a major meeting, she
said she got into an argument with a distinguished scientist and
stood her ground because ``I knew I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elion never married. She was once engaged, but her fiance
died of a heart infection. Ms. Elion said that she would not have
advanced in her career if she had chosen to marry and have children
because women were not encouraged then to work while their children
were young.

PROGRAM HELPS PROSTITUTES REGAIN DIGNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINA LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ At first, it was exciting.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot of attention for a girl _ cars honked when she
walked by, men whistled at the sight of her and ``boyfriends''
promised her anything and everything.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there was the quick money, and a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   But what Vicki first saw as the glamorous life of prostitution
faded quickly as her body and mind withered under a crack
addiction. Her pursuit of crack cocaine pushed her through the
series of beatings, robbings and rapes known as street life.
</P>
<P>
   Her fast excitement turned into slow pain.
</P>
<P>
   At six months pregnant, the 25-year-old realized her child would
die if she didn't get help.
</P>
<P>
   And here, Vicki got lucky: At the time she was looking for help,
the city of Phoenix was one of the few places in the country
willing to provide a diversion program specifically aimed at
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dignity is a pilot program sponsored by the City of Phoenix
Prosecutor's Office and contracted with Catholic Social Service of
Phoenix to provide support and services to help prostitutes get off
the streets. The end result not only would provide resources for
prostitutes, but would ideally reduce crime and save taxpayers'
money.
</P>
<P>
   It stands for ``Developing Individual Growth and New
Independence Through Yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And although nobody claims the program is the answer to stopping
the world's oldest profession, its organizers say it could be the
key to helping men and women who are ready to reclaim their lives,
and their dignity.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a few other cities across the nation that have
similar programs, and none are as extensive as Dignity, program
coordinator Kathleen Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women who are arrested for prostitution in the city
are given an option of attending the 36-hour class instead of going
to jail. It's a one-time-only offer that focuses on showing a
prostitute that ``what she does is not who she is,'' said Mitchell,
a former prostitute herself.
</P>
<P>
   The program began when Mitchell sent a newsletter about Dignity
House, another program that offers services to prostitutes, to the
city prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   She was asked to write a proposal for a diversion program, which
the City Council later approved, and the program was born.
</P>
<P>
   Since February 1998, 100 people have graduated. In all, about 65
percent of those who started the program finished it, Mitchell
said. Its organizers are evaluating the cost-effectiveness now.
</P>
<P>
   However, given the scope of the problem and the complex social
aspects involved in prostitution, it's unclear whether a program
such as Dignity can survive.
</P>
<P>
   But its supporters say this is the only program that has worked
for them. Forget rehab. Forget halfway houses.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Vicki has quit prostitution and given up crack.
She takes care of children during the days, and brings home A's in
the courses that will bring her closer to becoming a chemical
dependency counselor.
</P>
<P>
   There's also 31-year-old Lisa Godinez, who worked the streets
for 10 years to support her crack cocaine addiction. She's been
clean and sober for almost a year thanks to the program.
</P>
<P>
   She even has a list of goals hanging in her bedroom: finish her
GED, reunite with her eight children, get off intense probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs robbed me from myself, my kids and my family,'' she
said. ``I've broken so many promises, my kids don't believe me
anymore. But I take it one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Vicki, who asked that her last name be withheld, and
Godinez said Dignity is the only program they've been through
that's prostitute-specific, unlike the numerous rehabs both have
attended.
</P>
<P>
   They are just two examples of the of the 120 men and women who
are arrested for prostitution-related crimes in Phoenix every
month. It costs about $2,000 to arrest and prosecute each one,
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   And much of that cost is paid for by city dollars.
</P>
<P>
   City laws against prostitution are strict _ mandatory sentencing
requires first-time offenders to serve 15 days in jail, 30 days for
a second offense and 60 days for a third. Those caught four or more
times, which is the majority, serve six months, Phoenix police Lt.
Larry Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Dignity students must attend seven sessions that range in topic
from health dangers to the criminal aspects to trauma bonding.
They're told how they affect the community, what can happen to them
and how to get out.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the program, they're taught life skills and what
resources are available to help them.
</P>
<P>
   But program supporters know that many of the students who
graduate from the classes will go right back out on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were girls there that were `doing dates' on the
breaks,'' Vicki said, adding that a crack addict doesn't want to
work for eight hours a day, when a trick is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of women prostitutes are addicted to drugs,
Mitchell said. They have been abused and neglected, and their pimps
won't let them leave. Not to mention the fact that there are always
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women have absolutely nobody, and when somebody says
`you're pretty' or `you're smart,' they just fall apart,'' social
service supervisor Dana Mercz said. ``They're vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the drugs numb prostitutes' pain and the pimps
keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make these women feel so special,'' she said. `'They're
really smooth. They're cunning. They really hook 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``And before she knows it, she's doing something she never
thought she would do.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems are severe, and even Mitchell admits that these men
and women need more than a 2{-week class. They need affordable
housing, treatment, day care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a chip in the iceberg,'' Jacobs said. `'We don't
have the residential, the educational component.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But who in the community will foot the bill?''
</P>
<P>
   But for people like Renae, who struggled to keep daughter Vicki
off the streets for about seven years, it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic,'' she said. ``A year ago, I didn't think she
could be in my home. I would have the baby, but I wouldn't have
Vicki.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It blows me away.'' &QL;

BEARS ENTER SWEEPSTAKES FOR FREE-AGENT MILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cardinals have their first serious competition in trying to
keep outside linebacker Jamir Miller, considered one of the NFL's
most attractive free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is scheduled to visit the Chicago Bears today and
Wednesday, his first free-agent trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears are looking for an outside pass rusher to replace John
Thierry, who was taken one pick after Miller in the first round of
the 1994 draft. Thierry, a disappointment his entire Chicago
career, also is a free agent and is expected to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's interest in Miller surfaced just as another team, the
Oakland Raiders, dropped out of the picture. The Carolina Panthers
and Cleveland Browns talked to Miller earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's agent, Steve Baker, spoke with Raiders officials during
the weekend at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis, but the
Raiders decided they don't have the salary-cap room to bid for him.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials continue to talk almost daily with Baker but
still haven't made an offer for Miller, the team's leading tackler
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another Cardinals free agent, free safety Kwamie
Lassiter, is scheduled to visit the San Diego Chargers today. The
Chargers are looking to replace Devin Bush, who signed with the St.
Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter's agent, Jim Solano, was presented a multiyear deal by
the team last week. He is believed to be looking for between $1.5
million and $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals haven't completed their deal to re-sign offensive
tackle Lomas Brown. His agent, Lamont Smith, met with team
officials Friday in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he expected the two-year contract to be finished by
as early as last weekend. But he has decided to visit the Cleveland
Browns on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns are interested in Brown because they still need a
left tackle to fill out their offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials talked to kicker Chris Jacke's agent, Steve
Weinberg, in Indianapolis and plan further discussions. Jacke, an
unrestricted free agent, handled the place-kicking duties the final
four regular-season games and the two playoff games because of a
knee injury to Joe Nedney, who isn't expected to be at full
strength until at least the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the Cardinals were among the 152 players
allocated to the NFL Europe league for next season. They are
defensive end Jomo Cousins (Berlin) and wide receivers Kevin Drake
(Scotland) and Andy McCullough (Frankfurt, Germany). &QL;

LAKER FANS SOUND OFF ON NEWS OF RODMAN'S ARRIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Scornful of his contract offer and the team's
superstar mentality, basketball's bad boy Dennis Rodman declared he
wants to worm his way into a Los Angeles Lakers uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed to the teeth in body-piercing jewelry and topped with a
foppish hat, Rodman hissed, quipped and cried as he told a crowded
news conference Monday at Planet Hollywood in Beverly Hills that
he's ready to sign and will be ready to play by Thursday against
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will make me happy is if I can bring this city a ring
just like I did in Chicago,'' he said. ``I'm here just because I
want to make people happy. I miss entertaining. I miss entertaining
for the people. I play for the people, I give the people what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for a championship after 12 inglorious seasons, the
Lakers were mum beyond saying that ``sometime very soon'' Rodman
would be signed to a contract.
</P>
<P>
   The ``people'' were more outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   The predominant lament of sports fans all across town was that
the untarnished image and championship tradition of Baylor, West,
Kareem and Magic were in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good act. He belongs on Hollywood (Boulvard) or maybe
over there on Sunset with the other freak shows and people like
him,'' said Trey Smith, sitting in the crowded TGI Friday's in
suburban Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   But like others, he was open to the possibility Rodman could
help the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Rodman's never pretended to be pure of heart or out to
help humanity,'' Smith said. ``He's got to be the most self-serving
man out there, but the Lakers think he'll help them win.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fan, Clive Lee, 17, added: ``The Lakers need help,
especially at the forward position. They need someone to grab
rebounds and do the dirty work so he'd be a good addition. Everyone
knows how he is off the court, but he's a player on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans wish Rodman would play it straight as a Laker, shut
his mouth, hang up his dresses and help the Lakers win a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got enough pretty `women' wearing dresses in L.A. We
need someone who wants to play basketball,'' said 37-year-old Bob
O'Donoghue.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting alongside O'Donoghue and a few other conservatively clad
business consultants at Yankee Doodle's Sports Bar and Restaurant,
Steve Johnson, 38, implored Rodman to ``close his mouth or just
stay wherever the hell he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miner, 30, had a terse message for Rodman: ``Shut up and
sign the contract or leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Miner, a Lakers fan his ``entire life'' who sports bleached
blond hair that would make Rodman proud, stressed he doesn't have a
problem with the five-time NBA champion's tattoos or body piercings
_ only the contract dilly-dallying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous,'' Miner said. ``But the way they're
playing now, he can't hurt. He knows how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans also took offense at Rodman's news conference remarks that
``all the guys want to be superstars'' instead of being team
players, a pointed reference to Lakers stars Kobe Bryant and
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bad thing to say,'' Oscar Lazo said as he cooked for
a lunchtime crowd at Weber's Place in blue-collar Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the experience he has, he should show some guidance
and help out Kobe and Shaq,'' the 28-year-old said. ``I still think
he'll help the team if he ever starts playing.''

EMPATHY FOR TYSON'S TV ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Residents at the county jail in Rockville, Md., were in a group
area, doing time, a popular activity among members of the prison
population.
</P>
<P>
   A new inmate suddenly went berserk.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson pitched a fit, and then a television. The set crashed
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether other inmates were watching the TV at the
time, but if they were, they couldn't have been pleased that their
entertainment hour had been interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The set was dead. No picture. No sound.
</P>
<P>
   Manslaughter: ``Aww, (at)$%! . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Grand theft auto: ``What did you do ``that'' for?!''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson: ``I'm sorry . . .''
</P>
<P>
   While inmates took turns aiming the remote at the broken set,
with no response, guards placed the perpetrator in solitary
confinement, perhaps for his own protection.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's lawyers argue that their client shouldn't be disciplined
for destroying county property because the jail deprived the former
heavyweight champ of his antidepressant medication.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Mike Tyson is a full-time job. When he's not biting an
ear in the ring, he is jumping out of his car after a minor traffic
accident and assaulting elderly motorists. That incident, a parole
violation, landed Tyson back in jail.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest aggression is understandable. Maybe even
forgivable. When Tyson threw a TV, he gave in to a very powerful
human urge.
</P>
<P>
   Medicated or not, many of us at some time have experienced the
same impulse. Have you ever felt like picking up your TV set and
throwing it?
</P>
<P>
   Be honest.
</P>
<P>
   We've all seen those TV commercials for discounted long-distance
telephone rates (dial 10-10-whatever). After watching and listening
to the same ad 20, 30, 40 times, do you start talking back to the
set?
</P>
<P>
   Don't you want to scream?
</P>
<P>
   In one TV spot, a businessman lifts an outdated computer from
his desk and tosses it out of a 10-story office window.
</P>
<P>
   Ever want to do that with your TV?
</P>
<P>
   I do, whenever I see . . .
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vitale. The college basketball guru is a nice man. He loves
the game so much that ``for a cheap rush, (he) takes hits of air
from old basketballs'' according to David Letterman's Top 10
reasons Vitale is nuts. But his loud, ranting shtick is almost as
irritating as a TV set with a horizontal-hold problem.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Musburger. The most melodramatic announcer in TV sports.
Every event is extra special because ``he'' is on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any NBA game. The league can do all the ``I Still Love
This Game'' promos it wants. NBA players hugging kids. Signing
autographs, mending fences with disgruntled fans. But the
post-lockout level of play isn't good. Some nights it's dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Utah scored 56 points. After beating the Suns, Detroit
lost to San Antonio. The Pistons shot only 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Billiards. Thumb wrestling. Strongest-man competitions. Almost
anything on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Venturi. ``So and so has ``no'' shot,'' the veteran golf
announcer whispers. Of course, so and so invariably proves
otherwise, hitting his 170-yard approach out of the hay and landing
the ball four feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman. Is there any network he is not on? Any talk show
he won't do?
</P>
<P>
   There he was again Monday, the biggest self-promoting
cross-dresser in sports, holding court at a news conference at
Planet Hollywood in Beverly Hills, where the 37-year-old forward
announced that he has decided to play for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   If you missed Dennis on the network news, don't worry. Look for
him soon on a cable channel, pushing one of the world's five
shortest books:
</P>
<P>
   ``My Plans To Find The Real Killers,'' by O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wild Years,'' by Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mike Tyson's Guide to Dating Etiquette''.``''
</P>
<P>
   `` The Amish Phone Directory''.``''
</P>

RODMAN SAYS HE'S READY TO SIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Dennis Rodman had much to say _ too much
for live television _ at a typically bizarre press conference
Monday but the question on the lips of Los Angeles Lakers fans
remained unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Will the NBA's king of rebounding and self-indulgence join the
Lakers as speculated throughout the month?
</P>
<P>
   Rodman said yes, indicating at one point that he would sign a
contract later in the day, his most tantalizing such statement to
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, my first game will be Thursday,'' he said. The
Lakers will play their 13th game of the 50-game season Thursday
night against the Clippers at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executives, who didn't attend Rodman's long-hyped
announcement, issued a brief statement indicating a contract
agreement was not imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying for the past couple of weeks that we would
like to have Dennis Rodman on our team,'' said Mitch Kupchak, the
Lakers' general manager. ``Now that he's announced his desire and
intention to play for us, we hope to sign a deal and see him in a
Lakers uniform sometime very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very soon'' could mean a contract as early as today, according
to some reports.
</P>
<P>
   But keep the purple and gold hair dye in the cupboard for now.
Given Rodman's impulsiveness and the division in the Lakers' front
office over his value, nothing will be certain until the ink in his
signature is dry.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, 37, has pulled down the most rebounds in the NBA for a
record seven straight seasons, and earned two championship rings
with the Detroit Pistons and three with the Michael Jordan-led
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``what will make me happy'' now is helping the talented
but inexperienced Lakers to a title. He said he's ``bored'' since
officially retiring last summer.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, though, that he doesn't want to join the Lakers in
the role of teacher for young teammates.
</P>
<P>
   And Rodman, who would receive less than $500,000 from the Lakers
this season because of the NBA salary cap and the lockout-shortened
schedule, said he would like a two- or three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a stumbling block. Part of Rodman's appeal to
Lakers owner Jerry Buss is the thought the team could dump the
unpredictable power forward at the end of the short 1999 season if
he proves to be the distraction many predict, but a two-year
compromise might be agreed upon if today's negotiations go
according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman said he doesn't believe reports that Lakers vice
president Jerry West is opposed to signing him. But he conceded
Lakers players might ``resent me'' for keeping them guessing all
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the people of L.A. and California will accept me
for who I am,'' said Rodman, who has head-butted a referee, argued
publicly with a coach, kicked a courtside photographer and missed
team practices during his 12-year NBA career. ``I miss entertaining
for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   But fans who think he's a perverted self-promoter couldn't have
been dissuaded by Rodman's performance Monday at an
entertainment-themed restaurant, where his press conference drew a
volatile mix of impatient sportswriters and fawning Hollywood
reporters and paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up 30 minutes late, wearing a huge, multicolored hat,
nose rings and orange shoes, which went nicely with a black suede
jacket and gray slacks. His wife, actress Carmen Electra, was at
his side, a rarity that put photographers in a dither.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman began by saying he was there to ``make up my mind if I
want to play'' _ as if he intended to decide on the spot. Only when
pressed did he say definitively, ``I have made up my mind I want to
play for the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to tease you guys (reporters) or anything like
that,'' Rodman said. He added: ``I must be very interesting and
important for you guys to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the question-and-answer session, Rodman broke down while
arguing that his charity contributions prove he isn't ``selfish.''
Tears leaked from beneath his dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   His 25 minutes at the microphone included frequent four-letter
words, notably a scatological description of the Lakers' half-court
offense. And when someone asked what role Electra played in
Rodman's career decisions, they volunteered a detail of married
life that must have caused noontime TV viewers to clamp their hands
over the kiddies' ears.
</P>
<P>
   The press conference was carried live on three broadcast
channels, a regional cable sports network and at least one sports
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station was represented by two men in feather boas,
one sporting a lavender wig and white wedding dress to emulate an
old Rodman publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classic media circus, which is why Rodman should have
expected the big laugh he got by explaining why Lakers
representatives weren't invited to the press conference: ``We
didn't want to make it a big spectacle.''

RODMAN A BLIGHT ON THE LEGACY OF PEOPLE LIKE ROY CAMPENELLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Dennis McCarthy is a Daily News columnist) 
(EDITORS:   note language in graf 7) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``I know I'm from another age, and this is a new
day and all, but it's still not right.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Roxie Campanella, widow of Hall of Fame baseball player Roy
Campanella, on the Los Angeles Lakers preparing to sign bad boy
Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't right, Roxie. Not right at all. But we're from the
old school. What do we know? We're dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Class and dignity _ a couple of attributes your husband, Roy,
and Jackie Robinson took deadly serious when they were busting up
the color line for all African-American athletes back in the '50s _
took it on the chin again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They've become anachronisms, Roxie, these old concepts _ musty
words from the old school that just don't cut it anymore in the
``Just win now, baby, at all costs'' school of pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   Class and dignity get thrown out with the trash when a proud
franchise that brought NBA championships to Los Angeles with class
acts like Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic
Johnson go slumming and hire a worm to try to win another one.
</P>
<P>
   A one-man freak show named Dennis Rodman who doesn't have the
class and dignity in his whole tattooed, pierced, butt-ugly body
that men like Roy Campanella and Jackie Robinson had in one pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   Like you suggested Monday, Roxie, this guy must have flunked
American history. He doesn't have a clue, much less care, about
what went on before he graced Earth with his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy and Jackie took so many insults, and had so many things
done to them, but they never let any of it affect their class and
dignity,'' Roxie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew that by keeping their heads high _ by being men, not
boys _ they were making it better for the black kids coming up
after them. But a guy like this _ Rodman _ he's destroying it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of trail is he blazing?'' she asked. ``He's turning
it into a freak show. Roy and Jackie would go crazy if they were
still here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have a fit because we're letting it all slip away. Our
class and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully said, Roxie.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing is there are so few people from the old school
around, or willing, to throw that fit for Roy and Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   Someone to burst in the front office of sports moguls who hire
druggies, wife-beaters, rapists, bullies and other assorted forms
of low life only because they can jump, run, skate or hit a ball
farther than a guy without criminal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Someone to stand up for the tradition of Roy and Jackie, and
say: ``What the hell is going on? This is what we tore down the
color line for? A freak show?''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be wonderful, Roxie, if just one more time we went
into an arena, ballpark or football stadium and watched class and
dignity beat the freaks and felons?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know. I'm dreaming again. That's thinking from another
age. The old school.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new day. New fans, too, I guess. Guys like Rodman sell
tickets and help deliver championships. That's all that counts.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Lakers are telling us, aren't they? Sign Rodman,
and pass Jerry West some Rolaids.
</P>
<P>
   If pro basketball's bad boy wants to smack around some women,
cross-dress, act like a damned fool and, in general, spit in
society's eye _ hey, what's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Lighten up. He's just blazing another trail.
</P>
<P>
   And what a grand trail it is _ isn't it?

PENGUINS TRIP UP COYOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Was he rafting on the Volga? Perhaps he was rock
climbing in the Urals? A moonlight stroll in Gorky Park, maybe?
</P>
<P>
   Pick any locale. But wherever the concentration of Coyotes
goalie Nikolai Khabibulin was Monday night, it wasn't in
Pittsburgh's Civic Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin did the best impression of Billy Buckner since
Buckner cost the Boston Red Sox the World Series by allowing a slow
roller to beat his five-hole, as the Coyotes fell for the fifth
straight time, 4-1, to the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have come at a worse time because the Coyotes,
playing six men recalled within two weeks from Springfield and
using defensemen Oleg Tverdovsky and Deron Quint as wingers,
executed a tight game plan well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say, it was just one of those nights,''
said Khabibulin, who started for the 16th time in 18 games. ``I was
stopping the good shots and missing the bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the guys played very good in front of me. They
played with a lot of intensity and a lot smarter. I lost the game
tonight. They told me not to worry about it . . . it's hard to say
anything right now.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad were the Penguins' goals? Not one would have
statistically been recorded as a prime scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   The first, by Ian Moran at 6:03 of the first period, came when
Moran was dumping a lazy three-hopper to set up a line change that
slowly scooted through his five-hole from the behind the red line.
It would have been ruled icing had it not been on net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I played good after that _ well, before the second
goal,'' Khabibulin said with a wry smile.
</P>
<P>
   The second, by Stu Barnes at 7:25 of the second period, bounced
off the back of Khabibulin's left foot after Barnes shot it from
behind the goal line on the goalie's right, 1:10 into a power play.
</P>
<P>
   The third, which ended Khabibulin's night early for the second
straight game and put rookie Robert Esche in net, came at 9:15 of
the second period when a falling Aleksey Morozov reached out and
hook-slung an off-speed shot through the five-hole.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the Coyotes' recent collapse has come full cycle.
While forwards have been lost to injury by the bushel, the
forecheck disappeared and defensemen wandered, Khabibulin was the
one constant who has been reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a stingy game plan,'' Coach Jim Schoenfeld said. ``With
the lineup we had, we wanted to make sure we played it close to the
vest and not give up any odd-man rushes and hopefully get out of
here with a 1-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players executed the game play pretty damn well.
Unfortunately, Niki had a pretty bad night. It goes without saying
for the larger portions of the season, he has been sensational for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than than the fact the Coyotes played their most solid
game of the trip, another bright spot was that captain Keith
Tkachuk finally broke his eight-game streak without a goal on a
solid defensive-related play.
</P>
<P>
   Teppo Numminen stole the puck away from Barnes and fed Tkachuk
on a breakaway. Tkachuk beat goalie Tom Barrasso with a back-hander
crossing the net at 18:28 of the second period to make the score
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith has been coming and I think he's pretty much back,''
Schoenfeld said. ``He had four good scoring chances at Tampa and
was coming at Florida. A rib injury is not easy to come back from
because of all the torque the middle takes. It eliminates the
ability to forecheck and finish checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tkachuk nor leader Rick Tocchet were about to point
fingers at Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played better but we still lost,'' Tkachuk said. ``Niki is
our Number 1 guy. He has been our best player all year. He was
winning games for us when we had no business winning. We can't
blame him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet, whose three goals had represented all of the Coyotes'
scoring in the first two games of the seven-game trip, concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple fluky goals; what can you do?'' Tocchet said. ``The
worst thing you can do is start blaming anyone. It's the biggest
cliche in sport, but it's true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to be a winner, but it's tough to be a loser. You
can't be a quitter when you're losing. When we get through this, it
can make us stronger for the playoffs.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``I know I'm from another age, and this is a new
day and all, but it's still not right.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Roxie Campanella, widow of Hall of Fame baseball player Roy
Campanella, on the Los Angeles Lakers preparing to sign bad boy
Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't right, Roxie. Not right at all. But we're from the
old school. What do we know? We're dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Class and dignity _ a couple of attributes your husband, Roy,
and Jackie Robinson took deadly serious when they were busting up
the color line for all African-American athletes back in the '50s _
took it on the chin again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They've become anachronisms, Roxie, these old concepts _ musty
words from the old school that just don't cut it anymore in the
``Just win now, baby, at all costs'' school of pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   Class and dignity get thrown out with the trash when a proud
franchise that brought NBA championships to Los Angeles with class
acts like Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic
Johnson go slumming and hire a worm to try to win another one.
</P>
<P>
   A one-man freak show named Dennis Rodman who doesn't have the
class and dignity in his whole tattooed, pierced, butt-ugly body
that men like Roy Campanella and Jackie Robinson had in one pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   Like you suggested Monday, Roxie, this guy must have flunked
American history. He doesn't have a clue, much less care, about
what went on before he graced Earth with his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy and Jackie took so many insults, and had so many things
done to them, but they never let any of it affect their class and
dignity,'' Roxie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew that by keeping their heads high _ by being men, not
boys _ they were making it better for the black kids coming up
after them. But a guy like this _ Rodman _ he's destroying it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of trail is he blazing?'' she asked. ``He's turning
it into a freak show. Roy and Jackie would go crazy if they were
still here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have a fit because we're letting it all slip away. Our
class and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully said, Roxie.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing is there are so few people from the old school
around, or willing, to throw that fit for Roy and Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   Someone to burst in the front office of sports moguls who hire
druggies, wife-beaters, rapists, bullies and other assorted forms
of low life only because they can jump, run, skate or hit a ball
farther than a guy without criminal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Someone to stand up for the tradition of Roy and Jackie, and
say: ``What the hell is going on? This is what we tore down the
color line for? A freak show?''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be wonderful, Roxie, if just one more time we went
into an arena, ballpark or football stadium and watched class and
dignity beat the freaks and felons?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know. I'm dreaming again. That's thinking from another
age. The old school.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new day. New fans, too, I guess. Guys like Rodman sell
tickets and help deliver championships. That's all that counts.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Lakers are telling us, aren't they? Sign Rodman,
and pass Jerry West some Rolaids.
</P>
<P>
   If pro basketball's bad boy wants to smack around some women,
cross-dress, act like a damned fool and, in general, spit in
society's eye _ hey, what's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Lighten up. He's just blazing another trail.
</P>
<P>
   And what a grand trail it is _ isn't it?

CLUBHOUSE BANTER GOOD OMEN FOR D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Take just two steps into the Diamondbacks clubhouse
down here and it immediately hits you how different the 1999
Diamondbacks are from the inaugural version.
</P>
<P>
   This, baseball fans, is what a big league clubhouse is supposed
to be like: Half animal house, half serious. It's a combination
shared by almost every winning club, and it exists only when
veterans dominate the roster.
</P>
<P>
   You know you're in a major league clubhouse when you hear one
player yelling across the room at another and giving him a hard
time about his golf game, his expanded biceps or just about
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Through little fault of their own, this type of banter was
practically non-existent last year. It is, however, a necessary
ingredient in the big leagues if you want to win.
</P>
<P>
   It's a given that most people will never step into an occupied
big league clubhouse. But if you could, you would notice a common
thread among winning clubs _ a friendly but spirited camaraderie
that spares no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to look at chemistry and putting a little
more importance on it,'' said Pete Incaviglia, a veteran who is in
camp with a minor league contract and trying to win one of the
backup outfield jobs. ``It's not always the best teams that win,
but the teams that play best together.''
</P>
<P>
   Incaviglia, who has 206 career home runs, is exactly the type of
player the Diamondbacks were missing last season. He's loud and
boisterous, and if you didn't know him, you might even think he's
obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   But sift below the coarse exterior and you find as respected a
player as there is in baseball, one who knows what it takes to win
games.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget what a well-schooled player Incaviglia is
when you see him taunting Todd Stottlemyre every day. But when
Stottlemyre gives it right back to Incaviglia or Luis Gonzalez, you
are instantly reminded of what was missing last season.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation for last year's basic silence was not the fault
of the players on the roster. Except for a handful of veterans, the
clubhouse was filled with kids who hadn't accomplished much in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   Part of baseball's unwritten code states that you keep your trap
shut until you have done something. Using that as a barometer, it's
no wonder the majority of the players didn't act like nuts
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   The few veterans that were around last year _ players such as
Andy Benes, Matt Williams, Jay Bell and Devon White _ didn't have
the kind of personality to dominate a clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   And that's OK. You don't want too many wackos in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, we got a different group of guys when it
comes to getting on guys,'' Manager Buck Showalter said. ``It's a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer Gregg Olson, who did not have a secured job last spring
and therefore was hamstrung from taking control, has flexed his
veteran muscle this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are taking vans back and forth between Tucson
Electric Park and their minor league complex across a busy avenue.
After the first day of workouts, Olson noticed the minor league
pitchers taking up the front seats of the vans while guys like
himself and Stottlemyre had to clumsily climb into the back.
</P>
<P>
   Olson listed the criteria that must be met for sitting in the
seats nearest the driver. They include: Having played against
coaches Dwayne Murphy or Jim Presley or having been a bona fide
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   While he was at it, Olson stipulated that the same rules apply
for sitting in the first four rows or the last four rows on bus
trips to other ballparks this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's real special when you step in and see a glow in
the clubhouse,'' Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Before camp started, I thought this club was capable of winning
about 84 games, mostly because of all the new pieces being fitted
together. After watching the first week of workouts, I can say this
club is capable of anything, including winning the National League
West. &QL;

WALTER LINI, 57, CLERGYMAN WHO LED NATION OF VANUATU 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Walter Lini, an Anglican priest who led the 83
Melanesian islands of Vanuatu and their 172,000 people to
nationhood, died on Sunday. The former prime minister was 57 and
had governed the country for 11 years before he stepped down in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Lini was born on Pentecost, one of the larger of what were then
the New Hebrides, a Y-shaped cluster of islands administered
jointly by Britain and France. He had studied for the ministry in
New Zealand and was serving as a priest and as leader of the New
Hebrides National party when the colonial rulers announced plans to
withdraw by 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Because his party dominated the colonial parliament, Lini was
poised to become prime minister. But a month before independence, a
French-speaking planter named Jimmy Stevens led 600 bowmen to take
control of the island of Espiritu Santo. Supported by some local
French-speakers, Stevens wanted to withdraw the island from the
about-to-be-proclaimed nation of Vanuatu, which means ``our eternal
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Lini sought aid from Britain, which, over the objections of
France, reluctantly sent 200 Royal Marines, who served as a
peacekeepers on Espiritu Santo long enough for the independence
ceremonies to proceed on schedule. Once the new flag went up, Lini
signed a defense pact with Papua New Guinea, which sent forces to
replace the British Marines, quickly arrested Stevens and put down
the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The country Lini took over was poor in almost everything but
fish. It had only 30 college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   It also found itself vulnerable to geopolitical pressures. It
sought to trade fishing rights to both China and Taiwan. Lini's
government angered France by its support for independence groups in
New Caledonia and its opposition to nuclear testing in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   It irritated the United States by calling for a reduction in
U.S. naval traffic, recognizing Libya, and welcoming Vietnam and
Cuba to establish embassies while holding off the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Lini scoffed at suggestions that he supported Communism.
Acknowledging the need for international aid, he spurned any great
leaps forward, declaring: ``We have a lot of resources that we have
not exploited, but we are not so much in a hurry to exploit all of
these. We lived here many years before Britain and France came, and
we will continue to live here for many more years. Why should we
use everything now?''
</P>
<P>
   Lini's party won re-election in 1983, maintaining strong support
among the country's Protestants and English-speakers. But in 1987
the party split, and some legislators boycotted Parliament.
Vanuatu's largely ceremonial president dissolved the legislature
and appointed a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   After Australia, New Zealand and other countries in the region
refused to recognize the move, the president and his new prime
minister were removed, and Lini was restored. But his authority was
diminished and in 1991 he lost his party leadership and stepped
down as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary, four sons and two daughters.

RODMAN MELODRAMA BRINGS MIXED REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
 REAX-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman's personal soap opera is apparently moving to Los
Angeles, based on his news conference and a statement released by
the Lakers Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Will he make the Lakers a championship team? Or will he become a
distraction that leads to disaster?
</P>
<P>
   Forgive the Suns if they haven't been watching As the Worm Turns
with rapt attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can all sleep at night,'' forward Tom Gugliotta cracked
when told of Rodman's announcement. ``Between that and Kosovo, who
knew what was going to happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Center Luc Longley, a former teammate of Rodman in Chicago,
smiled when told that Rodman had played up his decision, strung out
the process and made a big splash with his news conference,
alternately crying and cracking jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis playing it up?'' Longley said. ``Fancy that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Suns agree that Rodman, if healthy, in condition and
focused on his job and not Hollywood, could make the Lakers even
more lethal than they already are.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely adds a big rebounder and a guy who is going to
play defense,'' Clifford Robinson said. ``You know what he's going
to bring on the court. But you know what he's going to bring off
the court as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of whether the team is strong enough not to
let that affect what they do on the floor. But there's no question
he can help them on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kleine, another former Rodman teammate, figures the story
could play out one of two ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen what he did for Chicago,'' Kleine said. ``But
you've seen what he did in San Antonio. ''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman tore the Spurs apart before leaving there. With the
Bulls, with the strong personalities of Michael Jordan and Scottie
Pippen, he won championships despite generating a whirlwind of
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows the type of player he is,'' Gugliotta said.
``If he can be what he's been for the Bulls, he can probably help
that team. But it's risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good organization. Hopefully, there are enough good
guys there to control him. They've got a veteran leader in Derek
Harper, and there are some guys in the organization, like Magic
(Johnson), who can do that, I assume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Shaq's team, and there's a lot of pressure on (Shaquille
O'Neal) to win a championship. I don't think he'd allow anybody to
come in there and take away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley said Rodman wasn't a bad guy to have on a team, at least
when a game was being played.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a great teammate as far as I was concerned _
when game time comes,'' Longley said. ``He can do a lot of things
on the floor. He can help that team a lot if he's focused.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Longley have any advice for the Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not prepared to give advice,'' he said. ``Stay tuned. I
think they'll figure it out for themselves.''

IT'S KIDD'S PLAY:SUNS HAVE FUN  
 EVEN COLD, FLU CAN'T STOP GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Kidd was feeling so dizzy and sick Monday night against
the Dallas Mavericks, he was practically seeing double. In fact, he
was seeing triple-double.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the effects of a cold and flu that caused Kidd to leave
the game for a few minutes early in the first quarter, the Suns
point guard recorded his third triple-double in five games in a
101-83 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's line: 17 points, 12 assists, 10 rebounds and his seventh
victory in eight games against his old team since the Mavericks
traded him to Phoenix. Three of his 22 career triple doubles have
now come against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say it's a vendetta,'' Kidd said. ``But
everytime I go out and play against them, I'm going to give
110-percent, sick, hurt, it doesn't matter. That was my thought
process when I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd said his chest was burning in the opening minutes of the
game, he was dizzy and not sure he could continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I hit my second shot there at the beginning and fell on
the court, I just wanted to stay there,'' Kidd said. ``Rex
(Chapman) was funny. He told me he knew something was wrong when he
ran past me''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the ball,'' Chapman interjected.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night when Kidd probably didn't need to produce such an
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman rediscovered his shooting touch and scored 18 points on
7 of 12 shooting while doing a solid defensive job on Dallas guard
Michael Finley, who had 17 points but made 6 of 16 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd got him some easy shots early, and that got Chapman going.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first layup, Jason got me the ball where I could
probably have dunked it,'' Chapman said. ``But I just wanted to
make sure I got it in the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   He hit five of his first six, including a three-pointer and a
tough baseline runner that took him almost behind the backboard.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Manning came off the bench to scored 17 points in 22
minutes, hitting seven of eight shots on postup moves the Mavericks
couldn't solve. He added seven rebounds and four assists in what
was probably his best game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny looked really active,'' said Suns Coach Danny Ainge.
``He gave us a little of everything out there, he defended,
rebounded, boxed out, made shots, gave us leadership. He was every
bit as good as he was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clifford Robinson came off the bench to lead a defensive
effort tha limited the Mavericks to 39-percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   It was far more than the road-weary Mavericks could handle, and
their point guard, former Sun Steve Nash, also was suffering from
the flu. He failed to score a field goal in 23 minutes in the face
of Kidd's defense, missing three shots and getting only four
assists and one free throw.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were playing their seventh straight game on the
road, all within a span of 11 days, and the fatigue showed in the
fourth quarter, when the Suns turned a 10-point lead into 16 in
less than four minutes. Manning scored eight of the club's first 10
points in the quarter to lead the rush.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns wanted to jump out quickly on the Mavericks, knowing
that they would be tired. And they did, grabbing a 12-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Suns failed to put the Mavericks out of their misery.
Trailing by 18 with 6:45 to go in the first half, Dallas closed the
half on a 21-11 run to get within eight.
</P>
<P>
   At least it was a lead. In their previous four games, the Suns
had faced deficits of 17, 15, 22 and 19 points. They came back to
win two of those games , and regained the lead against Detroit only
to lose that one.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they never trailed and blew it open in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Kidd, a towel wrapped around his head, sounded
like a guy who needs a day off. He attended an open scrimmage
Sunday, and said he probably should have stayed in bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell Coach Ainge I was sick,'' Kidd said. ``I know
how much the fans mean to the Suns and the league, so I wanted to
be there.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much doubt he'd be there for the Mavericks, either.

GILKEY UPBEAT AS DEAL DRAGS  
 D-BACKS, PIRATES CONTINUE TO WORK ON TRADE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Will Bernard Gilkey be a Diamondback or a Pittsburgh
Pirate?
</P>
<P>
   The answer remained up in the air late Monday night as officials
from both clubs and in the commissioner's office waited for the
outfielder to decide whether to accept changes in his contract as
part of a trade that would send him from Arizona to the Pirates in
exchange for infielder-outfielder Tony Womack and outfielder Al
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which has been widely reported for the past week,
could be completed today, might need more fine-tuning or could be
scuttled altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Its completion hinges upon issues regarding an annuity that will
pay Gilkey $1 million a year for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what's going on for sure. I watch ESPN
like everybody else and wait to see what happens,'' Gilkey said
after arriving at Tucson Electric Park late Monday afternoon.
``Whether I'm in Arizona or in Pittsburgh, I'm going to contribute
to either ballclub one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried. I'm confident that Jim (Bronner,
agent) can take care of the business part of it. The most difficult
thing was figuring out what kind of clothes to pack, for cold
(Pittsburgh) or warm (Arizona).''
</P>
<P>
   Said Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr., who spent
most of the day on the phone with Pirates GM Cam Bonifay and
Bronner, ``We'll just have to wait to see what happens tomorrow
(today).''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gilkey remains a Diamondback. As of Monday
afternoon, he planned to be on the field today as the club begins
full-squad workouts. When he arrived, he shook hands with the
clubhouse crew headed by Chris Guth and was expected to speak with
Manager Buck Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming here, Gilkey was in Phoenix undergoing a physical
performed by Diamondbacks team physician David Zeman. The Pirates
were concerned about a slight injury to his right knee when it
locked up while he was playing recently with his 3-year-old son at
their home in the St. Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   The exam included a magnetic resonance imaging test, which
revealed no damage. The information was sent to the Pirates'
medical staff in Bradenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Gilkey, who was acquired in a trade from the New
York Mets on July 31, said he wants to remain a Diamondback, ``but
I know that baseball is a tough sport and this (trades) is the
nature of the beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey knew his name was being tossed about in trade talks, but
his attention was focused on his wife, Patrice, who on Feb. 16 gave
birth to the couple's second son.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .227 with four homers and 28 RBIs in 82 games for the
Mets, and .248 with one homer and five RBIs in 29 games for
Arizona. But he had only nine at-bats in September, when he was
affected by vision difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   During the final week of the regular season, Gilkey traveled to
Calgary, Alberta, to undergo elective corrective laser surgery on
both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He has not hit against live pitching, only off pitching machines
in a cage, but does not anticipate any problems as the spring
progresses.
</P>
<P>
   While he is focusing on his hitting, Gilkey also will be faced
with the adjustment of a position switch, from left field to right
field. Luis Gonzalez, acquired by the Diamondbacks in a trade with
Detroit, is expected to start in left field, with free-agent signee
Steve Finley in center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buck has talked to me about it over the winter. I'm a good
enough athlete where I can adjust pretty well,'' Gilkey said.
</P>
<P>
   He has always received strong support from his family, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about whether he can rejuvenate his career to a level that
approaches the .317, 30-homer, 117-RBI season he had with the Mets
in 1996, whether he has anything to prove, Gilkey said, ``I can
make believers out of non-believers if I stay positive.'' &QL;

FREE TO SPEAK, SORT OF, LEWINSKY GIVES A LONG-SOUGHT INTERVIEW

 (Subs for new penultimate graf regarding another Lewinsky
interview) (sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finally unmuzzled by the independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, Monica Lewinsky gave her exclusive interview to Barbara
Walters of ABC News on Saturday, although she was not permitted to
talk about the conduct of Starr's staff members toward her, ABC
executives said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under her immunity agreement with Starr, Ms. Lewinsky had to get
his permission to speak to any journalist. Ms. Walters and David
Westin, the president of ABC News, said in a telephone news
conference on Monday that Ms. Lewinsky had gained that permission
after agreeing to certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to not talking about the conduct of the independent
counsel's office, they said, she was forbidden to contradict any of
her grand jury testimony or to discuss any potential future legal
proceedings. She was also required to have a lawyer present.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said Ms. Lewinsky was not allowed to describe the
events of the night of Jan. 16 when she was first questioned, for
hours, by prosecutors and the FBI. ``However,'' Ms. Walters said,
``everything that happened that night is a matter of record now,
and is something we can talk about,'' referring to plans to weave
taped segments into the interview to fill in parts of Ms.
Lewinsky's story.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said Ms. Lewinsky had been ``very full and frank
about her emotions'' concerning the night of Jan. 16 and concerning
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The interview will be broadcast on Wednesday, March 3, from 9 to
11 p.m. ET on the program ``20/20.'' It took place at an ABC News
studio in New York, and lasted about three and a half hours,
interrupted by a lunch break. Westin said that the lawyer for Ms.
Lewinsky, Sidney Hoffman, had been on the set, ``at some distance,
but able to hear,'' and raised no objections during the interview.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Ms. Lewinsky was interviewed by Jon Snow, a
journalist from a London television station that paid her $600,000.
That interview is to be shown on March 4.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said one answer from Ms. Lewinsky had surprised her.
Asked what was the toughest question she faced last year, Ms.
Lewinsky said it had come from a grand jury member who wanted to
know why she had a history of relationships with married men.

JOKINEN SKATES THIN LINE

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It may not be saying much given the current state of
the Kings, but in recent games, rookie Olli Jokinen has been one of
the team's best players.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday night's 5-1 loss to the St. Louis Blues, Jokinen -
the third player chosen in the 1997 NHL draft - had collected three
points in his previous three games.
</P>
<P>
   And a big reason may be that Jokinen recently has become
smaller. The 20-year-old Finn said he has been on a low-fat diet
and dropped eight pounds in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started riding the bike, doing extra work and eating
different food,'' said Jokinen, who has been following the
nutritional advice of a Finnish friend. ``Some guys are joking that
I don't eat anymore. I just eat normal food. That's how I lost
weight, eating normal food and working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson said, ``A couple of weeks ago, we felt he
was carrying too much weight. He came to training camp at 210, 211
(pounds on a 6-foot-3 frame). He was up to 218. Now, he's back to
211, 212. He's got his jump back and he's much more of a physical
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   In a slump: The Kings' offense has been in a season-long,
team-wide slump. No one, it seems, is immune.
</P>
<P>
   Including Monday's loss, Russ Courtnall has no goals in 14
games, Luc Robitaille has one in seven, Craig Johnson has one in
14, Ray Ferraro has one in nine, Yanic Perreault has none in nine,
Sandy Moger has one in 16 and Pavel Rosa has one in 11. Johnson and
Rosa were healthy scratches Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jozef Stumpel's meaningless goal with 3:51 left Monday gives him
two goals in his last 13 games. Before suffering a knee injury last
week that is expected to sideline him for about three weeks, right
wing Vladimir Tsyplakov had not scored a goal in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War: Center Craig Conroy and defenseman Chris McAlpine
downplayed it later, but the teammates engaged in a wrestling match
during the Blues' practice Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get the puck, McAlpine slashed Conroy, who swung his
stick and clipped McAlpine on the head. McAlpine then responded
with his ``game slash'' - harder than the practice slash. This
raised Conroy's ire, and the two dropped their gloves and
eventually wrestled each other to the ice before teammates stepped
in.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the two had an animated discussion, but eventually were
laughing about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff happens, but it doesn't last more than the time it
takes for it to happen,'' Conroy said. ``It's over and you can joke
about it afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the bout was ``just frustration. If you're
winning, none of that stuff happens. It's a lot more fun. When
you're losing, everybody's a little testy.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The last memory most Houstonians have of Rashard Lewis was his
tearful draft-day mini-news conference.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lewis, the 6-10 product of Elsik High School, desperately wanted
the Rockets to select him with one of their three first-round
picks. He sat on the edge of his seat each time Houston's turn came
around, television cameras beaming Lewis' reaction all over the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets' selections came and went, and Lewis was still
sitting. In fact, the entire first round swept by without his name
being called.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was crestfallen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going to the Rockets, Lewis, who had been projected
by some to go as high as the 12th pick, dropped into the second
round, where the Seattle SuperSonics snapped him up with the 32nd
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to contain his disappointment, Lewis broke down, as one
might expect from a teen-ager who felt he had been jilted by a
longtime love. And like most every other teen-ager, Lewis no doubt
made up his mind to make sure that former love would come to regret
that decision.
</P>
<P>
   It might be working, because the next time local fans see him,
Lewis is more likely to have a broad smile stretching across his
face. He's happy with his new love, and it's obvious.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those everything-happens-for-a-reason stories, Lewis
is expected to be in the starting lineup tonight when the Sonics
take the floor at Compaq Center to play the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing,'' Lewis said during the lockout of his
draft-day ordeal. ``I wasn't going to let it get me down for long,
though. I figured I should start working on my game so I could go
up to Seattle and show them something.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has shown plenty.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of size, athleticism and shooting ability made
Lewis a standout during coach Paul Westphal's practices. Still, he
was a second-round pick on a team loaded with veterans.
</P>
<P>
   All Lewis needed was a break.
</P>
<P>
   And he got just that when Billy Owens broke his left pinky in
the Sonics' third practice. Westphal made a surprising decision,
opting to put Lewis, a forward, into the starting lineup at
shooting guard in the Sonics' Feb. 13 game against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have circumstances, he certainly wouldn't be
starting,'' Westphal said of Lewis. ``Billy would be. But I don't
want to artificially hold him back, either. I think this is the
best move.''
</P>
<P>
   With that move, Lewis became the youngest player in franchise
history to start a game, and the fourth-youngest starter in league
history. Lewis, who finished with eight points and five rebounds in
the Sonics' 105-92 victory, was 19 years, 189 days old when he
started his first game, trailing only the Lakers' Kobe Bryant (18
years, 159 days), Toronto's Tracy McGrady (18, 222) and Portland's
Jermaine O'Neal (19, 125).
</P>
<P>
   To say the Sonics have been surprised would be an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much time and money and resources as we spend on the
draft,'' Seattle general manager Wally Walker said, ``I always like
to stand up and say, `Hey, this is the guy we had targeted all
along.' But that's not even close to the truth. We didn't spend
much more than cursory time with him as we prepared for the
draft.''
</P>
<P>
   But just scant months later, here's Lewis, starting in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said he made the decision to start Lewis based on two
factors: He wanted to keep last year's starter, Hersey Hawkins, as
a weapon off the bench; and the youngster had proved he deserved to
get some meaningful minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get him some experience under his belt, if possible,
and I think this is the opportunity to do that,'' Westphal said.
``I think he has a real feel for the ball, a feel for rebounding.
He's not a player out there to put on a show; he's out there to be
efficient. He's a player that makes plays. It's rare for a kid that
young. He handles himself with a lot of maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gathering experience. This is a really nice luxury for us
to be able to use him, get him some experience and still win
games.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of his maturity came from an offseason of intensive
workouts at Westside Tennis Club, where Lewis played in regular
pickup games against Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille
O'Neal, Otis Thorpe, Rodney McCray, Mark Bryant, Othella Harrington
and Antonio McDyess. Shy and timid at first, Lewis blossomed under
the tutelage of the assembled veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he was surprised to find that veterans were willing
to show him the ropes and teach him some of the tricks of the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you hear all that about pros, but when I made
mistakes, they pulled me aside and told me what I needed to do to
make me better,'' he said. ``They told me things like to keep
playing and keep shooting. I was just waiting for the ball to come
my way, but they told me to be more aggressive and shoot the ball
more. They wanted me to get into the game more, and I guess I
needed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the lockout hurt many players and fans on various
levels, it actually benefited Lewis, who is averaging 3.7 points
and 2.8 rebounds in 12.3 minutes per game for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helped me a whole lot,'' Lewis said. ``The season
could have started a long time ago, and I'm not sure I would have
been ready then. Playing (at Westside during the lockout), I think
I learned a little bit more than I would have just going straight
in and playing with Seattle. Right now, I think I'm a better player
than I would have been if there hadn't been a lockout.''
</P>
<P>
   He's apparently a much better player than the Sonics
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to comprehend how advanced he is,'' Westphal said.
``I had all kinds of high school credentials and went on to a nice
career in the NBA. But I wasn't ready to play an NBA game when I
was 19. It's ridiculous to even think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know 18- and 19-year-olds. I think Rashard is
exceptionally mature in the way he handles himself. He restores my
faith in the youth of America.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN Kim Perrot spoke about her illness Monday, she first said she
had breast cancer. She made such an odd mistake for two reasons:
one, because she is more frightened than she has ever been 10 times
over, and two, because her closest friend and fellow Comet, Cynthia
Cooper, lost her mother 11 days ago to breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Cobbs died Feb. 12, one week before Perrot found herself
numbly sitting in a doctor's office at the Medical Center being
told about her own cancer. It had taken root in her lungs and
spread to her brain, where a tumor the size of a golf ball now
threatens her motor skills.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff in her chest is worse, though. It may threaten her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, perhaps the biggest little woman on the face of this
cruel planet, came to Westside Tennis Club to break the bad news to
us herself. So women are the weaker sex? The Braves' Andres
Galarraga sent a spokesman in his stead last week when it was
revealed he would miss the 1999 baseball season because of a tumor
on his spine.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to fault Galarraga. This is, however, to applaud the
fortitude inside Perrot, who will spend four hours under the knife
Wednesday morning while the top of her skull is temporarily removed
and the odious lump below is cut out.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery is not uncommon. Barring some terrible complication,
it won't kill her. But the procedure is merely the start of a
difficult ordeal. Radiation therapy on several other, smaller
tumors in the brain must follow. Then, chemotherapy will begin to
deal with the alveolar adenocarcinoma in her chest. That cancer is
an aggressive one, and it tends to respond poorly to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Why Kim?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just random bad luck,'' Comets physician Walt Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   But Perrot insists she will play in the WNBA again. While she
was speaking, albeit haltingly and tearfully, her coach, Van
Chancellor, sat to her right, his head slumped way forward. He
rubbed his eyes hard. If you looked closely, you could see tears
dripping from his cheeks into his lap.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't crying for an athlete. He was crying for a young woman
who might as well be his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot was never supposed to play for Chancellor. She wasn't
supposed to play for anybody in this newfangled American pro league
for women because, well, because she just wasn't good enough.
Cripes, look at her. A runt! She was fortunate she didn't get cut,
sight unseen, before she ever tugged on a pair of Comets practice
shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim has won every battle she's been in,'' the coach said.
``She can win this one, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot didn't reveal her fear when she fought long odds as a
wannabe Comet. If there were tears, we didn't see them. She simply
set her jaw, bowed her skinny back and won Chancellor's heart _
with hers.
</P>
<P>
   While Kim ran the show, the Comets won the first WNBA title,
then another. Her story _ I'd call it rags to riches, but she has
hardly gotten rich _ made her a much-coveted inspirational speaker.
She addressed a group at Rice on Sunday, never once intimating to
the enthusiastic crowd that she had black clouds over her head in
the form of black smudges on her MRIs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Raymond Sawaya, chairman of the department of neurosurgery
at M.D. Anderson and the man in whose skilled hands Perrot's future
initially rests, estimates his hospital annually performs some 200
of the operations Perrot will undergo. Many are complete successes;
some fail altogether. Most results are somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's cancer is unpredictable. There's no reason for it, nor any
rhyme to its pattern once inside the body. Perrot has yet to feel
any discomfort in her lungs. Every manifestation of the disease _
headaches, slight numbness on her right side and a slurring of
speech after a recent workout _ is the result of what Sawaya
concedes is a ``relatively large'' node inside her skull.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot is perhaps the last person in pro sports who would seem
disposed to such an interloper. She neither drinks nor smokes. Her
worst vice is a heated dominoes rivalry with Chancellor. She pretty
much lives to play ball, and she has played it amazingly well for
someone seemingly so ordinary. Possibly, she will play again.
Perrot, it seems, is not someone to carelessly bet against. But you
can't favor her chances. This is deadly stuff she's up against.
</P>
<P>
   Random bad luck. It can't be explained or understood, as with
the other unfair things that happen in the world every minute of
every day.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The road to a third straight National League
Central championship just got a little tougher for the Astros.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a day when position players began reporting for spring
training, the Astros learned Monday that All-Star outfielder Moises
Alou will miss most, if not all, of the 1999 season with a torn
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Alou, 32, hurt himself
last week when he fell off a treadmill while training at his home
in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a devastating blow,'' said Astros general manager
Gerry Hunsicker, whose best-case scenario has Alou missing no fewer
than five months. ``This is one of the fears you live with in this
business and hope you never have to address. This was the worst
possible scenario for this injury. For all intents and purposes,
he's out for the year. I think the best we could hope for is that
he returns sometime in late August or early September.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were holding out hope the injury was not serious. But
their worst fears were confirmed when an MRI in Houston by team
physician Dr. David Litner revealed a torn ACL.
</P>
<P>
   Alou was ushered through the back door at Methodist Hospital on
Monday afternoon and was unavailable for comment. He immediately
boarded a plane for Miami, where he may seek a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Alou finished third in the NL Most Valuable Player voting last
season behind Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire. In his first season with
the Astros, Alou hit .312 with a team-leading 38 home runs and 124
RBIs in helping the club win a second consecutive NL Central
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said Alou was hurt Thursday when he tried to adjust
the controls on a treadmill that was going too fast, lost his
balance and caught his knee in the crevice between the treadmill
belt and frame. He also hurt his left thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery has not been scheduled, but Hunsicker expects it to
happen sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Astros did not believe the injury was severe.
Hunsicker thought it could be a cartilage problem that would
sideline Alou for three to four weeks. Alou flew to Houston on
Sunday night and walked unassisted and without a noticeable limp
upon arrival at Bush Intercontinental Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was shocked by this diagnosis,'' Hunsicker said. ``I
think he was really stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou's agent, Bob Gilhooly, said his client was taking the news
hard after suffering what may well be his third season-ending
injury in the past eight-plus years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never had injuries that have been just nagging,''
Gilhooly said. ``It's always something catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1990, Alou suffered a torn rotator cuff in his right
shoulder while diving back to first base on a pickoff attempt in
the Dominican Winter League, forcing him to have surgery and miss
the Montreal Expos' entire 1991 season. In 1993, he suffered a
dislocated left ankle and fractured leg when his spikes got caught
in AstroTurf as he made a quick stop after rounding first base. He
missed the final three weeks of that season.
</P>
<P>
   Alou has been on the disabled list seven times since being
drafted in the first round by Pittsburgh in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Minus Alou, a member of the Florida Marlins' World Series
championship team in 1997, the Astros will likely start the season
with an outfield alignment of 23-year-old Richard Hidalgo in left
field, Carl Everett in center and Derek Bell in right.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to replace him,'' Hunsicker said. ``Just like
(Jeff) Bagwell, (Craig) Biggio and Bell, you don't replace those
All-Star-caliber players. When you have a contending club, depth is
just vital. It's what separates a contending club from the rest of
the pack. It's like an insurance policy. If you don't buy one, then
need it and don't have it, you're in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Astros avoided any prolonged injuries to their
front-line players. Bagwell, Billy Wagner and Mike Hampton spent
time on the disabled list but were out for no more than three
weeks. Hidalgo separated his right shoulder after colliding with
the center-field wall at Denver's Coors Field and was sidelined for
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who was traded by the Marlins to the Astros in 1997,
played in all but three of the Astros' 162 games last season and
set career highs in almost every offensive category, including
homers, RBIs, hits (182), runs (104) and doubles (34).
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said the focus now shifts toward solidifying the
fourth and fifth outfield spots. Dave Clark most likely will get
one of the spots, and the Astros have a pool of players, including
Glen Barker, Ryan Thompson, Alex Diaz and Brent Bowers, to choose
from for the other. All except Barker have major-league experience.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said the club would not explore acquiring an
experienced outfielder outside the organization at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time that would become an alternative is if we don't
have the talent in camp to fill those spots,'' he said. ``I think
that would be premature to suggest that we would be focusing
outside. I'd like to see what we have in camp first and give those
players an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will also use spring training to learn to live
without Alou. Manager Larry Dierker admitted the loss of Alou
weakens his club and said its task becomes significantly tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a body blow but not a knockout,'' Dierker said. ``I think
we're still a good club but not as good as yesterday (before the
news). I would have projected us as probably a playoff team. I take
that word probably now to possibly.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN P. LOPEZ  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The ironic coincidence is how it happened.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moises Alou was running in place _ making good time but getting
nowhere. He was spinning his feet on a treadmill, working hard but
not moving forward even an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly and strangely, something happened that left Alou caught
in a point of no return, tangled in the tread and tripping
backward. It ended with Alou sprawled on the ground, his entire
season torn apart like the ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours earlier, the Astros had broken off the Roger Clemens
trade negotiations because of a worry that ultimately they, too,
might be running in place had they pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The Clemens trade surely would have sold tickets, brought home a
hero and given the pitching staff a boost as broad as Clemens'
shoulders and overwhelming as his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   But what if? Would a single twist of fate ultimately leave the
Astros making good time but not moving forward even if they had
Clemens?
</P>
<P>
   It was a worry that constantly ran through the minds of skipper
Larry Dierker and general manager Gerry Hunsicker. At what cost
Clemens?
</P>
<P>
   The Clemens deal likely would have cost the Astros at least one
outfielder, maybe two. Derek Bell and his 600-plus at-bats, his
.314 average and 108 RBIs probably would have gone to Toronto along
with his experience.
</P>
<P>
   What if something were to happen to Alou? The Astros wondered.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Carl Everett would have gone in the deal. Maybe Richard
Hidalgo. Maybe Dave Clark would have been a throw-in. While none of
those outfielders is an established every-day player, all are
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   And with the outfielder would have gone a pitcher _ not Scott
Elarton but maybe a proven starter like Mike Hampton, the only
lefty on the starting staff. The minor-league prospects would have
been culled, too.
</P>
<P>
   What if? The Astros wondered.
</P>
<P>
   What if something strange, unexpected and fateful happened to
Alou, the only time-tested outfielder who would have remained?
</P>
<P>
   Clemens could do a lot for this team, but what he couldn't do
was hit .312 with 38 home runs and 124 RBIs like Alou. He could
throw 95 mph, but he could not offer the outfield depth or key hits
of a Hidalgo or Everett.
</P>
<P>
   And how would taking such a risk in the outfield jibe with the
risk already taken behind the plate, with Brad Ausmus traded to
Detroit and the reins to the catching duties handed over to the
young and unproven Mitch Meluskey?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have left us basically with two positions where we
were unproven,'' Hunsicker said, referring to catcher and the
full-time outfield duties either Everett or Hidalgo would have
taken had Bell been traded. ``The more unproven every-day players
you have, the bigger the risk. The more inexperience, the more
unpredictable it becomes. We kept thinking we might be more
vulnerable to injury and have less flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the snap in Alou's left knee was a devastating blow to the
Astros' hopes, but it didn't crush them. There is flexibility in
the outfield, if not a player who can replace Alou's 1998 numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And while the trade of the veteran Ausmus was a risky move, in a
twist as ironic as the one that will leave Alou out of action
through at least most of 1999, it was a major factor in the Astros'
passing on Clemens and feeling better today about Alou's injury.
</P>
<P>
   Had Ausmus not been traded, Hunsicker and the Astros would have
been more inclined to let go of Bell and get Clemens. With Ausmus
still around, it would have meant only one unproven regular player
would have to enter the lineup instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros might have been more willing to deal for Clemens. But
in the wake of Alou's injury, the Astros would have been in quite a
pickle today.
</P>
<P>
   The outfield would have consisted entirely of players who have
never played every day in the big leagues _ Hidalgo, Everett and
Clark. How many teams have won a division with a rookie catcher and
essentially an entirely new every-day outfield?
</P>
<P>
   ``Depth is everything,'' Hunsicker said. ``Too many people
underestimate its importance. (During the Clemens trade talks), we
kept asking ourselves, `If something happens, could we handle
it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Something very bad happened. But while it remains to be seen how
the Astros will respond without Alou, the prospects in the outfield
are much more solid. Bell will be in right field, Everett likely
will start in center, and Hidalgo will be in left.
</P>
<P>
   Clark should come off the bench, and the speedy Glen Barker, who
came from Detroit in the Ausmus deal and offers more depth, figures
to make the big club. And certainly somewhere, the much-heralded
Lance Berkman is wondering when the call will come.
</P>
<P>
   Has a GM ever earned Executive of the Year votes for the trade
he did not make? Has a trade widely considered ``minor,'' like the
one of Ausmus, ever proved to be bigger in the big picture?
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of questions to be answered without Alou, but
one that should not be asked about the pass on Clemens is, ``What
if?''

FLAMES DEFEAT RANGERS, 6-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ It is difficult enough for a veteran team to
play 7 games in 11 days with the last two ending on consecutive
nights in a time zone two hours west of home. It is even more of a
problem when a top defenseman for that team leaves with an injury
early in the game. And it makes things worse when the best player
on the opposition is motivated by what amounts to a pre-game
farewell ceremony before fans who admire him.
</P>
<P>
   This unfortunate team on Monday night was the New York Rangers,
who fell by 6-2 to the Calgary Flames in the Saddledome, a result
that ended their two-game winning streak and prevented then from
moving within 2 points of a playoff berth. The injured defenseman
is Ulf Samuelsson, a rough customer who doesn't usually stay hurt
long. And the burning Flame was Theo Fleury, who scored on
Calgary's first shot of the game and then set up a power-play goal
to put his team up by two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Any chance of a Ranger comeback ended at the five-minute mark of
the third period when Cory Stillman scored a short-handed goal,
giving the Flames a 5-1 lead, after a turnover by Brian Leetch on a
long pass in his own zone. Leetch, who played almost 23 minutes in
the first two periods, looked fatigued. He has been playing around
30 minutes a game. A major part of the Rangers' attack, the captain
has three goals in his last 32 games. For Calgary, Stillman had two
goals and so did Phil Housley. Kevin Stevens and Manny Malhotra
scored for the Rangers. The Flames are undefeated in five games and
are 6-1-5 in their last 12.
</P>
<P>
   The early minutes of the game ruined the goalie-rotation plans
of Coach John Muckler. Although Mike Richter stopped 39 of 40
Edmonton shots in a 2-1 victory over the Oilers in overtime on
Sunday night, Muckler started the rookie Dan Cloutier on Monday
night. It was part of a plan to establish a rotation that would
still give Richter the majority of games while exposing Cloutier to
more competition. But Cloutier, who had won his previous two
starts, failed to finish the first six minutes and Richter replaced
him after the Flames had a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cloutier said he was screened on the first goal but that he did
see the second goal. He said he would not be discouraged. ``No
point in sitting on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other piece of early bad news concerned Samuelsson, who left
the game early in the first period with a groin strain. Samuelsson
will have four days to recover. The team does not play again until
Friday night, when Phoenix visits Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson said he was injured in a 6-1 victory over Pittsburgh
last Friday when a puck hit him high on the right thigh. ``Really
weak,'' he said, referring to the muscle in the injured area. ``I
tweaked it a couple of times in warm-ups tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson said that doctors told him he needs about a week to
recover but that he might be back before then.
</P>
<P>
   The Ranger news got worse after the game when Muckler said that
Todd Harvey would probably miss the next four weeks to recover from
a broken thumb on his right hand. Harvey, who has been an
inspirational player despite injuries, has missed the last three
games because he has problems gripping his stick. Harvey said he
expected his right hand to be placed in a hard cast and that he
hoped to return in less than one month.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's game began with a ceremony honoring Fleury, the
veteran Flames right wing who will probably leave the team soon as
an unrestricted free agent. Making $2.4 million this season, Fleury
recently killed a proposed trade to the Los Angeles Kings, who were
willing to sign him for $25 million over four seasons. Fleury
turned it down and said he did not want to leave the Flames this
season, preferring to stay for the struggle to make the playoffs.
Calgary is not expected to re-sign him in the summer for budget
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony marked Fleury's 823rd point as a Flame, breaking
the team record of 822 set by Al MacInnis, who now plays for St.
Louis. Among the gifts Fleury got was a silver stick. He used a
more traditional tool to open the scoring at 2 minutes 47 seconds,
beating Cloutier on the glove side off the rush on the first Flames
shot of the game. It was Fleury's 30th goal of the season. Then
Fleury set up Valery Bure on the power play at 5:09 to give the
Flames a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the Flames went up by 3-0 on Housley's goal, the Rangers
got one back on a power play when Wayne Gretkzy set up Stevens, who
beat goalie Fred Brathwaite from short range. But the Flames got it
back 13 seconds later when Richter misplayed the puck to the
corner, stumbled, stopped a shot while sprawling but lay helplessly
while Stillman backhanded the rebound into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler winced when someone suggested that the busy schedule may
have accounted for fatigue and a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' Muckler said. ``I hate using excuses. we don't have
any space for feeling sorry for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The game marked another day in Gretzky's quest to break Gordie
Howe's record of 1,071 goals accumulated in the National Hockey
League and World Hockey Association in both the regular season and
the playoffs. Although the record is not officially recognized by
the NHL, it is real and it is significant. Gretzky has one goal in
his last 18 games, two in his last 28 and eight for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's name was chanted heartily by the Calgary fans during
his final shifts. He finished the game with no shots on goal but
had a scoring chance late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I would have done it last night in Edmonton,'' said
Gretzky, 38, who has not said whether his 20th NHL season will be
his last. ``I wish I could have done it tonight.''

VAN EXEL, NUGGETS BEAT LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Sometime this summer, a wrecking ball will knock
McNichols Sports Arena into the pro basketball graveyard, and the
Los Angeles Lakers can only hope any record of Monday night's game
is buried in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't just lose, they lost the second straight in a
three-day set. And they didn't just lose to anyone, they lost to
the lowly Denver Nuggets. Worse, the final blows were dealt by the
one Nugget the Lakers least wanted to wreck their road trip.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Nick Van Exel?
</P>
<P>
   The exiled former Lakers guard scored seven of the Nuggets' 13
points in overtime to lead his new team to an astounding 117-113
upset of the team that gave up on him.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Van Exel would gloat or anything, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, it's great,'' Van Exel said, then quipped, ``Best
win I've had since I've been in Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets' second win in 10 games came at the expense of a
Lakers team already reeling from a loss 24 hours earlier in
Seattle. And with a flight back to the Pacific Northwest to play in
Vancouver, B.C. tonight, the possibility of an 0-3 road trip _ and
a 6-6 record _ looms like, well, a wrecking ball over the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperation?'' Eddie Jones said, repeating a reporter's
question. ``That's a great word to use. I think a better word is,
we need a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the math; he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, despite 26 points and a near triple-double from Kobe
Bryant, 28 points from Shaquille O'Neal, 17 from Jones and a
season-high 24 from Elden Campbell off the bench, the Lakers
coughed up their most embarrassing loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost,'' Bryant said, ``to a team we should have beat by
20.''
</P>
<P>
   They had them by 12, anyway, early in the fourth quarter. But
then Chauncey Billups found a home behind the arc and started
carpet-bombing. Billups hit a trio of 3-point shots and scored 15
points in the fourth, his last 3-pointer concluding a 20-9 run that
gave Denver a 104-103 lead with 54 seconds remaining in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had a chance to regain the Lakers' lead, but he hit only
one of two free throws to tie the game, then fouled out and sent
Antonio McDyess to the line. McDyess missed both free throws and
Campbell got the rebound, only to have it stolen by ... Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   It hadn't been the best night for Van Exel in regulation _ he
dished out 12 assists, but hit 1 of 12 shots and it appeared his
former team would beat him a second time in 12 days. But he opened
overtime with a 3-pointer and fed Raef LaFrentz on a slam dunk as
the Nuggets pulled ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Without O'Neal, the Lakers tried to win on Campbell's low-post
game, but he went 1 for 4 and had a pair swatted away by McDyess
before fouling out with a 113-106 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have to give Nick Van Exel a lot of credit,'' coach Del Harris
said of his old nemesis. ``His assisting was spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel was not so charitable. And it was hard to blame him.
Losses like this were once pinned on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I watch them, I see the same thing, a lack of
intensity.... Same thing we were going through last year. Guys
really aren't having fun out there,'' he said. ``It's beautiful for
me, because I think a lot of people in management and Del thought I
was that problem. And no, I'm not that problem. They know their
problem. They've gotta address that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Shaquille O'Neal literally asked to be fined Sunday in
Seattle, and by the time he arrived in Denver on Monday, his wish
had been granted. The NBA fined O'Neal $10,000 for his postgame
rant against officials after the Lakers' 92-89 loss to the Sonics.
Of the fine, O'Neal said, ``Whoop-de-(bleeping)-do. And they can
take 10 (thousand) more, too.... It's just like a tax.... If David
Stern wants to be FICA, he can be FICA.''

LAKERS GET READY FOR THE CIRCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Dennis Rodman is coming, and Kobe Bryant knows this
much about the imminent arrival of his new Los Angeles Lakers
teammate: ``It's gonna be bananas.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-week build-up to Rodman's signing will soon give way
to the three-ring circus only he can create. And it's already
starting.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds of the locker room being opened before tipoff
Monday, three TV cameras and six reporters were staring Bryant in
the face, armed with questions about the multi-tattooed,
cross-dressing rebounding specialist.
</P>
<P>
   And this is just the prelude. Are they ready for the crush?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can prepare for it,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers will take it, if it means Rodman providing 15
rebounds a game and defense against Karl Malone, Vin Baker and
Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for us to focus on is Dennis adds rebounds
to this team,'' said Bryant, who is happy with the acquisition.
``It can take a lot of pressure off of Shaquille (O'Neal).''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is likely to sign a two-year deal for the veterans
minimum salary _ $1 million per season as a player with 10-plus
years _ sometime today. He could be in uniform as early as Thursday
night's game at Anaheim against the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, nothing's certain with Rodman, who reportedly was
ready to sign several times in the past few weeks, only to drag the
process out longer.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Del Harris wasn't making any immediate plans for Rodman's
arrival, or even making any statements about his presumptive new
starting power forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until he's actually put the ink on the paper, it really is too
early for me to say anything,'' Harris said. ``I've learned that in
my 20-plus years in the league that nothing is final until it's
final.''
</P>
<P>
   And once it's official, the true test of the Lakers' focus will
commence. Though Rodman has been talked about as the missing piece
to the Lakers' championship aspirations, the talk among the Lakers
was not about titles, but about balancing Rodman's potential
negatives with his contributions.
</P>
<P>
   As Bryant put it, ``I think it's gonna be even more of a
challenge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And someone who knows the Lakers well thinks they may not be up
to that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dennis wants to be Dennis the rebounder that he is, they
could be fine,'' said ex-Laker Nick Van Exel, ``but if he wants to
come in with all the gimmicks and antics, that's when they're gonna
run into all the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Without veteran leaders with championship rings, such as Michael
Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the Lakers might not be equipped to
handle Rodman, Van Exel said. ``I don't know if he really respects
Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Harris couldn't get along with a strong personality like
Van Exel, does he stand a chance with Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny. Comical. I would love to see it,'' Van Exel said.
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks it's a bad move. ``I can't see anything good out
of it, really. I think they have a championship team right now,
with all the pieces in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Those pieces are easily scrambled by Rodman's personality, as
the San Antonio Spurs once learned. Derek Harper, the 15-year
veteran now in command of this young team, believes, or at least
hopes, Rodman's antics will not be a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it couldn't,'' he said, ``because I don't want it to be a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anything in the world can sidetrack me or
break my concentration,'' Harper said. ``We can ill-afford to be
side-tracked at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones said he wasn't thinking about Rodman's arrival and
responded with a combination of disinterest and apparent
trepidation. But he said Rodman could bring ``some laughter, some
fun'' and some entertainment to a team in need of it. And he
believes Rodman's knack for distraction could be an asset when
turned on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets up under (Karl) Malone's skin,'' Jones said of the
Jazz forward, who has killed the Lakers in two straight
postseasons. ``That's gonna be a great distraction.''

   They've become anachronisms, Roxie, these old concepts _ musty
words from the old school that just don't cut it anymore in the
``Just win now, baby, at all costs'' school of pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   Class and dignity get thrown out with the trash when a proud
franchise that brought NBA championships to Los Angeles with class
acts like Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic
Johnson go slumming and hire a worm to try to win another one.
</P>
<P>
   A one-man freak show named Dennis Rodman who doesn't have the
class and dignity in his whole tattooed, pierced, butt-ugly body
that men like Roy Campanella and Jackie Robinson had in one pinkie.
</P>
<P>
   Like you suggested Monday, Roxie, this guy must have flunked
American history. He doesn't have a clue, much less care, about
what went on before he graced Earth with his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy and Jackie took so many insults, and had so many things
done to them, but they never let any of it affect their class and
dignity,'' Roxie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew that by keeping their heads high _ by being men, not
boys _ they were making it better for the black kids coming up
after them. But a guy like this _ Rodman _ he's destroying it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of trail is he blazing?'' she asked. ``He's turning
it into a freak show. Roy and Jackie would go crazy if they were
still here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have a fit because we're letting it all slip away. Our
class and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully said, Roxie.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing is there are so few people from the old school
around, or willing, to throw that fit for Roy and Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   Someone to burst in the front office of sports moguls who hire
druggies, wife-beaters, rapists, bullies and other assorted forms
of low life only because they can jump, run, skate or hit a ball
farther than a guy without criminal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Someone to stand up for the tradition of Roy and Jackie, and
say: ``What the hell is going on? This is what we tore down the
color line for? A freak show?''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be wonderful, Roxie, if just one more time we went
into an arena, ballpark or football stadium and watched class and
dignity beat the freaks and felons?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know. I'm dreaming again. That's thinking from another
age. The old school.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new day. New fans, too, I guess. Guys like Rodman sell
tickets and help deliver championships. That's all that counts.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Lakers are telling us, aren't they? Sign Rodman,
and pass Jerry West some Rolaids.
</P>
<P>
   If pro basketball's bad boy wants to smack around some women,
cross-dress, act like a damned fool and, in general, spit in
society's eye _ hey, what's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Lighten up. He's just blazing another trail.
</P>
<P>
   And what a grand trail it is _ isn't it?

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Late in the first half of Sunday's Sonics-Lakers game
at KeyArena, Shaquille O'Neal took a pass on the right side of the
key, turned and started to thunder his way hoopward.
</P>
<P>
   Olden Polynice moved into his way _ believed to be a first for a
Sonic center since O'Neal became a Laker.
</P>
<P>
   The bump of upper torsos wasn't enough to make a foul, but it
was just enough to disturb O'Neal's footwork. He lost his dribble
out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a dramatic turnover, nor was it the first time
O'Neal has been denied. But it marked a shrewd, vital maneuver at
the heart of the Sonic success _ and the point of O'Neal's
obscenity-festooned laments after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you about it, man,'' Polynice said, grinning. ``I
can't give away the scouting report.''
</P>
<P>
   He later acknowledged what could be seen by close observation _
the Sonic plan was to keep O'Neal from planting both feet for his
power move. Once O'Neal is set, a defender might have more luck
pushing over a grain silo.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as O'Neal is striding, he has a chance to be nudged
off-balance. Considering the numerous close-in shots that rimmed
out, the nudge worked just often enough to deny him a handful of
baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, O'Neal uses terms other than nudge, and his
colorfulness will require you to use your imagination. Based on the
fine issued by the NBA Monday, they were $10,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   But were some tactics by Polynice illegal, as O'Neal claimed? Is
there a double standard of rules application, as he charged?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and yes. And since O'Neal benefits from both at least as
much as he is hindered, here's some intimate advice for the NBA's
leading scorer:
</P>
<P>
   Shut up.
</P>
<P>
   A frame-by-frame video breakdown of the contact between Polynice
and O'Neal probably would reveal enough specific violations both
ways to draw criminal charges, never mind six fouls each.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't happen, because NBC doesn't want to televise
free-throw contests. The network already has Ahmad Rashad to fill
its boredom quota.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Polynice was guilty of the two-hand push to the back,
O'Neal was guilty of the off-arm hook as he powers to the hoop. But
O'Neal almost always skates by on that offensive foul. Just as he
gets by with the big man's hippity-hop.
</P>
<P>
   That was a maneuver mastered by former Houston great Moses
Malone, who was always shuffling his feet under the boards while in
possession of the ball. But he was so quick and active under the
boards that it became a trademark that almost never generated a
call of traveling.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the NBA allows a sort of liberal
interpretation of its laws once a good player establishes a
trademark move or style.
</P>
<P>
   If NBA officials were strict constructionists, Michael Jordan
might have been just another pretty good jump shooter, since his
frequent violations of rules concerning traveling and palming the
ball would have retired his method of driving to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, it's instructive to watch Gary Payton during his
money move in the low post. With his back to the basket and the
defender, Payton wiggles backward, fakes one way and then whirls
his lead shoulder the other way, nearly lunging past his helpless
foe. The trailing hand carries the ball almost above his plunging
head, and he seems to run the length of Rhode Island between
dribbles.
</P>
<P>
   Never gets called.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure where the line should be drawn. What I am sure
about is that every sport has similar latitudes toward rules
interpretation. From football's permission for offensive linemen to
hold, to baseball's OK for double-play makers to be merely in the
neighborhood of second base when they catch the ball for the pivot,
the pro sports attitude is to allow the game to be played, and
players to star, short of egregious abuse of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's rage against the uncalled foul is understandable,
because defense against him typically is not so much a style or a
move as it is a counterpunch. But O'Neal is the initiator of much
contact because his bullrushes provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   If he were a jump-shooter or a high-post slasher, I could
understand the martyrdom. But Shaq is a runaway truck, and the
floor slopes downhill wherever he's standing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Lakers led the NBA in free throws attempted, and
O'Neal had more per game than anyone in the league except for Karl
Malone. Think of it this way: A running back is going to get
tackled more often than a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   So, big fella, save your wounded soul for the rap CDs. Keep the
martyrdom act for the director of your next movie. If you need a
public psyche-flushing, call Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   Just spare the rest of us your view of your tortured existence.
I mean, it's not as if going to the free-throw line is a positive
experience for you.

<P>
   Q: The owner of our company always finds an opportunity to brag
about his money, his cars, his trips, his houses and his
possessions, and we are all tired of listening to this. We work
hard and are rewarded well, but his tendency to fill us in on the
details of his newest acquisitions is getting hard to take. What
can you say to this? M.F.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Although you would probably like to say something like,
``Enough,'' there is never enough for this person. The reality is
that no matter what you say to him, he is not likely to change.
What you are seeing is a reflection of his personality, and his
tendency to count his money in public is one of his enduring, if
not endearing, traits. There are probably parallels to this type of
bragging behavior in other aspects of his work, and they may even
help the business succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your relationship with him, you or one of your
associates can act as a spokesman for the team and have a private
heart-to-heart discussion with him. However, no matter how gently
you package your comments, you are likely to meet with
defensiveness, disbelief, or even arrogance. For example, he may
indicate that if more of you were like him, the company would be
doing even better. He may feel that the company needs more
braggers, not less.
</P>
<P>
   In a word, his personality is one of the realities of working
for him. He probably has many strengths as well, but the real
question is whether you have the strength to listen to his constant
bragging.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The vice president of our company hovers over the fax
machine. He is a ``control freak'' who has to see everything coming
over through the fax. One fax that was clearly addressed to me was
given to another employee. He claimed he didn't see my name on it,
but after a 45-minute discussion, he finally admitted to seeing my
name but didn't forward it to me. Why did he lie to me? I don't
understand this behavior. O.D.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: If this vice president is lying to become a card-carrying
control freak, he is going to have to do more than park at the fax
machine misdirecting incoming messages, and then denying and
ultimately admitting what he did. Rather than trying to obtain any
further admissions from him, it will make more sense for you to get
a commitment from him that he will no longer interfere with faxes
that are addressed to you.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the bigger picture, why in the world should you need
that kind of a commitment from a vice president in the first place?
Surely there must be someone above this individual who believes
that there are better things for this vice president to do with his
time than play fax collector.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I just completed the evaluation of one of our employees who
reports to me, and I had asked her to complete the same form prior
to our getting together. The interesting thing is that she rated
herself lower than I rated her in many categories. I am wondering
if this points to a lack of confidence on her part. What do you
think? S.C. &QL; 
A: Your employee's rigorous rating of herself can be a reflection
of any number of factors, including honesty, high standards,
humility, or even confusion over the rating scale. The difference
between your rating and hers provides the basis for a very
productive discussion regarding objectives, performance criteria,
priorities, deadlines and mutual expectations.
</P>
<P>
   There is very little that you can conclude from your employee's
self-ratings without this type of discussion. However, it is
interesting to note that studies have found that high achieving
individuals tend to look back at their performance and focus more
on the areas in which they could have done better, as opposed to
focusing on their many accomplishments. This employee may be
signaling a high need for achievement, and this can be important
motivational information.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, her lower self-ratings may indicate that she needs
more feedback regarding her performance. She may be picking up less
than stellar cues from you, and, as a result, she is feeling less
positive about her work. In this regard, it is interesting to note
that your employee's evaluation of herself can be a valuable source
of feedback for you.

 CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS OFFER $2.3 BILLION CONSERVATION BILL  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Framed by stunning views of San Francisco Bay
and the Golden Gate Bridge, California Sen. Barbara Boxer and Rep.
George Miller unveiled ambitious legislation Monday at the Presidio
that would earmark $2.3 billion annually for everything from
renovating decaying urban parks to purchasing thousands of acres of
land for public recreation and endangered species protection.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed Resources 2000, the proposal drew enthusiastic plaudits
from attending Bay Area politicians, particularly San Francisco
Supervisor Michael Yaki, who sees it as an opportunity to restore
Golden Gate Park's sagging infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said some of the money could also be used to provide a
long-overdue renovation for the U.S. Mint in San Francisco, which
was closed in 1994 because of earthquake safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill probably won't pass in the precise form Boxer
and Miller presented, insiders say the chances of passing a major
federal land and water conservation bill this year are good, given
unusual bipartisan support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The bill by Miller and Boxer, both Democrats, would fully fund
the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was established in 1965
to use revenues from offshore oil development to purchase land for
conservation and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Congress allowed $900 million annually for the fund. But with
the exception of one or two years in the 1970s, only a small
fraction of that figure has ever made it into the program's yearly
budget.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past 30 years, the lion's share of revenue from
offshore oil development has been diverted to the federal general
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Resources 2000 would do two things: It would fully pay for the
Land and Water Conservation Fund and it would establish new funds
for urban and regional parks, fisheries conservation, endangered
species protection and farm and rangeland preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide the full $900 million for the Land and
Water Conservation Fund and $1.4 billion for seven ancillary
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to restore the commitment made to the American
people 30 years ago,'' said Miller, of Martinez. ``This will
provide states, local communities, farmers and others the resources
they need'' for environmental restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, for her part, invoked conservationist President Theodore
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a comprehensive long-term strategy so our children's
children can herald our actions as we do T.R.'s today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was something of a love-fest between Boxer and
Miller, as she presented him with a pair of pince-nez similar to
the ones Roosevelt wore.
</P>
<P>
   ``With George's mustache, I think he looks like T.R.,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yaki was ebullient at the prospect of securing federal funds for
renovating Golden Gate Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``All cities and counties have a chart they don't like to show
the public,'' he said, ``and that's the one for deferred
maintenance and infrastructure for urban parks. Finally, we have a
bill that can address that. It's a godsend.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond, Calif., Mayor Rosemary Corbin said the bill could help
establish a large city park, benefiting many city residents who
spend their lives surrounded by concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a linear park that will cut through some of
our poorest neighborhoods,'' she said. ``(To us), that's what this
bill is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Resources 2000 is competing with bills offered by other federal
legislators, including one by Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, that would
fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but would also
provide incentives for increased offshore oil development.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., will probably introduce
legislation of her own to provide enhanced revenues for the Land
and Water Conservation Fund, said Jay Watson, the California and
Nevada Regional Director for the Wilderness Society. Watson noted
that President Clinton has also called for pumping money into the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Kapolczynski, Boxer's California director, said Resources
2000 is superior to the other proposals ``because it is off-budget.
It guarantees full funding in perpetuity, and it doesn't provide
drilling incentives, like Young's bill does.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the president's proposal goes, said Kapolczynski, ``it
would subject the money to the full appropriation process. It could
be diverted in any given year.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said the Boxer-Miller bill is ``the high water mark, the
thing to aim for.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill may not pass intact, said Watson, he expects
that significant land and water conservation legislation will come
out of the current Congress and be signed into law by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important and exciting here is that bipartisan momentum
is building to make the funding permanent and secure,'' Watson
said. ``Both sides want it.''

 MEDICAL WORKERS AT RISK IN BLOOD COLLECTION, U.S. WARNS  &HT;     By APRIL LYNCH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of health care workers risk exposure to deadly
blood-borne diseases each year because of accidents caused by
broken blood collection tubes, federal health and safety
investigators warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2,800 health care workers are injured by broken
glass blood collection tubes every year, according to the
Occupational Health and Safety Administration. One doctor in
Maryland died from an HIV infection contracted in a blood
collection tube accident.
</P>
<P>
   Health care workers can also contract diseases such as hepatitis
B or hepatitis C from exposure to infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the injuries could be prevented by changing the way
blood is collected or examined, OSHA officials said in a warning
issued in conjunction with the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health and the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The glass tubes in question are familiar to almost anyone who
has ever had a blood test. The tubes are used for blood collection
everywhere from hospitals to blood donation centers and doctors'
offices. Collected blood is drawn into the tubes and sent to
laboratories for testing.
</P>
<P>
   Most accidents occur when the tubes are being sealed or placed
in centrifuge machines to start some testing procedures. Pressure
on the tubes sometimes causes them to shatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood can spatter, potentially exposing (health care)
personnel to blood-borne pathogens,'' the OSHA warning said. ``The
broken glass fragments can also injure the user, resulting in
exposure to blood.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA and the other federal agencies said other types of
collection devices and methods should be used to reduce the risk of
accidents from broken glass tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Among those recommended are tubes made of materials other than
glass or those wrapped in puncture-resistant film, tubes that are
safer to seal and blood testing that does not require putting blood
samples  &LR;

FAA HAS FAILED TO INCREASE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS AT AIRCRAFT REPAIR
STATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE, Wash. _ Safety problems at aviation repair stations are
well known to government investigators nationwide. Over the years,
sloppy repairs and slipshod equipment installation have been
identified as a factor in or the cause of several aircraft
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board reported that several
people were injured on June 8, 1995, when the engine of a ValuJet
plane exploded on takeoff from Atlanta. Investigators said the
engine failed because repair station workers failed to do a proper
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, according to the safety board, a fatigue
fracture ``undetected or improperly repaired'' at a repair station
caused a propeller to rip off a Southeast Airlines plane cruising
18,000 feet above western Georgia. Eight people were killed and 21
injured as the pilot fought to land the disabled aircraft in a
hayfield.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, 1996, 110 passengers died in the flaming crash of
another ValuJet DC-9 in the alligator-infested Florida Everglades.
The fire began in the cargo hold, caused by oxygen generators
improperly packaged and identified at a repair station.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were still waist-deep in swamp water at the crash
site as members of Congress were demanding immediate changes in the
way the Federal Aviation Administration monitors the nation's 2,800
third-party repair stations. With great flourish that FAA announced
it was going to increase the number and intensity of inspections.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA first promised to improve regulation of repair stations
and the qualifications and abilities of station workers in 1989.
But according to the General Accounting Office, the improvements
have been repeatedly delayed, as has the FAA's pledge to increase
the number of inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the FAA had about 600 inspectors responsible for the
intricate examinations. No new inspectors are expected to be added
in the near future. With the FAA having to find money for air
traffic control's pay raises, a wide hiring freeze has been
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, third-party repair stations are gaining popularity:
The FAA estimates that repairs, maintenance and mandatory
inspections of nearly half the nation's 6,900 passenger and cargo
planes are contracted out to privately operated repair stations in
the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Having work done at the FAA-certified stations can be a
money-saver for airlines that want to avoid the enormous cost of
huge hangars, specialized tools and mechanics with special skills.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stations are little more than mom-and-pop operations
that fix specific cockpit instruments. Others tackle complex jobs
such as engine repair. A few, such as Everett's Tramco, offer
nose-to-tail services with FAA certification to rebuild an entire
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   While FAA inspectors have found problems at Tramco, no crashes
or accidents have been attributed to work done there.
</P>
<P>
   Regulating aircraft repair shops is never easy. While everyone
shares the same FAA Bible, interpreting the regulatory scripture
can lead to problems.
</P>
<P>
   There are tens of thousands of precisely worded Federal Air
Regulations _ or FARs _ guiding every possible aspect of flying.
There are FARs governing the design, construction and installation
every screw, bolt, cable, engine, electrical item, control device,
seat and piece of metal on an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations also control who is authorized to maintain these
items, the manuals they use and how and when the maintenance is to
be done.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes can boil over, with FAA lawyers and repair plant
operators dickering on penalties when violations are found. Options
include suspension or revocation of the station's FAA license to
operate, a letter of correction, a letter of reprimand or a cash
fine that could range into the millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   FAA field inspectors lament that the fines often have no
relation to the severity of the violation _ with companies that
count profits in millions of dollars ordered to pay just $800 or
$1,000 for a violation that could endanger an aircraft and the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   That sends a mixed message to the inspector and the company,
according to a General Accounting Office report to Congress in
1997.

FAA INSPECTOR CITES SHODDY WORK AT GIANT AIRCRAFT REPAIR STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER, LISA OLSEN and SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ Federal aviation safety inspectors, warning of
dangerously incompetent work on many jetliners, last summer
recommended closing Tramco, North America's largest independent
aircraft repair station.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a Federal Aviation Administration inspector at the
sprawling Tramco plant warned of ``a disaster waiting to happen''
because of problems at the Paine Field operation, which worked on
421 planes last year.
</P>
<P>
   FAA inspectors also wrote agency lawyers that Tramco's
``violations raise significant concerns for safety and clearly
raise the potential of a catastrophic failure leading to a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   But their bosses ruled against pulling the company's FAA
license.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was more appropriate to use other means of dealing
with this issue,'' said FAA spokesman Mitch Barker. ``We increased
our surveillance at Tramco ... and that continues.''
</P>
<P>
   So do problems at Tramco.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, FAA inspectors found serious flaws in Tramco's
work on a United Airlines jet's control cables.
</P>
<P>
   But a Tramco executive and a lawyer representing the company
bristled Monday at suggestions the company has anything but a
sterling record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has an outstanding safety record,'' said Kenneth
Quinn, Tramco's Washington, D.C., lawyer. ``It's never been
involved in any major incident or accident in its history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ashworth, a Tramco vice president for maintenance, quality
and engineering, said, ``We're dedicated to safety _ absolutely
dedicated to safety beyond anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet FAA scrutiny has prompted changes at Tramco, which has
tightened its quality assurance program and will launch an
immediate ``top to bottom'' audit of its operations, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday an eight-member independent team of auditors is expected
to begin a review of repair work by Tramco mechanics and to survey
how its customers and the FAA evaluate the work.
</P>
<P>
   The company routinely has outside audits, but Ashworth said this
enhanced review is both to ensure Tramco isn't ``missing
something'' and as a response to questions from the
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The station was renamed BFGoodrich Aerospace MRO Group Inc. in
August to reflect the name of its parent company. But most of those
who work there still use its original name, Tramco.
</P>
<P>
   Working in three massive hangars at Paine Field, Tramco's 2,300
workers perform repairs, heavy maintenance, modifications and
inspections on jets owned by dozens of passenger carriers such as
United, Northwest, Continental and Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The company also maintains cargo planes for United Parcel
Service and Federal Express. In addition, it refits and customizes
planes for clients such as the Seattle SuperSonics and the
president of Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, the airline with the nation's best safety record,
expresses continued confidence in Tramco, which it has used for two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But at least two airlines _ America West and Frontier _ stopped
using Tramco last year. Both had trouble with planes Tramco
mechanics returned to service with lingering mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tramco said quality concerns had nothing to do with the
decisions of America West and Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Michel, the FAA's principal maintenance inspector for
Tramco, ran a one-man operation there until last summer. Since
then, four other inspectors were added to his staff, which is still
just a third of the dozen he and his colleagues have requested.
Michel and all other FAA officials contacted for this article
declined comment and referred all questions to Barker, the regional
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Understaffed as they are, Michel and his team have filled filing
cabinets and computer files with documentation of safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tramco executives say the FAA has overstated the severity of the
violations and that ``all problems cited have been addressed and
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Tramco paid four penalties to the FAA in the summer of 1998. But
they were all small, ranging from $1,100 to $13,200, the FAA's
Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barker also said the books are still open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the violations have been closed (resolved) but there
are 15 that are still being actively pursued,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred pages of FAA documents, inspection reports,
internal correspondence and Tramco documents obtained or reviewed
by the Post-Intelligencer show a lengthy and continuing record of
mechanical, training and equipment violations committed by Tramco
workers and apparently overlooked by the company's safety
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the violations in the past three years:
</P>
<P>
   _A Frontier 737 was sent back into service with loose and
insecure couplings in its fuel tank. The plane made 43 flights
before the trouble was spotted in June 1998. Had the couplings
separated, fuel could have pumped into the wing, where it would
leak out, posing a fire or explosion risk.
</P>
<P>
   _A United 727 was released for service by Tramco with its flight
control column _ which is comparable to a car's steering column _
improperly rigged 4{ inches out of position. A United crew found
the problem in February 1998 during a preflight inspection. Had it
not been caught, the pilot might have experienced stiff control or
a false impression of how the aircraft was moving during flight.
</P>
<P>
   _A Northwest 727 was released by Tramco and flown with Vise Grip
locking pliers securing an equipment cooling fan in March 1998. Had
the pliers come loose, critical equipment could have overheated and
failed.
</P>
<P>
   _Between 1988 and 1994, Tramco repaired the aluminum ``skin'' of
10 Boeing 737 ailerons, a part of the wing that helps the pilot
bank or turn the aircraft. The repairs were not done in accord with
Boeing standards, and ailerons on planes flown by Casino Express
and South Africa Airways came apart in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of an aileron during high-speed flight could cause violent
vibrations that could overstress other flight surfaces, causing
them to fail. Tramco executive Ashworth said the problem is the
only instance in which the FAA told the company of a safety
problem.
</P>
<P>
   _A Frontier 737 was cleared for operation with a leaking engine
pressure ratio system, which measures engine performance. Because
of this, one flight had a problem which the crew handled and
another flight was aborted. The date of the incident was not
available Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _A Southwest 737 was returned to service with a rudder power
control unit improperly reassembled in December 1996. It
malfunctioned during a test after making a few flights. Failure of
the same unit, which moves the rudder to make the plane turn, is
suspected in the fatal crashes of a USAir 737 in Pittsburgh and a
United 737 in Colorado Springs. Neither plane has been identified
as having been worked on at Tramco.
</P>
<P>
   _A Federal Express 737 was released for service with bolts
holding an elevator loose or missing. The elevator is a part of the
tail that helps regulate airspeed and rate of climb or descent. The
date of the incident was unavailable Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 primary concern is that Tramco will directly or
indirectly cause a major airplane accident by returning an airplane
or airplane component to service in an unsafe, unairworthy
condition,'' regional aviation safety inspector William Blake wrote
in an August briefing paper to Brad Pearson, flight standards
division manager for the FAA's Northwest Mountain Region.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer retained William Becker, a certified
aircraft appraiser and expert witness on aircraft safety issues, to
review FAA and Tramco documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that stuff is scary, and with 57 years in the
business I don't scare easily,'' Becker said. ``Almost every case,
issue or incident could have been elevated to rather remarkable
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the problems should have been glaringly obvious and
should have easily been caught by mechanics or inspectors, Becker
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Colorado-based aviation consultant who also has worked with
Tramco disagreed. Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, an
aviation research firm, said it's inevitable that some things will
be missed when a plane is taken apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would caution against saying Tramco does sloppy work on the
basis that these things are found,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean
that it's excusable ... but knowing Tramco's reputation, I would
probably err on the side of (trusting) Tramco and not the FAA.''
</P>
<P>
   In correspondence to the FAA, Tramco disputes the accuracy of
several of the violations, denying some outright and saying others
caused no damage or unsafe conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Tramco officials said the company didn't even know that
Michel had recommended taking away the certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never did bring up the certification case. That ought to
be telling you that no one was apparently pursuing this case,''
said Quinn, Tramco's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, FAA documents show repeated warnings to Tramco that the
company lacks key management people with experience in maintaining
planes flown by major air carriers. Ashworth is one of the Tramco
officials whose qualifications have been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn maintains that top FAA administrators don't agree with
Michel's interpretation of the regulations as requiring such
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also has faulted Tramco's policy of paying bonuses or
other incentives to quality control inspectors who meet production
schedules. They say this system means the inspectors are not free
from corporate pressure to keep an aircraft from being returned to
flight service.
</P>
<P>
   Ashworth said Tramco does not cut corners and is ``by far the
most expensive company in this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Quinn said the company's quality assurance program is
based on FAA research and has won plaudits from government and
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they admit that mistakes can be made. ``Anytime you have
human beings touching an aircraft it is possible that they do it
incorrectly,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Tramco has expanded its hangar space and
tripled its staff to meet growing demand from airlines that
increasingly have contracted with third-party repair stations to do
major maintenance. The number of planes it services each year has
nearly doubled since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Tramco may have grown too fast, said Becker, the
Post-Intelligencer's consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tramco had the opportunity to take on more business than they
can handle at the time they were losing their most experienced
personnel,'' said Becker. ``That has to be a root cause, but it's
not an excuse. There is no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition for experienced aircraft workers is also intense
when Boeing is flush with orders, said Steven Calvo, a
Seattle-based senior evaluator of transportation issues for
Congress' General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Tramco has had a problem when Boeing is doing
very well,'' Calvo said. ``Tramco will lose a lot of experienced
people because Boeing pays more. The loss of this experience could
explain why they are having what appears to be a quality control
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashworth acknowledged that turnover was a problem three years
ago, when Boeing hired Tramco workers away to jobs that pay $5 an
hour more, but said turnover has fallen since then and many former
employees who face layoffs at Boeing are returning.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the FAA's concerns appear to center on cost cutting.
</P>
<P>
   The agency faulted Tramco for removing the floorboards and
changing primary flight instruments and an auto-pilot component
during a test flight of a FedEx 727. The FAA said these actions
made the aircraft ``unairworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Tramco top management, FAA inspector Michel
wrote, ``Your quality control manager complained about the
requirements of multiple test flights and the impact of higher
costs to your customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, an FAA inspector checking Tramco's
inspection of a UPS 757's landing gear found dirt and grime
covering the gear surfaces ``in such a condition that it couldn't
have been inspected properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel wrote Tramco that when he discussed with the Tramco
inspection crew chief the need to clean the gear before making a
proper inspection, the man ``expressed his concern on how he was
going account for this additional expense and the amount of
man-hours this was going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Marlene Livack, the FAA's Seattle Flight
Standards district office manager, Ashworth disputed Michel's
allegations. He said Michel ``obviously misinterpreted'' Tramco's
manager of quality control and its chief inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Ashworth said Monday the company's quality assurance program,
which went into effect in the second quarter of 1997, did need
improvements and has received them because of FAA oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn refused to publicly speculate on Michel's actions or to
criticize him. But he said there seemed to be a ``disconnect''
between how local inspectors enforce rules and how FAA headquarters
believe they should be enforced. The local inspectors tend to view
the regulations as ``gospel, which it's not,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about safety at Tramco cannot be blamed on
misunderstandings or on FAA inspectors failing to do their duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked with Michel in the past and found him to be
very professional and very knowledgeable about the working of
repair stations and there is no reason to doubt the concerns he's
raised,'' said Calvo, of the GAO.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as clear, however, that FAA managers back up those
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of examples of FAA safety inspectors around the
nation being criticized, ostracized or even demoted and fired for
tenacity in doing their jobs. These tales often surface at
congressional hearings convened after air disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also faces regular criticism for ignoring problems
because its mandate is to promote the interests of the aviation
industry as well as to regulate it.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who was chief counsel for the FAA before he left
government, confirmed that the agency's criticism of Tramco came at
a time when Ashworth was being considered for a top safety job at
the FAA's Washington headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the possible appointment garnered no special
treatment for Tramco.
</P>
<P>
   FAA documents indicate that at least one senior supervisor and a
manager in Seattle's flight standards office cooled efforts to
crank up the heat to bring Tramco into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of acting on a recommendation to pull Tramco's
certificate last year, Livack, the FAA manager, called for special
meetings with the company to resolve the issues.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the FAA ``categorically denies'' that Livack was
soft on Tramco.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, she spearheaded the increased efforts to get the
company to comply,'' said Barker, the FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But changes Tramco promised in August don't seem be reducing the
number and severity of problems.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a 737 used to shuttle Arco Supreme oil field
workers to Alaska's North Slope went through a Tramco D-check, the
most detailed maintenance and inspection sequence required by the
FAA and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft was held for two or three extra days as Tramco
mechanics tried to correct a problem with an elevator, said Jack
Evans, manager of corporate communication for Alaska Airlines,
which has the maintenance contract for Arco's two planes.
</P>
<P>
   Tramco declared the aircraft was OK. It then made two round
trips carrying oil field workers between Anchorage and the North
Slope.
</P>
<P>
   On the second flight, pilots experienced slight problems with
the way the elevators were responding. The plane was flown back to
Seattle, where Alaska Airlines mechanics found two of the elevator
control cables improperly connected, said Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Ashworth said he believes the problem must have occurred after
the plane left his plant.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday Alaska Airlines maintenance managers met with their
counterparts at Tramco to discuss the elevator problem. Ashworth
would say little about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In January, FAA inspectors found another serious mechanical
problem, this time with a United 727 that had been repaired at
Tramco. The plane's improperly rigged control cables were rubbing
against another component and one cable was nearly worn through.
Had it parted, the pilot could have had difficulty controlling the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, America West joined a national trend among air
carriers by laying off hundreds of its own mechanics and
contracting out heavy maintenance to Tramco.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, America West ``decided to move our maintenance,''
said Frank Tucci, vice president of maintenance and engineering.
``We have pulled out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucci would not say specifically why America West dropped
Tramco. ``I can't take a chance on lawsuits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before it dropped Tramco, at least two planes were returned to
America West with problems that Tramco had not fixed _ both
incidents that helped prompt FAA inspector Michel's recommendation
to revoke certification.
</P>
<P>
   In July, America West was forced to pay an unprecedented $2.5
million civil settlement by the FAA because of a wide range of
issues that included maintenance and operations problems between
1996 and mid-1998, said Bill Shumann,cq an FAA spokesman in
Washington, D.C. America West had its own mechanics during that
period, but used Tramco for heavy maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The government specifically faulted the airlines' oversight of
third-party maintenance providers, including Tramco. To avoid
paying an additional $2.5 million, the airline agreed to conditions
that include correcting ``oversight of contract maintenance and
performance of maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Shumann said that in many cases the fine had ``nothing to do
with the quality of the contract maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Frontier Airlines, a small Denver-based carrier, also stopped
using Tramco several months ago, after discovering fuel line
problems in two planes. One plane made more than 40 flights before
Frontier's own inspectors discovered loose and unsecured couplings
in a fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier spokeswoman Elise Eberwein said the airline was already
planning to hire more mechanics and do its own overhauls when it
dropped Tramco last year. She would not say if Frontier stopped
using Tramco sooner than planned because of maintenance problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an issue between Tramco and the FAA,'' she said.
``We're not going to comment publicly ... we don't fly planes that
aren't airworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tramco officials say that they couldn't reach an acceptable
contract with America West and that Frontier simply found a cheaper
third-party shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``No carrier or customer has expressed safety or quality control
concerns in context of a contract termination,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Other air carriers said their confidence in Tramco remains
unshaken, although they have had problems with the Everett repair
station.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Logan, Northwest's director of flight safety, described
problems his airline has had with Tramco as a ``reliability
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Planes were ``not meeting our requirements coming out of
maintenance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said the airline will
continue to send planes to Tramco.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents in our judgment were reliability rather than
safety issues, but nonetheless ones we take seriously. We consider
them anomalous when compared with the relationship we have had with
Tramco,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS spokesman Mark Dickens said the company retains an
eight-person quality control team to oversee maintenance in
Everett, and is ``very happy with Tramco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it sounds like at this point that the FAA inspector on
site there is doing his job, there are checks and balances and the
process that's established is working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And at Southwest Airlines, which has used Tramco for heavy
maintenance of its fleet for 20 years, spokeswoman Christine
Tureabe said, ``We're confident in their abilities.''

 UNDATED: and abroad. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her investigations led her to conclude that doctors became the
keepers of the female orgasm for several related reasons. To begin
with, women have been presumed since Hippocrates' day, if not
earlier, to suffer from some sort of ``womb furie'' _ the word
``hysteria,'' after all, derives from uterus. The result was
thought to be a spectacular assortment of symptoms, including
lassitude, irritability, depression, confusion, palpitations of the
heart, headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, muscle spasms, stomach
upsets, writing cramps, ticklishness and weepiness.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to treat the wayward female than a physician, and
where better to address his ministrations than toward the general
area of her rebellious female parts?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maines also proposes that women historically have suffered
from a lack of sexual satisfaction _ that they needed somebody's
help to have the orgasms they were not having in the bedroom. By
the tenets of what she calls the ``androcentric'' model of sex,
women were supposed to be satisfied by the motions of heterosexual
intercourse _ the missionary position and its close proxies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as many studies have shown, at least two-thirds of women
fail to reach orgasm through coitus alone, Dr. Maines said. As a
result, she said, many women historically may have spent their
lives in an orgasm deficit, without necessarily identifying it as
such. At the same time, religious edicts against masturbation
discouraged women from self-exploration. ``In effect,'' she writes,
``doctors inherited the task of producing orgasm in women because
it was a job nobody else wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The vibrator was not the first therapeutic approach to treating
feminine ``pelvic hyperemia.'' Dr. Maines and other historians have
described the practice of hydrotherapy, the taking to the baths or
spas, as an ancient means to a sometimes climactic end. A century
ago, spas like Saratoga Springs were a favorite destination of the
well-to-do, who enjoyed the diversity of aqua-regimens: the warm
baths, the bracing baths, the mineral baths, the gas-infused bubbly
baths, the swirling proto-Jacuzzi baths, and, especially, the
``douche'' baths, in which a current of water was directed through
a high-pressure hose or nozzle against the surface of the body _ or
into a cavity of the body, if the bather so desired.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman named Abigail May, who traveled to Ballston
Springs, N.Y., in 1800, seeking relief from the pain of her cancer,
found happiness, if not a cure, in the water treatments, Dr. Maines
writes, using information from a journal she found during her
research. At first nervous at the sight of the douche hoses, May
made sure to ``have laudanum handy'' and then took the plunge. ``I
screamed merrily _ so says Mama,'' May wrote in her journal. ``For
my own part I do not remember much about it _ I felt finely for two
hours after bathing'' and was ``so much pleased with the Bath''
that she went again not long afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The vibrator remained a staple of the doctor's armamentarium and
the proper wife's boudoir until the 1920s, Dr. Maines said, when it
began showing up in stag films and quickly lost its patina of
gentility.
</P>
<P>
   Vibrators are still widely available, of course _ unless you
happen to live in Alabama, Georgia and Texas, where state
legislatures have banned the sale of vibrators and other ``sex
toys.'' The American Civil Liberties Union is now vigorously
challenging the Alabama statute. If Alabama permits the prescribing
of the anti-impotence drug Viagra, the ACLU argues, how dare it
tell women that they can't have their own electromechanical
prescription for joy?

 BY SUZANNE LEIGH  
 c.1999 Medical Tribune News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven years ago Dr. Yared Kebede Haile worked as a well-paid
physician for an American oil company in his native Ethiopia. He
remembers his American patients with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would come in with a cold or a mild laceration and demand
antibiotics,'' he said, chuckling over the national idiosyncrasy of
self-treating even the most minor disorder with an array of
over-the-counter medications.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile found his work uninspiring. So he did what most
American doctors would never do: He traded his air-conditioned
office for a volunteer physician assignment that took him to
makeshift clinics and hospitals in war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told how difficult it would be for an African expatriate
who was Christian to work in Afghanistan, a Muslim country,'' said
Kebede Haile, now 32 and studying for his Master of Public Health
(MPH) degree at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead I found the Afghanis were very polite, very friendly
and respectful,'' he said, speaking Tuesday at the Montefiore
Medical Center in New York to promote the work of Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF), the Paris-based volunteer organization that
recruited him.
</P>
<P>
   After his three-month assignment in Afghanistan, Kebede Haile
worked for MSF in Uganda and later volunteered in Bangladesh,
Liberia and Ethiopia. His experiences of living in different
countries have been 100-percent positive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt I was not accepted and respected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of MSF's assignments last for a minimum of six months, but
this is a career path that does not come with job security. Last
year, volunteers were expelled from Kabul in Afghanistan, where MSF
had been providing medical services for eight years. And earlier
this month volunteers were evacuated from southern Sudan after
reports that pro-Sudanese government militia were raiding villages
and killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Many MSF assignments involve a precarious balancing act of
placating governments that resist volunteers' presence, maintaining
political neutrality and speaking out when atrocities are witnessed
without jeopardizing continuation of programs.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile insists it is not difficult to remain politically
impartial. Nevertheless, the organization has frequently wrestled
with the dichotomy of maintaining neutrality while condemning
injustices. When the group was founded in 1971, its charter forbade
members to talk about what they had witnessed during missions. But
the group has subsequently spoken out about human rights violations
in Cambodia, Afghanistan and Ethiopia, and has even carried out
secret missions in countries where its presence was not welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 MSF established a United States headquarters in New York
with the name Doctors Without Borders. A second office was opened
in Los Angeles, and a drive for donations and volunteers was
initiated. Last year the organization recruited 110 volunteers from
the United States to work in countries as diverse as Sri Lanka,
Guatemala, Bosnia, Vietnam, China and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the four-and-a-half years Kebede Haile has been with MSF
he has been surprised by the fact that American volunteers are
overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I have never seen an African-American involved
in [overseas] volunteer work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Kebede Haile this is a statistic that undermines overseas
humanitarian efforts. Doctors Without Borders needs multiracial
teamwork to have credibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the participation of minority groups, it could be argued
that Doctors Without Borders is vulnerable to misperceptions that
it is just another attempt to alleviate the ``white man's burden.''
</P>
<P>
   With the spotlight on trouble spots like Rwanda, Zaire and
southern Sudan, Kebede Haile is hoping that more black Americans
will consider volunteering in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with MSF has changed my whole way of thinking. I
have learned so much from other people and other cultures. I
believe everyone can benefit from this experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile also wants black Americans to discover the
``other'' side of Africa, a continent ``with a rich culture and
civilization.'' For the most part, Americans' only exposure to
Africa is images of war, famine and devastation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders is seeking specialists in internal
medicine, emergency medicine and infectious diseases, general
surgeons and practitioners, anesthesiologists and nurses. A
background in public health is especially desirable. Social
workers, psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are also required
for some assignments. Volunteers with non-medical backgrounds are
also invaluable to operations, especially civil engineers, people
with experience in finance, administration and accounting and those
with expertise in water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>

 BY SUZANNE LEIGH  
 c.1999 Medical Tribune News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven years ago Dr. Yared Kebede Haile worked as a well-paid
physician for an American oil company in his native Ethiopia. He
remembers his American patients with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would come in with a cold or a mild laceration and demand
antibiotics,'' he said, chuckling over the national idiosyncrasy of
self-treating even the most minor disorder with an array of
over-the-counter medications.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile found his work uninspiring. So he did what most
American doctors would never do: He traded his air-conditioned
office for a volunteer physician assignment that took him to
makeshift clinics and hospitals in war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told how difficult it would be for an African expatriate
who was Christian to work in Afghanistan, a Muslim country,'' said
Kebede Haile, now 32 and studying for his Master of Public Health
(MPH) degree at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead I found the Afghanis were very polite, very friendly
and respectful,'' he said, speaking Tuesday at the Montefiore
Medical Center in New York to promote the work of Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF), the Paris-based volunteer organization that
recruited him.
</P>
<P>
   After his three-month assignment in Afghanistan, Kebede Haile
worked for MSF in Uganda and later volunteered in Bangladesh,
Liberia and Ethiopia. His experiences of living in different
countries have been 100-percent positive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt I was not accepted and respected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of MSF's assignments last for a minimum of six months, but
this is a career path that does not come with job security. Last
year, volunteers were expelled from Kabul in Afghanistan, where MSF
had been providing medical services for eight years. And earlier
this month volunteers were evacuated from southern Sudan after
reports that pro-Sudanese government militia were raiding villages
and killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Many MSF assignments involve a precarious balancing act of
placating governments that resist volunteers' presence, maintaining
political neutrality and speaking out when atrocities are witnessed
without jeopardizing continuation of programs.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile insists it is not difficult to remain politically
impartial. Nevertheless, the organization has frequently wrestled
with the dichotomy of maintaining neutrality while condemning
injustices. When the group was founded in 1971, its charter forbade
members to talk about what they had witnessed during missions. But
the group has subsequently spoken out about human rights violations
in Cambodia, Afghanistan and Ethiopia, and has even carried out
secret missions in countries where its presence was not welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 MSF established a United States headquarters in New York
with the name Doctors Without Borders. A second office was opened
in Los Angeles, and a drive for donations and volunteers was
initiated. Last year the organization recruited 110 volunteers from
the United States to work in countries as diverse as Sri Lanka,
Guatemala, Bosnia, Vietnam, China and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the four-and-a-half years Kebede Haile has been with MSF
he has been surprised by the fact that American volunteers are
overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I have never seen an African-American involved
in [overseas] volunteer work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Kebede Haile this is a statistic that undermines overseas
humanitarian efforts. Doctors Without Borders needs multiracial
teamwork to have credibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the participation of minority groups, it could be argued
that Doctors Without Borders is vulnerable to misperceptions that
it is just another attempt to alleviate the ``white man's burden.''
</P>
<P>
   With the spotlight on trouble spots like Rwanda, Zaire and
southern Sudan, Kebede Haile is hoping that more black Americans
will consider volunteering in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with MSF has changed my whole way of thinking. I
have learned so much from other people and other cultures. I
believe everyone can benefit from this experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile also wants black Americans to discover the
``other'' side of Africa, a continent ``with a rich culture and
civilization.'' For the most part, Americans' only exposure to
Africa is images of war, famine and devastation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders is seeking specialists in internal
medicine, emergency medicine and infectious diseases, general
surgeons and practitioners, anesthesiologists and nurses. A
background in public health is especially desirable. Social
workers, psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are also required
for some assignments. Volunteers with non-medical backgrounds are
also invaluable to operations, especially civil engineers, people
with experience in finance, administration and accounting and those
with expertise in water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   The six-month minimum is waived for general surgeons and
anesthesiologists, who are allowed to work for six-week periods.
All volunteers receive paid expenses including accommodation and
modest allowances.

listeners, especially the men, tend to squirm. That's because she
spends her days doing experiments on the penises of mammals from
rats to armadillos. She is, to her knowledge, the first and only
scientist to study the biomechanics of the male organ _ in other
words, the principles of engineering and physics that enable the
penis to do what it's supposed to do. Mary Roach, a contributing
editor of Discover magazine, reports.

   When Diane Kelly describes her unusual field of study, her
listeners, especially the men, tend to squirm. That's because she
spends her days doing experiments on the penises of mammals from
rats to armadillos. She is, to her knowledge, the first and only
scientist to study the biomechanics of the male organ _ in other
words, the principles of engineering and physics that enable the
penis to do what it's supposed to do. Mary Roach, a contributing
editor of Discover magazine, reports.

   Forensic scientists use the presence of pollen in decades-old
remains to try to establish the season that a mass slaying in
Germany took place _ and thereby the probable culprits, the Nazis

   ``Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.'' Diane Kelly is making the
point that she is used to saying the word. She says it in front of
large gatherings of academics. She has said it to a Tallahassee
police officer who caught her by the side of the road, removing one
from a dead armadillo. She says it to people at barbecues and
dinner parties who ask her what she does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a 30-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Cornell, is the
first _ and to her knowledge only _ scientist in the world to study
the biomechanics of the mammalian penis.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to speculate on the reasons no scientist has studied
the penis in the past: a) the majority of scientists are men, and
b) the research involves things like ``inflation and bending
experiments,'' wherein a rat penis is attached, by way of electric
clamps, needles and superglue, to a strain gauge and a force
transducer. (The organ is not, mercifully, attached to the rat.)
Kelly allows that ``men do squirm a lot'' at her talks.
</P>
<P>
   Her field _ biomechanics, the application of principles of
physics and engineering to living things _ is a very young science,
only 35 years old or so.
</P>
<P>
   With biomechanics' elders heading into retirement, a second
generation has taken the baton and carried it into less obvious
places: the biomechanics of hearing, of smelling, of circulation.
Kelly was one of the intrepid few to claim reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   She chose male reproductive organs over female not because of
any prurient interest, she says, but because they're so much
simpler: fewer parts, fewer functions. The same practical bent
determines the species she studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dead armadillos, her original organ donors, were easy to come by
in the part of Florida where she did her graduate work. When
armadillos are startled, they invariably jump into the air, putting
them at grille height and pretty much sealing their fate in the
face of oncoming trafffic.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the male Florida armadillo has the advantage of
being uncommonly well endowed. Its penis can be as long as
one-third its body length (a proportion that stretches to
two-thirds in some South American armadillos), which may have
something to do with the need to insinuate it under the female's
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Biomechanically speaking, the male reproductive organ has to do
two things. It has to get rigid, and it has to deliver sperm. Kelly
made her name in the rigidity arena, solving, as she puts it, ``the
mechanical problem of how to make something that's floppy stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer she found contradicted conventional biomechanical
wisdom. A penis is, in its materialist essence, a fleshy cylinder,
and as such it's far from unique in nature _ mechanically, it's
akin to an earthworm or a squid tentacle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on bones for support, these ``hydrostatic''
structures use pressurized liquid. Hydrostats are elegant
engineering solutions to a host of physical challenges, but they
necessitate a couple of safety mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   First, a structure that relics on internal pressure for
stiffness must have a means of restraining that pressure _ a tough
skin _ to make sure its innards stay innards.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if it's going to bend, it must bend without crimping.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, the solution nature has provided for these
cylinders is to protect them on the outside with fibers of collagen
woven in crossed helices, like intertwined spirals of DNA. This
arrangement lets the cylinder resist the internal pressure yet bend
smoothly and spring back naturally to its original position, a
desirable state of affairs if you're, say, a worm on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had assumed that penises must have the same
arrangement of fibers. Apparently, no one had argued that a penis
is not a worm. A worm, though, if it's going to get anywhere, needs
to be readily bendable. A penis, for reasons that do not need
explaining, must be rigid. It has one place it needs to go, and
wriggling is not how it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly discovered, while examining armadillo penises for her
dissertation, that the fibers in the mammalian penis are not in
fact helically wound. Instead they're laid out in layers: one
longitudinal, in which the fibers run parallel to the organ's long
axis, and one circumferential, in which the fibers run
perpendicular. Kelly called the arrangement an axial orthogonal
array.
</P>
<P>
   Having collagen fibers arranged this way discourages bending and
allows the erect penis to hold its shape. It's not squishable. The
circumferential fibers keep it from bulging out when the end is
pushed in, and the longitudinal fibers hold its length when it's
squeezed. In short, the fiber array makes the erect penis behave
like an erect penis and not like a water balloon.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Kelly is occupied with other matters:
investigating the baculum, or penis bone. Among mammals, there are
species of rodents, pinnipeds, bats, and primates that have bacula,
and in no case does anyone know what they're for.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is working on a specimen, the penis of a freshly deceased
rat, testing a hypothesis about how the baculum might work.
</P>
<P>
   She grips the tip of the bone with a copper electric clamp and
impales the other end on a hypodermic needle. Then she ties a piece
of string around the base of the penis and pulls it tight. She
presses in the syringe plunger and pumps the penis full of saline.
This is how you give an erection to an unattached penis. (It tends
to have the opposite effect on attached penises, human ones anyway,
which usually leave the room right about now.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelly checks the strain gauge wires, then steps back. She
presses the switch to engage the pulling mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The machine commences a slow upward motion. The tiny penis
bends, the computer beeps and whirs. Kelly sighs. ``Hours of prep
for minutes of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Her relief can be read like a billboard. The data are in. She
can get in her car and go see her family and not say penis again
until tomorrow.

   &UR; OF FLOWERS AND MURDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had theorized that the grave in Magdeburg was
created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while
capable of many horrors, would not normally have created a mass
grave in the center of a city. But they may have done so in the
spring of 1945, during the last few chaotic weeks of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a
Soviet counterintelligence agency. SMERSH reportedly executed
Soviet soldiers who refused to help quash a revolt in the former
German Democratic Republic in June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have often used pollen found on victims to
determine where a murder took place, but Reinhard Szibor, a
biologist and forensic specialist at Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg, realized that pollen could also be used to determine
when death occurred, a crucial point in the case of the Magdeburg
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.
Researchers are now looking for corroborative evidence in archives
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIND OVER MATTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strokes and accidents that damage the brain of spinal cord
sometimes leave people fully conscious but unable to speak or move.
Trapped in their own bodies, the people who suffer from what is
sometimes called locked-in syndrome are lucky if they can
communicate their needs with a blink or a raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. A team of neurologists has developed a
device that allows paralyzed people to communicate through a
computer without having to move a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kennedy, a neurologist in private practice near Atlanta,
has been working on the implant _ a millimeter-long electrode _ for
12 years. Implanted into the part of the brain that normally
controls the hands, the electrode, coated with growth factors that
spur brain tissue to grow into it, picks up electric signals sent
back and forth by nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient thinks about moving his hands, electrical
activity near the electrode increases. Through an amplifier and
antennas positioned underneath the scalp, those signals are
transmitted to a computer, which uses them to drive a cursor across
a screen.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating or relaxing, a patient can control the firing
of his neurons and make the cursor stop on an icon with a prepared
message or on a letter of a keyboard display. The computer then
speaks or prints a letter or message.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Roy Bakay, a neurosurgeon at Emory University, have
tried the implant on a man paralyzed from the top of the neck down
after a stroke. He hasn't quite mastered the keyboard, but he can
position the icon near prepared messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's delighted,'' says Kennedy, ``and when it works for him he
has a big smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A NEW SABER-TOOTHED CAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In north central Florida there is a sinkhole that local fossil
collectors call Hog Heaven. Paleontologists have unearthed the
remains of dozens of large wild hogs called peccaries from the
site, as well as the skeletons of two saber-toothed cats, all of
which died about 1 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the sabertoothed cats were bringing home pork
for the kittens,'' says paleontologist Larry Martin of the
University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The cats from Hog Heaven are unique for more than their penchant
for pork _ they are the first specimens of a new and particularly
fearsome species of sabertooth, bringing the total number of known
North American species to three.
</P>
<P>
   The new cat, which has not been officially named, combines some
of the deadliest features of the other two species. Like Smilodon
(the picture-book example of a sabertooth), it had a powerful,
stocky build.
</P>
<P>
   ``And like Homotherium, it had broad, knifelike teeth that are
very coarsely crenulated, and then a projecting set of long, curved
incisors that are serrated like a steak knife,'' says Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the largest, most ferocious sabertooth in the world at
that time,'' says Martin. ``If I were going to choose who would win
a bout of mortal combat,'' he adds, ``I'm not sure that this thing
wouldn't clean Smilodon's _ or Homotherium's _ plow.''

   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.
Researchers are now looking for corroborative evidence in archives
in Moscow.

<P>
   Strokes and accidents that damage the brain of spinal cord
sometimes leave people fully conscious but unable to speak or move.
Trapped in their own bodies, the people who suffer from what is
sometimes called locked-in syndrome are lucky if they can
communicate their needs with a blink or a raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. A team of neurologists has developed a
device that allows paralyzed people to communicate through a
computer without having to move a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kennedy, a neurologist in private practice near Atlanta,
has been working on the implant _ a millimeter-long electrode _ for
12 years. Implanted into the part of the brain that normally
controls the hands, the electrode, coated with growth factors that
spur brain tissue to grow into it, picks up electric signals sent
back and forth by nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient thinks about moving his hands, electrical
activity near the electrode increases. Through an amplifier and
antennas positioned underneath the scalp, those signals are
transmitted to a computer, which uses them to drive a cursor across
a screen.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating or relaxing, a patient can control the firing
of his neurons and make the cursor stop on an icon with a prepared
message or on a letter of a keyboard display. The computer then
speaks or prints a letter or message.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Roy Bakay, a neurosurgeon at Emory University, have
tried the implant on a man paralyzed from the top of the neck down
after a stroke. He hasn't quite mastered the keyboard, but he can
position the icon near prepared messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's delighted,'' says Kennedy, ``and when it works for him he
has a big smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A NEW SABER-TOOTHED CAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In north central Florida there is a sinkhole that local fossil
collectors call Hog Heaven. Paleontologists have unearthed the
remains of dozens of large wild hogs called peccaries from the
site, as well as the skeletons of two saber-toothed cats, all of
which died about 1 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the sabertoothed cats were bringing home pork
for the kittens,'' says paleontologist Larry Martin of the
University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The cats from Hog Heaven are unique for more than their penchant
for pork _ they are the first specimens of a new and particularly
fearsome species of sabertooth, bringing the total number of known
North American species to three.
</P>
<P>
   The new cat, which has not been officially named, combines some
of the deadliest features of the other two species. Like Smilodon
(the picture-book example of a sabertooth), it had a powerful,
stocky build.
</P>
<P>
   ``And like Homotherium, it had broad, knifelike teeth that are
very coarsely crenulated, and then a projecting set of long, curved
incisors that are serrated like a steak knife,'' says Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the largest, most ferocious sabertooth in the world at
that time,'' says Martin. ``If I were going to choose who would win
a bout of mortal combat,'' he adds, ``I'm not sure that this thing
wouldn't clean Smilodon's _ or Homotherium's _ plow.''

   ``Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.'' Diane Kelly is making the
point that she is used to saying the word. She says it in front of
large gatherings of academics. She has said it to a Tallahassee
police officer who caught her by the side of the road, removing one
from a dead armadillo. She says it to people at barbecues and
dinner parties who ask her what she does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a 30-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Cornell, is the
first _ and to her knowledge only _ scientist in the world to study
the biomechanics of the mammalian penis.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to speculate on the reasons no scientist has studied
the penis in the past: a) the majority of scientists are men, and
b) the research involves things like ``inflation and bending
experiments,'' wherein a rat penis is attached, by way of electric
clamps, needles and superglue, to a strain gauge and a force
transducer. (The organ is not, mercifully, attached to the rat.)
Kelly allows that ``men do squirm a lot'' at her talks.
</P>
<P>
   Her field _ biomechanics, the application of principles of
physics and engineering to living things _ is a very young science,
only 35 years old or so.
</P>
<P>
   With biomechanics' elders heading into retirement, a second
generation has taken the baton and carried it into less obvious
places: the biomechanics of hearing, of smelling, of circulation.
Kelly was one of the intrepid few to claim reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   She chose male reproductive organs over female not because of
any prurient interest, she says, but because they're so much
simpler: fewer parts, fewer functions. The same practical bent
determines the species she studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dead armadillos, her original organ donors, were easy to come by
in the part of Florida where she did her graduate work. When
armadillos are startled, they invariably jump into the air, putting
them at grille height and pretty much sealing their fate in the
face of oncoming trafffic.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the male Florida armadillo has the advantage of
being uncommonly well endowed. Its penis can be as long as
one-third its body length (a proportion that stretches to
two-thirds in some South American armadillos), which may have
something to do with the need to insinuate it under the female's
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Biomechanically speaking, the male reproductive organ has to do
two things. It has to get rigid, and it has to deliver sperm. Kelly
made her name in the rigidity arena, solving, as she puts it, ``the
mechanical problem of how to make something that's floppy stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer she found contradicted conventional biomechanical
wisdom. A penis is, in its materialist essence, a fleshy cylinder,
and as such it's far from unique in nature _ mechanically, it's
akin to an earthworm or a squid tentacle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on bones for support, these ``hydrostatic''
structures use pressurized liquid. Hydrostats are elegant
engineering solutions to a host of physical challenges, but they
necessitate a couple of safety mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   First, a structure that relics on internal pressure for
stiffness must have a means of restraining that pressure _ a tough
skin _ to make sure its innards stay innards.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if it's going to bend, it must bend without crimping.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, the solution nature has provided for these
cylinders is to protect them on the outside with fibers of collagen
woven in crossed helices, like intertwined spirals of DNA. This
arrangement lets the cylinder resist the internal pressure yet bend
smoothly and spring back naturally to its original position, a
desirable state of affairs if you're, say, a worm on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had assumed that penises must have the same
arrangement of fibers. Apparently, no one had argued that a penis
is not a worm. A worm, though, if it's going to get anywhere, needs
to be readily bendable. A penis, for reasons that do not need
explaining, must be rigid. It has one place it needs to go, and
wriggling is not how it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly discovered, while examining armadillo penises for her
dissertation, that the fibers in the mammalian penis are not in
fact helically wound. Instead they're laid out in layers: one
longitudinal, in which the fibers run parallel to the organ's long
axis, and one circumferential, in which the fibers run
perpendicular. Kelly called the arrangement an axial orthogonal
array.
</P>
<P>
   Having collagen fibers arranged this way discourages bending and
allows the erect penis to hold its shape. It's not squishable. The
circumferential fibers keep it from bulging out when the end is
pushed in, and the longitudinal fibers hold its length when it's
squeezed. In short, the fiber array makes the erect penis behave
like an erect penis and not like a water balloon.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Kelly is occupied with other matters:
investigating the baculum, or penis bone. Among mammals, there are
species of rodents, pinnipeds, bats, and primates that have bacula,
and in no case does anyone know what they're for.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is working on a specimen, the penis of a freshly deceased
rat, testing a hypothesis about how the baculum might work.
</P>
<P>
   She grips the tip of the bone with a copper electric clamp and
impales the other end on a hypodermic needle. Then she ties a piece
of string around the base of the penis and pulls it tight. She
presses in the syringe plunger and pumps the penis full of saline.
This is how you give an erection to an unattached penis. (It tends
to have the opposite effect on attached penises, human ones anyway,
which usually leave the room right about now.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelly checks the strain gauge wires, then steps back. She
presses the switch to engage the pulling mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The machine commences a slow upward motion. The tiny penis
bends, the computer beeps and whirs. Kelly sighs. ``Hours of prep
for minutes of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Her relief can be read like a billboard. The data are in. She
can get in her car and go see her family and not say penis again
until tomorrow.

   &UR; OF FLOWERS AND MURDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had theorized that the grave in Magdeburg was
created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while
capable of many horrors, would not normally have created a mass
grave in the center of a city. But they may have done so in the
spring of 1945, during the last few chaotic weeks of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a
Soviet counterintelligence agency. SMERSH reportedly executed
Soviet soldiers who refused to help quash a revolt in the former
German Democratic Republic in June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have often used pollen found on victims to
determine where a murder took place, but Reinhard Szibor, a
biologist and forensic specialist at Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg, realized that pollen could also be used to determine
when death occurred, a crucial point in the case of the Magdeburg
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.

   By concentrating or relaxing, a patient can control the firing
of his neurons and make the cursor stop on an icon with a prepared
message or on a letter of a keyboard display. The computer then
speaks or prints a letter or message.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Roy Bakay, a neurosurgeon at Emory University, have
tried the implant on a man paralyzed from the top of the neck down
after a stroke. He hasn't quite mastered the keyboard, but he can

   &UR; OF FLOWERS AND MURDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had theorized that the grave in Magdeburg was
created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while
capable of many horrors, would not normally have created a mass
grave in the center of a city. But they may have done so in the
spring of 1945, during the last few chaotic weeks of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a
Soviet counterintelligence agency. SMERSH reportedly executed
Soviet soldiers who refused to help quash a revolt in the former
German Democratic Republic in June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have often used pollen found on victims to
determine where a murder took place, but Reinhard Szibor, a
biologist and forensic specialist at Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg, realized that pollen could also be used to determine
when death occurred, a crucial point in the case of the Magdeburg
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.
Researchers are now looking for corroborative evidence in archives
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIND OVER MATTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strokes and accidents that damage the brain of spinal cord
sometimes leave people fully conscious but unable to speak or move.
Trapped in their own bodies, the people who suffer from what is
sometimes called locked-in syndrome are lucky if they can
communicate their needs with a blink or a raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. A team of neurologists has developed a
device that allows paralyzed people to communicate through a
computer without having to move a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kennedy, a neurologist in private practice near Atlanta,
has been working on the implant _ a millimeter-long electrode _ for
12 years. Implanted into the part of the brain that normally
controls the hands, the electrode, coated with growth factors that
spur brain tissue to grow into it, picks up electric signals sent
back and forth by nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient thinks about moving his hands, electrical
activity near the electrode increases. Through an amplifier and
antennas positioned underneath the scalp, those signals are
transmitted to a computer, which uses them to drive a cursor across
a screen.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating or relaxing, a patient can control the firing
of his neurons and make the cursor stop on an icon with a prepared
message or on a letter of a keyboard display. The computer then
speaks or prints a letter or message.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Roy Bakay, a neurosurgeon at Emory University, have
tried the implant on a man paralyzed from the top of the neck down
after a stroke. He hasn't quite mastered the keyboard, but he can
position the icon near prepared messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's delighted,'' says Kennedy, ``and when it works for him he
has a big smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A NEW SABER-TOOTHED CAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In north central Florida there is a sinkhole that local fossil
collectors call Hog Heaven. Paleontologists have unearthed the
remains of dozens of large wild hogs called peccaries from the
site, as well as the skeletons of two saber-toothed cats, all of
which died about 1 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the sabertoothed cats were bringing home pork
for the kittens,'' says paleontologist Larry Martin of the
University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The cats from Hog Heaven are unique for more than their penchant
for pork _ they are the first specimens of a new and particularly
fearsome species of sabertooth, bringing the total number of known
North American species to three.
</P>
<P>
   The new cat, which has not been officially named, combines some
of the deadliest features of the other two species. Like Smilodon
(the picture-book example of a sabertooth), it had a powerful,
stocky build.
</P>
<P>
   ``And like Homotherium, it had broad, knifelike teeth that are
very coarsely crenulated, and then a projecting set of long, curved
incisors that are serrated like a steak knife,'' says Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the largest, most ferocious sabertooth in the world at
that time,'' says Martin. ``If I were going to choose who would win
a bout of mortal combat,'' he adds, ``I'm not sure that this thing
wouldn't clean Smilodon's _ or Homotherium's _ plow.''

 &HT;    What teen-age boys talk about on the way to school
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two chief topics of conversation the other day among the
three teen-age boys I cart to school were:
</P>
<P>
   The snippet of a porno film that somehow made its way into an
episode of ``The Simpsons'' aired locally last week; and a fellow
student who had his tongue pierced.
</P>
<P>
   None of the boys saw the four seconds of hardcore that for
still-unexplained reasons made it onto the Fox show, but news of it
has doubtless sent ratings soaring among the adolescent set. The
station manager has apologized more times than Bill Clinton, fired
somebody who was supposed to check the tape, and is probably
enduring massive amounts of ribbing.
</P>
<P>
   He has my sympathy. As for me, I am happy that I was not
required to explain exactly what the four seconds of porn
contained. They already knew, the teen-age boy information network
being quicker than any high-dollar computer line, especially when
it comes to hormonal matters.
</P>
<P>
   As for the boy who had his tongue pierced, the general consensus
among my passengers is that placing a sharp object through one's
tongue is a lousy idea. I was heartened to hear this. For a moment,
I was fearful that the next big fight at the house would be over my
stepson's wish to also get his tongue pierced.
</P>
<P>
   These teen-agers run in packs, you know, like wild dogs. Each
day they tumble into my car dressed identically: wide-legged jeans,
Doc Martens, a T-shirt from the Puking Rats or some other rock
group whose lyrics cannot be reprised in a family newspaper, and
their hair parted in the middle and always in their eyes. If it's
cold, they bring Adidas jackets with white stripes up each sleeve,
but they rarely wear them. Usually, the jackets end up crumpled in
the back seat of my car to be picked up later. Wearing a jacket
apparently is not cool.
</P>
<P>
   This is the grunge look, I'm told. There are cliques in high
school, which is no surprise. There have always been cliques. My
passengers are grungers, devotees of heavy-metal music like Korn,
Tool and other Bands With Only One Name. Other cliques include the
preps and the kickers. Female preps are OK among these teen boys,
being female and all, but male preps are disdained. As for kickers,
well. Let's not go there.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried on occasion to explain with the benefit of
middle-aged wisdom that dividing people into groups based on how
they dress is dumb. I may as well be speaking Esperanto for all the
good it does me.
</P>
<P>
   I torture the teens by forcing them to listen to National Public
Radio on the 15-minute drive to school. Likely this is the only
news they are exposed to that isn't on MTV. After some initial
grumbling, they have resigned themselves to their cultural fate and
at times actually become interested in a story. Of greatest appeal
are news items having to do with anything gross, such as a recent
piece about the millions of rats in Washington, D.C. No, not
Congress. Real rats, which outnumber people in our capital by about
four-to-one, if memory serves me correctly. This story had their
full attention, being high on the teen gross-out scale.
</P>
<P>
   Stories about Alan Greenspan, Kosovo or impeachment put them
into a daze, and they start talking about what music video they
watched the night before, what so-and-so said on the phone, or how
they're going to talk their parents into springing for a new pair
of Docs.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are a constant topic of conversation on the ride to
school. They are divided into two categories: cool and mean. A cool
teacher does not assign much homework, allows the occasional
playing of CDs in class, and doesn't care if one catches a little
shut-eye while the lecture drones on. A mean teacher expects
students to do their work and whops them upside the head if they're
caught sleeping. Luckily for the nation's future, most teachers are
considered mean.
</P>
<P>
   While tongue piercing is considered highly gross, tattoos are
considered cool. My stock answer is that my stepson can pierce any
part of his body he wishes once he is paying his own rent. I also
point out that a tattoo is a painful process consisting of many
hundreds of needles inserted into the skin. I'm counting on his low
pain threshold to keep him from doing something dumb.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Impeachment Trial That We Thought Would Never End
dominates NPR today. The vote is unanimous in my car. We're all
glad that the trial is finally over so NPR can get back to doing
cool stories about dog-eating alligators and other stuff that teen
boys find fascinating.

 &HT;    CONMMENTARY: Many sleppless nights
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My inner clock is suffering from premature
Y2K syndrome. It's never been much of a timepiece, but now it has
quit working altogether. My son assures me it's just a phase. I
tell him I'm too old to be phasing.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, my days and nights have become indistinguishable, except
for one being darker than the other, and now I find myself roaming
the house at 3 a.m. looking for something to iron. For a while I
tried calling friends for catch-up chats, but that didn't work out.
Even the polite ones kept falling asleep mid-conversation.
</P>
<P>
   What I think about mostly during the owl hours is how everybody
else is asleep and I'm not. Why them? Why not me? Maybe what my
ex-husband used to say is true. When I'd marvel at his ability to
sleep through tornadoes and 3 a.m. feedings, he'd attribute his
uninterrupted slumber to a clear conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Just about the time I decide to give in and look for a job
teaching night school at a community college, my built-in Big Ben
resets itself and I have to start all over. No more bean tostadas
at 6 a.m. just because it feels like lunch time.
</P>
<P>
   Often, as I lie awake trying to locate the Big Dipper through my
bedroom windows, I ponder the meaning of time. We're told it's
relative. My question is: To what?
</P>
<P>
   When I was a kid, time was taken care of by my parents: Get up!
(OK.) You'll be late for school! (I'm up.) Are you up? (Almost.)
And don't try getting dressed under the covers again. (Rats!)
</P>
<P>
   And my teachers. ... Mrs. Fecser, second grade: It's time for
arithmetic. (Double rats!) Elizabeth, it's your turn to answer the
first problem. (I didn't have time to do my homework; I fell
asleep.) You're lazy. (I'm just a little kid who hasn't learned to
tell time yet.) So I've noticed.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours into the school day she'd announce: All right,
everyone. It's time for us to visit the restrooms. (I don't have to
go now.) It's TIME! (Are you sure?) Just, GO! (OK, I'll try.) Maybe
my confusion is genetic.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother Parker always had bad luck with clocks. One day I
asked Granddaddy why Grandmother took afternoon naps. I thought
that was just for little kids. He told me it was because her inner
clock was broken and he wished she'd get it fixed because the
household found it a little irritating to be awakened at 2 a.m. to
the strains of Grandmother banging out her own fractured version of
Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture complete with cannon fire. Granddaddy
suggested she find a quieter way to celebrate the Russian defeat of
the Napoleonic invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime during WW2, daylight savings time came to Jacksonville
(Fla.), and while the rest of the city moved their clocks ahead one
hour, Grandmother refused. Said it wasn't natural and she'd have no
part in it. Singularly, she trod her familiar though untimely path.
</P>
<P>
   Being a chip off Mrs. Parker's old block, I've come to realize
that clocks just don't work for me either _ like the morning I woke
my 8-year-old son, hustled him off to the shower, and fed him
breakfast. I was shoving him out the door to catch the bus when he
pointed out the obvious. It was still dark outside. We were three
hours early for the bus, so we settled down to a poker game in his
bottom bunk. Of course, we fell asleep and missed the rest of the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   And now I find that instead of getting better at this relativity
of time stuff, I'm getting worse. My only hope is that come the
year 2000, the world will slow down and catch up with me.

 &HT;    Mazda keeps LXP Protege within range of entry level
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Auto buyers are always on the lookout for deals,
especially ones that happen to include great value. It is always a
bonus to the buyer if the vehicle's brand carries a certain amount
of prestige. Nowhere is this search more intense than in the
entry-level segment.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is common for a brand to grow upscale. Car brand X
might start off at a price of $12,000, but two years down the road,
the asking price has risen to $18,000. That's not just inflation at
work. Some of the increase may come from government-mandated
changes for safety or environmental reasons, but many times, the
cars are just getting fancier or including more equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for many consumers this kind of upward growth
takes them out of that brand's price range.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda, however, has kept its eye on the entry-level buyer while
not cutting the quality of its cars or lessening its image, which
includes producing a full range of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1999 LXP Protege, Mazda has a brand-name vehicle that
isn't beyond too many buyers' financial capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Protege gets a new, more European body style this year. But
for many, the real news is that the base price begins at $13,130, a
number that puts it on the edge of the entry-level segment.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a stripped-down model. The new Protege has real
seating for five, and its structure has been enhanced with a triple
H-body construction, adding to the vehicle's safety. Window posts
and metal rails in the roof and on the side of the car are designed
to protect occupants in the event of a side impact or rollover.
</P>
<P>
   Dual front air bags are standard, and the rear doors are
enhanced with a safety catch pin. Powered by a peppy 1.6-liter
four-cylinder engine, the Protege offers 29 mpg city and 34 mpg
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the basics. There is a full complement of standard
features most entry-level consumers want, including AM/FM radio
with a CD player, power windows and door locks, cruise control,
three-point seat belts, 60/40 rear fold-down seat, rear window
defogger, tilt steering column, dual power mirrors, intermittent
wipers and tinted glass.
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning will run an additional $1,145. But even then,
consumers are looking at a fully dressed out Protege with a sticker
under $15,000 in a name-recognizable package.

 &HT;    Race is not an issue in quarterback bonanza of '99
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The National Football League, which has done as
miserable a job developing black quarterbacks as it has hiring
minority head coaches, is poised to take an important step on the
former.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the league, it could be a dawning of a new era,'' Kansas
City offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye said before the quarterbacks
worked out Sunday at the NFL combine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a year we're going to bring a lot of young blood to
the (quarterback) position,'' Raye said, ``and it's significant
that much of it is going to be young black blood. It appears that
we are not as color-blind about quarterbacks as we once were.''
</P>
<P>
   A talent pool that might rival the legendary quarterback class
of 1983 has helped the NFL's collective vision. Not since 1987,
when four quarterbacks were taken in the first round, have more
than two been chosen in the opening round. Five or six quarterbacks
might go in the first round of the 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Of the consensus top four quarterbacks this year, three
prospects _ Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida, Syracuse's Donovan
McNabb and Akili Smith of Oregon _ are African-Americans. All three
are expected to join in the opening round Kentucky star Tim Couch,
the probable first pick. Some personnel directors say they think
that all four might be taken by the middle of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 23 quarterbacks invited to the combine are
minorities, the highest number for the annual predraft workouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Eagles, who pick second, told Culpepper on
Saturday that their plan now is to take a quarterback, even if
Heisman trophy tailback Ricky Williams still is on the board. A
fourth black quarterback, Shaun King of Tulane, quietly is being
considered as a potential first-round pick by at least three clubs.
Ted White of Howard is likely to be drafted in the middle rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even Aaron Brooks of Virginia apparently improved his stock some
on Sunday by demonstrating good arm strength and running the
40-yard dash in a sub-4.6 time. McNabb and Smith apparently threw
the ball very well during workouts. Culpepper chose not to work out
but will throw during an on-campus session in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worried about the race thing at my position, but
I'd be naive to say it hasn't been something you notice about the
NFL,'' McNabb said. ``I guess there's been sort of an unspoken
feeling that we had to be clearly better than the (white)
quarterbacks for the league to consider us. But there's no hint of
that here, really. I guess that's progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970 draft, the first combining the NFL and old AFL,
49 quarterbacks have been selected in the first round. Three _ Doug
Williams of Tampa Bay (1978), Andre Ware of Detroit ('90) and Steve
McNair of Tennessee ('95) _ were black. Nearly as many Mannings _
Archie in 1971 and Peyton last year _ have been selected in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy noted that when he left the
University of Minnesota in 1977, he was the most celebrated
quarterback in the school's history and held virtually all of the
Gophers' career passing records. But when he signed as an undrafted
free agent with the Pittsburgh Steelers, he never got the
opportunity to compete at the position. He was switched to free
safety in his first minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, Dungy says he still feels slighted, but he
emphasized that none of this year's prospects will have a similar
fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely we're seeing progress,'' said Dungy, who is
interested in McNabb and King. ``People are being evaluated on
their arm strength, size and mobility on an even playing field. You
don't hear scouts saying, `Can we afford to take this guy? Will he
be able to pick up our system?' The issue of race is not an issue
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who led Tulane to its first undefeated season, pointed out
that all of the prospects have played quarterback most of their
football careers. None ever was asked to change positions.
Culpepper, McNabb and Smith all said that they have not been
scrutinized more closely because of race.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Steelers director of operations Tom Donahue, who
could take a quarterback in the second round, said the stereotypes
that once dogged black passers no longer are a factor in evaluating
prospects. ``There was this subconscious temptation to describe a
black quarterback as `more athletic` or `more mobile,' those kinds
of euphemisms,'' Donahue said. ``You simply don't hear that
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting more opportunities now,'' King said, ``because
there's a need for younger quarterbacks in the NFL and because
we're the best ones. If you can play, you can play, and it doesn't
matter if you're purple.''

<P>
   However, it is common for a brand to grow upscale. Car brand X
might start off at a price of $12,000, but two years down the road,
the asking price has risen to $18,000. That's not just inflation at
work. Some of the increase may come from government-mandated
changes for safety or environmental reasons, but many times, the
cars are just getting fancier or including more equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for many consumers this kind of upward growth
takes them out of that brand's price range.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda, however, has kept its eye on the entry-level buyer while
not cutting the quality of its cars or lessening its image, which
includes producing a full range of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1999 LXP Protege, Mazda has a brand-name vehicle that
isn't beyond too many buyers' financial capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Protege gets a new, more European body style this year. But
for many, the real news is that the base price begins at $13,130, a
number that puts it on the edge of the entry-level segment.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a stripped-down model. The new Protege has real
seating for five, and its structure has been enhanced with a triple
H-body construction, adding to the vehicle's safety. Window posts
and metal rails in the roof and on the side of the car ar designed
to protect occupants in the event of a side impact or rollover.
</P>
<P>
   Dual front air bags are standard, and the rear doors are
enhanced with a safety catch pin. Powered by a peppy 1.6-liter
four-cylinder engine, the Protege offers 29 mpg city and 34 mpg
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the basics. There is a full complement of standard
features most entry-level consumers want, including AM/FM radio
with a CD player, power windows and door locks, cruise control,
three-point seat belts, 60/40 rear fold-down seat, rear window
defogger, tilt steering column, dual power mirrors, intermittent
wipers and tinted glass.
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning will run an additional $1,145. But even then,
consumers are looking at a fully dressed out Protege with a sticker
under $15,000 in a name-recognizable package.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Congressional Republicans are reworking
themselves from the impeachment party to the tax cutting party, but
although tax cutting is a cozy comfort zone for Republican
politicians, it is not clear that tax cuts play much better with
the public than impeachment did. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ An article about bacteria in chicken led to a
conversation with old friends about how we were served chicken when
we were kids. Chicken bacteria wasn't a problem for me. Each Friday
night, I would eat at Grandma's house, she an old-country woman
who, after koshering it in a bath of rock salt, cooked her chicken
so long that no bacteria could hope to survive. (Howard Kleinberg
is a columnist for Cox News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Diplomacy is the cruelest art, judging by
Madeleine Albright's ultimatum to the ethnic Albanians _ agree to

News Service) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN _ ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ Stopping by the post
office the other morning, I ran into a couple of fellows I've known
since school days. They were excited because their gold shipment

News Service) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My inner clock is suffering
from premature Y2K syndrome. It's never been much of a timepiece,
but now it has quit working altogether. My son assures me it's just
a phase. I tell him I'm too old to be phasing. (Elizabeth Schuett,

 &HT;    Size matters when it comes to batteries
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What determines the usefulness of a ``12 volt'' automotive
battery? How do I know if my battery really needs to be replaced or
if it just needs to be recharged? When it comes time to replace a
battery, what do I need to buy? Is the most expensive the best, or
can I get by with a cheap one?
</P>
<P>
   Those are a lot of questions about such a simple box.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive batteries are manufactured and rated according to
specific criteria. First, the battery must fit into the space
provided for it and connect to the existing battery cables. This
external physical characteristic is defined as the BCI (Battery
Council International) group number. A group number is assigned to
a battery according to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Its maximum dimensions of length, width and height.
</P>
<P>
   While this might seem like a no-brainer, it is actually very
important. Besides the obvious ``well, it looks like it will fit''
and then doesn't, installation of the wrong size battery can lead
to the battery strap not fitting or working properly.
</P>
<P>
   If the battery is not secured correctly and is allowed to jiggle
or bounce around, all kinds of problems can occur. Acid spills and
broken plates inside the battery are only a couple. These two items
alone have the potential of turning a perfectly good electricity
generating device into a battery-bomb.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen far too many batteries held down with bungee cords,
slats of wood jammed around them and/or old coat hangers. The size
of the battery matters! Make sure the battery tray and strap are in
good shape and doing their jobs. If they are eaten away with
corrosion, get them repaired or replaced.
</P>
<P>
   -- Voltage: 6 or 12 volts.
</P>
<P>
   Six-volt electrical systems were replaced by 12 volts many years
ago. However, 42-volt automotive electrical systems are on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   -- Post configuration.
</P>
<P>
   Which side are the ``+'' and ``-'' mounted on the battery? It's
another seemingly simple situation until you get home and the
cables don't reach, or worse yet, get hooked up backward.
</P>
<P>
   -- The type of terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Top-mount or side-mount terminals are the most common automotive
application. Some batteries are equipped with both types to fit a
broader selection of vehicles. If you get one of these batteries,
be sure to leave the little plastic caps in place on the terminals
you don't use. This reduces the risk of electrical shorting.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a battery that fits in place, you need to
determine its electrical capacity before you go ahead and connect
it correctly.
</P>
<P>
   A battery is rated on its ability to pass ``working
electricity'' tests. Typically, there are three major ratings _
reserve capacity (RC), ampere hour (A/H) and Cold Cranking Amps
(CCA) _ that determine what a battery is suppose to do under
certain conditions. All of the tests are related to time,
temperature, the amount of electricity (called amperage) needed for
the work to be done, and the minimal amount of voltage required to
keep the electrical system functioning.
</P>
<P>
   You may find all, some or none of these ratings printed on the
top of a battery. If they are not visible, you will need to ask for
the battery documentation. Remember, all of these tests pertain to
a fully charged battery at 12.66 volts. A partially charged battery
will not perform to specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Next week: Details on battery ratings and two other ``looks
good'' ratings.

 &HT;    Size matters when it comes to batteries
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What determines the usefulness of a ``12 volt'' automotive
battery? How do I know if my battery really needs to be replaced or
if it just needs to be recharged? When it comes time to replace a
battery, what do I need to buy? Is the most expensive the best, or
can I get by with a cheap one?
</P>
<P>
   Those are a lot of questions about such a simple box.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive batteries are manufactured and rated according to
specific criteria. First, the battery must fit into the space
provided for it and connect to the existing battery cables. This
external physical characteristic is defined as the BCI (Battery
Council International) group number. A group number is assigned to
a battery according to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Its maximum dimensions of length, width and height.
</P>
<P>
   While this might seem like a no-brainer, it is actually very
important. Besides the obvious ``well, it looks like it will fit''
and then doesn't, installation of the wrong size battery can lead
to the battery strap not fitting or working properly.
</P>
<P>
   If the battery is not secured correctly and is allowed to jiggle
or bounce around, all kinds of problems can occur. Acid spills and
broken plates inside the battery are only a couple. These two items
alone have the potential of turning a perfectly good electricity
generating device into a battery-bomb.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen far too many batteries held down with bungee cords,
slats of wood jammed around them and/or old coat hangers. The size
of the battery matters! Make sure the battery tray and strap are in
good shape and doing their jobs. If they are eaten away with
corrosion, get them repaired or replaced.
</P>
<P>
   -- Voltage: 6 or 12 volts.
</P>
<P>
   Six-volt electrical systems were replaced by 12 volts many years
ago. However, 42-volt automotive electrical systems are on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   -- Post configuration.
</P>
<P>
   Which side are the ``+'' and ``-'' mounted on the battery? It's
another seemingly simple situation until you get home and the
cables don't reach, or worse yet, get hooked up backward.
</P>
<P>
   -- The type of terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Top-mount or side-mount terminals are the most common automotive
application. Some batteries are equipped with both types to fit a
broader selection of vehicles. If you get one of these batteries,
be sure to leave the little plastic caps in place on the terminals
you don't use. This reduces the risk of electrical shorting.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a battery that fits in place, you need to
determine its electrical capacity before you go ahead and connect
it correctly.
</P>
<P>
   A battery is rated on its ability to pass ``working
electricity'' tests. Typically, there are three major ratings _
reserve capacity (RC), ampere hour (A/H) and Cold Cranking Amps
(CCA) _ that determine what a battery is suppose to do under
certain conditions. All of the tests are related to time,
temperature, the amount of electricity (called amperage) needed for
the work to be done, and the minimal amount of voltage required to
keep the electrical system functioning.
</P>
<P>
   You may find all, some or none of these ratings printed on the
top of a battery. If they are not visible, you will need to ask for
the battery documentation. Remember, all of these tests pertain to
a fully charged battery at 12.66 volts. A partially charged battery
will not perform to specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Next week: Details on battery ratings and two other ``looks
good'' ratings.

doors open and a large blurry mirror flips up, displaying to
passing cars what's going on inside _ dancing and drinking at one

JEWELS INSPIRE TWO DESIGNERS' GOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the height of the dress-down grunge explosion five
or six years ago, two clean-cut prep-style guys, Mark Badgley and
James Mischka, went in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   They perfected the now-iconic slip-dress and embellished it with
the most extravagant but subtle beading, charged a small fortune
for their creations and made fashion history.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes are timeless and collectible. Each of them is a
scintillating work of art.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the designers had planned to show their extensive
fall/winter '99 line in their new and unfinished 11th-floor
showroom. But due to insurance problems that had more to do with
safety than anything else, the show was canceled, so the Bead Boys
saw guests and buyers in their current Seventh Avenue showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Seated on black chairs at chic metal tables between pipe racks
displaying yard after yard of beaded and non-beaded evening
dresses, skirts, sweater sets and a limited amount of fur-trimmed
daywear _ each creation given a name, not a style number _ the men
discussed the clothes. As a young model paraded out in a
wasp-waisted strapless black ball gown with a massive skirt and
train, Badgley, the dark-haired partner with the studious black
glasses, called the dress a ``she.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably one-fourth of the winter selection are full-skirted
ball gowns, a welcome change for the hip-and-thigh endowed who
could never get their little toe into one of Badgley Mischka's
slips. Not that the clothes were ``body-ist'' or anything, but,
Mischka said, ``We listen to what people tell us on the road at
trunk shows, and we wanted to add a silhouette for more bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The slip dress is still a classic,'' added Badgley. ``It
always works, it's always young and modern.''
</P>
<P>
   The new gowns have bodices with beaded straps, some that are
strapless, some coming off cap-sleeved, low-cut beaded chiffon
illusion tops; skirts are in iridescent satins in grayed-down,
dusty jewel tones. It is a collection that has taken its
inspiration from antique jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Portia'' dress, the full-on strapless black taffeta
ball gown, for instance, the decoration looked like an Edwardian
pearl. A rose-cut diamond necklace was suspended on the front of
the dress under the bust.
</P>
<P>
   Badgley Mischka created an entire series of low-cut black
dresses designed to enhance their customers' fabulous jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Color choices for fall and winter also include what Badgley
calls ``a memory of color,'' or hues that change in the light and
that defy description. What I thought was a toast and platinum
velvet gown was actually green over nude that had been washed and
faded. The top of the gown was a waterfall of clear beading,
splashing down from the shoulders on chiffon net. ``We have upped
the luxury quotient,'' laughed Badgley.

ACTION FEATURE `RONIN' FILLS DVD-ROM VOID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ OK, let's do the math: There are something like 1.3
million DVD players sitting atop televisions and stereo systems in
America, swelling to perhaps 2.3 million by year's end.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But 5 million computers already have been sold with DVD-ROM
drives, with as many as 30 million expected by year's end. The
DVD-ROM drives allow owners to not only use any CD, CD-ROM or DVD
movie, but to also run prodigiously sized computer games,
multimedia and other material on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's say you're a movie company with a stunt- and
chase-filled little action film that did decent but not amazing box
office last fall, like, say ``Ronin.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you just drop your nice little movie on the DVD market, to
compete against the 2,500 or so other titles already there? Or do
you figure out a way to differentiate it, adding features that will
appeal to all those computer owners with DVD-ROM drives who don't
just want to watch a movie on their PC?
</P>
<P>
   Well, MGM Home Entertainment figured that decision was a
no-brainer, even if few others have followed suit (a notable
exception being last fall's feature-laden ``Lost in Space'' disc).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost nothing out there for DVD-ROM,'' said MGM Home
Entertainment marketing manager Dave Miller. ``You've got guys out
there with 300-MHz, 400-MHz machines and nothing to watch on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM hopes to remedy that, at least slightly. So you can buy the
``Ronin'' disc (it hits the market Tuesday), pop it into your DVD
player and watch storied director John Frankenheimer put pros like
Robert De Niro through their paces in a brisk action thriller set
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you can drop it into your computer's DVD-ROM drive and on
March 14 watch something really cool: novel hybrid programming
using the Internet, film outtakes cached on the disc and
Frankenheimer's just-created running commentary on the creation of
the film and its much-lauded stunts and chases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sending out what we think is the first truly convergent
product,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Ronin'' wasn't a hugely successful picture, Miller said
it was chosen as a test case because ``it's definitely a guy's
movie, and with Frankenheimer, you have a film director who's
passionate about talking about his craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer's discussion will be partly based on questions
submitted by fans as they register their discs in the weeks before
the show, said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Those suggestions will be edited down to a 25-minute audio
program with software ``hooks'' embedded in it. When the program
starts playing over the Internet, those hooks will trigger movie
scenes and outtakes on the disc to illustrate Frankenheimer's
points, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   That trick will largely eliminate lag time in the program's
transmission, despite its data-dense nature. Afterward,
Frankenheimer (whose credits include the brilliant Cold War
artifact ``The Manchurian Candidate'') will take part in an
hourlong online chat session.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great idea, intriguing enough to draw participation by
Microsoft, which is providing the computer power needed to handle
the expected online audience. And with 8,000 films in MGM's
library, it could be the start of a lot of intriguing new
productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is flexible, as long as we get (the outtakes and
software triggers) into the machine ahead of time,'' Miller said.
``If we think ahead and have all the material put on the disc to
play with, then we can come back to have a talk later. If there's
enough interest in this, we see it as a model for the future.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The music of Wire
</P>
<P>
   One of the fun things about reading Wired magazine over the
years has been the ``Colophon'' section tucked in the back of the
book. Most of the fine print there is devoted to geek-speak about
the hardware, software and other production details behind the
magazine's creation.
</P>
<P>
   But at the bottom is a paragraph highlighting what really made
the magazine possible _ the creative fuel for the month, as it
were.
</P>
<P>
   This month's list included such things as cranberry-date oat
cakes, Squaw Valley, jackhammers and lukewarm Perrier. The list
also usually includes a few interesting albums. Tracking down those
musical references has sometimes led to a great new find, or the
reclamation of a neglected old favorite.
</P>
<P>
   In something of the same way, Wired and Rhino Records have
issued a CD called ``Musical Futurists,'' an offbeat collection
that brings together such out-there artists as lounge god Esquivel,
free jazz freak/prophet Sun Ra, pop iconoclast Todd Rundgren,
hip-hop folkie Beck, ambient wizard Brian Eno and turntable titan
DJ Spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Several well-annotated pages of liner notes explain why each
artist is included in an album that aims to spotlight those who
used technology to create new genres and widely influence other
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the contributions of the artists on this disc, the
music you listen to ... would be very, very different,'' writes
Colin Berry, Wired's music editor.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Though it's a somewhat unlikely compilation _
further leavened with such creative forces as Devo, Tangerine
Dream, Sonic Youth, Laurie Anderson, Steve Reich and Thomas Dolby _
it generally does a good job achieving its goals.
</P>
<P>
   I might quibble with the Rundgren song choice _ ``International
Feel/Never Never Land'' is hardly the most representative or
interesting song in his vast catalog. But including Anderson's ``O
Superman (For Massenet)'' and Godley &AMP; Creme's transcendent ``Cry''
overcomes any sins.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, though, the album spotlights an array of musicians,
virtually all of whom deserve further investigation, who broke
ground in both music and technology in wildly different genres.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, despite the wide variety, the album indeed somehow
hangs together ``like a great mixed tape, a disc you'd be happy to
pop in for a reprieve from what's spewing from the music-video
channel or commercial-radio frequencies.''
</P>
<P>
   No spew here. Just the real stuff. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Veterans wanted
</P>
<P>
   Veterans have long told their war stories, but now, they have a
place to put them, in the California Military Museum in Sacramento.
The state-owned museum is looking for personal stories, photos and
other memorabilia from California veterans that it can include on
its Web site at (www.militarymuseum.org).
</P>
<P>
   If you have material you think may be appropriate, contact the
museum at webmastermilitarymuseum.org, or write to California
Military Museum, attention: CSM Dan Sebby, Web site manager, 1119
Second St., Sacramento, Calif. 93814. You can also call the museum
at (916) 442-2883.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Web site already has an extensive amount of
information, including histories of California military
installations, units and ships; an events calendar; an online
bookstore and lengthy listings of links to other military history
sites. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Look ma, no wires
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation gamers chafing at the short leash of their
controllers will welcome Doc's new wireless pair of dual-analog
controllers, which it's selling for a little less than $60 in most
major toy and gaming outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The controllers communicate by infrared beams with a port that
plugs into one of the PlayStation's two controller slots. A
``sleep'' mode conserves the two AAA batteries needed for each
controller.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with a TV remote control, you don't have to point the
device directly at the port to make it work, which is good for
those of us who believe body English will actually help you avoid
that oncoming monster. It has a range of about 30 feet.

MAYOR THROWS HIS HAIR IN THE RING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just a week and a constitutional crisis ago, I
took vacation vowing never to write about politics again.
</P>
<P>
   So then what happens? There's an outbreak of all the great
political sins and emotions _ fear, loathing, envy, hate, gluttony
_ and all in true San Francisco style.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultant Clint Reilly announced his candidacy for
mayor last week, and Mayor Willie Brown upstaged him with the two
words mayors are never supposed to utter during political
campaigns: ``fare increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, we'll pay more for bad service on the municipal transit
system, and as we know from restaurants, paying more for bad
service makes you like it more.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, while I was away the mayor got a new hair cut. He
got all of them cut. He had his head shaved. I don't know if this
is the youth look, the Jesse Ventura look or he's giving out
flowers to tourists arriving at the airport. But it doesn't look
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, now there's a tad more room in the hat for the ego.
</P>
<P>
   Let me know when he gets pierced.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that I hate Willie Brown. On Monday, Brown
went on a local television program and failed to deny there would
be a fare increase. Instead he attacked the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost,'' he told television host Ross McGowan,
``you've got to know that the San Francisco Examiner is a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Hate Willie Brown Club of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he inflated his importance. The world doesn't hate
Willie Brown. The world knows him only from sycophantic reports in
magazines and on ``60 Minutes.'' All the people who hate Willie
Brown are in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't all of the people. But it's most of the people part of
the time _ that part of each day when they're trying to find a
parking space or waiting for a bus. Of course, that can be a long,
hate-filled time.
</P>
<P>
   As the first columnist to stick it to Brown, rather than suck up
to him, I resent him saying my newspaper is a ``wholly owned
subsidiary'' of the Hate Willie Brown Club. The way he usually
talks about us, you'd think he'd at least call us the world
headquarters of the Hate Willie Brown Club.
</P>
<P>
   He'd be wrong anyway. No, we in the press don't hate
politicians. We love them the way San Franciscans love sourdough.
We have them for lunch, sliced or torn, and we love them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we dunk them in a stew of their own juices.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Brown made the uncharacteristic mistake of getting
tripped up by a tongue other than his own.
</P>
<P>
   A member of his hand-picked Muni task force told the public that
the transit system needs a more stable funding base, and thus fare
increases may be necessary. And Brown agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that Muni needs a fare increase, but the last
thing Brown needed was mention of the words just 90 minutes before
Clint Reilly announced his candidacy for mayor. Some suspect the
mayor scheduled the official release of his Muni plan to upstage
Reilly's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   That it did, the way setting your own garage on fire upstages
the new house next door.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Reilly interesting, besides the fact that he's
interesting, is that he's a political consultant gone on to the
hard stuff _ trying to get elected himself.
</P>
<P>
   This takes guts, as well as money, and he has both. Surely he
knows that people hate political consultants more than politicians.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no one to blame and no one to bill if the real
politician wins _ you know, the bald one.
</P>
<P>
   I mean the follicly challenged one.
</P>
<P>
   This is San Francisco, after all, where the overweight can be
protected from ridicule. Not politicians, though. Not yet.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Clover Has the Skinny on Nonfat-Milk Flavor  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Last week we brought you the tasting panel's top
choices for whole milk. But what about the nonfat variety?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panelists tasted eight brands of nonfat milk, and were
surprised at how much they liked the milks, agreeing that many
brands have improved vastly since the days when nonfat milk's
watery appearance and taste often earned it the label ``blue
milk.'' Panelists also concurred that nonfat milk is best served
very cold.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors went to  &UR; Clover Stornetta  &LR; (1/2 gallon, $1.69-$1.99
at many supermarkets), which came in second place in the panel's
previous whole-milk tasting. And panelists scored Clover's nonfat
milk higher than Lucerne, their top choice for whole milk. Three
panelists particularly liked the mouthfeel, and all the panelists
commented on the exceptional taste. All would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Lucerne  &LR; (1/2 gallon, $2.11 at Safeway),
winner of the whole-milk tasting. While one panelist described the
flavor as ``clean and honest,'' two others did not like the watery
appearance. Three would buy it; two might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Berkeley Farms  &LR; (1/2 gallon, $1.99-$2.15 at many supermarkets)
came in a close third, three points lower than Lucerne. Two
panelists called it nondescript, but another thought it had too
much flavor. Three would buy it, one might buy it and one would
not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to one of the more expensive brands,  &UR; Straus &LR; 
(1/2 gallon, $3.19-$3.39 at many supermarkets). Three panelists
liked the distinctive grassy flavors of this organic milk, but two
others thought it had an off taste. Two would buy it, one might buy
it and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Castle Creamery &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $2.79 at Andronico's) and
 &UR; Horizon &LR;  (1/2 gallon, $2.69-$3.11 at many supermarkets) tied for
fifth place. One panelist thought Castle Creamery tasted sweet,
while another described the flavor as sour. Two panelists thought
it had a richer mouthfeel. Three would buy it, one might buy it,
and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were more divided on Horizon. One thought the organic
milk had almost no milk flavor, and another described it as thin
and watery. But the remaining panelists liked the clean, mild
flavors. Three would buy it; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Two brands scored too low to rate: Michael's Organic and
Sunnyside.

 CHRON   EDITORS NOTE: Here is a recipe to make on the weekend, with 
 enough leftovers to use throughout the week in two other recipes 
 plus suggested ideas for other dishes. Recipes follow, plus 
 suggestions in optional trim.  
   
   
 THE WEEKEND COOK: Persian Rice Weaves an Exotic Spell  
   
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Among the most popular of Iran's legendary rice
dishes is chello, aromatic, long-grain rice that is washed, soaked
and steamed in a traditional, almost ritualistic process that
renders each grain dry, separate and astonishingly firm-tender.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As it steams, the rice forms a prized crust _ tah dig _ on the
bottom of the pot. Chello is served mounded like a pyramid, with
the deep golden tah dig as a garnish. A thin layer of butter,
yogurt, egg, potato or lahvosh helps create the crust. Our recipe
uses butter, yogurt and egg.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, basmati rice _ similar to Persian rice _ is
used to make chello. It is traditional to soak the rice in salted
water before steaming it, which produces a grain that is tender but
resilient, a texture difficult to duplicate without a saltwater
soak.
</P>
<P>
   When chello is served with grilled meat, the dish is called
chello kebab. Chello kebab is easy to make but takes time. The meat
must be marinated and the rice soaked and steamed _ both of which
can be done without much attention. An organized cook can start in
the morning and have a feast for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Chello kebab is a great company dish, and the leftovers can be
used many ways during the week. The two accompanying weeknight
recipes are inspired by another Persian rice dish called pollo,
where steamed rice is layered with meat, fruit, nuts and seasonings
and resteamed. Although these recipes are adaptations, they are in
the spirit of pollo-style rices where flavors and textures are as
intricately woven as a Persian rug.
</P>
<P>
   The herb sauce is also inspired by the Persian kitchen. Dill,
scallions and mint are readily used in Persian salads, but we whir
them into a pestolike condiment to accompany the kebabs. The sauce
keeps up to four days refrigerated, and you'll find many uses for
it during the week, too.
</P>
<P>
   Chello kebab is a dish for both gourmet and novice cook. It's a
wonderful project for anyone who appreciates good rice, regards
cooking as a pleasure and enjoys delving into underexplored
culinary territory. Yet, because it doesn't require special
equipment or cooking skills, chello kebab is easy enough for the
less adventurous cook to make with good results.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MASTER RECIPE: CHELLO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sumac is a red berry with a citrusy flavor. This spice,
traditionally sprinkled on chello, is available in Middle Eastern
markets. If you can't find it, omit it.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   5 cups basmati rice (preferably from India), cleaned
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon saffron threads, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons plain yogurt (not nonfat)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   Ground sumac (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the rice in a large bowl. Pour in lukewarm water to cover
by 2 inches. Swish the rice with your fingertips, let it settle,
then pour off the cloudy water. Repeat 4 or 5 times, until the
water runs clear. Drain. Return the rice to the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Dissolve 3 tablespoons of the salt in 12 cups cool water. Pour
over the rice, swish it briefly and set aside to soak for 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Place the crumbled saffron in a bowl and pour 11/4 cups boiling
water over it. Cover and steep for at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the egg and yogurt in a small bowl until well combined. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 4 quarts water into a large, heavy pot with a tight-fitting
lid. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Cover and bring to a
boil over high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the soaked rice well, then stir into the boiling water,
cover, and return to a boil. As soon as the water boils, uncover
the pot and boil hard until the rice is cooked but still firm (not
brittle) in the center, in 3 to 4 minutes. Check the rice after 3
minutes by biting into a few grains. Try not to under- or over-cook
it. Drain the rice well.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse out and dry the pot. Return it to medium heat. Pour all
but 3 tablespoons of the melted butter into the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Stir 11/4 cups of the cooked rice into the egg mixture. Spread
it evenly over the bottom of the pot. Increase heat to high. Add
the remaining rice, mounding it into a neat pyramid with a spatula.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the remaining 3 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons
water. Drizzle the mixture over the rice. Place a kitchen towel
over the pot, then cover tightly with the lid. Steam for 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and steam for 45 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the sink with an inch of cold water. Stand the
still-covered pot in the water for 5 minutes to help loosen the
crust.
</P>
<P>
   Submerge 2 cups of the cooked rice in the reserved saffron
water; let stand for 1 minute. Drain well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, mound about 5 cups of the remaining rice into a
pyramid on a serving platter. Sprinkle a scant cup of the
saffron-tinted rice over the top.

 &UR; WEEKNIGHT RECIPE: CURRIED LENTILS, LAMB &AMP; BASMATI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lentils mixed with rice are traditional in Persian cooking,
sometimes with the addition of meat or dried fruit. A handful of
currants or raisins in this easy dish would be a welcome
counterpoint to the spices. Add either when you add the peas.

   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups lentils, picked over for pebbles, rinsed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion (10 ounces), cut into medium dice
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons good quality curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon (scant) ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon (scant) cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   8 pieces of lamb (from Weekend Recipe), finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 cups basmati rice (from Master Recipe)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup frozen peas, defrosted
</P>
<P>
   Instructions
</P>
<P>
   Bring 31/2 cups salted water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add
the lentils, cover, reduce heat to medium and simmer until just
tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid. Set
the lentils aside.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.
Add the onion and saute, stirring frequently, until golden, about 7
minutes. Reduce heat, if necessary, toward the end of the cooking
time so the onion doesn't burn.
</P>
<P>
   Add the curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the black pepper,
cumin, cayenne and cinnamon. Saute, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add
the reserved lentil cooking liquid and boil for 30 seconds. Add the
lamb and simmer for 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly stir in the rice, reserved lentils and the peas,
tossing until the rice mixture is completely coated with the
seasoned liquid. Using a spatula, mound the rice into a pyramid.
Cover tightly, reduce heat to low and steam for 10 minutes.

 &UR; WEEKNIGHT RECIPE: BASMATI RICE WITH DRIED CRANBERRIES &AMP; CHICKEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The classic version of this dish calls for preserved sour
cherries. You may use dried sour cherries if you find them, but
dried cranberries are similar and readily available. The
combination of sweet-tart fruit, black pepper and a hint of
bitterness from saffron is exotic and lovely. The lengthiest step
of this easy dish is caramelizing the onions.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups dried cranberries or dried sour cherries
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 very large onion (12 ounces), minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   8 pieces of chicken (from Weekend Recipe), finely diced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 cups basmati rice (from Master Recipe)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup saffron-tinted basmati rice (from Master Recipe)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped walnuts, toasted
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Place the dried cranberries in a bowl. Pour 1 cup of boiling
water over them and let steep for 10 minutes. Drain, reserving the
soaking liquid. Set the cranberries aside.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large, heavy pan over medium
heat. Add the onion and salt. Saute, stirring frequently, until the
onion is deeply caramelized but not burned, 35 to 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Increase the heat to high. Deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup water.
Boil for 1 minute. Add the reserved cranberry liquid, the chicken,
lemon juice and pepper. Simmer for 1 minute. Add the cranberries,
rice, almonds and walnuts. Toss gently but thoroughly to combine.
Using a spatula, mound the rice into a pyramid. Cover the pan,
reduce heat to low and steam for 10 minutes.

 CHRON   EDITORS NOTE: Food, nutrition and health studies bombard us, but 
 the seemingly endless information is often as confusing as it is 
 enlightening. Starting today, with Food in the News, The 
 Chronicle's Food staff aims to change that. This regular 
 round-up column will make practical sense of the latest 
 nutrition-related studies _ as well as offering offbeat but 
 tantalizing snippets of other food news to put on your plate.

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: A Tomato a Day Keeps the Doctor Away  
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ The tomato is the media star of the moment after a
study published last week in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute confirmed its cancer-fighting ability.
<P>
   Unlike the parade of other foods researchers suspect might have
anti-oxidant properties, the tomato is the real deal. The latest
report, out of Harvard Medical School, analyzes 72 past studies
linking tomatoes and cancer rates and concludes that eating a large
amount of tomato products may help reduce cancer risk _
particularly cancers of the prostate, stomach and lung.
</P>
<P>
   The tomato's secret is its high concentration of lycopene, the
carotenoid that makes the fruit red. But simply eating lots of raw
tomatoes won't do the trick. To fully release the lycopene,
tomatoes must be heat-processed. And to properly distribute the
cancer-fighting properties throughout the body, tomatoes should be
eaten with a little fat.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 12 ounces of tomato juice a day offers enough
lycopene to have some impact, the Harvard report shows. But without
oil to help the body absorb it, much of the advantage can be lost.
So eat some buttered toast with your morning tomato juice, says Dr.
Clare Hasler, head of the Functional Food program at the University
of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you eat a raw tomato on an empty stomach, you're not going
to get the lycopene,'' she says. ``That's why lasagne and pizza are
good sources _ you get that bit of fat, and the sauce provides a
high concentration of lycopene. But be reasonable. It doesn't mean
you can layer your pizza with tons of Italian sausage.''
</P>
<P>
   So exactly how much marinara is beneficial? Scientists are still
trying to figure that out, but one of the studies showed men who
ate 10 servings of cooked tomato products a week had lycopene
levels elevated enough to fight the cellular changes that precede
cancer. Other nutritionists say a serving a day is a good
guideline.
</P>
<P>
   And a serving is much less than you think.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slice of pizza is probably a serving and I would think a
typical plate of spaghetti is several servings,'' says professor
John Eurdman, director of nutritional sciences at the University of
Illinois. He heads up a National Cancer Institute study of lycopene
and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, tomato processors are ecstatic about the NCI report.
In ads, Heinz is touting ketchup as a cancer-fighter. And the
California Tomato Growers Association expects a boost in business.
About half of the world's processed tomatoes come from the state,
where about 3.2 million tons of paste are made each year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Eat Out, But Carefully &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Americans are eating out twice as often as they did 20 years
ago, according to a recent U.S. Department of Agriculture report.
That's good news for the restaurant business, but bad news for
diners' health.
</P>
<P>
   The new study based on food consumption surveys from 1977-95
shows the proportion of food we eat away from home has nearly
doubled. But food eaten at restaurants, fast-food joints and
take-out places is often much less healthy than what we eat at
home.
</P>
<P>
   For example, respondents reported that fat makes up about 31
percent of the calories of their home-cooked food. But it jumps to
almost 38 percent in the food they eat out.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, researchers says, is psychological.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers may believe that it is less important to consider
the nutritional quality of food away from home or (they are) less
willing to sacrifice taste when eating out,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Safer Sandwiches &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Government researchers have come up with another reason to eat
lots of horseradish with your roast beef. The root can knock out e
coli, listeria and a host of other disease-causing agents in food.
</P>
<P>
   The magic little microbe inhibitor is something called allyl
isothicoyanate, which shows up in high levels in horseradish and
mustard oil.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes from a food chemist from Oklahoma Sate
University who worked with USDA researchers in a search for
alternatives to chemical preservatives.

 Bay Area Pastry Chefs Trade Cookie Secrets  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Pastry chefs are unique among cooks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They head to the kitchen before dawn to supervise a quiet riot
of tiny chemical explosions and alchemy.
</P>
<P>
   They are precise people obsessed with their craft. News about
changes in the water content of butter can stop conversations.
Baking is, above else, chemistry. And chemistry is precise.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the nature of baking helps explain why about 80
Bay Area pastry chefs spent an entire morning earlier this month
debating the finer points of measuring brown sugar and the
attributes of a good cookie.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs who gathered in a Financial District hotel were part
of the Bakers Dozen, a loose-knit group that meets quarterly to
swap tips, troll for new recipes and look for new talent. Each
meeting features a different subject. This time, it was the cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies are close to the perfect dessert: portable, personal and
full of possibility. With just a few bites, a cookie conveys a lot
of information about the amalgam that comprises the dough. In the
hands of a good cook, imagination and technique can elevate what
is, at its essence, a homey and simple culinary concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like cookies to be comfort food. I don't want them to
be too complex,'' said Carolyn Weil, pastry chef and cooking
teacher from Berkeley and a founder of the Bakers Dozen. Her
favorites are cookies that feature the flavors of brown sugar and
oatmeal.
</P>
<P>
   Oatmeal is a key ingredient in the chunky chocolate oatmeal
cookies made by Black Cat chef David Chesarek _ just one of about
50 offerings chefs brought for an informal tasting. Rows of
delicate meringues, chocolate crisps, rum creme-filled vanilla
discs and lots in between snaked across a table at the back of the
hotel meeting room.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of home cooks who attended hoped to glean tips from
the experts and improve their own techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Knauer, a home cook from San Francisco, figured out why
her chocolate chip cookies sometimes turn out flat: too much brown
sugar. Although she uses the same-size measuring cup, she realized
she doesn't always pack it the same. She left vowing to weight the
brown sugar after she packs it.
</P>
<P>
   Knauer was brave enough to bring a batch of her family's
favorite cookie: apricot half moons. They held up well against the
professionals' offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Here is her recipe, plus four others created by professionals
and presented at the cookie showdown. Although there was no
official winner, these are among the cookies that won praise from
Bakers Dozen organizers or created a buzz among cookie tasters.

   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Line a baking sheet with baker's parchment. Cut a 12x16-inch
length of parchment and place nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Sift together the flour, soda and salt. Set aside. Combine the
molasses and coffee; set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Using an electric mixer on medium speed, cream the butter for 1
minute. Add the sugar and cream for 30 seconds, scraping the sides
of the bowl. Add the minced ginger and spices; mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Add the flour mixture alternately with the molasses/coffee and
mix well, scraping the sides of the bowl from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Using a spatula, scrape the dough onto the length of parchment,
then with the help of the parchment, roll the dough into a
2-inch-diameter log. Place in the freezer until firm.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to bake, unwrap the log and slice into 1/4-inch-thick
rounds for thin, crisp cookies; or into 3/4-inch rounds for soft,
chewy cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Coat the cookies with granulated sugar, then place on the baking
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 14 minutes, reversing the pan at the halfway
point. Cool on rack.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 48 thin or 16 thick cookies.

 A Taste of Paradise: The Bay Area offers a culinary voyage 
 across the South Pacific  
 Hawaii _ Fiji _ Tonga _ Samoa  
   
   
 By M.M. Pack  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ One Friday night last spring, after the last class
of the week, a procession of cars pulled away from the California
Culinary Academy in San Francisco heading for a clifftop back yard
overlooking San Pablo Bay. Some of the cars carried food and beer;
others sagged under loads of firewood and stones; still others were
stuffed with burlap bags, chicken wire, and bales of ti and taro
and banana leaves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proudly leading the parade was a tiny blue Honda Civic
containing two large men and _ lolling in the back seat _ a very
recently slaughtered, disconcertingly intact 150-pound pig.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the pig, we were a pretty diverse crew. From Tokyo
to Tucson to Texas, from Manila to Maine, some of us were not long
out of high school, others were changing from careers as varied as
truck driving, professional dancing and technical writing. We
seemingly had nothing in common except our passionate love for food
and cooking. And this night we were going to have a luau.
</P>
<P>
   Class member David Vera, from Fiji, led us in digging the
roasting pit, building the bonfire, heating the rocks, burying the
pig in a shroud of burlap and aromatic leaves and then
not-so-patiently waiting until the next afternoon for the feast.
And feast we did, not only on the succulent, smoky, fork-tender
kalua pig, but also on poi and yams and poke, tropical fruit salad
and coconut haupia.
</P>
<P>
   This taste of the Pacific Islands only left me hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   The cuisines of the Pacific Islands may be the original fusion
food. The history of the Pacific is one long story of peripatetic
voyaging and settling, warfare and colonization, cultures colliding
and morphing, all of which affected the food.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiian cuisine, most familiar to mainlanders, is a blend of
foods from distinct eras of migration, according to Rachel Laudan,
author of ``The Food of Paradise'' (University of Hawaii Press,
1996).
</P>
<P>
   The first wave was the Micronesian voyagers of the third century
who brought pigs, chickens, taro, sweet potatoes, bananas, sugar
cane and coconuts to add to the ocean's wealth of seafood.
Americans and Europeans _ many from Portugal _ began arriving in
the late 18th century, introducing new fruits and vegetables, salt
meat and salmon. Asians and Filipinos landed in the 1880s, bringing
rice, noodles, tofu, soy, Asian vegetables, herbs and spices.
</P>
<P>
   This heady larder all started to come together in 1920s with the
comfort fare called Local Food _ raw fish poke, teriyaki, Spam
musubi, saimen noodle soup with fishcake, the salted dried fruits
called crack seed, Portuguese sausages and malasadas, and
fruit-flavored Hawaiian shave ice. In the early 1980s, Local Food
jumped another notch when restaurant and hotel chefs began turning
the ingredients into sophisticated fare, launching what they called
Hawaiian Regional Cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The food of Fiji also reflected the cultures that settled there
_ originally Melanesians and Polynesians, then Western traders and
missionaries. Chinese immigrants brought rice, soy and ginger, and
Indians added the panoply of spices, peppers and curries that are
such an integral part of Fijian food today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fijian cuisine is the only one I know that includes a
variety of native green vegetables,'' Vera says. Some of these are
taro leaves; bele, ``slimy but tastes good,'' Vera says; tightly
curled fern shoots called ota; spinach; moca (pronouned ``motha'');
duruka, buds of a plant resembling sugar cane that's like fibrous
asparagus; and nama, which is a reef seaweed with a crunchy
texture.
</P>
<P>
   Tonga and Samoa weren't as heavily settled by Westerners so the
food in those countries remains closer to the original island
cooking. Samoan and Tongan cooking tends not to be highly spiced;
it features cooked breadfruit, taro root, taro leaves and green
bananas served with coconut milk and onions.
</P>
<P>
   Suckling pig roasted on a spit is well-loved in Tonga and
barbecued turkey tails are popular in Samoa, says Levi Lelea, who
serves plate lunches at Levi's Market in Daly City. ``So is a dish
called luau pilikaki, which is made from taro leaves, coconut and
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   While each of these island cultures is unique, they still share
some cooking methods and ingredients, such as earth ovens (called
imu in Hawaii, lovo in Fiji, umu in Samoa), dug in a pit, to
slow-cook food; staples such as taro root and leaves, bananas,
coconut milk, yams, pork; and prepared dishes made from fresh raw
fish.
</P>
<P>
   But the migration to the Pacific Islands has not been one-way.
Many Islanders have settled in Northern California, too. The
Association of Bay Area Governments counted more than 21,000
Hawaiians in the nine-county Bay Area in 1990, and that number has
increased in the last decade. Robert Uhrle, executive director of
the Samoan Community Development Center, speculates there are as
many as 30,000 Samoans in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Several cultural groups sponsor events and serve as
clearinghouses, including the Pacific Islander Cultural
Organization in San Francisco and the Polynesia Polynesia
cq &LR; Cultural Organization in San Jose, whose members have compiled a
cookbook (see cookbook list).
</P>
<P>
   Island food at Bay Area restaurants ranges from
California-Hawaiian fusion at Aloha Junction in Mill Valley to
straight-up plate lunches at Hawaiian Drive-In No. 28 in the
Mission and Tita's Hale Aina in the Castro. If you time it right,
you can catch some music with your food at the Templebar in
Berkeley or the Punahele Grill in San Francisco. Levi's Market in
Daly City serves take-out Samoan plate lunches and desserts six
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   But you can also cook Island food yourself, helped by
ingredients from across the Pacific. Poi, taro leaves, frozen
prepared food and all manner of Island snacks can be found in
specialty stores (see Supplies listing), and fresh Island fish
varieties are often available from fishmongers. And fresh tropical
produce can often be found in well-stocked supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   All of this can easily be turned into Island food at home, a
comfort food that personifies the word multicultural. The more I
learned about Pacific Island food, the more I appreciated that in
our months together my classmates had taught one another their home
cooking from Japan, the Philippines, Fiji and all over the States.
That's why, on that evening by the water before we scattered to our
corners of the planet, it seemed so fitting to celebrate our
diversity through the rich culinary mosaic of the Pacific.

 &QL; 
 &UR; HAUPIA WITH TROPICAL FRUIT COMPOTE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While this simple coconut pudding often is made with cornstarch,
the more traditional method is to thicken it with arrowroot.
Arrowroot produces a creamier, lighter pudding with a more
pronounced coconut flavor. The classic Hawaiian presentation is to
cut the pudding into squares and serve on pieces of green ti leaf.
Alternatively, chill the pudding in molds, then turn out onto
dessert plates. Accompany with fruit compote. Adapted from ``The
Food of Paradise: Exploring Hawaii's Culinary Heritage,'' by Rachel
Laudan (University of Hawaii Press, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons arrowroot
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 cups coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Fruit Compote (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Mix the arrowroot and sugar in a saucepan; gradually whisk in
the coconut milk until there are no lumps. Place over low heat and
cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture just simmers and has
thickened. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into an 8-inch square cake pan or 6 individual molds,
cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, until the pudding
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Cut into 6 squares (or turn out of molds) and garnish with fruit
compote.

 &UR; KOKODA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Variations of marinated raw fish are found throughout the
Pacific Islands; kokoda in Fiji, oku in Samoa and poke in Hawaii.
This Fijian version, from David Vera, traditionally is made with
walu, but any very fresh, firm, white-fleshed fish, such as sea
bass or swordfish, may be used. Make this one day in advance; the
fish should marinate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound walu, ono, or other firm white-fleshed fish fillets
</P>
<P>
   1 cup white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh lemon or lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   To Finish:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup grated carrot
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup diced red onion
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup diced green onion
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup diced peeled and seeded tomato
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced seeded fresh Thai pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely minced lime zest
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup canned coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   The day before serving, cut the fish into 1/2-inch cubes. Place
in a bowl with the vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Cover and
refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 45 minutes before serving, drain the fish and
rinse it briefly in cold water. Drain the fish again. Place in a
bowl and add the carrot, red onion, green onion, tomato, cilantro,
pepper, lime zest and juice, and the coconut milk. Mix gently.
Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.

 &UR; LAULAU &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Laulau is a traditional Hawaiian dish that can be made with fish
and pork, beef and/or chicken. The key to its great flavor is fat.
If you use very lean meat or fish, the laulau may be dry and the
flavor disappointing. The traditional outer wrapping of aromatic ti
leaves is beautiful and contributes much to the taste of the dish,
but if ti leaves are not available, you can use foil instead. This
recipe comes from David Vera.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 two-inch cube pork butt
</P>
<P>
   1 two-inch cube beef chuck steak
</P>
<P>
   1 two-inch cube butterfish, or other rich fish such as salmon
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 fresh taro leaves, or 1 to 2 large collard green leaves (see
note)
</P>
<P>
   2 fresh ti leaves
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Cut a 4-inch length of kitchen string. Season the meat and fish
with a generous amount of salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   If using fresh taro leaves, cut off and discard the tough stems,
then simmer the leaves in water to cover for at least 45 minutes.
This destroys the calcium oxalate crystals in the leaves. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Pass the ti leaves back and forth over a flame (such as a gas
burner) for 10 to 15 seconds. This enhances the flavor and makes
the leaves a little more pliable.
</P>
<P>
   Place a taro leaf in the palm of your hand. Place the meat and
fish in the center of the leaf and wrap the ends of the leaf around
the filling. Wrap 2 or more taro leaves around the bundle so it is
completely enclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Place 1 ti leaf shiny side down on a work surface. Place the
other ti leaf shiny side down across the first one at right angles
(forming a giant ``X''). Place the meat/fish bundle in the center.
Bring the 4 ends of the leaves up around the bundle, then tie the
bundle with string.
</P>
<P>
   Place the bundle in a steamer over simmering water, cover, and
steam for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, remove the string and ti leaves. Accompany the laulau
with steamed rice or poi.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Fresh taro and ti leaves are available in stores that
stock Pacific Island specialties.

 &UR; PALUSAMI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Variations of this dish, with and without meat, are prepared in
Samoa, Fiji and Tonga. In this version from David Vera, canned corn
beef is the traditional filling, but well-marbled beef brisket also
works. Wrapping the contents in taro and banana leaves may take a
little practice, but the end result is so delicious, it's worth the
effort. Having two pair of hands for the task makes it easier. The
slow baking enhances the nutty flavors of the taro and coconut in
combination with the beef.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   7 fresh taro leaves, or one package frozen taro leaves (see
note)
</P>
<P>
   1 pound beef brisket, well-marbled, cut into 1-inch cubes; or 16
ounces canned corned beef, cubed
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, cut into small dice
</P>
<P>
   1 tomato, cored, seeded and cut into small dice
</P>
<P>
   2 chile peppers, deveined and minced (optional)
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons cilantro, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cups coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 banana leaf
</P>
<P>
   2 limes, cut into wedges
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If using fresh taro and banana leaves:  &LR; Cut off and discard the
taro leaf stems, then simmer the leaves in water to cover for at
least 45 minutes. Drain. Select a medium-sized bowl to act as a
mold. Line the bowl with the 2 largest taro leaves, forming a sort
of leaf container. Arrange 3 more leaves inside to strengthen the
bottom of the leaf container.
</P>
<P>
   Place the beef in the center, then add the onion, tomato,
peppers and garlic. Top with the cilantro. Pour the coconut milk
over the filling and season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Tear the remaining 2 taro leaves into small pieces and place on
top of the mixture. Carefully fold the large taro leaves up and
over to form a bundle. Cut the banana leaf in half lengthwise.
Place the halves at right angles to each other (forming an ``X'')
on a flat surface. Transfer the taro leaf bundle to the center of
the ``X'' and fold the banana leaves up and around the bundle. Wrap
the entire packet in foil.
</P>
<P>
   Place the bundle in an oven-proof dish and bake for 11/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If using frozen taro leaves:  &LR; Thaw and drain the package of
leaves. Line a medium-sized bowl with a large piece of foil. Inside
the foil, form a lining using half of the taro leaves. Following
instructions above, fill the leaf container. Spread the remaining
taro leaves over the filling. Wrap the foil over all, forming a
sealed bundle.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, open the bundle while it is still piping hot. Squeeze
lime juice over the filling and serve.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Black Cat's Salad Is Whisker-Lickin' Good  
   
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ When we ordered the artichoke and potato salad with
poached lemons at Black Cat, my friend couldn't quite accept the
fact that some one would actually eat a whole lemon _ peel, pith
and all.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But that's one of the highlights of this simply delicious salad
at the San Francisco restaurant celebrating the cuisines of four
cultures that come together on Broadway: Chinese, Italian, seafood
and the old-time Barbary Coast.
</P>
<P>
   For the salad, chef Reed Hearon cooks small fingerling potatoes
and sets them aside. Then he cooks artichokes and lemons together,
adding potatoes during the last minute to reheat. The ingredients
are drained, then lightly coated with a simple vinaigrette made
from olive oil and the warm juices from one of the poached lemons.
It's simple yet delicious.
</P>
<P>
   The most time-consuming task is preparing the artichokes. They
must be trimmed and stored in lemon water so they won't discolor
before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Hearon, who also owns Rose Pistola, opened the Black Cat in
1998, but it looks as if it has been there for years. At no other
restaurant in the city can you find a delicious tea-smoked duck, a
raw seafood bar, steaming chowders, a thick steak for four and a
veal chop Milanese all on the same menu. It's a smorgasbord of
flavors, but the simplicity of the warm salad celebrates the best
of California freshness.

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients: &QL; 
4 lemons
</P>
<P>
   4 medium artichokes
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   8 small fingerling potatoes
</P>
<P>
   8 parsley sprigs, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large mixing bowl with cold tap water and add the juice
of 1 lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Working with 1 artichoke at a time, remove the leaves and pare
the woody stem with a vegetable peeler. Cut the heart (with stem)
in half lengthwise and scoop out the fuzzy choke. Immediately place
the artichoke heart halves in the bowl of acidulated water. This
keeps them from discoloring.
</P>
<P>
   Bring large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Drain the
artichoke hearts and add them, along with the remaining 3 lemons to
the boiling water. Simmer until the artichokes are tender, about 20
minutes. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, simmer the potatoes in a generous amount of salted
water until they are tender. Drain, peel if desired, and cut in
half lengthwise.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the warm potatoes, artichoke hearts and the parsley in a
serving bowl. Cut each lemon in half. Add 4 of the halves to the
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze the juice from the remaining 2 halves into the olive
oil. Season with salt and pepper and stir to emulsify. Pour this
vinaigrette over the vegetables and toss gently to coat. Add more
salt and pepper, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the component parts equally among salad plates.

YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE _ OR JUST MY SHOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What makes the lights in tennis shoes light up _ batteries or
chemicals?
</P>
<P>
   _ T.N.
</P>
<P>
   A: The light comes from a watch-type battery, said David Gatto,
chief executive officer of L.A. Gear.
</P>
<P>
   The battery is encased in a temperature-resistant epoxy that is
activated with motion. ``Picture a can with a wire inside,'' Gatto
said. ``The wire vibrates and touches the inside of the can,
completing the circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoe's batteries normally last about four to six months.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Gear introduced the first lighted shoe in 1992. ``It was an
instant success,'' Gatto said. First popular with older children
and teen-agers, the customers are now ``decidedly below age 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many others died in the Audie Murphy plane crash of May
28, 1971?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.D., North Richland Hills, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Murphy, 46, was traveling in a twin-engine plane with four
business associates when it crashed into a mountain near Roanoke,
Va. All five were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The war hero and actor was flying from Atlanta to Martinsville,
Va., to visit a manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several groups have led efforts to commemorate
Murphy, the most decorated combat soldier of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A fan club was begun in 1995 by Stan Smith. For more
information, write to Audie Murphy National Fan Club, 8313 Snug
Hill Lane, Potomac, MD 20854-4057. There's also a World Wide Web
site about his accomplishments at www.audiemurphy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get the music from ``Star Trek Voyager''?
</P>
<P>
   _ V.P., Fort Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A: GNP/Crescendo Records has released soundtracks for ``Star
Trek Voyager'' and many other science-fiction TV shows and films.

RUDYARD KIPLING'S ROUSING STORIES DESERVE REVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A capricious editor suggested that I deliver a regular column on
books that are acknowledged as classics or ought to be. Almost 10
years and 500 entries later, I've begun repeating myself.
</P>
<P>
   Very soon after the advent of this series, readers assumed I
have read every truly notable book and am keen on every
distinguished author. Far from it, and I'm often at a loss for
responding to requests for producing essays on authors whose works
I've never investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Zweig, for example. I've obtained an English translation
of ``Beware of Pity,'' and when I get around to reading it, I may
be able to say something about Zweig, who to me has been only
another foreign name.
</P>
<P>
   Or George Sand. Have I even ``seen'' any of her books?
</P>
<P>
   Or Rex Beach. I've read none of his chest-pounding bestsellers
of yore but probably could fake an essay on the strength of having
watched three of the five (!) movie versions of ``The Spoilers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still they ask, and often I comply _ with a consideration of
Stephen Vincent Benet, for example, or a valentine to Rebecca West.
Frequently I'm asked to write about an author or book that was
covered before the reader in question caught up with the series. Do
Faulkner, they say, or Poe or Mark Twain or Edith Wharton.
</P>
<P>
   The champion, though, is Rudyard Kipling.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no longer surprised when someone asks me to commit a Kipling
tribute, because it happens so often. Some years back, I devoted a
column to ``Kim'' and supposed that took care of Kipling, with
whose work _ poetry, fiction, tales for children _ I was familiar
partially but not comprehensively. In recent years I've read more
of his good stuff, reacting to all those requests.
</P>
<P>
   Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936), an India-bred Briton, certainly is
popular with American readers, although I haven't figured if he's
popular ``still'' or popular ``again.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writing prime he was the most beloved writer throughout
the world since Dickens, and in 1907 he became the first British
author awarded the Nobel Prize in literature. But his reputation
plummeted in his own lifetime, then continued its descent
posthumously. Anti-Kipling sentiment may have been political
primarily, when it became fashionable to scorn Kipling as apologist
for English imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   That Kipling has staged a comeback isn't argued. Recent critical
revaluation is positive, but lay readers are the constituency that
has brought all of his writings back into print.
</P>
<P>
   He's a man's writer. Men are captivated by the rough
colloquialism of the ``Barrack-Room Ballads'' (''Danny Deever,''
``Gunga Din'' et al.), although Kipling is on occasion a competent
lyric poet to please women.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a writer for boys, rather than generally a writer for
children. The ``Just So'' stories for younger children may not
favor a gender, but the ``Jungle Books'' and ``Captains
Courageous'' and ``Kim'' were consciously crafted for the male
adolescent reader. Because they are not ``written down'' to their
intended audience, adults also enjoy these rousing adventures.
</P>
<P>
   A charge against Kipling was that he couldn't, and therefore
didn't, write ``adult'' fiction; and his biographers generally
agree that he wrote ``The Light That Failed'' as a rebuttal. It's a
good enough novel with a valid tragic hero, but it misses greatness
for seeming padded. One could believe it might have been one of
Kipling's marvelous stories, which tend to be longer than most
short stories and contain enough elements to stock a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Kipling's genius for economical storytelling has never been
questioned. He is an absolute master of the long short story,
exemplified by ``The Man Who Would Be King.'' In a Kipling tale
something is always happening or is about to. He's a writer to stir
real heart-thumping excitement in the reader.
</P>
<P>
   One might suppose he was a happy man. He wasn't.

ONE FILM'S BATTLE FOR THE FRENCH CINEMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The French may be eternally grateful to the US soldiers
who took part in the invasion of Normandy, but some are less
enthusiastic about the Hollywood invasion.
</P>
<P>
   For years, some French, especially cultural purists, have
bemoaned the pervasiveness of American culture, and have reserved
particular scorn for Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural commentators complain that the steady rise of the
number of Hollywood films is not only dumbing down French audiences
but is also endangering an indigenous film industry regarded as the
last vibrant and independent one in Europe. Despite those warnings,
French moviegoers are voting with their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Paris, where the cinematograph was invented a century ago, is
more than the birthplace of the cinema. It is widely considered the
capital of film appreciation. But the type of film the French
appreciate is changing. Movie attendance in France rose last year
dramatically, from 150 million to 175 million, but the audience for
French films shrunk from 51 million to 44 million.
</P>
<P>
   A French film, ``Le Diner de Cons'' (loosely translated as the
Dinner of Idiots'') was the second highest-grossing film last year;
selling 8 million tickets. But the gap between it and the American
blockbuster, ``Titanic,'' which sold 20 million tickets, seemed to
capture the fortunes of the competing film industries.
</P>
<P>
   All of this explains why this month's release of a film called
``Asterix and Obelix versus Caesar'' has taken on David and Goliath
proportions. With a budget of about $45 million, it is the most
expensive French film ever made.
</P>
<P>
   It stars the French icon, Gerard Depardieu, and includes cameo
appearances by many contemporary French stars. The hype surrounding
the film, meanwhile, seems to underscore French anxiety over the
erosion of their culture.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on the exploits of French cartoon characters
that were created in the 1950s in response to an invasion of
American and British imports, which, at the time, were accused of
diluting the cultural distinction of French cartoons. The cartoon
series is wildly popular, having sold some 280 million comic books
in 77 countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the live-action film, Obelix and Asterix and their friends in
a tiny French village fend off Roman invaders by drinking a magic
potion that gives them superhuman powers.
</P>
<P>
   Some cultural purists have suggested it is patriotic duty not
only to see the film, but to like it. Albert Uderzo, who with
collaborator Rene Goscinny created the cartoon characters on which
the film is based, was blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new film has to sink the Titanic,'' he said. ``French
pride is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   But others suggest intellecutal honesty is a French virtue that
trumps pride, and French critics have displayed ample quantities,
dismissing the film as much ado about nothing. The consensus among
critics is that the movie, unlike the cartoon strip, is not funny,
and that the best performance comes not from the hulking Depardieu,
who plays Obelix, but from the scrawny Italian actor Roberto
Benigni as the devious Detritus, who steals the potion and the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Bercoff, film critic for France-Soir, explained the
ambivalence that tinged many honest assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like high treason to say it, an attack against the
very heart of the nation, a crime worthy of court martial and
execution by firing squad, but I have to confess: after a few
minutes, I was royally bored by this film,'' he said. ``Nobody
applauded and a few people whistled because it was so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Parisien, which gave the film two out of five stars, was even
more blunt: ``It isn't funny. The actors play themselves. The
special effects are old hat. Big stars don't necessarily make for a
good film.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Figaro, which is among the most nationalistic of newspapers,
still had to ask: ``With all this sumptuousness, this respect for
detail, this stunning cast, these extraordinary settings, with this
whole marvellous spectacle that three generations have waited
impatiently to see, one question remains: why doesn't it work
better?''
</P>
<P>
   While the critics hate it, the French public is more
enthusiastic. In its first week, the film broke the French weekly
attendance record, selling 2.7 million tickets. By the end of last
week it had sold a total of 4.3 million. Claude Berri, the film's
producer, said the film needs to sell 5 million tickets to break
even, and hopes to sell 10 million, a goal that seems easily
reachable. Whether it can eclipse the record set last year by
``Titanic'' is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing the critics, Depardieu defends the movie as being
rooted in the tradition of distinctive French filmmaking. But even
he agrees the French film industry is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' he said, ``is most producers are stupid.''

STRIFE REVISITS GETTYSBURG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GETTYSBURG, Pa. _ There's another war raging on the rolling
terrain where Pickett's Charge, the most deadly and horrific
encounter in the three-day Civil War battle of Gettysburg, occurred
in July 1863. This one is between a small town and the Washington
bureaucracy and the forces of commercialism and preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Causing the commotion are plans for a visitor center to
accommodate crowds of 1.7 million annually at the 5,900-acre
Gettysburg National Military Park and the adjacent National
Cemetery where President Lincoln gave his immortal address. The
center would include a museum to safely house and preserve the
largest, richest single collection of Civil War artifacts in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But just as it was during the Civil War, the enemy is defined by
where you live. What sounded like a swell idea in Washington _
setting up a private-public partnership to turn a decaying,
cash-strapped national park into a state-of-the-art attraction _
has enraged the community that was supposed to benefit most from
it.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't any side in the fight over America's most famous
battlefield that doesn't claim to have the best interests of
Gettysburg at heart. That includes the National Park Service, the
town fathers and merchants, a private developer, and a variety of
historical societies and Civil War buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even Congress has stepped in, holding a hearing earlier this
month to determine what's gone wrong and who's to blame in this
hallowed place just north of the Mason-Dixon line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the job done at Gettysburg involves change, and change
is frightening to many people,'' said John Latschar, the park
superintendent and blunt Vietnam veteran who has become the symbol,
to many, of the federal government's insensitivity and political
blundering of the visitor center project. ``People don't like me. I
may seem arrogant because I think I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Latschar thinks he can do is get a $39 million, 118,000
square-foot visitor facility open by 2005. There, tourists would be
able to view storytelling exhibits on the causes and consequences
of Gettysburg, the critical and costly Union victory where 51,000
men died, were wounded or captured; see an educational film; catch
a tour bus; eat lunch; and buy a souvenir book or map. It would
also house a restored Cyclorama, the 350-foot panoramic painting of
Pickett's Charge that hung from 1884 to 1891 in the Tremont Street
building that now houses the Boston Center for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for reclaiming Ziegler's Grove, an important
piece of the battlefield, by demolishing two notable structures:
the current visitor center, a red-brick house built in 1921 by the
Rosensteels, a prominent local family, and the unusual Cyclorama
building, designed in 1961 and now on the list of sites eligible
for the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Rosensteel Eckert, 80, is so angry about the plan to raze
her old home that she is threatening to sue the Park Service to
retrieve the priceless collection of war artifacts her family
deeded it in 1971. Meanwhile, a historic-architecture advocacy
group is waging a campaign on the Internet to save the Cyclorama
building from the wrecking ball.
</P>
<P>
   But the real sticking point is the relocation of the visitor
center and museum to a 45-acre piece of private property inside the
park. The new spot is not only slightly outside the borough of
Gettysburg, but is also nearly a mile _ beyond easy walking
distance _ from the dozens of fast-food restaurants, gift shops,
and tourist attractions that have grown up across Steinwehr Avenue
from the visitor center parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gettysburg is a one-industry town, full of small, family
businesses, and we believe to physically isolate the visitor center
from that town will have a potentially devastating effect,'' said
Ted Streeter, a member of the Gettysburg borough council. ``The
Park Service plan is greedy and short-sighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Park Service officials insist they have listened to the
community at more than 30 public hearings, and kept the
decision-making, begun in the mid-1990s, open every step of the
way. They also tried to accommodate local businesses by dropping
proposals for an IMAX theater and gift shops, scaling back the
visitor center food service, and planning shuttle buses into the
historic center of town.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of townspeople and preservationists who
don't trust the Park Service. They blame the agency for failing to
tear down a private observation tower _ a 310-foot eyesore built in
1972 as a tourist attraction next to the park. They are angry, too,
that in 1990 the Park Service swapped a 7.5-acre tract of
battlefield with Gettysburg College, which promptly carved it up to
build a rail spur.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Silbey, a Washington consultant and longtime critic of
federal management at Gettysburg battlefield, said the Park Service
was so anxious to close a deal on the visitor center that it
secretly gave monopoly rights to commercial developer Robert
Kinsley of York, Pa. Kinsley said he is a patriot, not a profiteer,
and has set up a nonprofit foundation to solicit donations and
secure loans for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park is under siege,'' Silbey said. ``This is all about
money _ an enormous amount of money _ and the crown jewel of
American battlefield parks is going to get honky-tonked up.''
</P>
<P>
   A drive through town, past the fudge shops and T-shirt
emporiums, the buffet restaurants, Christmas stores, and Civil War
wax museum, shows that commercialization hasn't exactly bypassed
Gettysburg. Eileen Woodford, northeast regional director in Boston
of the National Parks and Conservation Association, a private group
that backs the Park Service plan, said the benefits of restoring
the park and protecting its antiquities far outweigh the risks of
selling some souvenirs and soft drinks near a modern visitor
center.
</P>
<P>
   The public areas of the old visitor center _ the dimly lit
exhibit halls, the ``electric map'' of the battlefield that
resembles a large, seventh-grade science project, and the washrooms
with broken fixtures and missing tiles _ are ship-shape compared to
the basement storerooms. There, in 14 cramped rooms uncontrolled
for temperature, humidity, bugs, or dust, a huge collection of
Civil War artifacts is deteriorating. Swords are rusting, leather
pouches are moldy, paint on military-band drums is flaking, and
photographs and diaries are crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take care of what is in our stewardship,'' admitted
Paul Shevchuk, the park's assistant curator who has worked in the
chilly, windowless basement for 20 years. Shevchuk may be down
there a while longer. The Park Service's visitor center plan is not
going forward until Congress finishes its review.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress can't persuade the Park Service to stop the
development, the community is prepared to fight it in court. Walter
Powell, president of the Gettysburg Battlefield Preservation
Association and an opponent of putting the visitor center in the
park, believes a compromise location could be found that would
satisfy Park Service needs while pleasing the community and
preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trouble is, the Park Service has circled its wagons, saying
it's our way or the highway,'' Powell said. ``We're just not in a
situation where we can do that.''

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Flooded with memories of summer
storms
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share, via Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray,
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Leslie Ann Clark
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   When you've grown up in Oklahoma's Tornado Alley, you're
accustomed to dangerous weather, and if you are forced to go
without it, you really miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Like the plants in my yard in the D.C. suburb where I now live,
I, too, begin to wither and dry up.
</P>
<P>
   I call my parents when I see on the Weather Channel that it's
raining back home, and they stand on the back patio, holding the
phone up to the aluminum awning for me to hear the pitter-patter of
the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes if I'm real lucky, I even get to hear a long roll of
thunder in the background. I sit listening to the crackle of the
cordless phone and I'm transported back in time ...
</P>
<P>
   I can remember stepping off the faded yellow school bus into the
hot Oklahoma sun. As I crossed the street and headed home, the wind
started to pick up, blowing my hair into my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Dead leaves scurried across the street, like the other kids
hurrying for home. Sometimes the wind would be so strong that bits
of sand would sting my bare legs.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the corner onto my street and facing west, I could see
the most glorious sight there is to see in the springtime: Huge,
white cumulus clouds billowing up into the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   I stood dumbstruck staring at the swirling concoction. The tops
boiled and bubbled, reaching higher and higher into the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Just when I thought it couldn't grow any bigger, I'd hear a low
rumble in the distance and see a flash of light from deep within
the cloud.
</P>
<P>
   The wind turned sharply cooler and, taking a deep breath, I
could smell the sweet, clean rain before it fell.
</P>
<P>
   Running home, I witnessed the sky quickly turning a deep
black-blue. Soon the darkness was illuminated with lightning
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   I watched as the strikes made a path to the ground, uniting
heaven and earth for one brief moment and then releasing. Thunder
soon followed, and the process repeated more quickly each time.
</P>
<P>
   I'd count the seconds between the lightning and thunder to
compute the distance of the storm. Kid meteorology 101.
</P>
<P>
   The willow tree in my front yard swayed to and fro like an old
lady stretching in the morning, bending and twisting on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   As I threw my books onto the front porch, I felt the first bit
of rain, big drops that hit so hard they splattered a good 2 inches
across your bare leg.
</P>
<P>
   I stood in the driveway with my eyes closed, head tilted back
and mouth open, letting the rain wet my lips, teeth and tongue. The
drops hit with a thud on my head, harder and harder, until I
couldn't stand it any longer.
</P>
<P>
   I ran to the safety of the indoors and, with my wet face pressed
against the picture window in our living room, stood and watched
the miracle take place.
</P>
<P>
   First the flower beds filled. Puddles formed around the trees.
Soon a river was sweeping down the edges of the street, taking
twigs and leaves and everything in its path down the gutters.
</P>
<P>
   When rain began to let up, that was my signal to grab the
umbrella and rush outside for an afternoon of play.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting to no one in particular, I ran barefoot to the tiny
river in the street. The rain chilled my toes. Pebbles and sand,
rushed along by the current, swept over the tops of my feet.
</P>
<P>
   After the storm ceased, the sky would turn the most ominous
color, a greenish-yellow, as the sun struggled to make its way
through the clouds -- and then, so gold it almost hurt your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As the world returned to normal, I'd see it, a beautiful rainbow
forming over the western sky -- red, orange, yellow, green, blue
and purple arching above the rooftops of my neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly kids and dogs would make their way outside into the
street for the last hour of play for the day ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear that one, Leslie?'' my mom yelled into the phone
as the rain pounded the roof and nearly drowned out her voice.
``That was a good one! I just wish you were here to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm already there, Mom. And I can see it all.

DIET IS PART OF WINNING STRATEGY FOR DENVER BRONCOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in sports, ``s,'' and lifestyle, ``l,'' category)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Four hours before a football game, Denver
Broncos' quarterback John Elway would eat eggs, potatoes and
ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just likes it,'' team nutritionist Jackie Berning said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Berning won't take credit for Elway's performance
during last month's Super Bowl, when the Broncos beat the Atlanta
Falcons 34-19, she made sure he and his teammates ate well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two Super Bowl wins came when we started feeding the
Broncos breakfast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Berning, like many mothers, is a big believer in the power of
food.
</P>
<P>
   As nutrition coach for several professional teams, including the
Broncos, the Denver Nuggets, the Cleveland Indians and the Colorado
Rockies, she credits a balanced diet for laying the foundation for
good health, fitness and peak athletic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing to me is people fuel their cars better than
they fuel their bodies,'' said Berning, who has been working with
the Broncos for 15 years and is a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people show up at the office with no fuel in the
tank?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And having no energy or feeling too tired are two of the biggest
excuses people give for not exercising, according to a recent
national survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't always think of their diet as a reason they lack
energy,'' said Dr. Kristine Clark, director of sports nutrition at
Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right foods, such as eggs, whole grains, fruits,
vegetables and dairy products, can help fuel energy and give that
extra push needed to get up and exercise, whether you are a serious
athlete or just trying to stay in shape,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Essman of Guilderland, N.Y., makes her living, in part,
through exercise, and can't afford to run out of energy. Some days,
she teaches three exercise classes with appointments in between as
a personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find I have to have a lot of energy,'' said Essman, who owns
Janet's Personal Workout, a fitness training company. ``I don't
think there's any magic formula. I don't drink any potions or eat
special bars. I eat food.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's a good menu for energy? According to the American
Dietetic Association, carbohydrates are the main source of fuel for
working muscles. That's why foods high in carbohydrates should
comprise at least 60 percent of the calories in an athlete's menu.
</P>
<P>
   Good food choices include breads, grains, fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But when you eat is just as important as what you eat.
</P>
<P>
   If you work out in the morning, Clark recommends eating a
scrambled egg with vegetables and whole wheat toast, one to two
hours before.
</P>
<P>
   If you exercise after work, she suggests taking a 4 p.m. break
to eat chicken salad on whole wheat bread, a hard boiled egg,
low-fat sports bar or yogurt with fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Back to breakfast, Berning believes most people will do better
even if they just grab a banana before heading out the door.
</P>
<P>
   People who are running on empty are easy to spot. ``Their head
is bobbing at their desk and they have trouble staying awake,''
Berning said.
</P>
<P>
   Other snacks for energy include: 12 ounces of orange juice, one
cup of grapes and one bagel, low-fat vegetable soup with a pita
pocket, and a low-fat muffin with a cup of skim milk.
</P>
<P>
   Essman likes to munch on fruit and pretzels during an especially
busy day. She also makes a point of washing down her meals and
snacks with plenty of water: ``A lot of people are fatigued because
they don't drink enough water,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to Berning, the Broncos don't hit the field until
they have eaten breakfast at team headquarters. ``It's a
continental breakfast, low-fat muffins, fruit juice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative _ running on an empty stomach and no fuel _
feels like slamming into a brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Broncos say, `I'm going to be a hurtin' unit,'''
Berning said.

MORE IN ANGER THAN IN SORROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a year well supplied with deplorable behavior, Dan
Caccavaro wondered if the word _ at least in its verb form _ hadn't
expanded beyond its statutory limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, the word suggests an emotion that is
ongoing, like hate or love, as in `I deplore bigotry,' he wrote.
``But politicians use the word as a synonym for denounce, a verb
that denotes an action'' _ deploring the actions of Saddam Hussein,
for example. ``Is this a correct use?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   I hoped it was, since I too have used deplore to mean
``denounce.'' And as it turns out, Caccavaro was on to something:
Deplore has changed its tune to suit 20th-century tastes, but so
gradually and stealthily that few have noticed, much less objected.
</P>
<P>
   Deplore originates with the Latin deplorare, to bewail, weep
bitterly, mourn, and its English connotation, for centuries, was
primarily regret, not anger. A 1642 reference to ``our deplorable
brethren and neighbours'' describes people in a wretched condition,
the sinned against rather than the sinners. But it's not hard to
lament and condemn in the same breath, and Samuel Johnson, author
of the famous 1775 dictionary, noted that deplorable was
``sometimes, in a more lax and jocular sense, used for
contemptible; despicable: as, deplorable nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The denunciatory flavor seems to have stayed in the background,
though, till our century. In the '50s and '60s, a few usage
arbiters noticed the waning of the primary meaning: Theodore
Bernstein, for example, notes in 1965 the growing ``undertone of
disapproval'' in deplore. ``To say that `The President deplored the
tactics of Congress' is to say not only that he regretted them but
also that he frowned upon them.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently we live in a time more fond of denunciation than
lamentation, though deplore still often conveys both senses. And
neither meaning of the word is restricted to an ongoing condition:
You can't deplore a person, but you can deplore either a single
event or a permanent situation _ or both, on a really bad day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Captive audience
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing many local readers have deplored is the former wording
of donor credits on WBUR-FM in Boston _ ``Listeners support us,
along with (company name),'' they used to say, as if the listeners
were paying the sponsors. The revised version should please critics
_ ``We're funded by you, our listeners, and by (increasingly long
list of company names),'' is the new formulation. But the
transition wasn't entirely smooth: One January morning we woke to
hear ``We're funded by you, our prisoners'' _ an apt description,
some spouses might say, of us morning-to-midnight public radio
junkies.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Two thumbs down

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the shocking language news came from Tyco, whose
Sing and Snore Ernie, the talking Muppet, was programmed to say
``It feels good to lay down.'' This year, it's Ty Inc., creator of
the Beanie menagerie, that goofed, giving birth on Jan. 1 to
Millenium the misspelled bear. Ernie's grammar was corrected in
subsequent production runs, and given the depth of Beanie madness,
a similar fix in Ty's Millenium bug could make the single-n version
one hot teddy. Get him now, Beanie believers, before the fatal
correction comes. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Ann Landers also blundered in a recent column, printing a letter
that demanded a ban on the phrase rule of thumb, claiming it
derived from an English ruling allowing a man to beat his wife with
a stick no thicker than his thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Word writers have worked hard over the past few years to correct
this language legend, and you'd think Ann's staff might have
checked it before serving it up to millions of readers. The true
story isn't simple, but rule of thumb was being used to mean
``rough guide'' a century before Judge Francis Buller, in 1782,
issued his controversial guideline for wife-beating. And it wasn't
called a rule of thumb: Neither the judge nor the outraged public
used the phrase in connection with the case. It was only in the
1970s that the (erroneous) link between spousal abuse and rule of
thumb was embraced. (For a more complete history, and other verbal
entertainments, see Jesse Sheidlower's Web site at
www.randomhouse.com/jesse/.)
</P>
<P>
   As for Ann Landers, she gets nine lashes with a wet ziti _ no
bigger than her thumb, of course.

   ``People don't always think of their diet as a reason they lack
energy,'' said Dr. Kristine Clark, director of sports nutrition at
Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right foods, such as eggs, whole grains, fruits,
vegetables and dairy products, can help fuel energy and give that
extra push needed to get up and exercise, whether you are a serious
athlete or just trying to stay in shape,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Essman of Guilderland, N.Y., makes her living, in part,
through exercise, and can't afford to run out of energy. Some days,
she teaches three exercise classes with appointments in between as
a personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find I have to have a lot of energy,'' said Essman, who owns
Janet's Personal Workout, a fitness training company. ``I don't
think there's any magic formula. I don't drink any potions or eat
special bars. I eat food.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's a good menu for energy? According to the American
Dietetic Association, carbohydrates are the main source of fuel for
working muscles. That's why foods high in carbohydrates should
comprise at least 60 percent of the calories in an athlete's menu.
</P>
<P>
   Good food choices include breads, grains, fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But when you eat is just as important as what you eat.
</P>
<P>
   If you work out in the morning, Clark recommends eating a
scrambled egg with vegetables and whole wheat toast, one to two
hours before.
</P>
<P>
   If you exercise after work, she suggests taking a 4 p.m. break
to eat chicken salad on whole wheat bread, a hard boiled egg,
low-fat sports bar or yogurt with fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Back to breakfast, Berning believes most people will do better
even if they just grab a banana before heading out the door.
</P>
<P>
   People who are running on empty are easy to spot. ``Their head
is bobbing at their desk and they have trouble staying awake,''
Berning said.
</P>
<P>
   Other snacks for energy include: 12 ounces of orange juice, one
cup of grapes and one bagel, low-fat vegetable soup with a pita
pocket, and a low-fat muffin with a cup of skim milk.
</P>
<P>
   Essman likes to munch on fruit and pretzels during an especially
busy day. She also makes a point of washing down her meals and
snacks with plenty of water: ``A lot of people are fatigued because
they don't drink enough water,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to Berning, the Broncos don't hit the field until
they have eaten breakfast at team headquarters. ``It's a
continental breakfast, low-fat muffins, fruit juice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative _ running on an empty stomach and no fuel _
feels like slamming into a brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Broncos say, `I'm going to be a hurtin' unit,'''
Berning said.

SOX PROSPECT CHO HAS A MAJOR LEAGUE MSSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ He wore the uniform at Fenway Park on the
Fourth of July, when he became the first from his country to pitch
for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was Christmas in Korea, the day of Jin Ho Cho's
homecoming, and he put on the uniform again. This time, he was
standing at the grave of the father who had died seven months
earlier, when his son was on the other side of the world. Promise
me, the father had told his family as he lay dying of cancer, that
you won't tell my son until he comes back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I win my first game in the big leagues,'' Jin Ho Cho
whispered at his father's grave, ``I will dedicate it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Heartbreak requires no translation. Between Cho's halting
English, and the hollow expression in his eyes, there was no
mistaking the sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe my dream, to be a major league baseball player,'' Cho
said here  &UR; Monday &LR;   &UR; afternoon &LR; , sitting on a folding chair in an
empty clubhouse where only memories echoed off the walls. ``My
father say, `Cho, don't tell him.' Me? Not happy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was about to board a plane for home in Los Angeles, where he
had been enrolled in intensive English classes, when a Korean
reporter approached and asked about his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `He's still living, what are you talking
about?' '' said Sangyeol Moon, the LA-based correspondent for The
Daily Sports Seoul, who was here  &UR; Monday &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   When he landed in Korea, Cho said, an older brother was there to
meet him, and confirmed that his father was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father died in May, on May 31,'' Cho said.
</P>
<P>
   He died just several days after Cho had been summoned to Trenton
from Single A Sarasota to pitch for the Red Sox in an exhibition
against their Double A farm club. Cho pitched well that night, and
when the Sox were short a starting pitcher in July, general manager
Dan Duquette called up Cho, who became one of the few pitchers ever
to reach the big leagues in his first season of professional
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, he had been pitching for Korea University. Now
he was facing Frank Thomas and Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Korea University, I saw Frank Thomas on TV,'' Cho said.
``Good hitter. Albert Belle, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Cho spoke so little English that pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan bought an English-Korean dictionary and communicated with
him by pulling out a Daffy Duck sketch pad and drawing pictures.
Cho distinguished himself, allowing just one run in six innings,
but he wound up taking the loss in a 3-0 Red Sox defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He would make three more starts for the Red Sox, with
diminishing results each time, before being sent back to Trenton.
He went 0-3 with a no-decision and an 8.20 ERA in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came back to Trenton,'' said Ralph Treuel, who was the
Thunder's pitching coach and now is Boston's minor league pitching
coordinator, ``you could see he was emotionally worn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he'd lost a little bit of his edge. He'd been
humbled a little bit at the major league level, and I think he'd
gotten a little tired. His stuff wasn't there like it was before.
We shut him down to give him time to recoup. You could see he was
exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho began last season in extended spring training and changed
teams faster than some teammates changed undershirts, advancing to
Sarasota and Trenton before receiving the summons from Boston and
the subsequent return ticket to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost like being traded four times,'' Treuel said.
``New towns, new teammates. Physically and emotionally, that's a
whirlwind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Cho if he was scared or nervous when he arrived in the big
leagues, and you cannot be certain he understands the question,
even while pantomiming wiping your brow. His answer? ``No,'' he
said. ``Not scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to Trenton, Cho finally had a chance to settle
into the business of learning America. He lived with teammates John
Barnes and Jim Chamblee, and the other pitchers in the Thunder
rotation _ guys like Paxton Crawford and Jack Cressend and Robert
Ramsey _ made it a point to befriend him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a likable guy,'' Treuel said. ``The guys took him in
with open arms. They told me stories about taking him to Denny's,
and how much he would eat. He had a huge appetite.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Cho about Trenton and he says, ``Everybody my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   His agents, Steve Schneider and Gus Dominguez, had a
Korean-American law student, Kenneth Yoo, working as an intern. Yoo
stayed in regular contact with Cho, sending him the latest Korean
CDs from LA, where they're much easier to find than in Boston or
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very frugal,'' Yoo said. ``Most of his money, he sends
home to his family in Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho has discovered some native pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch American TV,'' Cho said. ``ESPN, baseball games. I
like action movies. `Braveheart.' Mel Gibson. `Lethal Weapon.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He has a friend in fellow Korean pitcher Sun Woo Kim, who spent
last season in Sarasota. They attended instructional league
together, and also studied English together in a school in LA.
</P>
<P>
   Where once it was rare to see a smile, Cho's face now will light
up in recognition. When a minor league coach called out ``Cho!'' in
passing, Cho responded, ``What's up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the quicker he can become adapted to the culture here,
the quicker he'll make it back to the major leagues,'' Treuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Few in the Sox organization have questions about his ability,
although he'll almost certainly start this season in Triple A
Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's definitely got major league stuff,'' said Treuel,
citing a fastball that Cho throws in the low 90s, as well as a
slider and a changeup that remains a work in progress. ``It's just
a matter of time, and a matter of need on the major league club.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho expects to return. ``I want to go back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has a promise to keep.

DISCOVERING `NATURAL' NEW ZEALAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ULVA ISLAND, New Zealand _ About half of all tourists to
Kiwi-land come just to look at the wildlife _ and that means birds.
</P>
<P>
   These southern lands had no native land mammals. Human
intervention has brought a plague of four-footed things. Bambi and
his cousins are among the most destructive. Introduced European red
deer are such pests that there is no closed season and no limit on
how many red deer a hunter can take. Rats and cats, ferrets and
weasels, even the intensely cute Australian possum _ all have
changed the landscape by chewing on the native plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, aptly named South Island is more ``natural''
than North Island. But to get close to how things really were,
visitors with a taste for natural history will go a little farther
south.
</P>
<P>
   Even closer to the Antarctic than South Island lies an
archipelago consisting of a single inhabited isle, Stewart Island,
and a scattering of seldom-visited and lonely islets. Of these, for
many reasons, little Ulva Island is the best-known secret place,
served by water taxi and crisscrossed by walking trails sensitively
sited by the national Department of Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you could get there on your own, but that would be a
serious error. After all, Americans have come halfway around the
world in both directions _ east/west and north/south _ and no
matter how many field guides we read and carry, there is no
substitute for local knowlege. Even travelers who have already
toured the temperate rain forests of South Island will be out of
their element on Ulva. Fortunate is the visitor who is introduced
to Ron Tindal, a retired Department of Conservation officer who can
take some credit for the uniqueness of Ulva Island and who, for a
very reasonable fee (some $25 US, including the water-taxi fare)
will show you a dozen or a hundred (depending on how well you pay
attention) things that would otherwise escape your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The uniqueness of Ulva Island is not in its vegetation or its
bird life as such but in the incredible richness of both. The
original owner of the island, Charles Traill, was an amateur and
enthusiastic naturalist who recognized long before most New
Zealanders that introducing foreign animals was a great mistake. He
kept deer off the island, and rabbits as well. Ferrets and weasels,
both introduced to try to cut down the rabbit population in most of
New Zealand, never made it to Ulva.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkably destructive Australian opossum was introduced to
New Zealand in the late 1920s. It is a nectar and pollen eater,
putting it in direct competition with almost all of New Zealand's
land birds. When someone asked Roy Traill, Charles's nephew and
second owner of the island, what he would do if someone put possums
on Ulva, he replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``First I would shoot the person who brought the possums. Then I
would shoot the possums.''k
</P>
<P>
   The only alien animals on Ulva were rats and mice, including the
Norway ship rat, the common house mouse, and the Polynesian rat,
introduced deliberately by the Maoris, who ate them with gusto.
Beginning in the early 1990s, the Department of Conservation
undertook a serious program to remove the rodents and return Ulva
to a pristine past unequaled in any New Zealand reservation open to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Tindal, at 70, with the fine shock of white hair that implies a
vigorous outdoor life, remarked to a slightly younger traveler:
``Perhaps you are of an age to remember the old military term
`rolling barrage.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what was done here, rather than trying to poison the
entire island at once, they began at one end with successive
`barrages' of poison across the width of the island.''
</P>
<P>
   As he led a trio of tourists through the woods (``bush'' in New
Zealand-speak), he pointed out the occasional pieces of bright
yellow plastic tubing near the footpath. These were monitoring
stations and poison dispensaries in case a rodent should reappear,
most likely from a visiting boat. ``This being New Zealand,''
Tindal offered with a grin, ``naturally we use butter as a monitor.
It works quite well, the natural diet is low in fat, so butter is
attractive, and we can tell by the teeth marks whether it has been
visited by a mouse or a rat, or just nibbled at by one of the local
birds.''
</P>
<P>
   The forest floor on the island was the first clue that visitors
had entered a renewed primeval landscape. Along the path, for the
first time in New Zealand, the ground was sprinkled with the
just-ripened fruits of the trees high above. Elsewhere, either the
possums had gotten to the flowers first or the scavenging mice and
rats had gleaned every nutritious bit from the leaf litter.
</P>
<P>
   The second clue was the sheer abundance of birds. On South
Island, it is true, there were bell birds and tuis, the former an
inconspicuous green bird heard more than seen and the latter a
striking black bird the size of a robin and decorated with white
plumes on its neck like a tuxedo-wearing diner who has decided to
tuck a linen napkin into his shirt front. On the big island, a tui
was a bird to be remarked upon.
</P>
<P>
   On Ulva, the inquisitive tuis amounted almost to a nuisance,
they all wanted to approach the visitors and announce their
interest and defend their territory with a peculilar loud wingbeat
combined with melodious, but noisy, whistling. Bell birds were so
frequently encountered that one could count on seeing a bird, not
every one would be nestled in amid camouflaging green foliage.
</P>
<P>
   The largest land bird on Stewart Island and its smaller
neighbors, a green and rusty-red parrot, the Kaka, was nesting and
feeding young wherever we walked. They too announced their presence
and our arrival with a bellicose and unmusical screech. As we
entered their territory, one of the adults would fly close, clearly
interested in keeping an eye on the large and curious visitors. We
watched one fly up to us, land in a tree over our heads, and then
begin to preen itself. A visitor remarked to Tindal that the bird
seemed calm enough to stop calling, and start arranging its
feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably not,'' Tindal said quietly. ``That bird's actually
quite nervous. The preening is a displacement behavior. They are
just like people in that respect. Perhaps you have noticed that an
uneasy public speaker will run his fingers through his hair when
called upon, or touch up her face or eyebrow with a finger, before
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour, we had seen two of New Zealand's three native
parakeets (the third was not to be expected in any case), been
shown kiwi tracks in a muddy spot on the trail, and been visited by
a flock of birds so uncommon that lifelong residents of South
Island had never seen one. This last bird was the New Zealand brown
creeper, about the size of, and with many of the habits of, a North
American chickadee. They were two-tone brown, the body a sort of
milk chocolate, and the head a really striking chestnut, almost
auburn colored in the right light. They came in little waves of 10
and 20 birds, mewing to each other and passing over and beside us,
just parting to get around our human obstacle, as they foraged on
trees and ferns for the small insects that make up most of their
diet. Winter walkers in North America will remember chickadees
moving so sociably through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   One occasionally visits woodlands with naturalists who announce
things like: ``There are more than 20 kinds of ferns native here.''
Tindal knew the names of several dozen ferns and tree ferns, he
could offhandedly identify the mosses, lichens, and such obscure
families as the liverworts and spleenworts. ``Spleenworts,'' he
remarked casually, ``are rather interesting because they hybridize
so easily.'' He then pointed out several hybrids, a level of
knowlege not commonly encountered in the company of ``experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Too soon, it was time to get back to Post Office Bay and catch
the water taxi to Stewart Island. Tindal was asked whether he
thought someone else would take up his style of guiding someday
when he was retired again from this second career. He thought not.
``People specialize too soon now,'' he said. ``They just do not
have the same general knowlege as the older generation.'' He said
it uncritically; it was just another keen observation of the
natural world. ``By the way,'' he added, ``if you have time some
day, you might like to go along on one of our marine trips. We do
all the seabirds and penguins and stop and pull a few rocks and do
all the intertidal zone stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably, one imagined, including the hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tindal, should you want an answer for everything you ever wanted
to know about the ecology of New Zealand's finest temperate rain
forest, can be reached at Box 109, Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island (no
postal code needed). His telephone for both voice and facsimile is,

JILTED BY DEMOCRATS, AFTER ALL BOSTON HAS DONE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So Hollywood, not history, is expected to provide the backdrop
for the 2000 Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   That choice _ which should become official after contract
details are finalized _ says something about Al Gore. The reaction
here says something even more about Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The convention city was viewed locally as Gore's to choose. Last
week, the vice president called Mayor Menino to tell him the big
party would be in LA, not Beantown. The mayor was mad and let Gore
know it. Hell hath no fury like a Menino scorned.
</P>
<P>
   After all we've done, Menino fumed, what does Boston get? The
cold shoulder from Gore _ and charges of systemic discrimination in
the city's public housing from Andy Cuomo, as Menino likes to call
the secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   This city worked hard to pitch itself, and for once the public
and private sectors worked well as a team.
</P>
<P>
   But is that really so surprising, given the stakes? What city
could possibly be more willing than Boston to open its arms, its
wallets, and its prime vacation spots to the Oval Office?
</P>
<P>
   We have opened all of that and more to Bill Clinton. Throughout
his presidency, we have been his enablers _ a city filled with
Hillarys. When he lies, we forgive him. When others shun him, we
race to pose for photographs with him. Degraded, disgraced, it
doesn't matter. He scurries to the Kennedy Library, gives us that
misty squint, and we swoon. When he leaves, he takes our money with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential power is not just an aphrodisiac for sloe-eyed
White House interns or long-suffering White House wives. It seduces
the men and women of this city over and over again. Trying to
replicate a moment in history, still golden in our minds _ remember
Jack! _ we clutch at one candidate after another.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton Boston found a winner and a soul mate. In victory we
could celebrate the triumph of our great cause and the influence
and access that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Here, you pay to play, a game well understood and skillfully
executed by Clinton, Gore, and the Democratic National Committee.
This city cheerfully poured millions into the party coffers. Just
this month, at a post-impeachment event to ``honor'' Newton
resident and retiring DNC chairman Steven Grossman, die-hard donors
raised $700,000 for the Democratic party. About 80 people paid
$10,000 each for a lunch of sea bass, mixed green salad, and
marscapone pastry with strawberries. Another 500 guests settled for
a reception with chicken Caesar salad and assorted cookies for $250
per person.
</P>
<P>
   The president raised Menino's hopes when he supposedly mused
during their ride from the airport, ``It all began here . . .
Bunker Hill, the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a foolish older woman who refuses to see the truth in the
mirror, we believed the lines thrown our way. Boston was in the
running. Los Angeles was making mistakes. Clinton and Gore knew who
their friends were and where they lived. The vice president could
forget about the Big Dig, the new convention center still in the
fantasizing stage, the dearth of hotel rooms, and, most of all, the
big political prize in California _ 54 electoral votes. He would go
with history and grit, not Hollywood and glitz.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he didn't. Gore went with the convention city choice
backed by conventional wisdom. And that makes sense, because he is,
according to conventional wisdom, the Democratic Party nominee and,
quite possibly, the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is the man to beat, at least as long as the economy holds.
Like Walter Mondale, he is the establishment candidate. On paper he
has every every advantage, every benefit, and he is nailing down
every bit of money. But sometimes you can become captive to all the
strengths you bring to the table. Money can buy consultants and
advertising; it cannot buy hearts. And heart still counts for
something even in a political world that is mostly about handing
over bags of campaign contributions _ doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, like everywhere else, politics is now an affair of
the pocketbook. But here it also still remains an affair of the
heart. So the risk-averse Gore takes a risk in ignoring his New
England romance. We thought we had a relationship!
</P>
<P>
   There is still a long way to go before he wears the crown of
party nominee. Those he crosses may not be able to knock the crown
off, but they can surely dent it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Menino says he is not just disappointed that Gore
overlooked Boston for the 2000 Democratic National Convention. He
is also distressed that the vice president decided to pick a locale
associated with Monica Lewinsky _ the woman with whom Clinton
didn't have ``sexual relations,'' just sex _ and the Buddhist
temple, where Gore attended a fund-raiser he didn't know was a
fund-raiser.

NEW YORK HAS ROGER...AND SO WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm trying to picture the Rocket waltzing into Manhattan's
Lespinasse and paying $35 for a foie gras appetizer that's half the
size of a flattened Slim Jim at Bayou Mama's. Or having some
snot-nosed 28-year-old investment banker from Goldman Sachs tell
him at the communal table at Asia de Cuba that he made twice as
much money in his year-end bonus than Roger Clemens made all of
last year, and he never had to break a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The point here is that this city's angst, its hand-wringing, its
collective tantrum over the Clemens-Yankees marriage is much ado
about hardly anything at all. We have descended into despair, but
the real reason is simple: Boston has become a city of
Manhattanphiles, a people constantly wrestling with our own obvious
sense of inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   You'll recall what comedian Fred Allen once said. ``I just
returned from Boston. It's the only thing to do if you find
yourself up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny guy, that Mr. Allen, and a Bostonian to boot. Funniest
part is, he speaks to the fears of a city that regards itself as
the backward little cousin of our suave and sophisticated relative
down the street, New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bostonian-turned-New Yorker Bill Bratton explains it another
way. The former police commissioner of both cities, Bratton comes
along Monday to make a declaration anathema to most men: Size does
matter. In New York, you can influence national change, garner
national publicity, become a national figure. In Boston, he leaves
unstated, the people of southern New Hampshire might see you on the
local news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is more questioning of itself than New York,'' Bratton
added. ``Boston is much more of an introspective place. New York
never questions itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Question ourselves? Us? What was it that happened when the
Toronto Blue Jays made a trade with the New York Yankees last week
that had absolutely nothing to do with the Boston Red Sox? We just
about drowned in our own inferiority. The Yankees got our goat once
again, they did. They stole the Babe. Bucky Dent hit one into the
net. And now they've got our Roger, even if he wasn't really ours
anymore. What a pathetic little province we've become when the
Yankees can lord Roger Clemens. Right?
</P>
<P>
   But what's wrong with this picture? As sports sage Will
McDonough points out, the trade is meaningless to the Red Sox. The
Yankees will win the AL East with or without Roger Clemens. It's
the wild card we're playing for now. So this isn't about baseball,
but perceptions, our own fears. We are frightened that we've become
nothing more than a silly little outpost, a place where whispy
Brahmin men wear brown loafers with blue suits as they call
corporate headquarters in Manhattan twice a day to find out how
much more of the budget has been cut.
</P>
<P>
   Does Charlotte feel this way about Atlanta? San Francisco about
Los Angeles? Portland, Oregon, about Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   Take a hard look at Bosotn and New York. Both have
Italian-American mayors. Well, theirs speaks English as if it's his
native tongue. So forget that.
</P>
<P>
   And true, New York has Fortune 500 companies. It dominates the
worlds of art and music. It has eclipsed Boston as a publishing
center. Hell, The New York Times even bought this newspaper, and a
shopping conglomerate changed the name of Jordan Marsh to Macy's.
What's left for us?
</P>
<P>
   Well, try livability. As Boston financier and author John
Spooner points out, ``Your worst day in six months in Boston is
like every day in New York. You just have to laugh in terms of who
you have to duke. You can't walk a block without someone's hand
out.''
</P>
<P>
   People pay more to garage their car on the Upper East Side than
most Bostonians pay for rent. Commuters from Connecticut ride the
train 90 minutes each way and regard themselves as lucky. An
exquisitely mediocre steak at Smith &AMP; Wollensky's runs upwards of
$30 per cut.
</P>
<P>
   And try compassion. New York is the largest, loneliest city in
the country. They have Howard Stern. We're blessed, in comparison,
with the likes of Howie Carr. Yes, they have Dan Rather and Tom
Brokaw, but we have Chet and Nat, and for good and for bad, isn't
that really what it's all about?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they have Roger Clemens and we are left with our
nagging sense of inferiority, which is, in effect, our sense of
self. Boston is not New York. It doesn't want to be New York. But
it hesitates at being too different. Perhaps it's better that Roger
is there. There will come a day soon when he wishes he was back
here.

NEWEST TREASURER ACCUSTOMED TO BODY BLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While former Massachusetts state treasurer Joseph
Malone was all too willing to tout his days as a football player at
Harvard, few voters know that his successor was an Ivy League
football player, too.
</P>
<P>
   Only she played without a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon O'Brien, who took over as treasurer last month, played
on the Yale women's rugby team, and was captain of the women's
soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents never imposed gender roles on me or my siblings,''
O'Brien said. ``I never thought about not doing sports, though I
have to admit rugby was a challenge. As a halfback, I was chased a
lot. But I ran fast because I was very scared. I think I was the
only member of the team who didn't get bloodied.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien also appears unlikely to get bloodied in a scandal in
the treasurer's office revealed just last week: Investigators
arrested a 20-year employee and an associate for allegedly trying
to steal $6.5 million from the Unclaimed Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The new treasurer, in office a little more than a month, hopes
the purported embezzlement will help her persuade lawmakers to let
her go forward with one of her major goals: a full-blown audit of
the treasury and lottery.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, 39, is the first woman to be elected to statewide
office without being part of a ticket or a special election. The
distinction is reflected even in her nonpolitical life.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and her husband, former lawmaker Emmet Hayes, receive
cards addressed to ``Treasurer and Mrs. O'Brien.'' Recently, Hayes
was shopping in a local grocery store when another shopper pointed
him out as he piled food into his cart. ``Oh, look,'' she said to
her companion. ``It's Shannon O'Brien's husband. I guess he does
all the home work now.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Boston University Law School, O'Brien was part of
an increasing chorus of women's voices on Beacon Hill when she
served in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a member of former Senate president William M. Bulger's
leadership team, she was tagged with the ``old boy'' label in her
run for treasurer. After all, O'Brien comes from a long line of
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawmaker, O'Brien lived in Easthampton in Hampden County
and represented the western part of the state. When she married in
1996, she moved to Whitman with her husband and stepdaughter, Jill,
adding the South Shore to her political base.
</P>
<P>
   She has barely taken office, but already some are saying that in
four or eight years, O'Brien could be a strong gubernatorial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could be a consensus candidate,'' said political
consultant Michael Goldman. ``Just look at who was with her on
stage the night she won the treasurer's race: Ted Kennedy was
there. Joe Moakley, too. For Democrats, it was the safest place to
be that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Goldman, that kind of talk is particularly
flattering. Five years ago, when he was the key strategist behind
former senator William Keating's ill-fated attempt to dethrone
Bulger, O'Brien criticized Goldman as a ``schmuck.'' Today, Goldman
shrugs off the insult as part of the normal rough and tumble of
state politics. ``Voting for O'Brien was the easiest vote I cast
this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of five children, O'Brien attended
Williston-Northampton high school, a private day school in
Easthampton, before heading to Yale University like her father
before her.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, of Irish and Polish heritage, seemed destined for a
career in politics. With her father, Edward O'Brien, on the
Governor's Council, her grandfather an aide to the late Governor
Paul Dever, and her great-grandfather Michael a state
representative, the O'Brien family has been called ``the Kennedys
of Western Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The family name is so well known that it's almost a brand name
in the western part of the state,'' said high school classmate
Paula Monopoli, a law professor in California. ``But she never
coasted on her name. She literally knocked on doors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen her intimidated by anything,'' marveled
Wendy Hill, who met O'Brien when the two were captains of opposing
soccer teams. ``She was an incredibly versatile player. And she's
like that off the field, too.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien spent eight years on Beacon Hill, serving three terms in
the House and one in the Senate from 1987 to 1994. Unlike some
other women before her, such as former Ways and Means chairwoman
Patricia McGovern and Senator Linda J. Melconian, O'Brien never
headed a major legislative committee. Appointed chairwoman of the
Senate's obscure steering and policy committee, which determines
when bills are taken up, she also served on the banking, labor,
insurance, and human services committees.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien sponsored several bills that became law, including one
that made child abuse a felony rather than a misdemeanor, a
whistleblower law that protects state employees who report fraud
and abuse in state government, and a measure that decreased
employee health care costs for cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   She supports abortion rights and opposes the death penalty _ the
opposite of her husband, whom she met when both were state
representatives. ``She used to call me a Neanderthal,'' Hayes
joked.
</P>
<P>
   After losing his reelection bid in 1990, Hayes became a
lobbyist. His clients include construction, environmental, and
transportation concerns, incuding the Boston Water and Sewer
Department. Since O'Brien's election as treasurer, Hayes has told
his clients he will not represent anyone with business before the
treasurer's office or lottery. ``We've gone further than the law
specifies because we don't even want the perception of any
conflict,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien first ran for treasurer in 1994, when Democratic leaders
recruited her to take on Malone, the popular Republican incumbent.
She was outspent nearly 4 to 1, and Malone walked to victory,
winning 63 percent of the vote. Still, O'Brien gained valuable
statewide contacts and name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   She worked as a health care executive for the next four years;
by night, she gathered political IOUs by running US Senator John F.
Kerry's record-breaking signature drive in his 1996 reelection
battle against then-Governor William F. Weld.
</P>
<P>
   Before she announced her second campaign for the treasurer's
office in 1997, O'Brien made a critical move: She convinced other
Democrats eyeing the race that she was the best candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearing the primary field was a really tough challenge, but
she did it,'' said former lieutenant governor Evelyn Murphy. ``It
let her focus all her energies on the final election. By being
willing to run once and lose, she was able to position herself as
the incumbent in the primary the second time around.''
</P>
<P>
   In the general election, O'Brien beat GOP businessman Robert
Maginn with 62 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   As treasurer, she plans to redirect the state's investment
strategy away from international equities and help establish
priorities for the state's long-term capital needs _ one of which
she believes should be upgrading public school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her reputation as a classic Beacon Hill insider, she
claims she will ``change the culture'' at the lottery, long viewed
as a hideaway for political hacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it, I have my work cut out for me,''
O'Brien said. And the job doesn't come with a helmet.

 By SALLY JACOBS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Estrich writes to understand her life.
</P>
<P>
   After she was raped at 21, she wrote a book about the legal
system. When she lost 50 pounds, she wrote a diet book. Now, the
smartest girl in class, the first female president of the Harvard
Law Review, the first woman to run a presidential campaign (for
Michael Dukakis) and the youngest woman to get tenure at Harvard
Law School, is writing about why women do not have more power.
</P>
<P>
   She is writing about herself. Estrich teaches law and has a
syndicated newspaper column. But she isalso a 46-year-old mother of
two. She is not a first anymore. She is just like countless other
women who edged out of the fast lane and into the car-pool line.
She makes peanut butter sandwiches and parses ce-real box text. She
counts calories.
</P>
<P>
   And on a recent afternoon she is arching her size-6 body proudly
in front of a hotel mirror, running her hands along her skin-tight
white jersey top and tiny pleated black skirt for a newspaper
photographer. She is doing this because she is on tour for the
paperback version of her diet book, ``Making the Case for Yourself:
A Diet Book for Smart Women.'' But what she is really doing, it
seems, is making a case for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am grappling with right now is seeing the men of my
generation assuming power in America and the women of my
generation, the women I went to law school with, the women I did
politics with, not. In a word,'' declares Estrich, in an interview
at a Boston hotel. ``You can't say any of the women are wrong. On
the contrary. I'm the one who told many of the women who worked for
me, `Whatever you do, don't miss children. Don't wait.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Estrich complaining about her lot. The woman who once
brandished political polls with pride now eagerly displays
photographs of her children, ages 5 and 8, and her husband, Marty
Kaplan, a communications professor. She works in her Los Angeles
home three days a week and teaches law at the University of
Southern California the other two days. At night, after the
children have gone to bed, she flips on some music and logs on to
the computer she used to write two books in the past year and a
half, the diet book and one about politics and criminal justice
called ``Getting Away With Murder,'' published last spring. They're
fine books, in their way. But they do not put her on the evening
news, where she used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her if she wants to work on a political campaign again, and
Estrich erupts in the hoarse boomlet of laughter that is her
trademark. She does not, not now, not even if it's a woman
candidate. What she wants is for women to have more flexibility.
She wants, in short, to alter the course of Western civilization so
that women can have productive, even first-string careers, and have
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all the justifications for why it is that the men who
used to work for me now run the world and I don't,'' declares
Estrich, throwing her hands in the air. ``Look, I'm happy. I'd
rather get up at 2 in the morning with a baby crying than (for) a
candidate in need of my assistance any day of the week. But we've
got to figure out the chapters of our lives. How are we gonna
change a system that gives us these either-or choices? How are we
going to get power on our terms?''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Estrich, a Lynn native, doesn't still
hang around some pretty powerful people. Just last week she spent
an hour talking to President Clinton in his office. (``I just
called up and said I'm going to be in town and can I come by?'')
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is a good friend. (``We used
to get excluded from all the same meetings together.'') And there
was that dance not long ago ``at Ben and Sally's'' with some of the
old political gang. She is talking, of course, about those famous
partygivers, former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee and his
wife, writer Sally Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it mean that she does not travel, although she doesn't
do much. Last week she was completing a rare five-city promotional
tour for her diet book, which has already gone back to press two
times.
</P>
<P>
   Although Estrich has the look of a large person squeezed into a
thin person's body, and concedes that staying slender requires
constant vigilance, she looks trim and fit. Sitting in a plush
armchair at the Westin Copley Hotel in Boston, she talks
enthusiastically about a range of topics including her fertility
doctors, her three-day-a-week exercise program, and, of course,
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Monica Lewinsky had gone on my diet, maybe she wouldn't
have been on her knees so much,'' hoots Estrich.
</P>
<P>
   So, what is it with the diet book? Why is Susan Estrich, pioneer
thinker and firebrand feminist, pushing a list of ways to stay out
of the kitchen? (Do your nails. Seduce someone. Have sex repeatedly
and frequently, says the list distributed by her publisher.) Why is
Estrich, a frequent TV news commentator, talking about her thighs
and preening for a publicity photos in black mesh hose and a brief
black cocktail dress?
</P>
<P>
   Because for most of her adult life she could not. Because when
she went to the closet to get something to wear to the Democratic
National Convention in 1988, even her largest size 14s with elastic
waists did not fit. Because when several years and two babies later
she looked in the mirror and saw 170 pounds packed on her
five-foot-six-inch frame. Because she did not want to die of a
heart attack at 54 as her father did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it was vanity,'' says Estrich. ``But part of it was I
had these babies. Nothing, nothing grabbed my heart and held it so
strongly as looking at my babies. I needed to live.''
</P>
<P>
   And so at last, Estrich lost weight, about 50 pounds in all. And
then she wrote a book about it. Published last year, the book
offers no dieting miracle, but basically advises women to throw
away the excuses along with the Danish and commit themselves to the
job at hand: losing weight. And if feminists complain that Estrich
has sold out, that she's buying into male cliches of womanhood, let
`em.
</P>
<P>
   ``I notice the people who say that kind of thing are usually
naturally thin,'' Estrich notes archly. ``Dieting for me is an act
of feminism. It is an act of taking responsibility and taking
charge of my life. I was fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason she was fat, was because she was working so
hard. During the Dukakis campaign, Estrich traveled for months at a
time and routinely worked 100-hour weeks. Every night, she and
whoever else was still in the office near midnight would call out
for Chinese food so that, ``by the time of the convention I had
gained 25 pounds and we were ahead at that time,'' Estrich moans.
``Imagine what falling 20 points in the polls can do to your
weight. When the going gets tough, the tough start eating.''
</P>
<P>
   It is more than a decade since Estrich was plucked from her
professor's post at Harvard to become manager of Dukakis's troubled
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Estrich says she's smarter now than she was then, but ask what
is her newfound wisdom about Dukakis and a very long, very
uncharacteristic silence follows. She gazes out the window, eyes
her white-tipped fingernails. Although Estrich says she and Dukakis
remain friends and see one another occasionally, the failed
campaign is difficult for her to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was who I was. We all did our best. It was an awkward and
difficult situation,'' she says finally. ``I didn't have
(Dukakis's) confidence in the way I needed to have it. In politics,
you fight with somebody for a long time and you win some and you
lose some and by the end it's time for someone else to come in and
do battle.''
</P>
<P>
   If Estrich remains loyal to her former employer, she is also
loyal to another fellow Democrat who has come upon hard times.
Recalling that Bill Clinton used to call her nearly every night of
the 1988 campaign to get the poll numbers and offer his help,
Estrich said she supports the president because, ``He's my friend.
He's also the leader of my team, which stands for choice for women
and the things I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrich doesn't just mean the choice to have an abortion. She
means the choice of having a real career as well as a family, and
the freedom to elect to do one without sacrificing the other. To
achieve that, Estrich argues that the rules of work need to be
restructured to provide greater flexibility, so that women have
more opportunities in their 40s, and that women in their 20s need
not be afraid of their own ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to live our lives like men. But that isn't the
only alternative,'' said Estrich. ``There is a third way and we've
got to chart it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Estrich, however, now is not the time. The phone in
Estrich's hotel room is ringing furiously. A black sedan is purring
outside the hotel, waiting to take her to the airport. And Susan
Estrich pulls on her sunglasses and starts to head back home toward
the job at which she will always be first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not such an egomaniac to think that no one can do what I
can do on a political campaign,'' calls Estrich, hurrying down the
corridor. ``But I'm 100 percent certain that when it comes to my
children, no one can do what I do. I have an irreplaceable role and
it's at home.''

REVISITING THE LIFE OF LORD BERNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
FIRST CHILDHOOD 
A DISTANT PROSPECT 
By Lord Berners 
Turtle Point Press/Helen Marx Books; 243 pp. and 186 pp.; $14.95
and $12.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America has not forgotten Lord Berners, because he was never
known here.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Gerald Tyrwhitt, Lord Berners (1883-1950), was
prized as a composer, novelist, wit, and incomparable host. On more
than one occasion, Stravinsky proclaimed him the finest composer in
England. He composed scores for Diaghilev's Russian ballet and for
the young company that grew into the Royal Ballet; his
collaborators included Gertrude Stein, Satcheverell Sitwell, and
Frederick Ashton, and his friends included most of the notable
literary, musical and political figures of his time and place. He
provides occasion for whimsical or outrageous anecdotes in numerous
memoirs. Nancy Mitford, who might have invented him, didn't need to
when she put him into her novel ``The Pursuit of Love'' as Lord
Merlin, whose whippets wear diamond chokers and whose parti-dyed
pigeons spread across the sky like ``a cloud of confetti.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicians have always been interested in Berners, who was dubbed
the ``English Satie,'' though Satie dismissed Berners as ``a
professional amateur.'' There are several CDs devoted to Berners's
work (a delightful one features Dame Felicity Lott and Graham
Johnson in the complete songs). Last year, belatedly, a first
biography appeared in England, Mark Amory's ``Lord Berners: The
Last Eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   Berners was certainly not the last eccentric, but he certainly
belongs in the great tradition. The composer Constant Lambert
recalled how Berners could achieve solitude even on a crowded
railway train. ``He would put on dark glasses and slyly beckon in
the passers-by. Those isolated figures who stood the risk of
entering the carriage became so perturbed by his habit of reading a
newspaper upside-down and taking his temperature every few minutes
that they invariably changed carriages at the next station.'' One
of his novels, ``The Girls of Radcliff Hall,'' privately printed,
transparently disguised his circle of homosexual friends as
students in a girls' school whose headmistress, Miss Carfax, is
clearly Berners himself. Cecil Beaton was so horrified that he
destroyed every copy he could find. Berners is supposed to have
presented the volume to Queen Mary, who complimented him on his
accurate picture of school life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Eccentric'' has awakened interest in Berners's
literary work. Turtle Point Press has reissued the two slender
volumes of autobiography that Berners wrote, ``First Childhood'' in
1934 and ``A Distant Prospect,'' a sequel published in 1945, and in
May will bring out an omnibus volume of six of his Firbankian
novels, (but not including ``The Girls of Radcliff Hall'').
</P>
<P>
   The autobiographies carry Berners up to his departure from Eton
at 16. In some respects the story they tell is all too familiar _ a
childhood cosseted but emotionally isolated, the roughing up in a
boy's school, romantic friendships, the awakening of aesthetic
impulses, and the conflict of those impulses with a materialistic
family and society. What makes the books memorable is the clarity
of Berners's unforgiving memory, his sense of character and eye for
detail, his judgment, his wit, his voice, his slant. The familiar
story is economically told from a point of view that still sounds
fresh and modern more than 60 years later _ and it is bracingly
free of self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his portrait of his grandmother, the ``violently
low-church'' Lady Bourchier, who ``went so far to have herself
described in `Who's Who' as `distinctly low,' an epithet which must
have caused some surprise to those who were unaware of its
sectarian significance.'' Berners recalls the ordeal of twice-daily
family prayers, for which the domestic staff were summoned. ``They
were obliged to quit whatever work they were engaged upon, dress
themselves up in tidy clothes and troop into the dining-room in
order to sit upon hard benches for 20 minutes or more, listening to
my grandmother declaiming scriptural exhortations in a voice that
seemed to hold out very little hope of salvation for the lower
classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Musical readers will enjoy Berners's accounts of his youthful
infatuations with Chopin (``the subtle changes of harmony that were
like the iridescent hues on the plumage of the Himalayan
pheasant'') and with Wagner, who obsessed him even though Berners
had been told that Wagner couldn't write a decent fugue. Music puts
Berners at odds with his fox-hunting family; paradoxically, his
ability to play musical comedy tunes earns him the favor of
sporting boys at school.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting that while Berners is never sexually
explicit, the books carry a considerable erotic charge for that
very reason; the romantic yearnings are without defined objects,
but they are also never unclear. Berners's autobiographies are
amusing period pieces, like his music, and like his music, they
have lasting value. What makes these two books unnerving is
Berners's sensibility, which is not escapist at all; he creates
entertaining artifice by facing down uncomfortable facts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not love at first sight . . . even though we were
introduced on Valentine's Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There it sat, a 1999 Jeep Wrangler Sport _ the selfsame car I'd
begged my son not to buy two years ago. This was fate at its most
perverse.
</P>
<P>
   Get behind the wheel? Me? Drive one? I don't even like to follow
these things on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2 a.m., the end of a long shift, and driving did beat the
option of putting on running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Would that I could say it was an enjoyable trip.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't particularly smooth with the clutch _ this Jeep had a
close-ratio five-speed manual tied to the 4.0-liter in-line six
engine that seemed to want you to move briskly through the gears.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the well-grooved ruts on the northbound Central Artery
brought back fantasies to trying to ride the famed Gilley's
mechanical bull. We bucked and yawed and threatened to make some
unplanned lane changes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the curving road by the local cemetery (an appropriate
location) was negotiated with care. I wasn't tipsy, but I was
paranoid that my ride might be.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning the Wrangler was sitting in the driveway,
waiting _ I'd like to say it had a defiant look in its plastic
foglights.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. G tried to play peacemaker and offered a Significant Other
Opinion: ``At least it's new.''
</P>
<P>
   That was true.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orange Line is only a mile-and-a-half away. Even though
I hadn't fallen for this first cousin of the Jeeps I once drove in
Uncle Sam's National Guard, I voted with my feet. Off to the T it
was. I didn't want to take this set of wheels _ out to play in
Boston's Friday traffic _ even if the tires were aptly named
Goodyear ``Wranglers.''
</P>
<P>
   How could it be that bad, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, simply climbing in one of these vehicles requires
being limber (Significant Other Opinion No. 2: ``Don't wear tight
slacks.''). If you have trouble getting into the front seat, don't
even think about getting in back. I managed only because the
passenger's seat slides up to the dashboard to create a tad of room
to execute this maneuver, which has a degree of difficulty of 8.2
on a scale of 10. In summertime, with the softtop down, it would be
just as easy to climb in over the side.
</P>
<P>
   Best to fold the back seat down and use it for storage. The
tailgate (with full-sized spare attached) swings open to provide
space for a row of grocery bags _ everyone has to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Once aboard, there's no room for the driver, either. Even with
the seat all the way back, the driving position is nuclear-sub
tight (``You can't even see the pedals,'' said
son-who-would-have-bought-one) with no place at all to rest your
arms.
</P>
<P>
   More annoyances? An irritating little orange arrow regularly
pops up on the dashboard display urging the driver to shift to a
higher gear even though the tachometer indicates a bare 2,000 rpms.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it's almost too easy bashing this beastie in print,
but two night's of sleep and the knowledge that 12 miles doesn't an
auto review make mandated a new beginning, starting with the
premise that this isn't your father's Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   We started with the owner's manual, knowing there's always a
nugget of knowledge to be shared. We learned:
</P>
<P>
   1. Be wary of abrupt maneuvers that could lead to rollovers
(wow!);
</P>
<P>
   2. If you ever want to use the soft top (not supplied with our
test car), find someone who has one of these vehicles and have them
show you the routine.
</P>
<P>
   So we hit the roads, hitting the highways, sitting in shopping
mall traffic and just driving both city and country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Significant Other Opinion No. 3: ``It's got a great heater.''
</P>
<P>
   True.
</P>
<P>
   A little Sunday snow on a dirt road wasn't a full
four-wheel-drive test, but the Wrangler loved it.
</P>
<P>
   But how much of that driving can one find in this area?
</P>
<P>
   On paved roads the steering and gearbox weren't so bad once we'd
adapted to them. Road noise _ long a bugaboo of Jeeps _ was
tolerable, too. This version is clearly more docile on macadam than
its predecessors, but it still yearns to go off roading.
</P>
<P>
   So, who does buy a Wrangler? I always figured the drivers were
irresponsible kids (``Couldn't you say `young and carefree'?'' asks
my aforementioned offspring.).
</P>
<P>
   A purchaser of this Sport model _ the midrange between the SE
and Sahara _ would have to go past the base price of $17,810.
Add-ons (air conditioning, ABS, hard top, fog lamps and the like)
brought the sticker to $21,560.
</P>
<P>
   And they'd have to buy some gas, too. Our test tank of gas
produced 17.2 mpg (right in the predicted range of 16-19).
</P>
<P>
   But Jeeps have been selling for years, and they've got a
personality you at least have to grudgingly respect.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if this isn't my father's Jeep, I'm still glad it isn't
my son's, either.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll share this secret: I'd love to try driving in
summertime on beach sand and in salt air instead of on road sand
with salt everywhere.

NET-SAVVY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE SHELVING LIBRARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To prepare a lesson for his students, Harvard Law School
professor Jonathan Zittrain recently turned to an Internet site on
Tunisia that looked reliable. There, he read about the North
African nation's exemplary treatment of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, the information was posted by supporters of
Tunisia's autocratic ruler. They gave the site a deliberately
misleading name, www.amnesty-tunisia.org, even though Amnesty
International has lambasted the country's human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the Internet rapidly has become the second
university library. Moreover, as a steadily escalating percentage
of students surf the Web rather than search the stacks, many
academics believe it could supplant the traditional library within
a decade or two as the primary destination for academic information
and research.
</P>
<P>
   But for at least the near term, even staunch supporters of the
Internet see major problems: Too much material in cyberspace is
incorrect, biased, or problematic in other ways. And while some
sites are easy to identify as the work of amateurs or advocates,
the veracity of many others that seem authentic or professional can
be difficult to assess.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites also appear and disappear at an extraordinary rate,
making it nearly impossible to know whether information cited in a
master's thesis today, for example, will be available to future
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already a totally changed world . . . and it's still
changing,'' said James Stellar, dean of the college of arts and
sciences at Northeastern University. ``We're really still in the
infancy of this thing . . . but we're certainly headed in the
direction where the Internet, whatever its problems or limitations,
will be dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   Stellar, like most college officials and professors nationwide,
said the lack of editing or peer review of World Wide Web sites _
processes that books and magazine articles typically undergo before
publication _ doesn't prevent him from encouraging students to use
the Internet. The academics say many traditional books and
periodicals also contain errors or are biased, and the job of
teachers is to help students assess and gather good information
regardless of its source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, actually, it's a wonderful way of teaching kids what
we've been trying to teach them for years: critical thinking,''
said Zittrain, who is executive director of the Berkman Center for
Internet and Society at Harvard Law School. ``Certainly, there are
issues to resolve, but I think we have to look at this new world
more as an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   This historic shift within higher education is unusual, and
perhaps unique, in at least one essential way: It is being driven
primarily by students rather than by professional educators. That's
because a growing number of students are so adept at using the Web
_ frequently more than their teachers _ that they regard it as a
routine place to answer their questions.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with nearly two-dozen students at several campuses
around Boston underlined that reality. All of them said they use
the Internet for 15 percent to more than half of their research _
the younger the student, the higher the percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier than going to the library, it's cheaper than
buying books . . . and there's no risk that it's going to be
checked out,'' said Rachael Goren, 19, a sophomore at Brandeis who
said she does about one-third of her research on the Web.``And it's
timing, too; if I want to find something out at 3 in the morning, I
can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A study released last month by the Higher Education Research
Institute at the University of California in Los Angeles showed
that 83 percent of college freshmen use the Internet as a research
and educational tool. It was the first national poll of its kind,
and the results surprised even its authors.
</P>
<P>
   They nevertheless agreed, as did other educators, that the
number seems in keeping with the steep trajectory Internet use has
achieved in the past few years. By the time today's middle-school
students reach college, most of those interviewed predicted, they
will be prone to do the overwhelming majority of their work on
computers rather than in the stacks of libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a stunning rate, I think, more and more students are
finding the Net to be a very convenient resource that they know how
to use, that they feel comfortable using, that they can use in
their dorm rooms or anywhere else,'' said Linda Sax, the director
of the UCLA institute and a proponent of Internet use. ``It's not
always at the college's encouragement, of course, and I think most
schools and libraries are scrambling to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   That they are. Although no colleges or universities appear to
have devised campuswide standards or guidelines, professors and
departments are discussing the issue and formulating ideas on how
to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   As one of his first acts when he assumed his job last year, for
instance, Stellar established a task force at Northeastern to study
how professors and students should use the Internet and to evaluate
the hazards of this resource.
</P>
<P>
   Similar committees are being set up across the country. Even at
schools where they're not, debate about the Internet's benefits and
pitfalls has become commonplace at faculty meetings and,
especially, at libraries where staff members are routinely being
retrained to become Net specialists.
</P>
<P>
   It appears a majority of professors nationwide have decided to
allow at least limited Internet sourcing for research papers and
other projects, and some encourage very wide use.
</P>
<P>
   Many still prohibit the practice, however, because they fear
students will not use other important resources, such as books and
journals, and will be unable to adequately judge the value or
validity of too much of the Web content they find.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, which was last year, we didn't do things
quite in the ways we do now,'' said Stanley Dodson, a zoology
professor at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Dodson said he encourages his students to use the Net to
acquaint themselves with a subject, find general information, and
get leads on pertinent journals and books. But he doesn't allow
citations to Web sites in their papers.
</P>
<P>
   Professors at other colleges have adopted similarly cautious
approaches, even as they seem a bit awed by the technological
advances they are watching and trying to keep up with.
</P>
<P>
   Several common threads connect the teachers who have banned
Internet sourcing: They still permit Web use in some circumstances,
they predict the Internet will become the dominant
educational-research tool despite their qualms, and they
acknowledge that one major reason for their reluctance to allow
more use of the Internet probably is their sense that students know
more about it than they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to encourage students not to fall into a trap of
the Internet making things much easier for them and not allowing
them to learn all the research skills that they should,'' said
James Mandrell, a professor of comparative literature and film at
Brandeis. Smiling, he added, ``But I've got a murky suspicion that
my own limitations dictate some of my reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Runde, director of the International Center for Computer
Enhanced Learning at Wake Forest University in North Carolina,
predicts that most of the problems of the Internet will be remedied
over time. He said guidelines for evaluating sites will be
established, peer review and editing for on-line journals will be
instituted, lists of acceptable and unacceptable sites will be
compiled, and individual schools and professors will learn how to
assess various sites' worth just as they do with books today.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Runde said, many college classes
eventually will have Web sites or Internet components of their own.
Constructing and maintaining those presumably will build skills for
teachers and students that will help them evaluate cyberspace
information.
</P>
<P>
   The professors, students, librarians, and college officials who
discussed the Internet issue last week agree that their foremost
concerns relate to assessing Web sites and learning how to use them
well. But they list other potential problems. Those range from
serious copyright questions, such as who owns the completed
research or works in progress on the Internet, to deep worries
about the Internet making it too easy for students to plagiarize or
to buy completed research papers from the scores of companies that
provide the service.
</P>
<P>
   Their reservations pale, however, when compared with the glowing
future the academics foresee for computerized research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there will be scams and there will be victims,
and there will be crimes and punishments we haven't even conceived
of yet,'' said Richard Larson, director of the Center for Advanced
Educational Services at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But he predicted that these ``growing pains'' of the Internet would
abate, and the US education system would become more mature as a
result.

AMATEURS UNEARTH RARE FIND IN ARGENTINA 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIMOTHY LELAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEY OF THE MOON, Argentina _ They didn't look like much at
first sight. A few small pieces of purplish rock sticking up in the
lunar-like sand of this desolate desert landscape in northwestern
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer inspection confirmed their true origin. These
weren't rocks. They were the remains of an animal that had died on
that spot over 230 million years ago. They were the fossilized
bones of a dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of our search party had walked right past the site
moments before and hadn't noticed them. Now I was sitting on an
outcrop of rock in the sweltering heat, drinking water from my
canteen. My gaze fell to the right of my knapsack, lying at my
feet.
</P>
<P>
   And there they were _ fragments of mineralized bone glinting in
the sand, each with the magenta sheen that is the unmistakable
signature of fossils in the Valley of the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   A friend and I had come to this harshly barren but beautiful
part of South America to search for the fossils of prehistoric
animals as part of an Earthwatch expedition _ a travel experience
unlike any other in a lifetime of trips and travels.
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered in Watertown, Earthwatch is a nonprofit
organization that sponsors scientific field research throughout the
world, enabling people from all walks of life to join its research
projects for two-or three-week periods as volunteers, writing off
the expense as a tax-free charitable contribution. Over the past 28
years, Earthwatch has supported more than 2,000 programs in some
120 countries, putting to good and productive work more than 50,000
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be scientifically minded to be an Earthwatch
volunteer. The only requirements are a healthy curiosity about our
planet and a desire for adventure. If you fit that profile,
Earthwatch trips are made to order.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is deciding which of the many possible expeditions
to take _ whether to help track snow leopards in India . . .
excavate ancient temple gardens in Pompeii . . . monitor the
effects of water pollution on wildlife in Russia . . . document the
erosion of glacial sediment in Iceland . . . study black rhinos in
Zimbabwe . . . or search for dinosaur fossils in the desert
badlands of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   My old friend, Jim Dean of South Berwick, Maine, voted for the
latter. We would go to the Valley of the Moon and look for fossils.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, my wife had shown no interest in this trip,
despite our many past travels together. The two of us have bicycled
in Spain, white-water rafted in Costa Rica, snorkeled in Bora
Bora,and skied in France, but the advance billing on this one left
her cold.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the thought of living for two weeks in a pup
tent, sleeping on the ground. ``Don't even think about it,'' she
declared, declining my invitation.
</P>
<P>
   So I turned to Dean, a former teacher (whose wife was similarly
averse to the idea of going). More than 40 years earlier, as
teenagers, he and I had traveled extensively together during school
vacations. Now _ both 61, both recently retired _ we teamed up
again and headed south.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is a big country, offering many climates and
conditions within its borders. I had never associated that nation
with deserts, however _ not until we reached the Earthwatch camp,
located near the Chilean border at the foot of the Andes.
</P>
<P>
   This was Ischigualasto Valley, otherwise known as ``The Valley
of the Moon,'' a perfect name for the barren and forbidding
terrain. It looked like something out of an Apollo astronaut's
photo album.
</P>
<P>
   We had driven the 250 miles there in a four-wheel Earthwatch
vehicle from the little town of San Juan, crossing the largest sand
dune field on the continent along the way. Known as the Bermajo
desert, it seemed empty of all life except scrub brush and
occasional hawks that circled high overhead in the thin blue sky.
The temperature climbed into the 90s and, strangely, we were alone
on the narrow road. There were no other vehicles. No towns. No gas
stations. No water. ``If the van breaks down on this road it is
very bad,'' said our driver, Nole, in Spanish. ``Es una problema.''
</P>
<P>
   Five hours later, the macadam turned into a two-track dirt road
as we approached our campsite in the valley itself, a 5-mile-wide
by 40-mile-long depression in the Earth's surface strewn with
towering mesas and clumps of ironstone, criss-crossed by deep
crevices and ravines, rimmed with high red cliffs and distant blue
mountains. This was to be our home and workplace for the next two
weeks and, as we set up our tent on the bank of a dry riverbed
later that afternoon, civilization seemed a very long way away.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Earthwatch expeditions involve 10 or 12 volunteers,
of all ages and backgrounds. Our group included a social
psychologist from California, a computer engineer from Wisconsin, a
college professor from Australia, a teenager on leave from his high
school in Colorado and a retired Army colonel from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   None of us had any training in paleontology. One of the most
appealing aspects of an Earthwatch expedition, however, is the
opportunity it provides participants to learn about new fields of
study, taught firsthand by experts. And that first evening, sitting
around the open campfire, William D. Sill, a Harvard-educated
paleontologist and leader of our Earthwatch project, gave the group
a brilliant shorthand seminar on his research into the origin of
dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley of the Moon, he explained, is the only place in the
world that reveals a complete sequence of fossil-bearing
sedimentation covering virtually all of the Triassic Period _ that
37-million-year span of time between 245 million and 208 million
years ago when dinosaurs came to dominate life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the area was an alluvial plain, covered with lush
ferns and rich grasses, watered by monsoon rains and rivers that
constantly overflowed their banks. The raging waters swept across
the land, depositing new layers of sedimentation and, in the
process, drowning many of the pre-historic animals that lived
there, entombing them in the ooze and mud.

   TAKE-BOS  
 VALLEY OF THE MOON, Argentina: ... and mud.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buried in that fashion, pressed by the weight of succeeding
layers of sedimentation, the carcasses of the animals slowly
fossilized, as mineral-laden water percolated through their bones,
leaving perfect duplicates of the original skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   Today, millions of years later, wind and rain are reversing the
process, gradually eroding away the sedimentary rock of
Ischigualasto Valley and revealing, once again, the fossilized
bones of those very same animals.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the fossils are mere fragments of bone that have been
moved from their original resting place. But sometimes they are in
their original shape _ ``articulated,'' as the paleontologists put
it, still connected in the form of a skeletal carcass. These are
the fossil finds that make a paleontologist's heart beat faster on
first sight. ``What kind of animal is this?'' they wonder. ``Have I
found something new?''
</P>
<P>
   There were many different species of animals living on the
planet in the early years of the Triassic Period, and most of them
weren't true dinosaurs. They were either reptilian cousins of
dinosaurs or they were what are referred to as ``proto-mammals.''
(My initial find of fossil fragments, which were too small to
identify, may have been one of these earlier specimens.)
</P>
<P>
   But something mysterious happened to life on Earth near the end
of the Triassic period, Sills explained. Dinosaurs beat out all the
other animals in the evolutionary pecking order and emerged as the
unchallenged dominant force on the planet. For the next 150 million
years or so they reigned supreme.
</P>
<P>
   Many paleontologists are seeking to learn why dinosaurs
subsequently became extinct, but Sills and his team of Argentinean
paleontologists are trying to figure out why they became ascendant
in the first place. To that end, they are searching for the remains
of the world's first dinosaurs, and they are convinced they will
find them in the fossil-bearing sedimentation of the Valley of the
Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where the eyes (and feet) of Earthwatch volunteers such
as ourselves come in. For two weeks _ carrying compasses to orient
ourselves, water to drink in the 100-degree heat, knives to probe
sites in the sand _ we hiked through the lunar landscape of this
extraordinary region, searching for fossils.
</P>
<P>
   An eerie solitude envelopes the place _ and all who enter it.
The rugged terrain seemed to swallow us as we spread out to search
the desert floor in all directions. Within minutes we were each
alone in a vast expanse that seemed to hold the untouched mysteries
of millions of years. The silence in the Valley of the Moon is
almost palpable in the mid-day heat. There is no sight nor sound of
life.
</P>
<P>
   But you scarcely notice the heat. The lure of fossil hunting
takes over and becomes an obsession. Around every arroyo, behind
every claystone knoll, on top of every rust-colored mesa, one may
find an intact fossil protruding from the sand, the skeletal
outline of an animal that lived and died there more than 200
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One walks with head down, glancing from side to side, looking
for the characteristic shapes and colors that are the fossilized
fingerprint of a prehistoric animal. Within a few days, Earthwatch
volunteers become expert at discerning the differences between
routine concretions of rock and the giveaway purple of ancient
bones.
</P>
<P>
   Often you come across little shards of these fossils, washed
down from the side of cliffs to the floor of the desert below. Some
may be recognizable as part of a vertebrae or a rib _ intriguing
but not necessarily valuable from a paleontological point of view
because they can't be identified. The real paydirt of fossil
hunting is when one finds the remains of a complete animal or a
skull.
</P>
<P>
   And on the last day of our expedition, Jim and I hit paydirt. We
found both.
</P>
<P>
   We had hiked across the entire valley to have a closer look at
the distant ironstone cliffs that turned brilliant red every
evening opposite our campsite in the setting sun. It was not an
area in which we had expected to find fossils, but on the way back,
tired and hot, we stumbled on two articulated skeletons, clearly
visible in the desert sand.
</P>
<P>
   One of them we recognized as that of a rhynchosaur, herbivorous
beasts that were very numerous at that time, referred to by Sills
as ``Triassic pigs.'' But the other looked different. Slowly,
carefully, so as not to disturb the site, we got down on our hands
and knees and brought our faces close to the ground for a closer
inspection. For several seconds we studied the patchwork of bones
that lay before us. And then we both recognized the same thing at
the same time: four large, sharp teeth pointing directly at us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cripes,'' Jim exclaimed, ``we're looking at a dinosaur's
head!''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the head was only part of what excited the
paleontologists who came out to view our find.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a proterochampsa!'' Sills exclaimed, after studying
the fossilized remains for several moments. ``We've only found four
others.'' (Proterochampsas, it turns out, were large and ferocious
proto-crocodiles that lived at the time of the dinosaurs.)
</P>
<P>
   But there was something else. We hadn't found one animal _ we'd
found two.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them was eating the other,'' Sills surmised. ``There
were two prehistoric creatures here, locked in mortal combat when
they died. This is a wonderful sighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Life on this Earthwatch expedition is not for the fainthearted.
Conditions can, on occasion, be trying. Temperatures range from 105
degrees by day to 45 at night. Wind storms buffet the campsite,
whipping up the sand and coating everything with dust. There is no
electricity in the camp. There is no running water. We washed from
plastic dish tubs with water doled sparingly from trucked-in
waterbarrels. There are no toilets. In fact, there were no
latrines. When nature called, we grabbed a trowel and a roll of
toilet paper and headed into the desert to do our thing and hide
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone seeking a trip that mixes a unique learning
experience with the thrill of exploration in a beautiful and
unusual part of the world, this Earthwatch trip is hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trip began, the president of Earthwatch sent the
volunteers a letter of welcome, the kind of form letter that one
normally ignores as promotional hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are one step away from an experience that may change your
life,'' he wrote portenteously.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what?
</P>
<P>
   He was right.

   International travel is not without its dangers.
</P>
<P>
   A global travel warning was issued this week by the State
Department immediately after the killing of three Kurds who stormed
the Israeli consulate in Berlin. The warning urged Americans to
take special security precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Even without this incident, travelers should be aware that
danger lurks in many parts of the world. With Americans exploring
more and more remote parts of the world, the wise traveler should
check out information on unknown destinations for safety's sake.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department regularly issues travel advisories on just
about every land in the world. To obtain an advisory call the State
Department (Citizens Emergency Center, Bureau of Consular Affairs,
2201 C St. NW, Room 4811, US Department of State, Washington, DC
20520) at 202-647-5225 or on the Internet at
http://travel.state.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware, though, many have critized these advisories for either
not providing enough information on the dangers of a destination or
for exaggerating the risks.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk of international travel is your health. The federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's International
Travelers Hotline provides information on health risks and medical
needs for places around the world. Call 404-639-2572 or on the

   Name the bird
</P>
<P>
   How would you like to name a new bird? It's just one of the
events on the Audubon Society's calendar this spring. March and
April bring one of the world's most spectacular wildlife pageants
to a short stretch of Nebraska's Platte River. About 500,000
sandhill cranes (almost 80 percent of the world's population),
along with millions of other migratory birds will be flocking to
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Platte will also be able to experience the
society's 29th annual Rivers and Wildlife Celebration in Kearney,
Neb., March 11-14. And on March 5 in Fort Worth, Tex., the society
will hold an auction to name a bird so rare it doesn't have a name.
The bird, an antshrike, was recorded for the first time in a remote
corner of the Amazon basin. The lucky bidder will have the honor of
creating the scientific name of this living creature.

OODLES OF NOODLES AT A MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've lost your noodle, perhaps you can find it at our
Museum of the Month: the four-year-old Ramen Museum in Yokohama.
</P>
<P>
   The museum attracts even more visitors than Japan's National Art
Museum, according to the JAL Newsletter. On display are dozens of
types of ramen _ a tasty noodle _ from around the world, including
an instant version with Arnold Schwarzenegger on the cup.
Three-hundred Japanese noodle bowls are also exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   The lower floor reproduces a Japanese street at dusk, with 88
miniature buildings. And there are nine on-site ramen restaurants
that draw so many diners that the lines stretch for blocks. At the
gift shop, you can buy ramen jewelry, key chains, and even
``emergency ramen,'' lasting up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can't make it to Yokohama, don't despair: The man
behind it all, Yoji Iwaoka, hopes to bring a similar museum to Las
Vegas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of ramen: The Japanese really do love the stuff. They
consume 5.3 billion servings a year, in about 600 varieties. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: What country has a map on its flag? (Answer at end
of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: In Spain, Donald Duck's nephews Huey, Louie, and Dewey
are known as Jorgito, Juanito, and Jaimito. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Big Mac beat: McDonald's has opened its first kosher restaurant
outside of Israel _ in Buenos Aires. It's also opened its first
restaurant in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, Burger King has opened a
``fly-through'' restaurant at a helicopter landing pad in London. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The long and short of it: The longest nonstop commercial flight in
the world is reported to be the Capetown, South Africa-Miami run on
South African Airways. It spans 7,650 miles in 14 hours and 30
minutes. The shortest commercial airline flight in the world is
said to be the Westray-Papa run in Scotland's Orkney Islands on
Loganair. It takes two minutes and there's no meal service. What is
believed to be the shortest commercial flight in the United States
is a mere 20 miles, from Appleton to Oshkosh, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cake contest: At the Shilla Hotel in Seoul, you can have your cake
and possibly a hotel stay. The hotel's master pastry chef has
created a millennium cake, shaped like a half-globe. The elaborate
cake costs about $25 US a slice, but the ninth customer gets a
complimentary cake and the 99th gets a hotel accommodation coupon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Thai taboo: Do not pat children on the head in Thailand. Such
action is said to interfere with the upward flow of the spirits. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Puff, puff: The Chinese smoke 150 billion cigarettes a year _ 30
percent of the world's total. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Brrrrr: Nearly 99 percent of all the ice on Earth is found on or
near Antarctica and Greenland. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mailbag: Readers have added to our recent list of names of
Massachusetts' communities that are the same as men's first names.
Allen Barron of Easton, cites a friend named Easton. Dorothy Ekberg
of Cromwell, Conn., mentions Milton, which happens to be her
husband's name. And Ray and Doreen Gondola of Tewksbury contribute
a very common man's name: Marblehead! &QL;

SET YOUR SIGHTS ON FAR HORIZONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asia, Arabia, Australia, New Zealand, China, India, Africa,
Europe, and Antarctica are places to discover by ship. And, if you
can't decide which ports of call to make, choose the world. A world
cruise is not only possible, but becoming affordable.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean may be the most popular cruising waters in the
world, but more and more travelers are discovering they can cruise
just about anywhere as easily as booking a Caribbean cruise.
</P>
<P>
   In summer 1999, a small armarda of ships _ many that cruise the
Caribbean in winter _ sail the waters of Europe. Cruise companies
are finding passengers are looking for new destinations, and the
popularity of Europe is evident by the number of ships that are
being home ported along the continent from spring through fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last year both Princess and Royal Caribbean scheduled the maiden
voyages of their newest and largest vessels in European waters. And
this year are adding more ships to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Just as European cruising is becoming more popular, cruise lines
are also extending their horizons to ports throughout the world.
While some lines such as Seabourn, Crystal, and Silversea regularly
roam the world, and others such as Cunard and Holland America have
annual world cruises, other familiar names like Princess, Royal
Caribbean and Norwegian are placing ships in distant ports.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is twofold, there are more new ships and cruise lines
are looking for new ports of call for them, and there are growing
numbers of cruise veterans who are eager to explore new regions of
the world on lines they enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of the international cruises:
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean International's Legend of the Seas will set sail
in November on a program called Royal Journeys, a series of 10
globe-trotting cruise itineraries. The 160-day program will visit
four continents, reaching 41 ports in 19 countries. Passengers will
be offered the opportunity to disembark the ship in a designated
port of call, travel to an alternative destination, then rejoin the
vessel in another port of call. Pre- and post-cruise packages will
also be available at land-based resort accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line now has its Norwegian Star stationed in
Australia for year round cruises. The ship has been renamed the
Norwegian Capricorn and is sailing on seven- and 14-day cruises.
The ship, the former Royal Viking Sea, is ideally suited for
Pacific waters as unlike newer ships which have shallow drafts for
Caribbean cruises, the Capricorn was designed for world cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Cruises has expanded its African and Holy Land cruises.
The line claims it is the first and only cruise line to offer an
in-depth exploration West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Cunard, which has been cruising the world for years, is
featuring Awesome Arabia this year. Featured will be calls to the
port of Dubai, which has emerged as a tourist destination for
travelers seeking a taste of Arabia while still enjoying all the
comforts and facilities of a world-class destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passengers on Cunard ships enjoy the exploration of exotic
destinations and the opportunity to witness firsthand the
combination of historic cultures and breathtaking surroundings.
That's why an Arabian program is such an asset to our cruise
offerings,'' said Peter Bates, executive vice president of Cunard.
Cunard ships heading for Dubai are the Queen Elizabeth 2, Royal
Viking Sun and Sea Goddess II.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific, Clipper Cruise Line is adding a fourth vessel to
its small ship fleet. The Clipper Odyssey will sail on three and
four day cruises from Bali, and in December sail for Australia's
Great Barrier Reef and New Zealand for a series of 10-day cruises.
</P>
<P>
   In the Caribbean many lines offer a private isle experience for
their passengers. Now Radisson Seven Seas Cruises is doing the same
in French Polynesia. Guests on the Paul Gauguin, which sails weekly
out of Tahiti, will now have a private motu of their own for a
secluded beach day of water sports, relaxation, and gourmet dining.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly three of the more luxurious ways to explore the world
by ship are offered on Silversea, Seabourn and Crystal cruise
lines. These lines are noted for their luxurious surroundings, fine
food, and world-class itineraries that range from Europe to the Far
East.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you want the world, a new cruise line, World Cruises,
begins sailing that call on all the continents including
Antarctica. What makes this line all the more interesting is its
pricing. Cruises will range from about $10,000 to around $15,000 a
person _ most world cruises have prices beginning above the $15,000
mark, and don't include all the continents. World Cruises is part
of the Toronto-based Marine Expeditions, which has been offering
cruises to Antarctica and other exotic destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica may seem an unusual destination, but its a regular
port of call for Orient Lines' Marco Polo. While every cruise line
has a special program planned for the new millennium, the Marco
Polo will be again heading there Dec. 23 for a New Year's Eve gala
on the southernmost continent. ``Most people who visit Antarctica
come back feeling totally exhilarated and renewed,'' said Deborah
Natansohn, president of the line. ``We couldn't think of a better
place to start a new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   For new ports of call far beyond the Caribbean, check out the
itineraries of these lines: American Canadian Caribbean Line,
Classical Cruises, Costa, Crystal, Cunard, EuroCruises, Holland
America, Ivarian Lines (a freighter with superb passenger
facilities), Marine Expeditions, Norwegian Cruise Line,
OdessAmerica Cruise, Orient Lines, Princess cruises, Quark
Expeditions, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, Regal Cruises, Royal
Caribbean, Royal Olympic, Seabourn, Silversea, Special Expeditions,
Star Clippers, Temptress Adventure Cruises, Windjammer Barefoot
Cruises, or Windstar Cruises.

</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Royal Music Festivals are back again aboard the Radisson Diamond
in June and August. Three 11-night cruises will feature some of
Europe's finest musicians, virtuosos and singers. The performances
will be held in settings such as the Hermitage Theater in St.
Petersburg, th Hall of State inside the Stockhyolm Royual Palace,
the Ajuda Palace in Lisbon, and France's Palais du Grand Large.
Each of the twin-hulled Radisson Diamond voyages will feature up to
four countries. For those making early bookings, savings of up to
$900 a person plus a $500 per stateroom bonus amenities package are
available. The bonus can be applied to shore excursions, spa,
boutique or the onboard Golf Academy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Big band cruises &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four of the country's most popular big bands will bring the
nostalgic sounds of swing to sea aboard Norwegian Cruise Line's
popular Big Band theme cruise aboard the legendary Norway Nov.
27-Dec. 4. The lineup includes the Artie Shaw Orchestra, Guy
Lombardo's Royal Canadians, Tex Beneke and His Orchestra and the
Terry Myers Orchestra. Special events on the sailing include
autograph signings, contests, a free-of-charge jukebox with old
favorites, period movies, and on days at sea, almost continuous Big
Band performances from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m.

Alaska for Jews
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the 6 million Jews who live in North America, about 38
percent are either orthodox or conservative Jews who observe strict
dietary laws and who do not travel on Saturdays. To take an Alaskan
cruise has meant traveling on a Saturday and, probably having to
bring along one's own kosher food. A cruise, Alaska Through Jewish
Eyes answers these and other travel problems. A kosher Alaska
adventure is set for June 1-15 aboard the Universe Explorer. Lotus
Tours and Rabbi Marvin Tokayer of New York, who have operated
kosher tours and cruises since 1982 say the cruise will feature
freshly prepared kosher foods, talks on Alaska as well as on Jewish
history. For information, call Lotus Tours at 800-267-5415.

   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ First, let's get the age thing out of the
way. Trot Nixon is not 30 years old. He has not been in the Red Sox
organization for 15 years. It just seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   All of the 1999 Red Sox were due in camp Tuesday (Feb. 23) and,
for the first time in his professional baseball career, Trot Nixon
has a job. Red Sox manager Jimy Williams is counting on Nixon to be
his starting right fielder Opening Day in Kansas City April 5.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is still only 24 years old (he'll be 25 April 11), which
seems impossible for Sox fans who remember hearing about him back
in 1993 when Daddy Butch Hobson was Boston's manager.
</P>
<P>
   How long has Trot been around? He was drafted by Lou Gorman.
This is the Red Sox equivalent of being one of Bill Parcells's
secretaries with the Patriots. Boston's Machiavellian general
manager Dan Duquette has purged the organization of almost all
Gorman nominees (John Valentin and Scott Hatteberg are the only
other Gorman draft picks still playing for the Sox).
</P>
<P>
   A multisport high school star in Wilmington, N.C., Nixon had a
scholarship to play quarterback at North Carolina State, but the
Sox made him the No. 7 pick in the draft and lured him to baseball
with an $890,000 signing bonus. They also set aside No. 7 _ the
number worn by Mickey Mantle, the favorite player of Trot's
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   There was small talk about Hall of Fame after Trot was drafted.
The Sox shipped him to Fenway for a round of public batting
practice, and Trot wowed the crowd with homers into the bullpen and
shots off the wall. Then he disappeared into the quagmire of the
minor leagues, and he's been almost invisible since that initial
showcase at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Lynchburg. Sarasota. Trenton. Pawtucket. Winter ball. Counting
time in the Florida Instructional League, Nixon has been playing
minor league ball for six seasons. Along the way he suffered a
chipped bone in his lower back and the discouragement of hitting
only .244 at Triple A in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon got it together last summer, hitting .310 with 23 homers
and stealing 26 bases for Pawtucket. He got called up to the bigs
Sept. 6 and hit .259 in 13 games. He started in right field in the
third game of the playoffs against the Indians and hit a single off
Charles Nagy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Darren Bragg gone and the Sox desperate for
outfielders with any power, Nixon's the one to play right field
unless he flops in Florida. This is his time. The job is his to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it that way,'' he said. ``I look at it that I
have to make this team. I need to go out and play well in spring
training. It's been a long time. I've had a lot of ups and downs,
but I've learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said the low point for him came in 1997 when he struggled
at Pawtucket. But he never thought about giving up and never
regretted choosing baseball over football. His family and friends
understood that the road to the big leaques is littered with
landmines (Nixon's wife, Kathryn Fisher, is a NASCAR reporter for
ESPN2). Some Sox fans have been less patient, wondering, ``Whatever
happened to Trot Nixon?''
</P>
<P>
   Casual fans of big league baseball have no idea how difficult it
is to make it to the majors. For every big leaguer you see riding
the bench with the Pirates, there are 15 kids who signed
professional contracts, kissed their families goodbye, and wasted
their youth kicking around the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not take long for certain players, but it is true _
there's so many baseball players in the minor leagues,'' said
Nixon. ``I don't think people quite understand it at all, just how
many players there are. Even in one organization, there's a lot of
players.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter he worked out in Bradenton with Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great four weeks at the `military academy' in
Bradenton with Nomar,'' he said. ``I worked on speed, agility,
lateral movement. I did a lot of weightlifting and spent 2-3 hours
a day in the cages and taking ground balls and fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's father, William, is a renowned kidney specialist in
Wilmington. He was an active participant in Trot's original
contract discussions and has been labeled a ``stage dad'' by some
folks in Sox camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that says that just doesn't know squat,'' said Trot.
``I push myself. You work out with me and you realize that. My
father pushed me when I needed to be pushed and that was in high
school and a lot of other fathers have done that same thing. It's
not like I answer to him and he pushes me. I push myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he gets to play where Dwight Evans, Tony Conigliaro, Ken
Harrelson and so many other sluggers patrolled. It has been 10
years since any Sox outfielder hit 20 homers (Evans in '89).
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've got a lot to prove to the fans and the
ownership,'' Nixon acknowledged. ``But I can't really give you
numbers. I've never even played half a major league season. But I'm
going to play hard, and hopefully I'l have a chance to put up
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can hit the ball, give 'em some speed. I don't have
the strongest arm in the world, but it's somewhat accurate. And I
play hard.''
</P>

THE FUTURE IS ALL MINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGTSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the good news arrived from the US Patent Office, I let out
a whoop of joy that I have no doubt will be heard until the end of
time. I had been awarded US Patent 89764392307921. I now own rights
to all knowledge of the future.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't seeking protection of any new invention. I had not come
up with a novel contraption for mopping Schnaunzer poop off your
shoes. I hadn't devised a unique applicator for zit cream. Nothing
as concrete as that. My goal was to guarantee that I alone would
benefit professionally, personally, and financially from my own
special intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   I do not intend to reveal here the unique concept I've created
and implemented in my prognostications that lifts my efforts above
those of everyone else. It's my secret, after all. Suffice it to
say that my special knowledge, acquired after years of dedication
and expense, met the Patent Office's criteria and merited broad
protection. Indeed, in the split second it took to thump the
bureaucratic stamp of approval on my application, the Patent Office
revolutionized the world of prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Now anyone who wishes to venture a prediction on anything: the
weather, the horses, the stock market, the likelihood of another
sexual dalliance by President Clinton will have to pay me first _
or risk serious legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the patent office delivered its wise decision, I did
what I do best: I peered into my future. And there I saw a crisp
image of mountains and mountains of dollars, bills of the highest
denomination piled as high as Mountr McKinley and there I was
jumping and sliding and frolicking all over the place. It was all
mine _ all mine!
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone object to my good fortune, allow me to point out
that what I requested and what the patent office endorsed is now
pretty much standard operating procedure. As Seth Shulman describes
in his telling, just-released book, ``Owning the Future: Inside the
Battles to Control the New Assets _ Genes, Software, Databases, and
Technological Know-how _ That Make Up the Lifeblood of the New
Economy,'' the patent office routinely grants exclusive rights to
broad notions.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier days, the patent office granted protection only to
tangible innovations. But now it deeds blanket rights to ideas,
concepts, and techniques that cut across wide swaths of the
high-tech, medical, and agricultural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Shulman explains, doctors now own medical
procedures, preventing other physicians from freely using them.
Software companies now gain monopolies on the building blocks for
writing new computer programs, freezing out competition and
possible innovation. Biotech researchers are even buying up the
rights to our own genes.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has become so outrageous, Shulman reports, that
lawyers are now arguing that professional athletes should be able
to patent or copyright their unique moves on the basketball court
or football field.
</P>
<P>
   Now as I use my exclusive rights to peer into the future, I can
see the outcome. Medicine will revert to the stone age as rights to
treatments will send costs soaring and leave us all dying without
care. Food production will dry up and we'll all starve as
agribusiness uses its patents to squeeze farmers. And we'll no
longer have rights to our own bodies as companies will have
patented every biological and genetic inch of us.
</P>
<P>
   But am I worried? Nah, I've got my patent. The future belongs to
me.

EXIT RUBIN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The end of the impeachment trial brought relief to more than
just the Clinton household. It was also a signal to Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin that he finally is free to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting shake-up could foreshadow the economic policy
agenda of the Democratic Party for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The current expansion owes much to Rubin. A former cochairman of
the investment banking powerhouse Goldman Sachs, Rubin joined the
Clinton campaign in 1992 after Mario Cuomo folded his candidacy.
When Clinton won the presidency against all odds, Rubin headed up
the newly created National Economic Council. From its
behind-the-scenes cockpit he decorously shouldered aside the
Council of Economic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate Majority Leader Lloyd Bentsen was Treasury
secretary in those days. He and Rubin persuaded Clinton that a
``downpayment on the deficit'' was needed. The resulting package of
tax increases and spending cuts touched off a six-year boom.
</P>
<P>
   The man who did the footwork on the downpayment, surveying
market participants, economists on its appropriate size, was a
38-year-old Lawrence Summers, a former Harvard University economist
then completing a tour as chief economist for the World Bank. When
he joined the Treasury in 1993 instead of heading the Council of
Economic Advisers, it was widely interpreted as a snub.
</P>
<P>
   When Bentsen retired after two years on the job, Rubin
effortlessly moved up to the Treasury. Only a few were not
surprised when he chose Summers as his deputy. It was a lofty place
for a young man, but then Summers was an unusual young man.
</P>
<P>
   The nephew of two of the century's premier economists (his
economist father is Paul Samuelson's brother, his economist mother
is sister to Kenneth Arrow) Summers had firmly established himself
as one of the top economists of his own generation. He had served
as campaign adviser to both Michael Dukakis and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A good division of labor ensued. Rubin talked markets, Summers
talked economic and regulatory policies, and both men talked to
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and, often enough, to
Clinton himself. Their balancing act served through many crises,
starting with the Mexican peso.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Committee to Save the World,'' as Time magazine recently
described the Greenspan-Rubin-Summers collaboration, is a little
breathless, but it conveys the spirit of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Summers is clearly the adminstration's choice to succeed Rubin.
And who is say that Rubin, 60, might not succeed Greenspan in due
course? A couple of years in New York would give the investment
banker time to re-examine the life he left behind when he suddenly
began commuting to Washington six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But would the GOP-led Senate confirm a Summers appointment to
the top Treasury job? It's a good question. That so young a man
should hold the job all but unprecedented, though Alexander
Hamilton was 34 when he took the job in 1789. The only other
trained economist to serve as secretary was George Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Summers has been noticeably prickly toward those
slow to grasp his points. But testifying on Capitol Hill has added
polish. He's patched up his relations with Vice President Gore, for
whom he might serve as a valuable link to Clinton's sober economic
policies. And his friendship with Republican eminence grise Martin
Feldstein should serve him well (Summers worked for Feldstein at
the Council of Economic Advisers in the first Reagan term.)
</P>
<P>
   Not so incidentally, so did Lawrence Lindsey, a former governor
of the Federal Reserve Board who over the weekend flew down to
Austin, Texas, to sign on as chief economic adviser to Texas
Governor George W. Bush. Like Summers, Lindsey was born in 1954;
like Summers, he was among Feldstein's star pupils. Indeed, Lindsey
even brought his former prof along (Feldstein is pushing individual
retirement accounts) to meet the potential presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   To have power is a wonderful thing. To have power when young is
a great advantage.

 &HT;    CHANGING ATTITUDES ON RACE HOLD HOPE FOR BETTER RELATIONS
 &HT;    950&AMP;add. With BLACK-DATA. For release Sunday, Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``The problem of the twentieth century is the
problem of the color line,'' educator W.E.B. DuBois wrote in 1903.
Will that still be true in 21st-century America, when whites are no
longer a majority and Hispanics replace blacks as the country's
largest ethnic minority?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in the attitudes of the ``Millennium
Generation,'' Americans under the age of 18. This demographic tidal
wave has already eclipsed the baby boomers in numbers, and there is
no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is going to redefine American society in ways
much more profound than the boomers,'' said Ronald Franklin, a
Detroit advertising executive who is analyzing the generation for
Connecticut-based Yankelovich Partners Inc., one of the foremost
trackers of changing American lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs that race relations are changing. White
kids want to ``be like Mike.'' ``Urban attitude'' colors the music
and fashion favored by ``Millenniums'' of all races. Colin Powell
and Oprah Winfrey are consistently among the most admired
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millenniums'' are the most racially and ethnically diverse
generation in the country's history, with a proportion of nonwhites
60 percent larger than that of the two preceding generations. Polls
show that its members are more relaxed in their attitudes about
race and more optimistic about the future of race relations than
previous generations were.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is re-creating America's racial identity every
single day,'' said Farai Chideya, an ABC News correspondent and
author of ``The Color of Our Future,'' a new book about individuals
coping with the country's changing racial terrain. ``And if anybody
is going to erase the color line, it's going to be them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such optimism is tempered by government data suggesting that
even after a century of civil rights progress, deep problems
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Black families still earn 40 percent less than comparable white
families and have 90 percent less family wealth. Less than half own
their home, compared to 70 percent of whites. Blacks are half as
likely to attend college as whites. A majority of black births
occur out of wedlock. Black men are incarcerated at a rate of
nearly 8 times that of whites. And blacks' life span averages six
years less than whites'.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it costs to be black in America in 1999,'' said
Joe Feagin, a sociologist at the University of Florida. ``That is
what 400 years of oppression means today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the ``Millennium Generation'' leading the way, it's
far from clear that future Americans will live as ``neighborly
citizens of a common country,'' as Frederick Douglass, the runaway
slave turned abolitionist leader, predicted just five months after
the President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their wealth, whites enjoy disproportionate political
power that gives them a great deal of control over the pace of
social change. For example, while blacks make up 12 percent of the
population, they hold only about 8 percent of the seats in the U.S.
House and none in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the talk about demographics really obscures a more basic
point _ that for all the gains of minorities, there is very little
sharing of power by the white establishment,'' said Chideya.
``Already, we see a backlash against racial diversity in an attempt
to keep America fixed in time.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the battle is affirmative action, the concept
that the victims of discrimination should be given special
consideration in employment and college admissions. Political
conservatives counter with a call for a ``color-blind society''
that grants racial preferences to no one.
</P>
<P>
   This struggle will affect race relations well into the next
century, complicated by the growing number of Americans who have no
personal knowledge of state-imposed segregation of blacks through
most of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``As new generations of whites are born and raised, the memories
of Jim Crow will fade, along with the guilt,'' said Richard
Kahlenberg, a researcher at the Center for National Policy in
Washington and author of ``The Remedy: Class, Race and Affirmative
Action.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite its experience with integrated schools and
neighborhoods, the ``Millennium Generation'' is not some racial
utopia. In a ``Class of 2000'' poll of 11th graders by CBS News,
one-fourth admitted having made racist remarks, a the group was
less likely to approve of interracial dating than older Americans
are of interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   According to experts, ``ground zero'' for the future of race
relations will come after the year 2050, when the youngest of the
``Millennium Generation'' will be 70 years old. Not long after,
race in America will have been turned upside down, with whites in
the minority and blacks, Hispanics and Asians constituting a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Paula D. McClain, a civil rights expert at the University of
Virginia, sees two prospects: one of increased racial tensions, the
other of unprecedented racial understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whites who have never experienced minority status will battle
to maintain their privileged position in the face of changing
demographics,'' McClain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' she added, ``it is possible that the
reversal in status for many white Americans will eventually bring
about improved race relations as they begin to understand the
situation in which black Americans have found themselves for the
last 400 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Feagin is in the pessimistic camp.
</P>
<P>
   The ``most likely choice'' for whites in the second half of the
next century is ``building more private schools, more guarded,
gated communities, moving to 'white states' in the Rocky Mountains
and Midwest, buying guns and more police _ basically the old South
African apartheid system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the color line begins to evolve into a color matrix, whites
may also try to co-opt some lighter-skinned, more assimilated
Asians and Hispanics into 'honorary white' status,'' another tactic
used in South Africa, Feagin said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Mary Thornberry, an expert on racial politics at Davidson
University, is suspicious of any predictions about the second half
of the next century. But she believes two trends will signal
whether ``race is disappearing as a central factor in identity'':
the level of support for public education and the frequency of
interracial dating and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A number of experts, noting the increase in interracial
marriages over the past decade, have suggested that this trend will
ultimately break down America's color line.
</P>
<P>
   But Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich, executive director of the Black
Leadership Forum, an umbrella group for dozens of civil rights
groups, notes that ``out-marriages'' occur more often among
Hispanics, who can be of any race, than African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Only 8 percent of black men and 4 percent of black women marry
outside their race, while 31.6 percent of native-born Hispanic men
and 31.4 percent of Hispanic women do, according to an analysis of
Census Bureau data by the Russell Sage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the process of racial convergence to beige ``a myth,''
Scruggs-Leftwich said that ``it will be a very long time before the
overwhelming number of African Americans will appear to be anything
other than African Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We must go on with the business of racial
reconciliation, we must dump the useless concept of
color-blindness, and we must value each other for exactly who we
are, not who we are fading into.''

BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS SHARE GILLETTE'S GOOD FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Alfred Zeien leaves Gillette Co. in April, he will not go
empty-handed. The departing chief executive, who announced his
retirement last week, will walk away with Gillette stock and
options worth roughly $160 million, based on last year's proxy
statement. But part of the Zeien legacy will be the millions he
made for other people, including Gillette employees.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as anyone can remember, most Gillette employees have
put their spare cash into Gillette stock, aided by generous
matching contributions from the company. The practice violates the
basic rule of investing _ namely that you don't put all your eggs
in one basket _ but hardly anyone at Gillette is complaining. Who
complains, after all, when he achieves the American dream and
becomes a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   According to John O'Connell, a benefits executive at Gillette,
roughly 300 of the 7,500 participants in the company's savings plan
have accounts worth more than $1 million. The list doesn't include
retirees or people who have bought stock through other vehicles.
Even more impressive than the number of millionaires is who they
are. About 20 percent of the group, or 60 people, are Gillette
employees who have never earned more than $50,000 a year. ``Some of
them are blue-collar people who work in the factory,'' said
O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   How did they amass such big nest eggs? Simple: They socked away
a fair amount of money in a stock that has performed spectacularly.
Under the rules of the savings plan, employees can put away up to
15 percent of their pay per year. In fact, the average contribution
is about 10 percent of pay, far above the US corporate average.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette matches 50 percent of the employee contribution up to
10 percent, or a maximum of 5 percent of pay. The Gillette
contribution is always made in company stock, and a big chunk of
the employee money goes toward the stock as well, even though
workers can invest in other things. About two-thirds of the plan's
$2.1 billion in assets is parked in company stock.
</P>
<P>
   And what a stock it has been. Since 1981 the stock has climbed
60-fold. Between the end of 1987 and the end of 1997 its value
increased 17 times, an annual rate of appreciation of 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a different story. Fears that the hard times in
Asia and Russia would slash Gillette sales _ a good assumption as
it turned out _ sent the stock on a steep slide. Between July and
September, the stock lost 40 percent of its value. ``People didn't
run away,'' said O'Connell, who saw very little change in employee
investment patterns. So far that faith has been rewarded. Gillette
stock, which dipped as low as 36, has recovered to 54, still below
its high of 62.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to employee investing habits, the company takes a
hands-off attitude. Gillette offers investment education and plenty
of opportunities to diversify. But if employees choose to stick
with the stock, so be it. In fact, Gillette executives, including
Zeien, have long endorsed the idea that employee stock ownership is
a good way to build loyalty to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is proud of the fact that you can go up to anyone in the
company and that person can tell you what the stock price is,''
said Danielle Frizzi, a Gillette spokesman. There are kiosks and
message boards sprinkled throughout Gillette facilities, said
Frizzi, where employees can check to see how the stock is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Investment experts get nervous when they hear about so much
money concentrated in one stock, even a great stock like Gillette.
``If you've got more than 25 percent of your money in one asset
that can be dangerous,'' said Dee Lee, a financial planner with
Harvard Financial Educators.
</P>
<P>
   Lee points out that even great companies sometimes have a way of
falling off a cliff. Remember Digital Equipment Corp.? Its stock
price fell from 200 to 20 over a period of years, a process that
wiped out billions, a chunk of which belonged to employees.
Employees may think they know their companies well, say planners,
but turning points are notoriously difficult to spot, even for
insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette employees are not the only ones in love with their own
stock. At some of America's best companies _ Coca-Cola, General
Electric, Pfizer _ the bulk of the assets in the 401(k) plan are in
the firm's own stock. ``Can you blame these people?'' asks Lee.
``They've done so well. How do you tell them to diversify? They've
got an ingrained loyalty to the company.''
</P>
<P>
   So far that loyalty has been well-placed. Under both Zeien and
his predecessor, Colman Mockler, Gillette employees have had their
eggs in the right basket. Come April, those eggs become the
responsibility of Michael Hawley, the new chief executive. Can he
keep them from cracking? Stay tuned.

AN OSCAR FOR A PARI OF AVID INNOVATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAC DANIEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEWKSBURY, Mass. _ Tom Ohanian and Michael Phillips are days
away from receiving an Oscar for technological achievement, one of
the pinnacles of their careers. Yet here they sit, in a dark room
whirring with computers, trying to make sense of Scene 43 in an
indie film called ``Dweller in the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   It's basic horror-film stuff, and Phillips and Ohanian have
taken on the job of making several messy shots meld together in one
coherent, hopefully terrifying, scene. But as it stands now,
according to both men, it ain't melding.
</P>
<P>
   Ohanian's skill as a film editor will help make order of things,
and Phillips will use his talents as a director to fine-tune. But
the real help will come from Avid Film Composer, a souped-up
$80,000 bundle of hardware and software that both men helped
develop for their employer, Avid Technology of Tewksbury. Film
Composer is a digital film-editing system that starting in 1992
quickly began replacing the bulky flatbed, the traditional
film-editing machine used over the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's this computer and what it's done for film and television
that helped garner Avid, Ohanian, and Phillips their Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the company won a scientific and engineering award from
the Academy for Film Composer, a bronze tablet that denotes any
achievement that ``had a definite influence on the advancement of
the film industry,'' according to the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, while dozens of other technological innovators
receive certificates and similar tablets, Avid will be the only
recipient of the coveted gold statue, a hard-won and carefully
orchestrated Hollywood nod acknowledging that Avid's technology has
arrived and that editing film will never be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Ohanian and Phillips, two film guys with no
computer background, got together with Avid's engineers to help
create Film Composer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we were driving oxcarts for years and this guy comes
by and says, `Here's a Jaguar. Do you think you'd like it?' '' said
Joe Hutshing, an Oscar-winning film editor who last edited ``Meet
Joe Black'' and who is currently editing ``Being John Malkovich''
on an Avid system.
</P>
<P>
   The system allows film to be digitized, edited, and manipulated
on a high-end computer system at 24 frames per second, then
transferred back to film without a breakdown in quality or timing.
</P>
<P>
   Although many other companies make similar systems, Avid's
success in filmmaking and television is in its numbers. An
estimated 85 percent of the prime-time television shows are edited
on Avids, 70 of the 114 films at this year's Sundance Film Festival
were edited on Avids, and 10 films nominated for Oscars this year
were edited using an Avid product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very similar to what happened when somebody invented the
word processor,'' Hutshings added. ``You might have had a great IBM
Selectric, but after the word processor came along, who cares.''
</P>
<P>
   On a flatbed, when a director or film editor wanted a scene to
dissolve into black, the editor would first have to lug that reel
of film to the machine. Such reels, which hold about 10 minutes of
film, weigh about 4 pounds each. If it wasn't the right reel, there
was more lugging to do, and more linear-based searching, a task
akin to finding a particular scene using the forward and reverse
buttons on a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   After finding the shot he wanted to dissolve, the editor would
take a china marker and run it across 24 frames of film. That, for
all intents and purposes, was the dissolve. A film would then be
sent out to be processed. Until it came back, editors and directors
never really knew what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watched it, you would see this line go through and
you'd say, OK, I think I know what that dissolve would look like,''
said Phillips. ``Slow motion or skipping motions were all leaps of
faith. If you talk to editors, you hear all these horror stories
about how many times they had to go back to the (film) labs because
it just wasn't what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   On a digital editing system, those 10-minute reels fit on
portable hard drives. If you want a dissolve, you see it right
there and then. Slower? No problem. Click a button. Done.
</P>
<P>
   If someone muffs the pronunciation of a word, an editor can
search the entire movie, find the same word, and transfer it to
that scene. No need to fly an actor back to dub the soundtrack. No
need to reshoot anything.
</P>
<P>
   In one demonstration, Ohanian and Phillips had a copy of the
screenplay for ``Mouse Hunt'' on one monitor and a scene from the
movie on another. Phillips clicked on a scene on the screenplay
monitor, and it appeared on the second monitor instantaneously. On
a flatbed, this would have taken several minutes, maybe a half
hour. On an Avid, it took less than a second.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene from the same movie in which a mouse runs across a
floor packed with mousetraps, the director wanted to fill one gap
with another trap. Using an Avid, editors cloned one of the traps
in the scene, turned it sideways, and digitally moved it into the
open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the technology became available for the first time,
editors saw it from a very creative side. They said, `Give me the
same eight months to edit a feature on this and I can explore it 25
times more ways than I ever could on film,' '' said Phillips.
``There is never a reason for saying `why not' anymore. You just do
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   After the changes are made on an Avid, the computer system then
prints out a precise ``cut list'' of all the editor's desired
special effects and manipulations. Those instructions are sent to a
film house, which will make the changes happen on celluloid,
something that computers have yet to replace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negative cutters will be around for a long time,'' Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Avid's technology allows filmmakers to experiment with
editing techniques, some say it has also accelerated the pace of
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   From the time the film ``Lethal Weapon 4'' shot its first scene
to the time it opened in theaters, a scant seven months passed. It
was a Hollywood record. But with hundreds of millions of dollars in
loans hanging over the production, mega-actors facing mega-demands
for their time, and studios clamoring to save money, seven months
was a godsend. It wouldn't have been possible without a digital
film-editing system.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the postproduction time is shrinking,'' said Ohanian,
``because if you're floating $100 million out on a loan, it's big
money here, and you can make a lot more money in terms of getting
that product into the theater faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohanian and Phillips are far from Hollywood types _ two men who
prefer to be behind the scenes rather than out front.
</P>
<P>
   Ohanian is a 38-year-old Rhode Island native who became
fascinated with film after his father gave him a Super 8 camera.
Although he started college as a dentistry major, he quickly
changed his mind. ``The moment I put two pieces of film together
and faked somebody out, I wanted to be an editor,'' he said. When
he came to Avid 10 years ago, he was the fledgling company's eighth
hire.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 38, was raised in France and schooled in Montana,
where he taught himself classical guitar and became interested in
studying music for film. After making a movie for some music he had
written, and creating rolling titles on a class project using slide
projectors and a roll of butcher paper, he was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, being a control freak, I thought, if I can do
the music and the movie, I can do it all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two came together when Phillips took an Avid class and saw
an early prototype of the system. When he realized this newfangled
system was similar to straight-cut editing on a flatbed, he spoke
up. Phillips told the instructor that what Avid was doing on the
computer was no different from what he and other directors were
doing on traditional film-editing equipment. ``I wasn't overly
impressed,'' he said, telling the instructor that the system
wouldn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Well, how should it work?' I said, `Hire me and
I'll tell you.' And I've been here ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Their work is now focused on bringing this expensive technology
to independent films, where time and money are of the essence.
Ohanian and Phillips said that such filmmakers can save $100,000
using a digital film-editing system, making up for lost time,
reshoots, and the cost of processing film. Which is why they're
helping out with ``Dweller in the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the system, Ohanian puts Scene 43 in some order, and the
story begins to show.
</P>
<P>
   A girl clad in a towel stands transfixed by a boarded-up window,
and a monster's hand reaches through, grabs her head, and drags her
into the blackness. A guy comes into the room and screams; more
people come into the room, scream, and run to the window.
</P>
<P>
   Then Phillips and the computer take over, tightening cuts,
fixing a continuity problem in which the monster's hand is on the
girl's head and then later on her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, after they've experimented with some of Film
Composer's many special effects, a scream is moved under another
scene, the monster's hand looks almost real thanks to a timing
delay, and the scene's movement is suddenly fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times artists won't think of paths to go down because
they know the technology is too hard to use or the technology
doesn't allow them to do it,'' said Ohanian. ``Here, you can do
that stuff. And what we're doing here has taken less than five
minutes.''

<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ First, let's get the age thing out of the
way. Trot Nixon is not 30 years old. He has not been in the Red Sox
organization for 15 years. It just seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   All of the 1999 Red Sox were due in camp Tuesday (Feb. 23) and,
for the first time in his professional baseball career, Trot Nixon
has a job. Red Sox manager Jimy Williams is counting on Nixon to be
his starting right fielder Opening Day in Kansas City April 5.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is still only 24 years old (he'll be 25 April 11), which
seems impossible for Sox fans who remember hearing about him back
in 1993 when Daddy Butch Hobson was Boston's manager.
</P>
<P>
   How long has Trot been around? He was drafted by Lou Gorman.
This is the Red Sox equivalent of being one of Bill Parcells's
secretaries with the Patriots. Boston's Machiavellian general
manager Dan Duquette has purged the organization of almost all
Gorman nominees (John Valentin and Scott Hatteberg are the only
other Gorman draft picks still playing for the Sox).
</P>
<P>
   A multisport high school star in Wilmington, N.C., Nixon had a
scholarship to play quarterback at North Carolina State, but the
Sox made him the No. 7 pick in the draft and lured him to baseball
with an $890,000 signing bonus. They also set aside No. 7 _ the
number worn by Mickey Mantle, the favorite player of Trot's
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   There was small talk about Hall of Fame after Trot was drafted.
The Sox shipped him to Fenway for a round of public batting
practice, and Trot wowed the crowd with homers into the bullpen and
shots off the wall. Then he disappeared into the quagmire of the
minor leagues, and he's been almost invisible since that initial
showcase at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Lynchburg. Sarasota. Trenton. Pawtucket. Winter ball. Counting
time in the Florida Instructional League, Nixon has been playing
minor league ball for six seasons. Along the way he suffered a
chipped bone in his lower back and the discouragement of hitting
only .244 at Triple A in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon got it together last summer, hitting .310 with 23 homers
and stealing 26 bases for Pawtucket. He got called up to the bigs
Sept. 6 and hit .259 in 13 games. He started in right field in the
third game of the playoffs against the Indians and hit a single off
Charles Nagy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Darren Bragg gone and the Sox desperate for
outfielders with any power, Nixon's the one to play right field
unless he flops in Florida. This is his time. The job is his to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it that way,'' he said. ``I look at it that I
have to make this team. I need to go out and play well in spring
training. It's been a long time. I've had a lot of ups and downs,
but I've learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said the low point for him came in 1997 when he struggled
at Pawtucket. But he never thought about giving up and never
regretted choosing baseball over football. His family and friends
understood that the road to the big leaques is littered with
landmines (Nixon's wife, Kathryn Fisher, is a NASCAR reporter for
ESPN2). Some Sox fans have been less patient, wondering, ``Whatever
happened to Trot Nixon?''
</P>
<P>
   Casual fans of big league baseball have no idea how difficult it
is to make it to the majors. For every big leaguer you see riding
the bench with the Pirates, there are 15 kids who signed
professional contracts, kissed their families goodbye, and wasted
their youth kicking around the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not take long for certain players, but it is true _
there's so many baseball players in the minor leagues,'' said
Nixon. ``I don't think people quite understand it at all, just how
many players there are. Even in one organization, there's a lot of
players.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter he worked out in Bradenton with Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great four weeks at the `military academy' in
Bradenton with Nomar,'' he said. ``I worked on speed, agility,
lateral movement. I did a lot of weightlifting and spent 2-3 hours
a day in the cages and taking ground balls and fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's father, William, is a renowned kidney specialist in
Wilmington. He was an active participant in Trot's original
contract discussions and has been labeled a ``stage dad'' by some
folks in Sox camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that says that just doesn't know squat,'' said Trot.
``I push myself. You work out with me and you realize that. My
father pushed me when I needed to be pushed and that was in high
school and a lot of other fathers have done that same thing. It's
not like I answer to him and he pushes me. I push myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he gets to play where Dwight Evans, Tony Conigliaro, Ken
Harrelson and so many other sluggers patrolled. It has been 10
years since any Sox outfielder hit 20 homers (Evans in '89).
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've got a lot to prove to the fans and the
ownership,'' Nixon acknowledged. ``But I can't really give you
numbers. I've never even played half a major league season. But I'm
going to play hard, and hopefully I'l have a chance to put up
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can hit the ball, give 'em some speed. I don't have
the strongest arm in the world, but it's somewhat accurate. And I
play hard.''

   ISRAEL-VOTERS _ JERUSALEM _ Elections in other countries prompt
efforts to get out the vote. In Israel, they try to fly it in.
Several thousand Israelis in a series of competing, and
semi-secret, political airlifts are expected to come from America
and Europe to cast their ballots in elections this spring. The
influx is apparently a result of three traits that mark the Israeli
character, a dedication to politics, a penchant for traveling and
living outside their country and, finally, a system that does not
allow voting by absentee ballots. As a result, not only are
individual Israelis headed back, but the country's national
airlines is offering election discounts and, reportedly, several
competing groups are looking to charter flights for voters leaning
their way. ``It will be kind of a race between efforts,'' said
Israeli political analyst Daniel Elazar, of the Jerusalem Center
for Public Affairs. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As Russia is approaching the time of new elections, it faces a
truly unique alternative. At the crossroads of two eras it must
decide to get off the ground and forge ahead or be resigned to
ultimate decline.
 &HT;    This is a time, after all, when the Russian authorities have
lost touch with the needs of the nation. The real will of the
people must be known. And so it is necessary to be sure the next
elections are truly free and fair.
 &HT;    The voting could help Russia recover that bond between the
government and the people. If the elections are again corrupted by
intrigue, conspiracy, under-the-carpet maneuvers and the charade of
``campaign techniques,'' as happened so outrageously in 1996, when
President Yeltsin was re-elected, expect the worse to happen.
 &HT;    The fact is that since 1991, there has not been a clean election
in Russia. The will of the people has been frustrated at all levels
_ federal, regional and in the republics. In recent years, Russian
voters have learned a great deal and must no longer be taken for
granted. New campaign deceptions are bound to fail.
 &HT;    There is one danger not to ignore: Of late, many people have
become so disenchanted that they might not vote at all. Some
politicians and academics have therefore suggested that, for a
limited time, voting should be made mandatory. This may seem rather
undemocratic, but I support the idea.
 &HT;    It may not work in other countries, but it could become a big
plus for Russian democracy, where the people must take hold. It
could help bring younger voters to the polls; they tend to stay
away. It would also minimize the possibility of manipulating
election returns.
 &HT;    Incidentally, voting in elections was for many decades mandatory
in Italy, with no harm done to Italian democracy. In Austria, this
rule is still in effect. In the United States, of course, this
might sound like heresy, but why should we always emulate America?
 &HT;    The media could play an important role. It is true that most of
our media is in the hands of those who pay, but freedom of the
press still exists in Russia. The test of a journalist's
responsibility is whether he or she pays heed to conscience and a
sense of professional duty. Many of them, I know, are thinking
about what's best for the nation.
 &HT;    The goal should be clear _ consolidating all those who are
capable of defending the interests of the majority and the
interests of Russia as a sovereign state. Is there a party that
could do it?
 &HT;    Let's look at the situation without bias. Opinion polls give the
lead to the communists, but they cannot win. They do not have a
realistic program for pulling the country out of crisis; they
represent only a part of the populace. The right-wing coalition of
the so-called radical democrats does not have a prayer _ the people
are likely to hold them responsible for Russia's chaos and
disastrous situation and punish them at the polls.
 &HT;    Thus, something new should be devised. And the possibility is
there, because what the Primakov government is doing is similar to
the program put forth by Yuri Luzhkov, the current mayor of Moscow
who aspires to national office. Both men emphasize the need to
protect Russia's national interests and to provide for the needs of
ordinary people.
 &HT;    This duo could work well, all the more so because their goals
have much in common with the positions taken by Grigori Yavlinski
and his Yabloko party. Many governors too appear ready to support
Primakov and his policy course. To sum up, conditions are in place
to create a broad-based alliance that would guarantee stability and
progress.
 &HT;    This is also a time for the West to take unconventional, wise
and courageous decisions. The West must demonstrate that it can
take a new look at Russia, and that it understands how dangerous
would be the temptation to take advantage of Russia's current
weakness to try to marginalize it in world affairs. This may well
be the time for the West to take an unprecedented step in
cooperation with Russia.
 &HT;    All responsible forces within and outside Russia should realize
that the fall of the Primakov government would plunge Russia into
chaos. Elections _ presidential or parliamentary _ could then
become impossible. There are some good reasons to be critical of
this government, but remember that Primakov was called in to manage
a disastrous political situation and a ruined economy.
 &HT;    What is more, Russia is going through a multiple crisis _
economic, psychological and political-institutional. Without
stability, it is hard to combat such a crisis. Too hard, in fact _
so I would venture to suggest that the presidential elections be
held first, not after the elections to parliament. This would
clarify the future direction of the country and make it possible to
start working quietly and in concert on amendments to the Russian
constitution.
 &HT;    Of course, to implement this scenario without violating the
constitution we need the consent of the president. It is up to him
to decide. Yeltsin should evaluate the need to do it so as to give
the country a chance to choose its future in a proper environment.
Today, he could still decide how history will look upon him.
Tomorrow, it may be too late.

away. It would also minimize the possibility of manipulating
election returns.
 &HT;    Incidentally, voting in elections was for many decades mandatory
in Italy, with no harm done to Italian democracy. In Austria, this
rule is still in effect. In the United States, of course, this
might sound like heresy, but why should we always emulate America?
 &HT;    The media could play an important role. It is true that most of
our media is in the hands of those who pay, but freedom of the
press still exists in Russia. The test of a journalist's
responsibility is whether he or she pays heed to conscience and a
sense of professional duty. Many of them, I know, are thinking
about what's best for the nation.
 &HT;    The goal should be clear _ consolidating all those who are
capable of defending the interests of the majority and the
interests of Russia as a sovereign state. Is there a party that
could do it?
 &HT;    Let's look at the situation without bias. Opinion polls give the
lead to the communists, but they cannot win. They do not have a
realistic program for pulling the country out of crisis; they
represent only a part of the populace. The right-wing coalition of
the so-called radical democrats does not have a prayer _ the people
are likely to hold them responsible for Russia's chaos and
disastrous situation and punish them at the polls.
 &HT;    Thus, something new should be devised. And the possibility is
there, because what the Primakov government is doing is similar to
the program put forth by Yuri Luzhkov, the current mayor of Moscow
who aspires to national office. Both men emphasize the need to
protect Russia's national interests and to provide for the needs of
ordinary people.
 &HT;    This duo could work well, all the more so because their goals
have much in common with the positions taken by Grigori Yavlinski
and his Yabloko party. Many governors too appear ready to support
Primakov and his policy course. To sum up, conditions are in place
to create a broad-based alliance that would guarantee stability and
progress.
 &HT;    This is also a time for the West to take unconventional, wise
and courageous decisions. The West must demonstrate that it can
take a new look at Russia, and that it understands how dangerous
would be the temptation to take advantage of Russia's current
weakness to try to marginalize it in world affairs. This may well
be the time for the West to take an unprecedented step in
cooperation with Russia.
 &HT;    All responsible forces within and outside Russia should realize
that the fall of the Primakov government would plunge Russia into
chaos. Elections _ presidential or parliamentary _ could then
become impossible. There are some good reasons to be critical of
this government, but remember that Primakov was called in to manage
a disastrous political situation and a ruined economy.
 &HT;    What is more, Russia is going through a multiple crisis _
economic, psychological and political-institutional. Without
stability, it is hard to combat such a crisis. Too hard, in fact _
so I would venture to suggest that the presidential elections be
held first, not after the elections to parliament. This would
clarify the future direction of the country and make it possible to
start working quietly and in concert on amendments to the Russian
constitution.
 &HT;    Of course, to implement this scenario without violating the
constitution we need the consent of the president. It is up to him
to decide. Yeltsin should evaluate the need to do it so as to give
the country a chance to choose its future in a proper environment.
Today, he could still decide how history will look upon him.
Tomorrow, it may be too late.

<P>
   .......................
</P>
<P>
   At International World Wrestling, I, Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,
was the headliner, Mr. Magnificent, the Boss Man.
</P>
<P>
   I brought wrestling into the modern age.
</P>
<P>
   I was the one who introduced rock 'n' roll. I was the first to
use loops of accordion wire in place of ropes. I was the one who
introduced pyrotechnics. A flaming genius!
</P>
<P>
   Every night it was a Ring of Fire!
</P>
<P>
   I was the first to employ sweat-seeking cruise missiles in the
ring. The first to use explosives: We liked to have one wrestler
throw another in a Dumpster and blow it up. Our slogan was ``Come
See Extreme Wrestling _ No Children Under 6 _ Not for the Squeamish
_ Don't Wear Your Good Clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   The blood flowed, the monster truck roared, the ring burst into
flames and the fans went away happy. I was sitting on top of the
world, earning millions, getting a million hits a day at
jimmybigboy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling gets hard when you pass 40, though. Your back hurts
from lifting 300-pound guys and heaving them into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   One night in the Boston Garden, Hump Hooley and I fought a
marathon tag-team match against the Messenger of Death and Mr.
Disaster, a real shorts-scorcher involving quarts of blood,
thousands of vampire bats, a pack of rabid wolves, six suicide
bombers from Hamas and 12 Tomahawk missiles, and in the finale I
hoisted the Messenger over my head and heaved him into the
turnbuckle, only to have him ignite a moat of gasoline around the
ring, and I passed out from the fumes and lay unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The flames were licking at my feet, death seemed near at hand _
and then pain awakened me!
</P>
<P>
   I leapt up and called in an air strike on myself! The cruise
missiles came straight at me! Smoke and flames! Utter confusion!
And when the smoke cleared, there was a heap of ashes in the middle
of the burning ring where I had been!
</P>
<P>
   The crowd screamed: ``No! No! Not Big Boy!'' And then I jumped
up and brushed the ashes away and Old Glory descended from the
rafters and I took hold of a corner and was lifted to safety as the
ring exploded and burned.
</P>
<P>
   When the match was done, I lay on the dressing-room floor, too
tired to shower. The Messenger of Death brought me a beer and Hump
helped me into a chair.
</P>
<P>
   I glanced at myself in a mirror and was shocked at the grayness
and blankness of me, the fatuous look in the eyes, as if I were on
powerful medications. Or else, as if I wasn't and should be. I
looked like a snake that had swallowed a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loved the flag bit,'' Hump said. ``Write that into the act
from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Boys, I believe I need a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the morning I went to a doctor who diagnosed a nasty case of
testosterone poisoning. The pills I took to keep my energy up were
causing a metabolic vasodilatation of the nerve endings. I was
getting numb above the neck.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One night in Dallas, a man waiting for me in the dressing room
stood as I entered and extended his hand: ``Jimmy, I am Earl
Woofner, the chairman of the Ethical Party of Minnesota. And I've
come a thousand miles to say that our state needs a man like you.''
</P>
<P>
   My skull glittered with sweat, my pink tights were spattered
with blood and I was wearing a peacock-feather headdress, cobalt
blue shades and a cape with 600 flashing light bulbs. Plus, a
python named Virg draped around my neck. Earl did not flinch.
</P>
<P>
   He set down his briefcase and sat on a bench and looked up at me
with utter sincerity and said: ``The people of Minnesota are crying
out for a champion to break the liberal choke hold and open up
politics to common sense and honesty. And I am looking at him.''
</P>
<P>
   I took off the glasses and set down the snake.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about it, Jimmy?'' he said. ``The troops are ready. When
do we get the order to march?''
</P>
<P>
   By rights I should be a Democrat, because I am for the little
guy, but the Democrats are run by yuppie liberals trying to remake
American society into a day-care center for adults. Making folks
stand outdoors to smoke a cigarette. Making a teacher fill out a
14-page questionnaire if she says boo to a kid. Labels on beer cans
warning that alcohol is not good for your health and may cause you
to fall down on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats started out with the New Deal, a good idea for its
time, and then delusions of grandeur led them to keep adding on to
it, like a guy who sets out to make carbonara sauce and starts
throwing sausage and peppers and onions in, and pretty soon you've
got peas and anchovies and pineapple swimming around in it and the
thyme and oregano are at toxic levels and nobody is hungry anymore.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Democratic platform. Programs for everything _
programs to combat grumpiness, stupidity, discrimination,
covetousness, improper lane changes, low math scores, flat beer,
poor taste and too much air in the Cracker Jack box, and all of the
programs require battalions of social workers and reams of paper.
</P>
<P>
   So I look to the Republicans, and what do I see? The Me First
Party: Squeeze the maximum profit out of everything, strip it
clean, gouge what you can, clear-cut the forest, to hell with
everybody else _ lay off the 20-year guys and hire cheap
replacements, cut costs, inflate the stock, sell out, make your
pile, leave town, head for your compound in Palm Springs, buy an
electronic security system and a team of Rottweilers, sit around
the swimming pool, enjoy your brains out and feel no more remorse
than a fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   So I thought, What the heck, why not the Ethical Party, a grab
bag of bikers and bird-watchers and disgruntled dishwashers and
surly seniors and people who call in to talk shows to gripe about
the mailman.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was May 1998. I took a week off from the I.W.W. tour and got
in my Porsche with the ``Mess With the Best, Die With the Rest''
bumper sticker and took a run around Minnesota to think about the
governorship.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer the gravel roads, where you can make time, roads that
would shake your fillings out at 30, but at 140 you fly over the
bumps like melted butter. From Moorhead to Worthington, on some of
those straight stretches, I held it at 200 for a while. I think
better when I'm moving fast.
</P>
<P>
   I cruised the state and I pondered the future.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the country, farmers were in hock and going broke, having
bought fancy combines at 20 percent interest, and now the price of
corn was bottoming out and the loans were coming due. In the
cities, the factories had gone south and the old factory buildings
were turned into restaurants serving lamb chops the size of
chickadees, plus an artichoke and a small red potato, for $30.
</P>
<P>
   I saw a picture of a candidate for the Democratic nomination for
governor, eating tofu at a fund-raiser and wearing a T-shirt that
said ``I Really Could Use a Hug Right Now.'' And a picture of a
Republican hopeful dedicating a milk-producing plant where 40,000
genetically engineered Holsteins, heavily sedated and lying on
canvas slings and fed with stomach tubes, could produce 2 million
gallons per day.
</P>
<P>
   I called Earl Woofner. ``I can't do it,'' I said. ``I am not a
politician. I don't have the stomach for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is your strong suit, your honest independent nature,'' he
said. ``Sleep on it. Call me tomorrow. The brochure is at the
printer's, ready to go. The 'Jimmy for Governor' beer is bottled,
all we have to do is slap on the labels.''
</P>
<P>
   That morning, as I often do when I'm on the road and have an
extra minute, I dropped by the local hospital to visit children,
and as it happened, there was one, a 12-year-old boy named Tommy,
who had lost his left hand in a corn picker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Boy,'' he said, ``how can I grow up to become a wrestler
without a left hand?''
</P>
<P>
   I told him: ``You can be anybody you want to be. Don't ever give
up. And it would be a great gimmick. Tommy (the Talon) Anderson.
Jump in the ring with your eagle-feather headdress and clack your
prosthetic device and get the audience to chant, 'He fought the
claw and the claw won.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was a chipper little guy, and he looked up at me and said,
``How did you become what you wanted to be, Big Boy?''
</P>
<P>
   And I was about to say, ``By sheer determination and
imagination,'' and then I thought: ``Hey, I'm not there yet. I want
to be governor. For once in my life, I want to be taken
seriously.'' And I looked down at his freckled face on the pillow
and said, ``Tommy, I came here to help you out, and instead you
helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   I called my wife, Lacy, and told her I had decided to run for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   There was a long breath of a pause, and she said: ``Fine, but I
don't campaign. I don't do the candidate's wife thing at all. No
fund-raisers, so don't even ask.'' I understood, I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you doing this?'' she asked. I said I was tired of
people making fun of me for wearing pink-feather boas.
</P>
<P>
   Felix, my promoter, offered to manage my campaign. Felix is a
hatchet-faced little guy with a toupee that looks like a raccoon
that got crushed by a semi. He favors livid green-plaid sport coats
and is very sallow and liverish looking, all splotches and rheum
and exploded capillaries, a stub of a cigarette smoldering on his
lower lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, thanks,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   I put on my Australian bush hat, my running shoes and my
``Gopher It'' T-shirt, and for five months I rode around Minnesota
in a motor home, green, the interior a soft beige that reminded me
of the inner thighs of a woman I met once in Miami, and lived on
Cheez Doodles, Ho Hos and root beer, which gave me so much gas I
could hardly keep my socks up. I addressed every Kiwanis Club,
Elks, Moose, Jaycees, Sons of Norway, Knights of Columbus, V.F.W.
and Eastern Star that cared to hear me and roamed the coffee shops
and Kmarts, handing out literature, pressing the flesh, chewing the
fat.
</P>
<P>
   I told the people: ``I am not a joke, I am a decent clean person
you could bring home and not be embarrassed by. Yes, I wore a pink
boa and gave flying mules and nipple lifts and atomic handshakes,
and will employ them against the Special Interests. I am no smarter
than anybody else and I don't claim to have all the answers, but it
ain't nuclear physics and I will work hard and accept no special
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   And what I don't know about state government, I'll know a month
after I take office.''
</P>
<P>
   My platform was exactly as follows:
</P>
<P>
   1. I will not tell a lie.
</P>
<P>
   2. I make no promise except to do my best.
</P>
<P>
   3. Any tax surplus goes straight back to you, the folks.
</P>
<P>
   4. I will scorn Big Business and Special Interests in favor of
you, the taxpayer and voter. The trough is closed.
</P>
<P>
   5. There will be action, not just a lot of yik-yakking.
</P>
<P>
   6. No weenies need apply.
</P>
<P>
   7. Let's party.
</P>
<P>
   I destroyed my opponents in the televised debates. I hung them
out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   The weaselly Democrat talked about government needing to create
jobs. I said: ``There used to be a country for people like you, but
it doesn't exist anymore. Its capital was Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   He whimpered and looked toward the corner of the studio, where
his advisers and pollsters were standing, holding his cue cards.
They were helpless to save him.
</P>
<P>
   The Wepublican was a scrawny runt with one wet finger in the
wind who used the word ``family'' in every sentence, as if this
might win him an Amana gas range, and said he favored social
welfare programs if they ``strengthened the family.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``If a person is smart enough to live in Minnesota, then
he is smart enough to take care of his own self and not look around
for a handout.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else dared to say it plain like that.
</P>
<P>
   And in gratitude, the people of Minnesota put me in the
governor's office.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was sworn in on Mon., Jan. 4, and the national press was
fawning all over me. Newsweek, Time, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore phoned that morning and wished me luck. ``Thanks, Al,''
I said. ``See you in Iowa.'' He had a coughing fit.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to whipping the pants off Gore, that Cigar Store
Indian, in New Hampshire and Iowa. Al will be the 10-to-1 favorite,
and when he falls he will crumble. When he garners 18 percent of
the vote in New Hampshire, compared with 52 percent for the
300-pound candidate with the big pink noggin, I am going to enjoy
watching him go on TV to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Al will wind up running the Ford Foundation and I will be a
president you can be proud of and land in Air Force One and inspect
honor guards and do my duty, and none of that groping in the West
Wing _ I will do mine upstairs in the First Bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Inauguration Day 2001 keeps me toasty warm on
these cold winter nights.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be sitting ramrod-straight in my seat on the flag-draped
platform before the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., dressed in my
black suit and Led Zeppelin T-shirt, a big wad of Copenhagen in my
cheek. On the back of my big bare head I'll feel, like dancing
snowflakes, the cold glares from all the big bonzos in the seats
behind me and I'll smile my Big Boy smile to the cameras on the
platform.
</P>
<P>
   I'll stand and raise my right hand and place my left hand with
the World Tag-Team Champion gold ring on the third finger upon the
Holy Bible held by my foxy wife, Lacy, and look Chief Justice Billy
(the Robe) Rehnquist straight in his black cobra eyes and vow to
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
and then turn to give Lacy a smooch and hug my daughter, Tiffany,
and my son, Adrian, and shake hands with Bill and Hillary and
squeeze Al Gore's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'll bear down a little until his eyes water and he looks
queasy, and say, ``Tough luck, buddy boy,'' and hold my arms up so
that my supporters out in the cheap seats can see me.
</P>
<P>
   I'll cock my ear to that distant cry of ``Jimm-ee, Jimm-ee,
Jimm-ee!'' _ and turn to go to the limo and look up and see every
senator and congressman and justice and ex-president and ambassador
standing, mouth open, in shock and confusion, as if they had just
witnessed the explosion of the Hindenberg, wondering: ``How did
this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   It's called democracy, boys.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    We all know them, if only by caricature. The parents who devote
hours each night to the ritual of their children's bedtimes. The
children with roomfuls of toys who complain of nothing to do. The
parents whose phone conversations are really interruptions
interrupted by conversation. The children who won't do their
homework unless their parents are nearby. The parents who intervene
on their children's behalf whenever a teacher delivers a bad grade,
a rebuke, a punishment. The children so incapable of dealing with
frustration they explode in rage whenever something goes any way
other than theirs. The children who think of no one but themselves.
The parents who think of no one but their children.
 &HT;    These are the parents, and these are the children, whom John
Rosemond would expunge from the national fabric.
 &HT;    Among an ever-growing group of usually conservative, often
Christian givers of authoritarian child-rearing advice, he is the
expert of the moment, largely because of a recent public dispute
with T. Berry Brazelton over the timing of toilet training.
 &HT;    But Middle America saw his day coming long before the potty wars
hit the papers. Twenty years ago, Rosemond (``Train them by 2!'')
was a family therapist in Gastonia, N.C., with an occasional
article in the local paper. Today, his weekly column appears in
about 150 newspapers.
 &HT;    His practice boarded up, the 51-year-old Rosemond wanders the
country eight months of the year, the Johnny Appleseed of
discipline, putting on nearly 250 shows annually. He publishes a
bimonthly magazine, Affirmative Parenting. He operates a Web site.
And his eight books, which have sold a total of more than a million
copies, have experienced a 30 percent increase in sales over each
of the last two years.
 &HT;    There's more in the works: an infomercial to market a ``take it
home'' effective-discipline kit; a series of nine hourlong programs
being developed for possible placement on PBS; a series of ``news''
segments to be marketed to television stations.
 &HT;    In the fall of '99 you'll even be able to take a cruise with
Rosemond. And when you return home, if he has done his job, you
will, in his words, ``fling open the door and say, 'Hey, kids,
things will never be the same!' ``
 &HT;    It wasn't a cruise, but they came mostly two by two, as hopeful
of salvation as the animals to Noah _ young married couples, women
walking with the shared gait of friends. They came by the hundreds,
up the steps to Wichita's Century II Convention Center.
 &HT;    They came with the purposefulness of disciples, ready to receive
the wisdom being handed out that day. And they were not
disappointed.
 &HT;    Though Rosemond's posture is stooped _ think John Lithgow on a
bad-back day _ his manner is straightforward, unambivalent. Part of
that authority must come from familiarity with his material. Not
only does he repeat three basic talks hundreds of times a year, but
he also uses the same anecdotes in his shows that he uses in book
after book.
 &HT;    ``Are you the kind of parents who tell your kids to pick up
their toys and then leave the room?'' Rosemond asked. ``Or are you
the sort who wants to have a warm and fuzzy relationship going with
the kid?'' His disdain turned to parodic soprano: ``I know, let's
make a game of picking up the toys. The person who gets the most
will get a bowl of ice cream after supper.'''
 &HT;    Rosemond moved on. ``If you punish your child,'' he advised,
``he will hate you. He won't talk to you for three days.'' Beat.
``It's a blessing. Take a vacation.''
 &HT;    The crowd laughed and clapped. They felt ``empowered'' _ a word
I heard to this side of nausea _ by Rosemond. He may have been
telling them they were jerks, but he was also telling them that
they could change. They could realize that rearing kids is ``a
no-brainer.'' They could learn to ignore the ``mental-health
professionals who have convinced us, with the assistance of the
media, that we were all raised in pathological, dysfunctional
families.''
 &HT;    They could forget everything they've ever heard about building
self-esteem in children. They could see their children as ``direct
descendants of Adam and Eve'' and, as such, ``inclined to
mischief.'' They could start confronting their children every time
they misbehaved, and then they could punish them. They could put
their marriage at the center of the family. They could stop
worrying about their relationships with their children and accept
the challenge of leadership. They could make their children happy
by making them well behaved.
 &HT;    Rosemond has not always thought such thoughts; indeed, the story
of his transformation is proof that there really is no conservative
like an ex-drug-taking, rock 'n' roll-playing liberal.
 &HT;    This is how he tells it: His parents divorced when he was 3;
when he was 7, his mother remarried, to an older man who moved the
family from Charleston, S.C., to Chicago. The marriage was marked
by violence, first verbal, then physical. (``I wasn't traumatized
by it, just scared to death.'') His stepfather believed all
emotions should be kept under wraps.
 &HT;    When Rosemond was 15, he went to live in Georgia with his
father, a golf pro, who gave him his own apartment. (``This was not
good for me.'') He finished his high-school years in Chicago. (``My
mother moved into her own room with a bolt lock and her own
refrigerator.'') He then went to Western Illinois University, where
he eventually received his master's degree in psychology.
 &HT;    While there, he played in a rock band. He did a lot of drugs. He
sported red hair down to his shoulders and a fatigue jacket with a
flag sewn upside-down on the back. But after he was married _ he
was 20; his bride, Willie Herman, was 19 _ it was time to get a
job, at a community-health center in the mountains of North
Carolina.
 &HT;    Their son, Eric, was born in 1969. At first, John and Willie
followed the advice of the ``nouveau parenting experts'' they
despise these days. But their son's rambunctiousness and Willie's
second pregnancy (Amy, their second child, is now 26) combined to
make them reconsider. ``Eric's behaviors were going to destroy our
relationship,'' Willie recalls.
 &HT;    The Rosemonds came to understand that Eric needed discipline of
the old-fashioned kind, and the conversion began.
 &HT;    (``This is Eric,'' Rosemond says, introducing me to his son.
``His career,'' Eric adds, laughing.)
 &HT;    As Rosemond's attitudes toward child rearing solidified, his
politics turned toward the right. These days he cannot abide
no-fault divorce; homosexual parenting; Selma Fraiberg's ``The
Magic Years''; sex-education programs; Thomas Gordon's Parent
Effectiveness Training program; homework planners (``a source of
codependency'' between the overinvolved parent and the
irresponsible child); single parenthood by choice; the inclusion of
spanking in definitions of child abuse; TV; and Hillary Clinton and
Marian Wright Edelman (``ultraliberals, leftists, socialists'').
 &HT;    The Rosemonds' home in Gastonia is Country Living perfect _
sampler pillows, stenciled walls, racks and racks of pipes, George
Washington hanging over the fireplace. But when Eric and his wife,
Nancy, walk in with their two little boys, ready for a lovefest
with Grandpa, it takes on the aura of a stage set. The afternoon
feels rehearsed, and everyone in the cast _ including me _ knows
his or her part.
 &HT;    Eric (``I don't read the books, I don't read the articles'') is
there to scoff at Dad. ``So, do you think he seems harsh, like not
a fun person?'' he asks me right off, laughing. ``Well, I tell
people he can dole out punishment with a smile on his face.''
 &HT;    Nancy casually but firmly minds the children, while Willie
soothes any queasiness Rosemond's beliefs about women might
engender. Rosemond is the well-rehearsed pro.
 &HT;    Here he is, in nutshell version.
 &HT;    _ Parents should stop worrying about developing self-esteem in
their children. If held accountable for their behavior and allowed
to experience hardship and frustration, children will develop
self-esteem on their own. Mothers, in particular, he says, are
guilty of rushing in the minute the child begins feeling unhappy or
distressed.
 &HT;    ``If there are two words that underlie self-esteem,'' Rosemond
says, ``they are 'I can.' Well, I was in a school recently. I
walked into the boys' bathroom. Above the mirror, there was this
sign that said, 'You are now looking at the most special person in
the whole world.' This isn't self-esteem. This is narcissism.
Today's child justifies anything. Bill Clinton is a prime example.
He grew up with a single mother who told him his excrement didn't
stink.''
 &HT;    _ Spanking is fine, if done swiftly, occasionally, privately, in
anger but not in rage, with the hand, on the rear.
 &HT;    _ Attention Deficit Disorder is not genetic _ as much as parents
(who don't want to think it's their fault) and professionals (who
want to continue treatment forever) want it to be.
 &HT;    ``Every 2-year-old has ADD, because the left temporal lobe is
not sufficiently developed,'' Rosemond claims. Parents who pay
attention to their children's proper brain development _ by
shielding them from electronic media, making them focus on adult
authority figures and expecting them to finish tasks _ cause this
innate ADD to disappear.
 &HT;    _ Toilet training should occur by the age of 2; otherwise, a
child will become a spoiled brat. Here's how it's done, on the
now-famous three-to-five-day plan: ``You take their clothes off.
You put the potty where they can see it. When they have an accident
they scream, because they hate it running down their legs. Every
time you hear them screaming you put them on the potty.'' Carpet
cleaning is the final step.
 &HT;    _ Chores are essential. By their teens, children should be doing
all kitchen cleanup, most of the housework and the lion's share of
the laundry.
 &HT;    _ All disobedience, no matter how small the infraction and even
if followed by an apology, must be punished. The punishment should
be unpleasant, memorable and inflicted at a time that is convenient
for the parent.
 &HT;    Rosemond talks like this until dusk, indefatigable, cool, even
when I ask if it might be easier to get his point of view across if
he separated it from his religion (``nondenominational
Jewish-Christian,'' by his description) and his politics: ``People
need to understand that conservatives did not politicize parenting
in America, that the people who did are people like Hillary Clinton
and Marian Wright Edelman.''
 &HT;    I didn't know then that Rosemond has his eye on a possible run
for the House of Representatives, but the information wouldn't have
mattered; my role in our stage play does not include a debate about
who politicized the family, how Clinton and Edelman came to be
linked at the hip or why he's polarizing the debate.
 &HT;    It is very easy to find people willing to take on Rosemond.
According to the executive director of the North Carolina
Psychology Board, Martha N. Storie, the board investigated a
complaint brought against Rosemond in November 1987. After an
informal hearing early the next year, a reprimand was issued.
 &HT;    In September 1995, after the board received another complaint,
Rosemond voluntarily entered into a consent order, which stipulated
that a state supervisor review his columns prior to publication.
 &HT;    (Rosemond, who first told me of these incidents, says the first
complaint referred to a column in which he said there was no
evidence that putting a very young child into therapy was efficient
either in time or money; the second complaint was a response to his
advice to the family of an 18-month-old who had been sexually
abused. He told them to forgo therapy for her, since she would
never remember the incident anyway. His descriptions of the
columns, which he stands by to this day, are generally accurate.
They have been excised from the archives on his Web site.)
 &HT;    Much more recently, Grace Reef, director of intergovernmental
relations for the Children's Defense Fund, told me that Edelman has
never worked on any legislation to make spanking illegal, as
Rosemond claims, and that the CDF knows nothing about any program
that would mandate a visit to every new mother to assess her
ability to mother, as Rosemond inveighs against.
 &HT;    I'm sure I also could have found sociologists more than willing
to label his thinking on women sexist. (``Women don't want men to
be more involved, they just want them to be more at their beck and
call.'') But it seemed too easy.
 &HT;    Besides, writing Rosemond off might suggest I don't recognize
anything of my family in the ones he criticizes. I do, and have to
admit that my husband and I have recently made subtle
Rosemond-inspired shifts in our child rearing. Now when we say,
``This is our car, and we are listening to 'All Things
Considered''' _ that ultimate line in the sand _ we mean it. Our
kids, age 10 and 13, look at each other, roll their eyes and
mutter, ``Brainwashed in Kansas.''
 &HT;    The people who adhere to Rosemond's philosophy would laugh at
that _ for more than the obvious reason of our general wussiness.
Their families had once been out of control, their children more
headache than pleasure, but that's history.
 &HT;    As Amanda Riley, a mother of two from Danbury, Conn., tells me,
hearing Rosemond speak three years ago ``rocked'' her world, though
the change in parenting style was not easy at first. ``My daughter
did not get that there were consequences for bad behavior,'' Riley
recalls. ``Since then, I haven't tried anything from Rosemond that
hasn't worked. He's kind of like a religion to me. What he says is
gospel.''
 &HT;    Rosemond often asserts that all parenting advice can be broken
down into a series of aphorisms. ``I'm going to give you enough
rope to hang yourself.'' ``You paddle your own canoe.'' ``You can't
get something for nothing.''
 &HT;    But what, I wonder, about that other maxim: ``Don't hold a
grudge''?
 &HT;    And that's what troubles me most about Rosemond. I respond to
some of what he says, but not to how he says it. ``Gotcha!'' he
seems to bellow, delighting in every punishment doled out. And
while research has shown that children turn out best in families in
which parental demands are enforced, that is true only if the
punishment is not punitive. Loosey-goosey parenting may not work,
but neither does ``seeing and not hearing'' children.
 &HT;    Besides, where does the fun in rearing children get factored in?
Where is the acknowledgment that complexity is not necessarily bad?
Where is the intellectual adventure that comes from helping kids
learn to discriminate between legitimate and bogus authority?
 &HT;    My time with Rosemond has helped me develop a theory. I call it,
in homage to the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild's ``second
shift'' (the work a woman does after returning home from her paid
job), ``the third shift.'' But unlike Hochschild's work of
scholarship, my theory is based on that grand journalistic
standard: myself and a couple of friends.
 &HT;    Somewhere along the line, my female friends and I took on,
unasked, a ``third shift'' _ the job of family-happiness manager,
juggling not only lessons and games and school events and nights
out with adult friends, but everyone's emotional well-being,
articulated or not. This is a thankless and exhausting task,
particularly if it includes eradicating frustration and boredom
from children's lives while simultaneously making sure they feel
good about themselves.
 &HT;    I accepted this work, without thinking much about its
consequences, until I met Rosemond. And then it came to me like a
nightmare. He might worry I was turning my children into the Bill
Clintons of tomorrow. But I had another concern: What if I was
rearing them to be Monica Lewinskys _ young adults who don't want
jobs where hard work is expected, who turn petulant when they don't
get what they want, even when what they're looking for is their own
happiness.
 &HT;    That realization _ that your kids can't grow up unless you let
them do it for themselves _ is what I'll take away from this
Rosemondian adventure. Or, as the man says, ``You can't get
something for nothing.''

 &HT;    We all know them, if only by caricature. The parents who devote
hours each night to the ritual of their children's bedtimes. The
children with roomfuls of toys who complain of nothing to do. The

Rosemond would expunge from the national fabric.
 &HT;    Among an ever-growing group of usually conservative, often
Christian givers of authoritarian child-rearing advice, he is the
expert of the moment, largely because of a recent public dispute
with T. Berry Brazelton over the timing of toilet training.
 &HT;    But Middle America saw his day coming long before the potty wars
hit the papers. Twenty years ago, Rosemond (``Train them by 2!'')
was a family therapist in Gastonia, N.C., with an occasional
article in the local paper. Today, his weekly column appears in
about 150 newspapers.
 &HT;    His practice boarded up, the 51-year-old Rosemond wanders the
country eight months of the year, the Johnny Appleseed of
discipline, putting on nearly 250 shows annually. He publishes a
bimonthly magazine, Affirmative Parenting. He operates a Web site.
And his eight books, which have sold a total of more than a million
copies, have experienced a 30 percent increase in sales over each
of the last two years.
 &HT;    There's more in the works: an infomercial to market a ``take it
home'' effective-discipline kit; a series of nine hourlong programs
being developed for possible placement on PBS; a series of ``news''
segments to be marketed to television stations.
 &HT;    In the fall of '99 you'll even be able to take a cruise with
Rosemond. And when you return home, if he has done his job, you
will, in his words, ``fling open the door and say, 'Hey, kids,
things will never be the same!' ``
 &HT;    It wasn't a cruise, but they came mostly two by two, as hopeful
of salvation as the animals to Noah _ young married couples, women
walking with the shared gait of friends. They came by the hundreds,
up the steps to Wichita's Century II Convention Center.
 &HT;    They came with the purposefulness of disciples, ready to receive
the wisdom being handed out that day. And they were not
disappointed.
 &HT;    Though Rosemond's posture is stooped _ think John Lithgow on a

that authority must come from familiarity with his material. Not
only does he repeat three basic talks hundreds of times a year, but
he also uses the same anecdotes in his shows that he uses in book
after book.
 &HT;    ``Are you the kind of parents who tell your kids to pick up
their toys and then leave the room?'' Rosemond asked. ``Or are you
the sort who wants to have a warm and fuzzy relationship going with
the kid?'' His disdain turned to parodic soprano: ``I know, let's
make a game of picking up the toys. The person who gets the most
will get a bowl of ice cream after supper.'''
 &HT;    Rosemond moved on. ``If you punish your child,'' he advised,
``he will hate you. He won't talk to you for three days.'' Beat.
``It's a blessing. Take a vacation.''
 &HT;    The crowd laughed and clapped. They felt ``empowered'' _ a word
I heard to this side of nausea _ by Rosemond. He may have been
telling them they were jerks, but he was also telling them that
they could change. They could realize that rearing kids is ``a
no-brainer.'' They could learn to ignore the ``mental-health
professionals who have convinced us, with the assistance of the
media, that we were all raised in pathological, dysfunctional

 &HT;    They could forget everything they've ever heard about building
self-esteem in children. They could see their children as ``direct
descendants of Adam and Eve'' and, as such, ``inclined to

they misbehaved, and then they could punish them. They could put
their marriage at the center of the family. They could stop
worrying about their relationships with their children and accept
the challenge of leadership. They could make their children happy
by making them well behaved.
 &HT;    Rosemond has not always thought such thoughts; indeed, the story
of his transformation is proof that there really is no conservative
like an ex-drug-taking, rock 'n' roll-playing liberal.
 &HT;    This is how he tells it: His parents divorced when he was 3;
when he was 7, his mother remarried, to an older man who moved the
family from Charleston, S.C., to Chicago. The marriage was marked
by violence, first verbal, then physical. (``I wasn't traumatized
by it, just scared to death.'') His stepfather believed all
emotions should be kept under wraps.
 &HT;    When Rosemond was 15, he went to live in Georgia with his
father, a golf pro, who gave him his own apartment. (``This was not
good for me.'') He finished his high-school years in Chicago. (``My
mother moved into her own room with a bolt lock and her own
refrigerator.'') He then went to Western Illinois University, where
he eventually received his master's degree in psychology.
 &HT;    While there, he played in a rock band. He did a lot of drugs. He
sported red hair down to his shoulders and a fatigue jacket with a
flag sewn upside-down on the back. But after he was married _ he
was 20; his bride, Willie Herman, was 19 _ it was time to get a
job, at a community-health center in the mountains of North
Carolina.
 &HT;    Their son, Eric, was born in 1969. At first, John and Willie
followed the advice of the ``nouveau parenting experts'' they
despise these days. But their son's rambunctiousness and Willie's
second pregnancy (Amy, their second child, is now 26) combined to
make them reconsider. ``Eric's behaviors were going to destroy our
relationship,'' Willie recalls.
 &HT;    The Rosemonds came to understand that Eric needed discipline of
the old-fashioned kind, and the conversion began.
 &HT;    (``This is Eric,'' Rosemond says, introducing me to his son.
``His career,'' Eric adds, laughing.)
 &HT;    As Rosemond's attitudes toward child rearing solidified, his
politics turned toward the right. These days he cannot abide
no-fault divorce; homosexual parenting; Selma Fraiberg's ``The
Magic Years''; sex-education programs; Thomas Gordon's Parent
Effectiveness Training program; homework planners (``a source of
codependency'' between the overinvolved parent and the
irresponsible child); single parenthood by choice; the inclusion of
spanking in definitions of child abuse; TV; and Hillary Clinton and
Marian Wright Edelman (``ultraliberals, leftists, socialists'').
 &HT;    The Rosemonds' home in Gastonia is Country Living perfect _
sampler pillows, stenciled walls, racks and racks of pipes, George
Washington hanging over the fireplace. But when Eric and his wife,
Nancy, walk in with their two little boys, ready for a lovefest
with Grandpa, it takes on the aura of a stage set. The afternoon
feels rehearsed, and everyone in the cast _ including me _ knows
his or her part.
 &HT;    Eric (``I don't read the books, I don't read the articles'') is
there to scoff at Dad. ``So, do you think he seems harsh, like not
a fun person?'' he asks me right off, laughing. ``Well, I tell
people he can dole out punishment with a smile on his face.''
 &HT;    Nancy casually but firmly minds the children, while Willie
soothes any queasiness Rosemond's beliefs about women might
engender. Rosemond is the well-rehearsed pro.
 &HT;    Here he is, in nutshell version.
 &HT;    _ Parents should stop worrying about developing self-esteem in
their children. If held accountable for their behavior and allowed
to experience hardship and frustration, children will develop
self-esteem on their own. Mothers, in particular, he says, are
guilty of rushing in the minute the child begins feeling unhappy or
distressed.
 &HT;    ``If there are two words that underlie self-esteem,'' Rosemond
says, ``they are 'I can.' Well, I was in a school recently. I
walked into the boys' bathroom. Above the mirror, there was this
sign that said, 'You are now looking at the most special person in
the whole world.' This isn't self-esteem. This is narcissism.
Today's child justifies anything. Bill Clinton is a prime example.
He grew up with a single mother who told him his excrement didn't
stink.''
 &HT;    _ Spanking is fine, if done swiftly, occasionally, privately, in
anger but not in rage, with the hand, on the rear.
 &HT;    _ Attention Deficit Disorder is not genetic _ as much as parents
(who don't want to think it's their fault) and professionals (who
want to continue treatment forever) want it to be.
 &HT;    ``Every 2-year-old has ADD, because the left temporal lobe is
not sufficiently developed,'' Rosemond claims. Parents who pay
attention to their children's proper brain development _ by
shielding them from electronic media, making them focus on adult
authority figures and expecting them to finish tasks _ cause this
innate ADD to disappear.
 &HT;    _ Toilet training should occur by the age of 2; otherwise, a
child will become a spoiled brat. Here's how it's done, on the
now-famous three-to-five-day plan: ``You take their clothes off.
You put the potty where they can see it. When they have an accident
they scream, because they hate it running down their legs. Every
time you hear them screaming you put them on the potty.'' Carpet
cleaning is the final step.
 &HT;    _ Chores are essential. By their teens, children should be doing
all kitchen cleanup, most of the housework and the lion's share of
the laundry.
 &HT;    _ All disobedience, no matter how small the infraction and even
if followed by an apology, must be punished. The punishment should
be unpleasant, memorable and inflicted at a time that is convenient

 &HT;    Rosemond talks like this until dusk, indefatigable, cool, even
when I ask if it might be easier to get his point of view across if
he separated it from his religion (``nondenominational
Jewish-Christian,'' by his description) and his politics: ``People

 &HT;    I didn't know then that Rosemond has his eye on a possible run
for the House of Representatives, but the information wouldn't have
mattered; my role in our stage play does not include a debate about
who politicized the family, how Clinton and Edelman came to be
linked at the hip or why he's polarizing the debate.
 &HT;    It is very easy to find people willing to take on Rosemond.
According to the executive director of the North Carolina
Psychology Board, Martha N. Storie, the board investigated a
complaint brought against Rosemond in November 1987. After an
informal hearing early the next year, a reprimand was issued.
 &HT;    In September 1995, after the board received another complaint,
Rosemond voluntarily entered into a consent order, which stipulated
that a state supervisor review his columns prior to publication.
 &HT;    (Rosemond, who first told me of these incidents, says the first
complaint referred to a column in which he said there was no
evidence that putting a very young child into therapy was efficient
either in time or money; the second complaint was a response to his
advice to the family of an 18-month-old who had been sexually
abused. He told them to forgo therapy for her, since she would
never remember the incident anyway. His descriptions of the
columns, which he stands by to this day, are generally accurate.
They have been excised from the archives on his Web site.)
 &HT;    Much more recently, Grace Reef, director of intergovernmental
relations for the Children's Defense Fund, told me that Edelman has
never worked on any legislation to make spanking illegal, as
Rosemond claims, and that the CDF knows nothing about any program
that would mandate a visit to every new mother to assess her
ability to mother, as Rosemond inveighs against.
 &HT;    I'm sure I also could have found sociologists more than willing
to label his thinking on women sexist. (``Women don't want men to
be more involved, they just want them to be more at their beck and
call.'') But it seemed too easy.
 &HT;    Besides, writing Rosemond off might suggest I don't recognize
anything of my family in the ones he criticizes. I do, and have to
admit that my husband and I have recently made subtle
Rosemond-inspired shifts in our child rearing. Now when we say,
``This is our car, and we are listening to 'All Things
Considered''' _ that ultimate line in the sand _ we mean it. Our
kids, age 10 and 13, look at each other, roll their eyes and
mutter, ``Brainwashed in Kansas.''
 &HT;    The people who adhere to Rosemond's philosophy would laugh at
that _ for more than the obvious reason of our general wussiness.
Their families had once been out of control, their children more
headache than pleasure, but that's history.
 &HT;    As Amanda Riley, a mother of two from Danbury, Conn., tells me,
hearing Rosemond speak three years ago ``rocked'' her world, though
the change in parenting style was not easy at first. ``My daughter
did not get that there were consequences for bad behavior,'' Riley
recalls. ``Since then, I haven't tried anything from Rosemond that
hasn't worked. He's kind of like a religion to me. What he says is
gospel.''
 &HT;    Rosemond often asserts that all parenting advice can be broken
down into a series of aphorisms. ``I'm going to give you enough
rope to hang yourself.'' ``You paddle your own canoe.'' ``You can't
get something for nothing.''
 &HT;    But what, I wonder, about that other maxim: ``Don't hold a
grudge''?
 &HT;    And that's what troubles me most about Rosemond. I respond to
some of what he says, but not to how he says it. ``Gotcha!'' he
seems to bellow, delighting in every punishment doled out. And
while research has shown that children turn out best in families in
which parental demands are enforced, that is true only if the
punishment is not punitive. Loosey-goosey parenting may not work,
but neither does ``seeing and not hearing'' children.
 &HT;    Besides, where does the fun in rearing children get factored in?
Where is the acknowledgment that complexity is not necessarily bad?
Where is the intellectual adventure that comes from helping kids
learn to discriminate between legitimate and bogus authority?
 &HT;    My time with Rosemond has helped me develop a theory. I call it,
in homage to the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild's ``second
shift'' (the work a woman does after returning home from her paid
job), ``the third shift.'' But unlike Hochschild's work of
scholarship, my theory is based on that grand journalistic
standard: myself and a couple of friends.
 &HT;    Somewhere along the line, my female friends and I took on,
unasked, a ``third shift'' _ the job of family-happiness manager,
juggling not only lessons and games and school events and nights
out with adult friends, but everyone's emotional well-being,
articulated or not. This is a thankless and exhausting task,
particularly if it includes eradicating frustration and boredom
from children's lives while simultaneously making sure they feel
good about themselves.
 &HT;    I accepted this work, without thinking much about its
consequences, until I met Rosemond. And then it came to me like a
nightmare. He might worry I was turning my children into the Bill
Clintons of tomorrow. But I had another concern: What if I was
rearing them to be Monica Lewinskys _ young adults who don't want
jobs where hard work is expected, who turn petulant when they don't
get what they want, even when what they're looking for is their own
happiness.
 &HT;    That realization _ that your kids can't grow up unless you let
them do it for themselves _ is what I'll take away from this
Rosemondian adventure. Or, as the man says, ``You can't get
something for nothing.''

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, Feb. 24:
</P>
<P>
   NY-HOTEL-BARS (New York) _ New York City is filled with
unappreciated treasures. But in the world of food and drink none
are so neglected as hotel bars. They have been here for ages,
planted like pillars around the city. Many are elegantly decorated,
like miniatures of the grand hotels that engulf them. And perhaps
it is for that reason that New Yorkers seem to overlook them. But
beyond the barrier of the hotel lobbies lie some of the city's most
secluded oases, where you can relax over a well-mixed drink, be
treated like a king or simply be as anonymous as the bars
themselves. By Amanda Hesser.

</P>
<P>
   ERITREAN-RESTAURANT (New Haven, Conn.) _ It's been a long time
since a restaurant has surprised me as much as Caffe Adulis, a
charming little place a long block from the Yale campus. I guess
you would call it an ethnic restaurant, because it specializes in
Eritrean food. Both the decor and the food were pleasant surprises.
It made amends for a lot of culinary nightmares I had during my
year as a correspondent in Africa. By R.W. Apple Jr.

<P>
   NY-CHILI (New York) _ Jane and Michael Stern were skeptical.
``Finding great chili in New York is like finding great pastrami in
Des Moines,'' he said warningly. Nonetheless, the Sterns have
agreed to eat chili at three different places to see if any can
equal the ones included in their latest book, ``Chili Nation: The
Ultimate Chili Cookbook With Recipes From Every State in the

WILLA'S WORLD (WHY KIDS TALK TO IMAGINARY FRIENDS)
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURA HILGERS 
 c.1999 Child 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday, August 21: Our daughter, Willa, began talking to herself
when she was 1. She would sit in her crib, before falling asleep or
just after awakening, and practice new words. ``Mine. Bear. Mine.
Bear,'' she would say, trying the words on for size.
</P>
<P>
   Now 4 1/2, Willa still talks to herself, before falling asleep
at night and during her (so-called) quiet time. She talks nonstop.
She sings. She invites pretend friends over. She re-creates fairy
tales. She takes the events of her day and turns them into
something her 4-year-old mind finds easier to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is delightfully odd, occasionally alarming, often
reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, August 26: Today, during quiet time, Willa and an
imaginary friend are ``babysitting'' an infant. No surprise: My
sister gave birth to a girl 17 days ago, and Willa and her
2-year-old brother, Devin, have spoken of little else. ``We're
babysitters, and we're taking care of a little girl,'' Willa
announces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, her old babysitter died,'' replies her friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got really sick, and she died,'' Willa confirms.
</P>
<P>
   Then her friend says to Willa, ``My mommy died.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to one-up her, Willa replies, ``My daddy died. It was a
long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   As Willa launches into talk of angels, I worry outside her door
that she either harbors murderous thoughts toward our babysitter or
would like to knock off both of her parents. Then I remember that
we recently saw ``Madeline,'' a movie that left Willa perplexed.
``Where were Madeline's parents?'' Willa has been asking me. ``Why
did they die?''
</P>
<P>
   After quiet time, I talk with Willa about death and tell her
that, even though everyone dies eventually, she doesn't need to
worry now: Mommy and Daddy are going to live a long time so we can
take care of her. As I say this, I cross my fingers and pray that
guardian angels, of which Willa is so enamored, really do exist.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, August 27: Willa, who is about as strong-willed a
child as you're likely to meet, does not take very kindly to
discipline. At every attempt, she fights me like an ornery bull. So
I am stunned when, on occasion, she repeats my rules, nearly
verbatim, to her stuffed animals_as if they were reasonable after
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to set the timer, and if you're not quiet in 10
minutes, you are all going straight to the barnyard,'' Willa tells
a lineup of dolls today. ``One, two, three...'' she says, counting
to 10. ``OK, everybody back in the barnyard,'' she says, sighing
like a veteran mom. ``Except you, Raggedy Ann.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, August 31: Today was Willa's first day of
prekindergarten, and we made a huge fuss about it. This emboldened
Willa to consider staying at school for a nap, as some of her
classmates planned to do. ``Could I please stay?'' she begged us.
When we told her no, perhaps another day, Willa took the matter
into her own hands. Now, during quiet time at home, Willa has
transformed her room into a classroom. But she's not a kid; she's
the teacher. ``Guys? What are you doing?'' Willa demands of her
pupils, Max, Patrick, Melissa, Lucy and LaKeisha, a seedy
assortment of dogs and dolls. ``Stop! What are you doing? Are you
listening to the teacher?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of you has to go to sleep. If you say that you're
not going to sleep, then you are not going to be allowed to play
outside,'' she says, then pauses for a moment. ``OK, goodnight,
boys and girls. I hope you all have a good sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   I am amused by Willa's insistence on playing the teacher_or,
more often, the mom_but I also feel a pang. Last year, Willa never
napped at school because she was afraid to. When I hear her, I
think, yes, this is a good way to tackle fears, by playing out what
it would be like to nap at school.
</P>
<P>
   But then the mom in me takes over, it pains me that she is
afraid of anything, and I want to rush in, wrap my arms around her
and make everything OK. I stop myself. She'll need these skills to
navigate the sometimes scary terrain of life.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Sept. 3: Willa has invited her Barbie, a frequent
guest, to quiet time today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to make a Lego bridge,'' Willa tells Barbie.
``Actually, it's going to be a dock. It's going to be the longest
dock ever, ever built. No one's ever seen one as long as this.''
</P>
<P>
   On seeing the finished result, Barbie is quick to agree.
``Thatt's a h-u-g-e dock, Willa,'' she marvels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Barble,'' Willa replies. ``I'm very good at building
stuff.'' As Barbie heads down the dock, however, Willa warns her,
``Watch out. There are crabs down there!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's pretend there aren't crabs,'' Barbie suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. Watch out!'' Willa revises, ``There are all toys down
there!''
</P>
<P>
   Of everything I've heard so far, I enjoy this conversation the
most. It makes me feel as though, amid the chaos and frustration of
raising children, we're doing something right. We've told Willa
that she's good at making things; that she'd be a good architect
(the word means nothing to her) because she's good at drawing.
We've even held her hand when, to her delight and horror, she
caught two crabs with a makeshift fishing pole this summer.
</P>
<P>
   As I listen outside her door, I delight in the way Willas mind
rearranges the pieces of her fife into something more interesting.
From the mundane she creates something magical.
</P>
<P>
   But I also feel wistful. I know my eavesdropping days are
numbered. In a few short months, Willa will no longer have her
quiet time. Even now, I can hardly keep her in her room at night.
</P>
<P>
   And as she grows older, her thoughts will retreat to her mind, a
place I can only hope she'll want to share.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it may just be time to switch channels. As Willa
ventures from her room, her little brother is sitting on his bed
next door, practicing words. ``Devin, like it. Devin, like it,''
he's saying, trying the sentence on for size. It's music to my
ears.

   Like many Americans, Andy Amundsen bought his Christmas presents
this year with his MasterCard _ he likes to rack up the bonus
frequent flyer miles.
</P>
<P>
   A responsible card user, Amundsen does not buy more than he can
afford and keeps track of what he's spending. When the bill comes
in, he matches his receipts to his statement and writes a check for
the full amount. To his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Amundsen, 16, and a high school junior, is one of many college
and high school students rapidly joining the legions of
plastic-carriers. It's a trend that can give them a good lesson in
money management and a jump on a good credit history, or plunge
them into a serious world of debt. It all hinges on how well they
manage the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Teenage Research Unlimited survey, 39 percent of
America's 18 and 19-year-olds have credit cards in their own names,
and 10 percent have access to a parent's card. And a recent study
by Phoenix Home Life Insurance showed that 60 percent of college
students have a credit card, but 20 percent of those surveyed can't
define the term ``buying on credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Before signing a contract for a credit card - or taking a card
on their parent's account - young people should know all the facts
about credit, said Paul Lauterjung of Financial Freedom, a
Petaluma, Calif., money management agency that helps people conquer
the basics of cash flow, set up a livable budget and pay off debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we've worked in the high schools and asked for a show of
hands of those with credit cards, about a third of the kids raised
their hands. And of those, some of them had up to three cards,''
Lauterjung said.
</P>
<P>
   Teens are perfect card-company targets, because they're good
consumers, and they want to be independent of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the 25.2 million Americans aged 13 to 19 spent $96.3
billion, according to the Rand Youth Poll, which anticipates at
least 4 percent annual growth in teen spending in the years ahead.
Because of the abundance of after-school jobs and increasingly
generous allowances, teens have plenty of money to spend. In 1997,
older teens, aged 16-19, had an average income of just over $5,100
a year, according to Rand research. And credit card companies have
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit card issuers are reaching them in high school at the
sophomore and junior level,'' Lauterjung said.
</P>
<P>
   Two main dangers put teens at risk with credit, he said. These
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Overextending themselves by buying more than they can pay
back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting into the ``minimum payment syndrome,'' where card
users pay only $5 or $10 a month, which just covers the finance
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things don't help kids to plan ahead, and they lead to
impulse buying,'' he said. ``It's very easy to get things on credit
that you can't afford.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, there are benefits to teens using
credit cards properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they track where they spend and use credit responsibly,
they'll be more in control of their money, instead of the other way
around,'' Lauterjung said. ``If it increases their money awareness,
that in itself will lead to better decisions down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Amundsen has had his own card on his dad's MasterCard account
for a little over a year. He's allowed to use it at his
convenience, as long as he pays his full balance each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it for as much as I possibly can,'' said Amundsen, who
has worked at a copy center for four hours a day, three days a week
since the eighth grade. ``I pay for everything with it. Christmas
presents, gas, food, errands for my parents - basically whenever I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule has always been, if he wants to use the card, he has to
pay the balance. It's not an option to put it off until the next
month and pay the finance charge. When the bill comes, he matches
his receipts with the bill and pays his parents with a check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never thought of our credit limit as a chunk of change
that I can go out and blow,'' he said. ``My parents have taught me
a lot about finances. Some of it I became interested in and learned
more about on my own, like CDs and the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as long as I can remember my parents have paid the entire
balance for their cards each month. It has definitely helped me see
this as the only way to use a credit card. Besides, why would you
want to pay $40 for a pizza that cost $20? That's an exaggeration,
but it will happen sooner or later if you don't pay your balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Amundsen has considered getting his own card to establish a
credit history, but he's found that many require a minimum income
level of $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Zakk Murphy, an 18-year-old high school senior in Sonoma County,
Calif., applied for and received credit cards for Target and
Mervyn's stores shortly before he turned 18. He said he got the
cards so he wouldn't have to wait for pay day from his job to buy
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have money from your paycheck when you get paid every
month, or whatever. So it's easier if you don't have cash, but
you've got the card right there, you can still get what you need,''
he said. ``And you also get discounts for having the card, like 10
percent or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he mostly buys clothes on his accounts, and he pays
the minimum payment amount for the cards each month. ``I've been on
top of it. When I get my checks from work, I divide out what I owe
and pay the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he learned money management on his own - it wasn't
something his family taught him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are learning a lot in economics class,'' he said. ``Since
it's senior year, we're getting some more mature,
stepping-into-life stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hast teaches a high school economics course in Petaluma,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely cover good debt and bad debt, which applies to
credit cards,'' he said. ``Good debt would be something that would
accrue you benefits in the future; bad debt is consumable items,
items that don't retain value, that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't think teens are ready for credit cards,''
he said. ``But they should remember that credit cards are only good
if you follow the guidelines for good credit. Get the low-interest
rate, don't have too many cards, and pay your bills off every
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Hast said, don't assume that all cards are the same: ``You
can obtain a Visa card from anywhere from 9.5 to 24 percent ...
It's easy to pick the brochures up, just shop around for a while
before you fill out the application.''

DISGRUNTLED PASSENGERS SUE AMERICAN PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Six American Airlines passengers are suing the
carrier's pilots over flights that were delayed or canceled during
a recent labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on behalf of six Illinois residents whose flights from
Chicago to San Francisco were delayed or canceled Feb. 10, San
Francisco lawyer Patrick Catalano filed a complaint in San
Francisco Superior Court Feb. 18. In it he asks that the lawsuit be
declared a class action so that perhaps thousands of plaintiffs may
join the original six in seeking damages.
</P>
<P>
   Catalano said that while he believed it would be difficult for
individual passengers to prove they had suffered significant
damages, he believed they could collectively describe delay-related
emotional distress and inconvenience that was allegedly a result of
pilots' disobeying a federal court judge's order to end a
``sick-out.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots began returning to work over the Presidents Day
weekend after calling in sick to protest the recent acquisition of
Reno Air by the AMR Corp., the parent of American. The disgruntled
pilots fear the acquisition of the discount carrier will allow
American to parcel out more flights to the lower-paid Reno pilots.
</P>
<P>
   If the San Francisco lawsuit is declared a class action, damages
per person would be limited to $200, Catalano said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300,000 to 400,000 American passengers were inconvenienced
during the labor action. On Feb. 10, the same day the
Chicago-to-San Francisco flights were delayed, U.S. District Court
Judge Joe Kendall in Dallas ordered the pilots back to work. Three
days later, he cited the union, the Allied Pilots Association, in
contempt and fined it $10 million for ignoring the order.
</P>
<P>
   The inconvenience continued for several days after Kendall
issued his order as pilots did not promptly return to work.
</P>
<P>
   The six Illinois residents went to Catalano when they arrived in
San Francisco, on separate American flights, to attend a business
meeting. Their delays were from six hours to three days, Catalano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Pilots Association spokesman Drew Engelke said from the
union's offices in Fort Worth, Texas, that the lawsuit was without
merit.

COLLEGE APPROVES POLICY ON MINORITY-ONLY HIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ A decision by Union College to restrict its
next four faculty hires to minority candidates and loosen the purse
strings to pay them has angered some professors and prompted a
debate over affirmative action on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated from years of losing qualified minority professors to
other schools, the Union faculty voted last March to exclude
candidates who were not black or Hispanic from the searches.
</P>
<P>
   The latest faculty member to be hired under the policy, Daniel
Mosquera, was named last week as assistant professor of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``targeted hiring,'' the policy was approved by a
two-thirds vote of the faculty, but a vocal minority warned of
unseen political and legal ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it objectionable because a targeted search excludes
people solely because of their racial background,'' said Terry
Weiner, chairman of the political science department. ``You
automatically cut off 90 percent of your talent pool. I think it
casts a shadow over the moral legitimacy of the hiring practices of
the college.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Hull, the president of the college, said the move was
necessary because Union ``hadn't produced results the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to their limited number, many African-American and Hispanic
professors enjoy a status equivalent to free agents in baseball.
Universities engage in bidding wars and professors change jobs and
advance at a rapid clip.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is especially difficult for smaller schools like
Union, an independent college of 2,300 students and about 190
faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   Until last spring's vote, Union administrators were not allowed
to pay new hires above a scale based on experience. As a result,
minority candidates often were lost to colleges like Oberlin in
Ohio and Swarthmore in Pennsylvania that outbid Union. Hull
remembers one finalist who went to Amherst College in Massachusetts
attracted by a salary five times what Union offered.
</P>
<P>
   Union is among only a handful of institutions in the country to
use targeted hiring to increase diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My congratulations to Union College,'' said Robert Atwell,
president of the American Council on Education from 1984 until 1996
and now a educational consultant living in California. ``It's quite
unusual. I think it's a bold and courageous thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It is even more remarkable at a time when states like
California, Texas and Washington have ended hiring preferences in
public higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the need for minority faculty justifies the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to educate students to have a proper view of
the constituency of this country and redress the effects of racism,
we have to do this,'' said Christina Sorum, the dean of arts and
sciences at Union. ``It is very important for white students to
have minority faculty they can respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Some professors wanted to place an advertisement emphasizing
equal opportunity even though the search was limited to minorities,
according to Brad Lewis, associate dean for undergraduate
education. But Lewis said it was important for the school to admit
the search was not open to all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to see a phony search that looked like equal
opportunity,'' he said. ``If you're not looking at all quality
candidates, and are only looking at qualified minority candidates,
you shouldn't fudge it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the opponents to targeted searches were several Jewish
professors, who were painfully aware that until the 1960s, many
schools _ Union included _ had quotas for Jewish faculty and
students.
</P>
<P>
   This historical outlook made them ``sensitive to a radical
interpretation of affirmative action,'' said Weiner, who is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner said he supports diversifying the faculty but fears that
targeted hiring could lead to ``all kinds of silly distinctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner said the school also could face lawsuits over the policy
if well-qualified white candidates are discarded during a targeted
search.

   LOS ANGELES _ Comic books have always played out the fantasies
of young men, so it should come as no surprise that their male
characters are almost always single and open to playing the field.
Mickey never wed Minnie ``and never will,'' according to a Disney
representative. It took 60 years for Superman to marry Lois Lane,
after which a plot line was promptly introduced where the Man of
Steel split into two separate people. Was the timing coincidental?

   We can only hope better things are in store for Popeye and Olive
Oyl, who tie the knot in a comic released by Ocean Comics this

decades-long gal, ``I yam what I yam,'' and has only a cigar band
to give her as a ring. He doesn't even take the corncob pipe from
his mouth when he kisses the bride. Ewwww!

AN OSCAR FOR A PARI OF AVID INNOVATORS

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEWKSBURY, Mass. _ Tom Ohanian and Michael Phillips are days
away from receiving an Oscar for technological achievement, one of
the pinnacles of their careers. Yet here they sit, in a dark room
whirring with computers, trying to make sense of Scene 43 in an
indie film called ``Dweller in the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   It's basic horror-film stuff, and Phillips and Ohanian have
taken on the job of making several messy shots meld together in one
coherent, hopefully terrifying, scene. But as it stands now,
according to both men, it ain't melding.
</P>
<P>
   Ohanian's skill as a film editor will help make order of things,
and Phillips will use his talents as a director to fine-tune. But
the real help will come from Avid Film Composer, a souped-up
$80,000 bundle of hardware and software that both men helped
develop for their employer, Avid Technology of Tewksbury. Film
Composer is a digital film-editing system that starting in 1992
quickly began replacing the bulky flatbed, the traditional
film-editing machine used over the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's this computer and what it's done for film and television
that helped garner Avid, Ohanian, and Phillips their Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the company won a scientific and engineering award from
the Academy for Film Composer, a bronze tablet that denotes any
achievement that ``had a definite influence on the advancement of
the film industry,'' according to the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, while dozens of other technological innovators
receive certificates and similar tablets, Avid will be the only
recipient of the coveted gold statue, a hard-won and carefully
orchestrated Hollywood nod acknowledging that Avid's technology has
arrived and that editing film will never be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Ohanian and Phillips, two film guys with no
computer background, got together with Avid's engineers to help
create Film Composer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we were driving oxcarts for years and this guy comes
by and says, `Here's a Jaguar. Do you think you'd like it?' '' said
Joe Hutshing, an Oscar-winning film editor who last edited ``Meet
Joe Black'' and who is currently editing ``Being John Malkovich''
on an Avid system.
</P>
<P>
   The system allows film to be digitized, edited, and manipulated
on a high-end computer system at 24 frames per second, then
transferred back to film without a breakdown in quality or timing.
</P>
<P>
   Although many other companies make similar systems, Avid's
success in filmmaking and television is in its numbers. An
estimated 85 percent of the prime-time television shows are edited
on Avids, 70 of the 114 films at this year's Sundance Film Festival
were edited on Avids, and 10 films nominated for Oscars this year
were edited using an Avid product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very similar to what happened when somebody invented the
word processor,'' Hutshings added. ``You might have had a great IBM
Selectric, but after the word processor came along, who cares.''
</P>
<P>
   On a flatbed, when a director or film editor wanted a scene to
dissolve into black, the editor would first have to lug that reel
of film to the machine. Such reels, which hold about 10 minutes of
film, weigh about 4 pounds each. If it wasn't the right reel, there
was more lugging to do, and more linear-based searching, a task
akin to finding a particular scene using the forward and reverse
buttons on a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   After finding the shot he wanted to dissolve, the editor would
take a china marker and run it across 24 frames of film. That, for
all intents and purposes, was the dissolve. A film would then be
sent out to be processed. Until it came back, editors and directors
never really knew what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watched it, you would see this line go through and
you'd say, OK, I think I know what that dissolve would look like,''
said Phillips. ``Slow motion or skipping motions were all leaps of
faith. If you talk to editors, you hear all these horror stories
about how many times they had to go back to the (film) labs because
it just wasn't what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   On a digital editing system, those 10-minute reels fit on
portable hard drives. If you want a dissolve, you see it right
there and then. Slower? No problem. Click a button. Done.
</P>
<P>
   If someone muffs the pronunciation of a word, an editor can
search the entire movie, find the same word, and transfer it to
that scene. No need to fly an actor back to dub the soundtrack. No
need to reshoot anything.
</P>
<P>
   In one demonstration, Ohanian and Phillips had a copy of the
screenplay for ``Mouse Hunt'' on one monitor and a scene from the
movie on another. Phillips clicked on a scene on the screenplay
monitor, and it appeared on the second monitor instantaneously. On
a flatbed, this would have taken several minutes, maybe a half
hour. On an Avid, it took less than a second.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene from the same movie in which a mouse runs across a
floor packed with mousetraps, the director wanted to fill one gap
with another trap. Using an Avid, editors cloned one of the traps
in the scene, turned it sideways, and digitally moved it into the
open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the technology became available for the first time,
editors saw it from a very creative side. They said, `Give me the
same eight months to edit a feature on this and I can explore it 25
times more ways than I ever could on film,' '' said Phillips.
``There is never a reason for saying `why not' anymore. You just do
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   After the changes are made on an Avid, the computer system then
prints out a precise ``cut list'' of all the editor's desired
special effects and manipulations. Those instructions are sent to a
film house, which will make the changes happen on celluloid,
something that computers have yet to replace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negative cutters will be around for a long time,'' Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Avid's technology allows filmmakers to experiment with
editing techniques, some say it has also accelerated the pace of
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   From the time the film ``Lethal Weapon 4'' shot its first scene
to the time it opened in theaters, a scant seven months passed. It
was a Hollywood record. But with hundreds of millions of dollars in
loans hanging over the production, mega-actors facing mega-demands
for their time, and studios clamoring to save money, seven months
was a godsend. It wouldn't have been possible without a digital
film-editing system.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the postproduction time is shrinking,'' said Ohanian,
``because if you're floating $100 million out on a loan, it's big
money here, and you can make a lot more money in terms of getting
that product into the theater faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohanian and Phillips are far from Hollywood types _ two men who
prefer to be behind the scenes rather than out front.
</P>
<P>
   Ohanian is a 38-year-old Rhode Island native who became
fascinated with film after his father gave him a Super 8 camera.
Although he started college as a dentistry major, he quickly
changed his mind. ``The moment I put two pieces of film together
and faked somebody out, I wanted to be an editor,'' he said. When
he came to Avid 10 years ago, he was the fledgling company's eighth
hire.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 38, was raised in France and schooled in Montana,
where he taught himself classical guitar and became interested in
studying music for film. After making a movie for some music he had
written, and creating rolling titles on a class project using slide
projectors and a roll of butcher paper, he was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, being a control freak, I thought, if I can do
the music and the movie, I can do it all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two came together when Phillips took an Avid class and saw
an early prototype of the system. When he realized this newfangled
system was similar to straight-cut editing on a flatbed, he spoke
up. Phillips told the instructor that what Avid was doing on the
computer was no different from what he and other directors were
doing on traditional film-editing equipment. ``I wasn't overly
impressed,'' he said, telling the instructor that the system
wouldn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Well, how should it work?' I said, `Hire me and
I'll tell you.' And I've been here ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Their work is now focused on bringing this expensive technology
to independent films, where time and money are of the essence.
Ohanian and Phillips said that such filmmakers can save $100,000
using a digital film-editing system, making up for lost time,
reshoots, and the cost of processing film. Which is why they're
helping out with ``Dweller in the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the system, Ohanian puts Scene 43 in some order, and the
story begins to show.
</P>
<P>
   A girl clad in a towel stands transfixed by a boarded-up window,
and a monster's hand reaches through, grabs her head, and drags her
into the blackness. A guy comes into the room and screams; more
people come into the room, scream, and run to the window.
</P>
<P>
   Then Phillips and the computer take over, tightening cuts,
fixing a continuity problem in which the monster's hand is on the
girl's head and then later on her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, after they've experimented with some of Film
Composer's many special effects, a scream is moved under another
scene, the monster's hand looks almost real thanks to a timing
delay, and the scene's movement is suddenly fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times artists won't think of paths to go down because
they know the technology is too hard to use or the technology
doesn't allow them to do it,'' said Ohanian. ``Here, you can do
that stuff. And what we're doing here has taken less than five
minutes.''

   It is hard to imagine Jordan without King Hussein _ or so runs
the old saw. He has dominated the country for 46 years, first as
authoritarian ruler, more recently as a hands-on constitutional
monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of ten of his subjects were born during his reign. He
is the one symbol that all Jordanians, rich and poor, secular and
religious, Palestinian refugees and indigenous citizens, have in
common.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jordan will lose its king, and probably sooner rather than
later. King Hussein himself implied as much by coming home for a
few days to attend to the succession, before unexpectedly rushing
back to America this week for more medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Only 63, he could now be facing a fourth bout of cancer, and the
choice of an heir is clearly on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Hassan, had served loyally as crown prince since
1964, when the king's oldest son, Abdullah, was still a baby. But
King Hussein had long made it clear that he would like the crown
eventually to pass to one of his children.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, in unnecessarily humiliating fashion, the king
demoted Hassan and elevated Abdullah as heir by royal decree.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the problem: as with every detail of his reign,
King Hussein managed the change personally. Although Jordan is
theoretically a constitutional monarchy, neither the Jordanian
people, nor their representatives in parliament, had any say over
the selection of their future king.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution does state that the king's eldest son will
succeed him. But King Hussein had had it altered in favor of Hassan
before, and many thought he might fix it again to install one of
his younger sons.
</P>
<P>
   At no point, apparently, did King Hussein consult anyone. As
always, he knew best.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, King Hussein often does know best. His stewardship
has seen Jordan develop from an artificial, divided and fragile
polity into a reasonably stable, united and well-governed country.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the despots of neighboring Arab countries, King
Hussein is a model of benign and competent rule.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, too, shows every sign of benevolence and ability,
albeit in his rather sheltered career in the army. But Jordan's
luck cannot last forever. Good rulers, history shows, do not grow
on family trees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of agonizing over which of Jordan's many princes should
succeed him, King Hussein should be making sure that the country's
institutions are strong enough to make the choice irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the king has concentrated power in his own hands.
Although he introduced some democracy in 1989 after decades of
martial law, he has taken care to rein in debate and preserve his
ultimate authority.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a weighted electoral law, parliament is dominated by
tribal elders fiercely loyal to the king. The main opposition party
boycotted the last elections in protest, and so has been excluded
from political debate.
</P>
<P>
   The press, too, has been brought to heel by a law that forbids,
in effect, any criticism of the king or his strategy of alliance
with America and peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Before the king's illness, Jordan's unions and professional
associations, which are among the few remaining bastions of
independent political power, had also been under attack.
</P>
<P>
   And one reason for the humbling of poor Prince Hassan was that,
while acting as regent, he had tried to make some military
appointments without consulting the controller-in-chief on his
sickbed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps King Hussein believes that by bequeathing a blend of
strong royal rule and limited democracy he will increase his
dynasty's chances of survival. But he himself has had trouble
imposing this system in the face of public protest, and the chances
that any successor would handle dissent as adroitly are slim.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for Jordan's monarchy, and the best future for its
people, lies in the king gradually handing over most of his powers
to parliament.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein should spend whatever remains of his reign making
himself dispensable. Otherwise, the old axiom notwithstanding, it
is not so hard to imagine what will become of his heirs. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Turks are cock-a-hoop. The man who for nearly 15 years has
orchestrated a bloody revolt in the country's Kurdish southeast has
been snatched abroad _ in Kenya _ and whisked back to Turkey to
face charges of fomenting murder and mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Turkey's politicians and to read its press, you
would think that, with Abdullah Ocalan behind bars, the civil war,
which has cost more than 30,000 lives, is all but over; that the
Kurds have been definitively squashed; and that successive Turkish
governments' misguided policy of denying the Kurds the right to
express, however peacefully, a desire for some kind of
self-government has been wondrously vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, any of it. A lasting peace can be forged only if the
Kurds, especially but not only in Turkey, are given the fair deal
that has so far been denied them.
</P>
<P>
   In its moment of seeming triumph, the Turkish government would
be wise to offer just such a deal. Then Turks and Kurds alike could
look forward to a better future.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's capture certainly provides an opportunity for the
reassessment on both sides that is needed before any settlement
becomes imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, it is true, the events of the past few days give
little evidence that a spirit of reason or compromise can be
applied to what is certainly a complex issue _ one, indeed, that
has plunged the Greek government into crisis, after allegations
that some of its ministers had colluded in Ocalan's entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   But, emotional and confusing as the kidnapping has been, it
might just possibly prove to be a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 million or so Kurds are perhaps the world's biggest
stateless nation. They find themselves scattered across four
countries _ Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria _ none of which is noted
for polished human rights or fair treatment of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds are unlikely to feel contented in any of these
countries, even if their governments became models of moderation,
without a generous measure of autonomy in the regions in which they
predominate. That needs to be understood by those who now resist
the Kurdish call for self-government.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, however, the Kurds need to recognize that there
is no political room in the Middle East, at present or in the
foreseeable future, for an independent state of Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   For Kurdish nationalists, the Ocalan episode may have brought
home that uncomfortable reality. It has shown the Kurdistan
Workers' Party, better known by its Kurdish initials, PKK, how
short it is of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even Greece, Turkey's eternal antagonist, wanted to
give Ocalan a haven. Turkey's army has been containing the Kurdish
rebellion in southeastern Turkey, where most of the country's 15
million or so Kurds live.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year or two, the rate of killing has subsided.
Emergency rule in several provinces has been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In a wider context the balance of power has shifted in Turkey's
favor, too. The United States still sees Turkey as a vital ally in
its campaign to strangle Saddam Hussein's Iraq. And, by cozying up
to Israel, Turkey has been able to squeeze Syria _ which is partly
why, last autumn, Ocalan, who had long been based in Syria, was
forced to seek exile elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   All this meant that, even before the snatching of their leader,
Turkey's Kurds were having to rethink their aims and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Some sign of that came in the more conciliatory tune that Ocalan
had begun to sing. It had not, however, beguiled everyone: Ocalan
has a brutal, capricious and autocratic record, even within his own
movement.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest robs the PKK of a charismatic strategist, but at
least it may allow the group to refashion itself in a more
civilized, democratic and peaceful guise _ and to renounce violent
secession as a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Why, though, should Turkey, boosted recently in the battlefield,
bolstered by allies old and new, and flush with joy at Ocalan's
arrest, now change its policy and consider giving the Kurds the
right of self-expression?
</P>
<P>
   First, because this latest change of fortune may not be
decisive. Many of the remaining guerrillas will hunker down in
their mountain fastnesses; they will not give up, not yet anyway.
They may even turn to terror in Turkish cities farther west, where
millions of Kurds have settled.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, though Turkey's Kurds are by no means always friendly
with their cousins in northern Iraq, the Iraqi minority now has the
core of an autonomous entity there, under the protection of the
same Americans who often seem willing to wink at the repression of
Kurds in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Turkey should realize that it will never achieve its
oft-stated goal of becoming a full member of the European Union
until it shows a greater respect for the rights of its own citizens
and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Turkey will have to change its opposition to
peaceful Kurdish desires for self-expression (such as the ability
to run schools and make broadcasts in Kurdish) if it is ever to
persuade the West that it is a full democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the shortest run, the least Turkey can do is to ensure
that Ocalan is given a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can help. The Kurdish problem has now, de facto, been
internationalized. Taking matters further, the European Union, with
American backing, could offer a forum for Turks and Kurds to seek a
compromise involving Kurdish self-rule in southeastern Turkey, if
that is what the Kurds want.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the Turks will reject such an idea. But the
Kurds will not go away. If they are not to have a state, they
deserve at least a modicum of self-government and justice. &QL;

<P>
   The Turks are cock-a-hoop. The man who for nearly 15 years has
orchestrated a bloody revolt in the country's Kurdish southeast has
been snatched abroad _ in Kenya _ and whisked back to Turkey to
face charges of fomenting murder and mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Turkey's politicians and to read its press, you
would think that, with Abdullah Ocalan behind bars, the civil war,
which has cost more than 30,000 lives, is all but over; that the
Kurds have been definitively squashed; and that successive Turkish
governments' misguided policy of denying the Kurds the right to
express, however peacefully, a desire for some kind of
self-government has been wondrously vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, any of it. A lasting peace can be forged only if the
Kurds, especially but not only in Turkey, are given the fair deal
that has so far been denied them.
</P>
<P>
   In its moment of seeming triumph, the Turkish government would
be wise to offer just such a deal. Then Turks and Kurds alike could
look forward to a better future.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's capture certainly provides an opportunity for the
reassessment on both sides that is needed before any settlement
becomes imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, it is true, the events of the past few days give
little evidence that a spirit of reason or compromise can be
applied to what is certainly a complex issue _ one, indeed, that
has plunged the Greek government into crisis, after allegations
that some of its ministers had colluded in Ocalan's entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   But, emotional and confusing as the kidnapping has been, it
might just possibly prove to be a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 million or so Kurds are perhaps the world's biggest
stateless nation. They find themselves scattered across four
countries _ Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria _ none of which is noted
for polished human rights or fair treatment of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds are unlikely to feel contented in any of these
countries, even if their governments became models of moderation,
without a generous measure of autonomy in the regions in which they
predominate. That needs to be understood by those who now resist
the Kurdish call for self-government.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, however, the Kurds need to recognize that there
is no political room in the Middle East, at present or in the
foreseeable future, for an independent state of Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   For Kurdish nationalists, the Ocalan episode may have brought
home that uncomfortable reality. It has shown the Kurdistan
Workers' Party, better known by its Kurdish initials, PKK, how
short it is of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even Greece, Turkey's eternal antagonist, wanted to
give Ocalan a haven. Turkey's army has been containing the Kurdish
rebellion in southeastern Turkey, where most of the country's 15
million or so Kurds live.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year or two, the rate of killing has subsided.
Emergency rule in several provinces has been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In a wider context the balance of power has shifted in Turkey's
favor, too. The United States still sees Turkey as a vital ally in
its campaign to strangle Saddam Hussein's Iraq. And, by cozying up
to Israel, Turkey has been able to squeeze Syria _ which is partly
why, last autumn, Ocalan, who had long been based in Syria, was
forced to seek exile elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   All this meant that, even before the snatching of their leader,
Turkey's Kurds were having to rethink their aims and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Some sign of that came in the more conciliatory tune that Ocalan
had begun to sing. It had not, however, beguiled everyone: Ocalan
has a brutal, capricious and autocratic record, even within his own
movement.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest robs the PKK of a charismatic strategist, but at
least it may allow the group to refashion itself in a more
civilized, democratic and peaceful guise _ and to renounce violent
secession as a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Why, though, should Turkey, boosted recently in the battlefield,
bolstered by allies old and new, and flush with joy at Ocalan's
arrest, now change its policy and consider giving the Kurds the
right of self-expression?
</P>
<P>
   First, because this latest change of fortune may not be
decisive. Many of the remaining guerrillas will hunker down in
their mountain fastnesses; they will not give up, not yet anyway.
They may even turn to terror in Turkish cities farther west, where
millions of Kurds have settled.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, though Turkey's Kurds are by no means always friendly
with their cousins in northern Iraq, the Iraqi minority now has the
core of an autonomous entity there, under the protection of the
same Americans who often seem willing to wink at the repression of
Kurds in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Turkey should realize that it will never achieve its
oft-stated goal of becoming a full member of the European Union
until it shows a greater respect for the rights of its own citizens
and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Turkey will have to change its opposition to
peaceful Kurdish desires for self-expression (such as the ability
to run schools and make broadcasts in Kurdish) if it is ever to
persuade the West that it is a full democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the shortest run, the least Turkey can do is to ensure
that Ocalan is given a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can help. The Kurdish problem has now, de facto, been
internationalized. Taking matters further, the European Union, with
American backing, could offer a forum for Turks and Kurds to seek a
compromise involving Kurdish self-rule in southeastern Turkey, if
that is what the Kurds want.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the Turks will reject such an idea. But the
Kurds will not go away. If they are not to have a state, they
deserve at least a modicum of self-government and justice. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The sight of the British press in a fit of moral panic is rarely
edifying. But over the past few days, with headlines about
``Frankenstein foods'' gracing the front pages of even supposedly
highbrow newspapers, the country has witnessed a particularly
dispiriting example.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are often
unthinking in their arguments. Solutions devised for one failing
are attacked for making another worse.
</P>
<P>
   Put a gene into a plant to make it infertile, so the change is
incapable of ``escaping,'' for instance, and you are accused of
stopping seed-planting for next year. Or make a plant insect-proof,
and you are damned for encouraging a more resistant strain of
insect.
</P>
<P>
   These issues are too important, many appear to believe, for
logic and science to play a part. That said, the intelligible
objections to GMOs need to be addressed, not merely dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   They are mainly of two kinds: the claim that GMOs are bad for
the environment and the claim that they are bad for human health.
</P>
<P>
   If GMOs are bad for the environment, it is likely to be in the
same ways as normal agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   They may tip the balance of nature further in farmers' direction
by allowing them to capture the maximum amount of sunlight falling
on fields, and then to keep most of the resulting plant material
for their own use. That means less for wildlife _ and so less
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, although preserving wildlife is a laudable aim, it is
better done explicitly, and not by expecting farmers to act against
their interests. Besides, many GMOs require less in the way of
pesticides and herbicides, which should bring significant
environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As for human health, the hoohah in Britain obscures the fact
that there is simply no good evidence that the technology used to
create GMOs is damaging in any way.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that individual products will never be
unhealthy. But it does mean that GMOs should be approached on a
case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   There may be scope for giving people more information through
labelling; and it would help if genetically modified food offered
more obvious advantages to consumers than a redder tomato.
</P>
<P>
   But blanket bans or moratoriums would be harmful, for even the
limited range of genetically modified crops that is now available
is starting to offer real and concrete advantages.
</P>
<P>
   The panic in Britain has also obscured something else _ that the
really important story about GMOs is being played out in Colombia.
Delegates from 170 countries met in Cartagena this week to work out
an international ``Biosafety Protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Their aim is to create guidelines that make trade in GMOs
(mainly crops) possible, but also sensitive to justified concerns
about safety and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying conflict in these talks is economic: between
those who wish to promote agricultural industries by fostering
trade, and those who wish to protect farmers by inhibiting it.
</P>
<P>
   World trade rules stipulate that safety measures affecting trade
must be based on science, not on popular fears. That is a good
principle, but it is being flouted. Europe's ban on hormone-treated
beef from America is an early, worrying, example.
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization has ruled against the ban on the
ground that there is no scientific evidence that the hormones are
dangerous; yet the EU is showing little sign of lifting it.
</P>
<P>
   A way needs to be found to stop scientific or pseudoscientific
differences from poisoning the global trade system.
</P>
<P>
   One encouraging sign from Cartagena is that delegations are not
falling into traditional rich- and poor-country camps. Argentina
and Mexico are lining up with America in favor of free trade.
Though they are poor by western standards, they see advantages in
embracing GMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Other poor countries should remember the ``green revolution'' of
the 1950s and 1960s, itself based on new botanical technologies.
Claims that GMOs may mean a second green revolution are
exaggerated. But history suggests that new agricultural techniques
do more good than harm; hindering their adoption would be foolish. &QL;

<P>
   Can justice be counted in money? Yes, comes the answer every
day, from parliaments and congresses, and from the courts that
enforce their laws: a small fine for a parking offense, a bigger
one for theft; damages for negligence; compensation for injury.
</P>
<P>
   So how much for the Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   Germany has never answered that question directly, but from its
early post-war days it has accepted that only by offering material
restitution as well as expressions of remorse could it prove that
it had broken completely with its Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years it has paid out fully $60 billion in reparations.
But the demands for more have not stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, indeed, they have grown more insistent, especially in
America, where the collective actions of lawyers, Jewish groups,
politicians and regulators now beset German companies as never
before, and threaten to hold up the takeover of Bankers Trust by
Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to put an end to the lawsuits, a dozen prominent
German banks and businesses, backed by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder,
announced this week that they would set up a fund _ it could be
worth more than $2 billion _ to compensate former slave laborers
and others who suffered under the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   This will not put an end to the pursuit, however, if only
because it is not only Germans who are being pursued. Several
American companies, for instance, now face claims because their
former German subsidiaries are accused of helping the Nazi war
machine; Ford, General Motors, Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan are
among the well-known names.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's largest insurer, Generali, is beset by claims. Eight
French banks are said still to owe money to Jewish depositors.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Barclays, whose French subsidiary has likewise been
accused, is setting up a $3.6 million fund in response.
</P>
<P>
   Two Austrian banks are likely to pay out much more in
compensation, though nothing like as much as the $1.25 billion that
Switzerland's banks last year agreed to put into a fund for the
heirs of Jewish depositors who died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The list could go on. Britain has created a small fund to
compensate Jewish refugees interned during the war. France is
producing an inventory of Jewish assets seized during the German
occupation, with a view to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Some 44 countries met in Washington in December to try to settle
disputes about assets, notably works of art, stolen by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   And many lawsuits are still outstanding: the French state rail
company is being sued by a man whose parents were sent to
Auschwitz, he says, in one of its trains.
</P>
<P>
   Better late _ even 54 years late _ than never? Certainly, that
is the right response where banks or insurance companies have
simply refused to come clean about deposits or policies, and
thereby robbed Holocaust victims or their heirs of what they were
owed.
</P>
<P>
   And, equally certainly, many of the belated payments of
compensation would not have been forthcoming but for legal action.
Nor indeed would much of the information that is needed for the
historical record, without which no accounting, financial or
otherwise, can ever be done.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is something distasteful about the quest for
``compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   The relentlessness of some Jewish groups, the ambitions of
American politicians seeking ethnic votes, the class-action suits,
the lawyers' contingency fees: do these really bring justice to
those who survived the Nazi terror, or honor the memory of the 6
million who did not?
</P>
<P>
   Or do they, by seeming to put a price on the Holocaust, reduce
this most terrible of episodes to something more like an everyday
crime?
</P>
<P>
   Several American lawyers say that, despite the new German fund,
they will fight on. They should think again. &QL;

<P>
   Can justice be counted in money? Yes, comes the answer every
day, from parliaments and congresses, and from the courts that
enforce their laws: a small fine for a parking offense, a bigger
one for theft; damages for negligence; compensation for injury.
</P>
<P>
   So how much for the Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   Germany has never answered that question directly, but from its
early post-war days it has accepted that only by offering material
restitution as well as expressions of remorse could it prove that
it had broken completely with its Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years it has paid out fully $60 billion in reparations.
But the demands for more have not stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, indeed, they have grown more insistent, especially in
America, where the collective actions of lawyers, Jewish groups,
politicians and regulators now beset German companies as never
before, and threaten to hold up the takeover of Bankers Trust by
Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to put an end to the lawsuits, a dozen prominent
German banks and businesses, backed by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder,
announced this week that they would set up a fund _ it could be
worth more than $2 billion _ to compensate former slave laborers
and others who suffered under the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   This will not put an end to the pursuit, however, if only
because it is not only Germans who are being pursued. Several
American companies, for instance, now face claims because their
former German subsidiaries are accused of helping the Nazi war
machine; Ford, General Motors, Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan are
among the well-known names.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's largest insurer, Generali, is beset by claims. Eight
French banks are said still to owe money to Jewish depositors.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Barclays, whose French subsidiary has likewise been
accused, is setting up a $3.6 million fund in response.
</P>
<P>
   Two Austrian banks are likely to pay out much more in
compensation, though nothing like as much as the $1.25 billion that
Switzerland's banks last year agreed to put into a fund for the
heirs of Jewish depositors who died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The list could go on. Britain has created a small fund to
compensate Jewish refugees interned during the war. France is
producing an inventory of Jewish assets seized during the German
occupation, with a view to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Some 44 countries met in Washington in December to try to settle
disputes about assets, notably works of art, stolen by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   And many lawsuits are still outstanding: the French state rail
company is being sued by a man whose parents were sent to
Auschwitz, he says, in one of its trains.
</P>
<P>
   Better late _ even 54 years late _ than never? Certainly, that
is the right response where banks or insurance companies have
simply refused to come clean about deposits or policies, and
thereby robbed Holocaust victims or their heirs of what they were
owed.
</P>
<P>
   And, equally certainly, many of the belated payments of
compensation would not have been forthcoming but for legal action.
Nor indeed would much of the information that is needed for the
historical record, without which no accounting, financial or
otherwise, can ever be done.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is something distasteful about the quest for
``compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   The relentlessness of some Jewish groups, the ambitions of
American politicians seeking ethnic votes, the class-action suits,
the lawyers' contingency fees: do these really bring justice to
those who survived the Nazi terror, or honor the memory of the 6
million who did not?
</P>
<P>
   Or do they, by seeming to put a price on the Holocaust, reduce
this most terrible of episodes to something more like an everyday
crime?
</P>
<P>
   Several American lawyers say that, despite the new German fund,
they will fight on. They should think again. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Saturday, the day after his acquittal in the Senate, it was
glibness-as-usual for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week,'' he said in his weekly radio address, ``the
warring parties in Kosovo have been meeting at a 14th-century
castle in France in search of 21st-century peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Savoring the rich sweep of the past, the president proceeded to
enunciate two lessons from history. First, ``World War II taught us
that America could never be secure if Europe's future was in
doubt.'' Second, ``Bosnia taught us...(that) violence we fail to
oppose leads to even greater violence we will have to oppose later
at greater cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of these two lessons, the president explained, America
should intervene in Kosovo, though there should of course be ``a
clear and realistic strategy to allow us to bring our forces home
when their work is done.''
</P>
<P>
   These standard phrases constitute pretty much all Clinton has to
say about his decision to commit troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, to be sure, that no such force will be
assembled: at midweek the Serbs and the ethnic-Albanian Kosovars
remained some distance from a cease-fire, without which
peacekeepers will stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   But, even if the two sides opt to keep on fighting, it is worth
pausing to consider the manner in which Clinton declared himself
willing to risk American lives for Balkan peace. It was not all
that impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Take, first, the ``lesson'' that America must intervene in
European conflicts early on. If this is really so obvious, why did
Clinton not intervene when the Kosovo bust-up began a year ago?
After all, America had long ago promised to jump into Kosovo at the
first sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush warned Serbia's dictator, Slobodan Milosevic,
that America would punish Serbia if it used force against Kosovo's
Albanian majority, and Clinton officials have echoed this threat
loudly and repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, for example, Madeleine Albright, the secretary of
state, promised that ``we are not going to stand by and watch the
Serbian authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away
with doing in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright also said, that same month, ``The time to stop the
killing is now, before it spreads.'' Yet Clinton, like America's
allies in Europe, dithered.
</P>
<P>
   Second, consider that cozy phrase in the president's Saturday
address about a clear exit strategy. He has ample political reason
to promise one of these: whenever an American president sends
troops abroad, critics accuse him of marching into a Vietnam-style
quagmire, so those critics have to be anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, at the same time, the president's talk of an exit
strategy is dishonest, and consciously so. He knows perfectly well
that no date can be set in advance for the withdrawal of
peacekeepers: in Bosnia, after all, a deadline of one year was set,
but American troops remain in place three years after the Dayton
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Mrs. Albright appeared on television to explain that
no deadline would be set in the case of Kosovo. So much for an exit
strategy, if Clinton meant a pre-timed one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Kosovo address also failed to explain the general
principles that determine when intervention is advisable.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, the president has intervened in
Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. But he has also declined to intervene in
places beset by equally serious wars, such as Chechnya, Liberia,
Sudan, Angola, Burundi, and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of these instances, America had plausible cause to
intervene: it might have felt some moral responsibility to quell
the humanitarian disaster in Liberia, a country invented by America
as a home for its ex-slaves; or in Angola, where America's
ex-Cold-War friend, Jonas Savimbi, is responsible for much of the
current carnage. But no intervention was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plainly feels that European wars threaten American
interests more than far-off African ones; not least because they
worry his European allies, whose cooperation he wants.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address, he made the point that violence in Kosovo
might spread into the neighboring countries of Albania and
Macedonia, pouring fresh poison on the relationship between Greece
and Turkey (now rendered even murkier by the Ocalan business),
which are both NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's critics, such as Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of
Texas, retort that European wars should be fixed by European
powers. Even if the Hutchison idea is not entirely practical, it
has some political force.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather than tackling it explicitly and head-on, Clinton
brushed past, talking soothingly about how America can ``make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's glibness on Kosovo is not an isolated case. It is the
hallmark of his foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the president has spotted a tough issue, taken
an admirable position on what should be done, and then failed to
implement it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believes in freer trade, but lacks the perseverance to
build a constituency for it. He wants to pay America's debts to the
United Nations, but has not persuaded Congress to go along with
this.
</P>
<P>
   Just at the moment, Clinton is preparing to deploy an
anti-missile defense system. But he has not publicly explained why
he has dropped his old opposition to this scheme, or what he means
to do about the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which is relevant to
the nuclear balance with Russia and which may now have to be
renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a brilliant student who thinks he can succeed by
pulling an all-nighter at the last minute. This is not the best way
to conduct American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, even though the Kosovo example is typical, it stands out
for its seriousness. If a NATO force is sent to Kosovo, it may well
have a difficult time: hard-liners on either side will resent the
cease-fire deal, and may take out their frustrations on the hapless
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a former Clinton official now at the Brookings
Institution, worries that Kosovo might turn into a Somalia-style
mess: American troops will get killed, triggering a hasty
withdrawal and undermining American internationalism for a good
while thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are always risks in peacekeeping. America is
strong enough to take these risks on _ provided it has a president
who explains them honestly. &QL;

   TEGUCIGALPA AND MANAGUA _ Edgardo Serrato points to the river, a
docile trickle of water in the distance. ``That...'' he says, then
swings around and points to the top of his field, ``got up to
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He turns back and indicates the barren, stony landscape on
either side of the river. ``And that,'' he says, ``used to look
like those,'' pointing to a thick patch of trees downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he sweeps his hand across his field, the soil newly
sown with beans, now covered with sand up to half a meter (nearly
two feet) deep. ``And this is what it left us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It,'' of course, was Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly four months since Mitch swept through Honduras,
while its wide skirts of rain soaked Nicaragua (and, to a lesser
extent, parts of Guatemala, El Salvador and southeastern Mexico).
</P>
<P>
   The most urgent disaster relief has been done, and the clouds of
rain and rescue workers have cleared. Now for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Among their many tasks, governments, aid agencies and farmers
like Serrato are assessing the damage to agriculture _ a vital
industry and big export earner _ and the time and money it will
need to recover.
</P>
<P>
   At least the destruction was not as great as was at first
feared. Early estimates put Honduras's crop losses at 70 percent
and the number of its homeless at 2 million (out of 6.3 million).
</P>
<P>
   There was talk of the country being set back 50 years. For the
first few days, with bridges down, cities cut off and water
everywhere, that sounded possible.
</P>
<P>
   Better estimates are now emerging. Central American farming
divides roughly into (a) staples, such as beans, maize and rice,
grown mostly by small farmers, many with only a hectare (2 acres)
or two, who live off their crops and sell any surplus; and (b)
export goods, such as bananas, coffee, cane sugar, sesame (in
Nicaragua) and shrimps.
</P>
<P>
   Beans, ready to be picked, were badly hit: both countries, it is
thought, indeed lost some 70 percent of this crop. But there is
more than one bean harvest a year.
</P>
<P>
   Maize too took a battering, but governments bought seeds for
emergency post-Mitch planting.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution was not brilliant: the mayor of Puerto Cortes, on
Honduras's Caribbean coast, says that promised seeds never arrived
and he had to drum up help from local businesses. But overall both
countries lost only 20 percent or so of the maize they could expect
in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   In commercial crops, Honduras lost nearly half of its bananas
and 20-25 percent of its coffee _ which means, between them, about
one-eighth of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua lost only 6 percent or so of either, but two-thirds of
its sesame.
</P>
<P>
   As for shrimps, for all the flooding of their salty lagoons,
there are even reports that Honduras's shrimp farmers will do
better in the year after Mitch than before.
</P>
<P>
   Crop losses, however, are only the simplest part of the story. A
harder question is what Mitch did to the land.
</P>
<P>
   When rivers that had burst their banks receded, they left sand
up to two meters (six-and-a-half feet) deep. Some small farmers
with fields next to rivers have lost them for good.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is less sand they, like Serrato, can mix it into the
soil, but the mixture does not hold water so well. In the hills,
torrents of water washed soil away, or left it but rinsed the
nutrients out of it.
</P>
<P>
   No one can yet quantify the effects, but at least for a time the
land will be less fertile.
</P>
<P>
   That is bad news for countries whose food output was already
rising less quickly than their populations: according to the World
Food Program, Honduras grew 27 percent less food per person in 1996
than in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But it is much worse news for some individual farmers, since so
many were only just scratching a living anyway. The same goes for
workers on the big banana plantations.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, Standard Fruit (a subsidiary of Dole, an American
fruit giant) says it will in time produce as much as before; but
not necessarily in the same spots, and it will take two years just
to replant everything that was washed away.
</P>
<P>
   Overall in the plantations, the result will be temporary or
permanent unemployment for thousands of workers.
</P>
<P>
   At least Standard can afford the $70 million-75 million it
reckons it will need to put its Honduran plantations back in order.
For many subsistence farmers there, the problem is how to replant
at all, and what. Normally, they save enough seed from one harvest
to plant the next. Not this time. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government bought rice and maize seed abroad, but Hondurans
are choosy about beans: they like a local red variety. ``Seeds of
Hope,'' a scheme sponsored by the United States Agency for
International Development, is supporting farmers _ Serrato is one _
to grow seeds for distribution to others. So are a couple of local
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   But this year such efforts will supply only a fraction of what
is needed for the main planting. Most farmers will have to sow
alien beans for a season at least, and they may get lower prices
for the result. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, recovery involves much more than just replanting and
waiting for the harvest. ``People see a hurricane as a one-off
blow,'' says one American development worker, ``but this is an
ongoing crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Freak rains during January dumped more water on some parts of
Honduras than the hurricane had, and farmers who had tried a late,
post-Mitch planting lost their crops again.
</P>
<P>
   Pests and fungi have flourished in the swampy conditions;
special chemicals and equipment are needed to get rid of them.
Dykes, bridges and roads have to be rebuilt; a lot of the lost
bananas and coffee were not washed away but went bad because they
could not be got to market in time.
</P>
<P>
   Most heavy-duty machinery is still out repairing the main roads,
so local roads are often being restored by hand. Silted-up rivers
must be expensively dredged before the dry season ends in May, or
they will flood again with the first rains.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials in both Honduras and Nicaragua reckon
their farms could recover in about five years. Nicaragua's
government plans to spend $1 billion during that time to achieve
it. But neither country has that kind of money, and local banks are
reluctant to lend except short-term.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of the Mitch-hit countries will present their
plans for reconstruction to prospective foreign aid donors, in
Stockholm, in May. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA AND MANAGUA _ Edgardo Serrato points to the river, a
docile trickle of water in the distance. ``That...'' he says, then
swings around and points to the top of his field, ``got up to
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He turns back and indicates the barren, stony landscape on
either side of the river. ``And that,'' he says, ``used to look
like those,'' pointing to a thick patch of trees downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he sweeps his hand across his field, the soil newly
sown with beans, now covered with sand up to half a meter (nearly
two feet) deep. ``And this is what it left us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It,'' of course, was Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly four months since Mitch swept through Honduras,
while its wide skirts of rain soaked Nicaragua (and, to a lesser
extent, parts of Guatemala, El Salvador and southeastern Mexico).
</P>
<P>
   The most urgent disaster relief has been done, and the clouds of
rain and rescue workers have cleared. Now for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Among their many tasks, governments, aid agencies and farmers
like Serrato are assessing the damage to agriculture _ a vital
industry and big export earner _ and the time and money it will
need to recover.
</P>
<P>
   At least the destruction was not as great as was at first
feared. Early estimates put Honduras's crop losses at 70 percent
and the number of its homeless at 2 million (out of 6.3 million).
</P>
<P>
   There was talk of the country being set back 50 years. For the
first few days, with bridges down, cities cut off and water
everywhere, that sounded possible.
</P>
<P>
   Better estimates are now emerging. Central American farming
divides roughly into (a) staples, such as beans, maize and rice,
grown mostly by small farmers, many with only a hectare (2 acres)
or two, who live off their crops and sell any surplus; and (b)
export goods, such as bananas, coffee, cane sugar, sesame (in
Nicaragua) and shrimps.
</P>
<P>
   Beans, ready to be picked, were badly hit: both countries, it is
thought, indeed lost some 70 percent of this crop. But there is
more than one bean harvest a year.
</P>
<P>
   Maize too took a battering, but governments bought seeds for
emergency post-Mitch planting.

   PRAGUE _ It is ``space pussies' night'' in Radost FX, a trendy
Prague dance club. Slender Czech girls gyrate to techno music
pumped out by a British DJ. Male hipsters stand off to one side
awaiting the promised ``Lesbian Love Show.'' A poster on the wall
advises dancers to bring their own ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   It could be anywhere really _ London, New York. But that is
precisely the point. Prague is no longer fenced off. East and west
mean less to Czech hipsters than cool and uncool.
</P>
<P>
   Techno music and ecstasy belong to a world more nuanced and
ambivalent than the bleak, harrowing world in which Jan Palach
chose to douse himself in gasoline, set himself afire, and stagger
dying into Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest against the Russian
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Palach was a 21-year-old student, whose passionate ideals
inspired Czechs and Slovaks at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Not now. Most of the youth propping up the bar in Radost FX have
a vague idea who Palach was (``That guy who did the Buddhist thing
_ right?''), but none is curious to contemplate what drove him to
despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is 20,'' one Czech mother later explains. ``For him and
his friends the past simply does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes with older Czechs too. In 1990 thousands gathered to
remember Palach's passing. Last month only a handful stood with
President Vaclav Havel to mark the 30th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   In small Czech towns most young people subsist on a lamentable
cultural diet of second-rate American television shows and pop
music. Few speak a foreign language; those who do opt for German.
</P>
<P>
   Prague is different. Here the more affluent and educated young
people have made their own underground. They choose English over
German, listen to edgier American and British alternative music,
prefer ``indie'' movies to television, surf the Internet, and favor
snowboards more than skis.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these hipsters' formative years have been spent in a
post-communist world. ``For me,'' says Tomas Hacek, a student of 20
at Charles University, ``liberty means raves and swapping e-mail
with guys in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Such views are echoed by the crowd camped out at a snowboard
shop off Wenceslas Square. Snowboarders here debate the merits of
Burton versus Sims boards, often using idiomatic English to make
their point.
</P>
<P>
   A snowboard is a major investment. A decent Burton goes for
12,000 korunas ($400) _ more than most Czechs earn in a month. Then
there is the look: imported skiing jackets starting at 4,000
korunas and daily lift-passes at 300.
</P>
<P>
   Less affluent skateboarders sprawl on a couch watching surf
videos imported from California.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they get their kicks from music, skating or film, one
thing Prague's hipsters share is an apathy for politics. The few
who do protest tend to stick to well-worn civil-rights and green
issues. A few campaign for gypsy rights or for Free Tibet or
blockade local branches of McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the apathy is a return to form. ``The Czechs have
been passive-aggressive for 400 years,'' says Keith Kirchner,
publisher of ``Think,'' an alternative magazine published in
English and Czech.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of hip Prague is English. A sizeable number of
American expatriates, often artsy graduates attracted by Cool
Prague's beauty and cheap living, have made it the city's second
language.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is spreading it too, though owning a computer is
still beyond the pockets of most youthful Czechs. But many frequent
Internet cafes, where for 80 korunas or so you can surf the net for
an hour, download snazzy sites, send e-mail and sip espresso.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Czech underground has produced little it can call its
own. But Czechs have begun to put out local movies and trade
homemade CDs of local bands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with so few foreigners speaking their language, Czech
hipsters, like their Danish or Greek counterparts, will stay net
importers of culture.
</P>
<P>
   Havel finds it sad. He laments not so much the influx of
English-language counterculture (one of his heroes was Frank Zappa,
the American music icon) as the lack of youthful purpose and what
he calls ``selfishness, opportunism and everything that at the time
of Palach's act was called stealthy collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   For Havel's generation of dissent, underground culture was a
protest medium. Today it is just a way of having a good time. &QL;

   Still, with so few foreigners speaking their language, Czech
hipsters, like their Danish or Greek counterparts, will stay net
importers of culture.
</P>
<P>
   Havel finds it sad. He laments not so much the influx of
English-language counterculture (one of his heroes was Frank Zappa,
the American music icon) as the lack of youthful purpose and what
he calls ``selfishness, opportunism and everything that at the time
of Palach's act was called stealthy collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   For Havel's generation of dissent, underground culture was a
protest medium. Today it is just a way of having a good time. &QL;

   LONDON _ Almost regardless of what may be decided this weekend
at the peace conference on Kosovo, there will be no lasting peace
or democracy in southeastern Europe until the NATO allies have a
fundamental policy for the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing, which the allies are threatening, may actually
reinforce each side's positions in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, establishing peace and democracy in only one area such
as Kosovo _ as Western countries are currently planning _ will only
be of very limited value.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans have never been amenable to easy solutions imposed
from outside. Even at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union
gradually lost control over Yugoslavia, Albania and Romania, while
the West barely contained the perennial Greek-Turkish disputes,
despite the fact that both countries were NATO members and
therefore, at least formally, allies.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the Cold War period, the current condition of the
Balkans is quite favorable. Although the Yugoslav war has played
havoc with the economies of the area and the Balkans' aspiration to
project an image of stability, the region is now at the top of the
European agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has NATO mounted in Yugoslavia the biggest military
operation in its existence, but also many international
organizations are now deeply engaged in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union is financing infrastructure projects designed
to connect Romania and Bulgaria to main transport routes, Turkey is
paraded as one of Europe's key strategic allies and the United
States is mediating in the Greek-Turkish dispute over Cyprus and
the islands of the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the promise of full integration into both
NATO and the EU has been extended to the region's states in return
for their good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this century, the great powers regarded the
Balkans as partly a geographic region and partly a disease for
which effective quarantine measures were the only adequate cure.
The Balkans may yet end the century in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   The story is not one of mischief or cynicism (although there was
plenty of both) but of a lack of vision, which could lead to missed
historic opportunities and continued misery for the region's
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton peace accords that put a halt to the Bosnian war in
November 1995 were based on a set of dubious assumptions. The first
was the belief that, in order to reunite the Bosnian state, one
must start by separating the various fighting armies.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with that was the belief that ``the people'' are
``good'' and desire peace and that only their leaders could be
``nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the people were allowed the opportunity to vote freely, the
thinking goes, the warlords would be removed from power and all
Bosnians would live together again. The Dayton accords provided for
elections. In addition, there was the assumption that there was no
crisis that a well-written constitution could not solve.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton included a fine constitutional specimen, complete with
rotating presidencies, constitutional courts and arbitral
tribunals. But, finally, there was the belief that talking tough to
the ``natives'' and threatening unspecified retribution without
actually having to commit to any action should be sufficient to
bring about peace.
</P>
<P>
   At every step, the troops that were dispatched to Bosnia
carefully eschewed any military involvement while the Western
governments increased their rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Bosnia has stopped, and we should all be
grateful for that. Nevertheless, Bosnia remains divided, and cut
away from its natural economic partners in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But, in many respects, Bosnia is yesterday's story, for the
West's real challenge is now with the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia represents the classic example of what can go wrong
in the transition from a communist society. The war, for which
President Slobodan Milosevic bears heavy responsibility,
perpetuated a disguised communist rule and postponed decisions
about the nature of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic fought the war in the name of Serbian unity and ethnic
purity. Yet Serbs are still divided and Serbia still contains the
highest number of ethnic minorities among all the republics of the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Having been the most integrated Eastern European state before
1989, Yugoslavia is now a pariah in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   To complete this cycle of tragedies, the Yugoslavia that
Milosevic invented after 1991 remains a rickety affair. Montenegro,
Serbia's partner in the federation, looks increasingly unreliable.
Moreover, the institutions of the state are an even greater farce
than they were during Tito's dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years after the demise of old Yugoslavia, the
Yugoslav federal presidency, which was meant to represent both
Montenegro and Serbia, remained a mere cipher designed to obscure
Milosevic's political control.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia and _ to a lesser extent _ Montenegro have therefore
ended with the worst possible outcome: They are the only former
Yugoslav republics not to have a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has failed in his nationalist dreams, but succeeded in
destroying his country's civic society. Ten years ago, the people
of Yugoslavia were in the forefront of all communist states. Today,
Yugoslavia is at the bottom of the pile, with no salvation in
sight. In addition, there is more to come, for the crucial issue of
Kosovo has yet to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the United States and the European Union have
solely relied on negotiations, exclusively with the existing
regimes, often in the hope of achieving brief periods of illusory
peace. The leaders of the region, in turn, have portrayed
themselves as saviors.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic has clearly not worked. Far from being upholders of
any solution, the autocratic leaders in some of the countries that
call themselves Yugoslavia's ``successors'' are actually part of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But a serious Western plan of stabilizing the region is still
feasible. It should start with establishing democratic roots in the
capitals of southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, Sarajevo, Zagreb and Tirana would be the targets for
the creation of fundamental democratic institutions, which would
uphold human rights and freedom of the media and implement an
economic revival plan.
</P>
<P>
   Calculated pressure would be imposed upon the current regimes to
push them out of power. The region's dictators should be attacked
where they hurt most: by taking measures to recover the billions of
state assets that they have managed to spirit away from their
countries.
</P>
<P>
   And, ultimately, the prospect of genuine European integration,
as well as economic reconstruction, should be promised to those
countries that manage to emerge from their current political rut.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it may be argued that such an approach will take
years to bear fruit and cost a great deal. But billions of dollars
have already been spent in peacekeeping operations, and the
proposal is to spend much more in Kosovo now.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there is neither peace nor stability. It is time
to go back to the fundamentals, however long it takes. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If there's such a thing as a schizophrenic ship, it's the
container ship Americana, says veteran traveler Jim Leveque, now
retired in Mexico. As he puts it, ``Forward, it's sweating,
shirt-sleeved, braying John Wayne, while aft it's immaculate Gene
Kelly relaxing in a cashmere sweater and penny loafers.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked to Leveque about his recent cruise on Americana, the
only vessel afloat designed to haul big, bulky cargo containers and
to cuddle up to 88 passengers in cruise ship comfort at the same
time. The proof of the latter is in the numbers: Out of a crew of
just over 50, fully 30 of those people are aboard solely to pamper
the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Early last summer, the Norwegian-owned Americana _ after
spending its first decade doing 50-day round trips between New York
or New Orleans and South America _ began three-week runs from
Houston to nine ports on the Gulf of Mexico and in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   An appealing aspect of Americana, Leveque says, is that she
never seems, and never is, crowded. Except over the winter
holidays, the ship rarely carries its maximum passenger capacity.
The rest of the year, half to two-thirds full is considered a good
load.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it is relatively full, more often than not fewer than
a dozen people might be found daytime in the lounge or the card
room-cum-library, and not all that many more topside on the
spacious sun deck by the swimming pool. Americana people spend a
good deal of their time in their quarters _ and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Even the standard double would be considered a suite on any
other ship. It has a parlor area with sofa, coffee table and
windows seemingly large enough to admit Moby Dick. The bathroom
includes a tub and bidet. The deluxe doubles are 25 percent larger
and the suites are twice as big.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers can read from the multitude of books in the library,
or watch a movie chosen from the ship's 400-plus videos. Or they
can venture onto the bridge, which is open round-the-clock except
when entering or leaving port. The officer on watch will help
understand the maps, explain navigation and talk about the cargo,
which could include a 5,000-gallon tank of Barbados rum headed for
the United States, enormous pieces of John Deere farm equipment
destined for Costa Rica or a container of foam food trays and
fabric just picked up in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Americana gets more socialable at mealtimes, during afternoon
tea, at the pre-dinner cocktail hour and for cordials and coffee
afterward, Leveque found. During the latter two periods Shirley
King plays piano, and before bedtime there may be bingo, blackjack
or bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Purser Bill Gable, a veteran of two decades at sea, likened
Americana people to those who went cruising a generation ago: of
adequate age to be affluent _ few are under 60 _ well traveled and
sufficiently cosmopolitan to have nothing to prove to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   They are not, he stresses, at all like those aboard the
1,000-plus passenger ships who pay $700 for a riotous week afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rarely did Leveque see a T-shirt and only occasionally
jeans. One passenger was shunned for wearing a sleeveless tank top
to breakfast and lunch, Leveque said, until he realized his fellow
passengers considered such attire underwear. Shorts are forbidden
in public areas after 6 p.m., and ``informal'' dinner attire for
men means a nice sport shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional drill and announcements to get ready
for shore excursions, the public address system was rarely used.
There was no encouragement to do this or that at a particular time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like not having to make choices,'' asserted one passenger to
Leveque. ``I like that there aren't any.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Americana travelers are inactive dullards. To the
contrary, most have quite interesting backgrounds, Leveque said,
citing these examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Houston geophysicist who, with his wife, survived
revolutions in a trio of Third World nations, and whose four
children were born in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ A former dean of communications and social sciences at the
University of Southern California who was a reliable guide to the
wine list, for before retiring to Mexico he had 600 bottles in his
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   _ An entrepreneur who had lived in France, India, the Virgin
Islands, Hong Kong and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   _ A former music librarian who had done the long South American
voyage on Americana 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   Such addiction isn't all that unusual. One other woman, probably
the recordholder, has taken 14 cruises, and it's rare that at least
a quarter of the passengers on any given trip aren't repeaters.
</P>
<P>
   Fares are seasonal, with the highest roughly from mid-November
through the end of April. A standard double is $4,914 per person
high season, $4,368 the rest of the year.

<P>
   If there's such a thing as a schizophrenic ship, it's the
container ship Americana, says veteran traveler Jim Leveque, now
retired in Mexico. As he puts it, ``Forward, it's sweating,
shirt-sleeved, braying John Wayne, while aft it's immaculate Gene
Kelly relaxing in a cashmere sweater and penny loafers.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked to Leveque about his recent cruise on Americana, the
only vessel afloat designed to haul big, bulky cargo containers and
to cuddle up to 88 passengers in cruise ship comfort at the same
time. The proof of the latter is in the numbers: Out of a crew of
just over 50, fully 30 of those people are aboard solely to pamper
the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Early last summer, the Norwegian-owned Americana _ after
spending its first decade doing 50-day round trips between New York
or New Orleans and South America _ began three-week runs from
Houston to nine ports on the Gulf of Mexico and in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   An appealing aspect of Americana, Leveque says, is that she
never seems, and never is, crowded. Except over the winter
holidays, the ship rarely carries its maximum passenger capacity.
The rest of the year, half to two-thirds full is considered a good
load.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it is relatively full, more often than not fewer than
a dozen people might be found daytime in the lounge or the card
room-cum-library, and not all that many more topside on the
spacious sun deck by the swimming pool. Americana people spend a
good deal of their time in their quarters _ and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Even the standard double would be considered a suite on any
other ship. It has a parlor area with sofa, coffee table and
windows seemingly large enough to admit Moby Dick. The bathroom
includes a tub and bidet. The deluxe doubles are 25 percent larger
and the suites are twice as big.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers can read from the multitude of books in the library,
or watch a movie chosen from the ship's 400-plus videos. Or they
can venture onto the bridge, which is open round-the-clock except
when entering or leaving port. The officer on watch will help
understand the maps, explain navigation and talk about the cargo,
which could include a 5,000-gallon tank of Barbados rum headed for
the United States, enormous pieces of John Deere farm equipment
destined for Costa Rica or a container of foam food trays and
fabric just picked up in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Americana gets more socialable at mealtimes, during afternoon
tea, at the pre-dinner cocktail hour and for cordials and coffee
afterward, Leveque found. During the latter two periods Shirley
King plays piano, and before bedtime there may be bingo, blackjack
or bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Purser Bill Gable, a veteran of two decades at sea, likened
Americana people to those who went cruising a generation ago: of
adequate age to be affluent _ few are under 60 _ well traveled and
sufficiently cosmopolitan to have nothing to prove to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   They are not, he stresses, at all like those aboard the
1,000-plus passenger ships who pay $700 for a riotous week afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rarely did Leveque see a T-shirt and only occasionally
jeans. One passenger was shunned for wearing a sleeveless tank top
to breakfast and lunch, Leveque said, until he realized his fellow
passengers considered such attire underwear. Shorts are forbidden
in public areas after 6 p.m., and ``informal'' dinner attire for
men means a nice sport shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional drill and announcements to get ready
for shore excursions, the public address system was rarely used.
There was no encouragement to do this or that at a particular time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like not having to make choices,'' asserted one passenger to
Leveque. ``I like that there aren't any.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Americana travelers are inactive dullards. To the
contrary, most have quite interesting backgrounds, Leveque said,
citing these examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Houston geophysicist who, with his wife, survived
revolutions in a trio of Third World nations, and whose four
children were born in different countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ A former dean of communications and social sciences at the
University of Southern California who was a reliable guide to the
wine list, for before retiring to Mexico he had 600 bottles in his
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   _ An entrepreneur who had lived in France, India, the Virgin
Islands, Hong Kong and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   _ A former music librarian who had done the long South American
voyage on Americana 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   Such addiction isn't all that unusual. One other woman, probably
the recordholder, has taken 14 cruises, and it's rare that at least
a quarter of the passengers on any given trip aren't repeaters.
</P>
<P>
   Fares are seasonal, with the highest roughly from mid-November
through the end of April. A standard double is $4,914 per person
high season, $4,368 the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And you can kiss the hated single supplement good-bye: Singles
pay no more for an outside single cabin than either party in a
standard double _ and windowless, inside quarters are less, $3,780
in high season, $3,360 at other times. All tips are included in the
basic fare. Medical staff members are on board.
</P>
<P>
   Port stops include Cartagena, Colombia; LaGuaira, Venezuela; San
Juan, Puerto Rico; Rio Haina, Dominican Republic; Puerto Limon,
Costa Rica; and Veracruz, Mexico.

<P>
   It might be a conventional island-hopping cruise in the
Caribbean or an adventure ship off the coast of Costa Rica, a
10-day trip to Riviera ports or a week in the misty waters of
Alaska's Inside Passage. But whether it's parents taking their
children, their own parents or a hybrid group of all three
generations to sail off into the sunset together, multigenerational
cruising is a growing trend.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships provide a safe, controlled environment for
children. They can be educational for kids and broaden their
horizons. But if a cruise is chosen with all family members in
mind, it can provide an array of activities for cruise-goers of all
ages as well as ample time for adventure, education and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   These multigenerational cruises can be a way for adults and
their parents to come together, to share the excitement of foreign
travel and enjoy the luxury of a floating vacation. It's a family
reunion joined with the inherent sociability of a cruise ship. On
today's large ships, that means space for private time as well.
</P>
<P>
   For multigenerational cruising, look for cruise lines that offer
a consistently high level of service and a well-planned mix of
activities for various age groups.
</P>
<P>
   Holland America (300 Elliott Avenue W., Seattle, Wash. 98119;
800-426-0327; www.hollandamerica.com) has ships such as the
Statendam, the Maasdam, the Ryndam and the Veendam, all good
choices.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1,613-passenger ship like the Maasdam, even the least
expensive outside double cabins contain twin beds that can be
easily converted to queen-sized and have sitting areas with sofa
and chair.
</P>
<P>
   There are usually two nights out of seven where formal wear is
called for, and white-gloved stewards live up to Holland America's
reputation for pampering. But don't be put off by some of the
formality. Those with teenage children in tow can expect youth
counselors to have organized discos and other activities. While
Holland America excels in general, a ship like the Maasdam is
especially well-suited for classic cruising in Alaskan waters.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean International (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami, Fla.
33132; 800-327-6700; www.royalcaribbean.com) and its megaships such
as Legend of the Seas, Splendour of the Seas and Sovereign of the
Seas are 2,000-plus passenger vessels offering a vast array of
entertainment and dining possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Splendour of the Seas, for example, is a very spacious
2,076-passenger ship that spends its winters in the Caribbean and
its summers in Europe. Play golf on an 18-hole seagoing course,
catch performances in the high-tech theater or stargaze using the
ship's starwheels to point out where each constellation is.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean has a four-tiered kids program, for sailors ages
3 to 17. There are separate kids' playrooms, a Captain Sealy's Kids
Galley Menu tailored to children's appetites and daily ``compass''
itineraries that give kids an hour-by-hour account of daily
activities.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who like true togetherness, Royal Caribbean has
suites that can sleep up to six family members.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity Cruise Line (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami, Fla. 33132;
800-327-6700; www.celebrity-cruises.com) has ships like the
Century, Galaxy, Mercury, Zenith and Horizon, which offer some of
the classiest cruise-going afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging in size from about 1,100 to 1,800 passengers,
Celebrity's ships are a sybarite's delight with stellar
entertainment, good dining and wonderful design.
</P>
<P>
   The price is another factor. Celebrity isn't inexpensive, but it
does provide extraordinary bang for a buck. Priced like Holland
America, its food and service can approach that of a higher-end
cruise line.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Galaxy, which has 2,056 passengers. The standard
cabins, with queen-size bed, a large window, two armchairs and a
spacious bathroom by cruise ship standards, is an elegant affair.
</P>
<P>
   As for kids, Celebrity has a notable four-tiered, age-ranked
kids program for children ages 3 to 17, with separate kids-only
clubhouses, teen centers and separate pools.
</P>
<P>
   There are also innovative programs like Summer Stock Theater, in
which kids of all ages first rehearse and then perform before their
parents later in the cruise. The Young Mariners Club offers a
behind-the-scenes look at shipboard life, and there's a Junior
Olympics to make sure that active kids stay active.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy sails in the Caribbean in winter, in Alaska during
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The new 2,400-passenger Disney Magic is the first ship from the
new Disney Cruise Company (210 Celebration Place, Suite 400,
Celebration, Fla. 34747; 800-951-3532; www.disneycruise.com). The
Disney Wonder will join her later in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On a one-week Disney cruise, the itinerary is typically three
days at sea followed by four days at Walt Disney World, or vice
versa. Family cabins that boast a revolutionary one-and-a-half
baths are star attractions in the accommodations area.
</P>
<P>
   As for entertainment, this is Disney, so expect Broadway-style
shows at the Walt Disney Theater and a dizzying array of shipboard
attractions for kids, like Studio Sea for family cabaret acts, ESPN
Skybox for sports nuts and Oceaneer's Adventure for kids ages three
to 12.
</P>
<P>
   At the full-screen Buena Vista Theater are Disney classics and
first-run releases. And there are three themed nightclubs for
adults only.
</P>
<P>
   This ships sails in the waters off Florida and the Bahamas.

   &QL; 
 &UR; SURVIVAL OF THE PRETTIEST: The Science of Beauty &QL; 
 &UR; Nancy Etcoff (Doubleday, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   As Mae West said, too much of a good thing can be wonderful.
When do we acquire our appreciation of beauty? Consider the
research of psychologist Judith Langlois. She collected hundreds of
slides of people's faces and asked adults to rate them for
attractiveness. She then showed the slides to 3-month-old babies.
The infants stared significantly longer at faces the adults had
found attractive, and they seemed to appreciate attractiveness
regardless of the subject's sex, race or age. This suggests, Etcoff
writes, that even babies have beauty detectors, and that human
faces might share universal elements of beauty even though their
features are varied. Babies are not immune to the standard; other
studies have shown that parents tend to be more affectionate and
playful with attractive babies. The message of this enlightening
book is that love of beauty is not a cultural lesson but a basic
instinct, a biological explanation for the fact that we cannot
withstand appearances. We can't explain it (when Etcoff asked
people at a modeling agency to define beauty, they described the
experience of (begin itals) seeing (end itals) beauty, and not what
beauty actually looks like), but it has us in its clutches for a
host of ancestral and biological reasons. Although Etcoff allows
that beauty is ``howlingly unfair,'' a genetic given that does not
reflect a person's intelligence or character, she also insists that
it has merit and purpose in the human equation. That, she says, is
why we should remember these measured words from George Eliot, whom
Henry James called ``magnificently ugly'': ``All honour and
reverence to the divine beauty of form! Let us cultivate it to the
utmost in men, women and children, in our gardens and in our
houses. But let us love that other beauty too, which lies in no
secret of proportion but in the secret of deep human sympathy.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MYTHS, LEGENDS &AMP; FOLKTALES OF AMERICA &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by David Leeming and Jake Page (Oxford, $25)
</P>
<P>
   It's said that when the legendary blues singer Bessie Smith was
11, she was kidnapped and taken in a burlap bag to Ma Rainey, who
gave her singing lessons. ``Johnny Appleseed'' was really an
eccentric, homeless man called Jonathan Chapman, who walked
barefoot in the coldest weather and devoted his life to planting
apple seeds in the remote places of the American frontier. Paul
Bunyan never existed at all _ stories about him are called
``faketales'' by folklorists who believe Bunyan was the creation of
lumber companies and chambers of commerce. This anthology also
includes the myths, legends and folktales of Bigfoot, Uncle Sam,
Billy the Kid, George (`I cannot tell a lie'') Washington and
Hiawatha, as well as the mythologies of indigenous peoples and of
the Europeans, Africans and Asians who came later. The tales are
tall, and peculiarly American. ``They serve as mirrors in which a
group of people can see themselves,'' the editors write. ``More
specifically and more often, they are like those mirrors in which
we apply makeup or even disguises, designing images of who we think
we are, how we believe we should appear to the world, and how we
think we should perform in it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WALKING ON WATER: Black American Lives at the Turn of the
Twenty-First Century &QL; 
 &UR; Randall Kenan (Knopf, $30)
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean to be Black? Is there a cohesive answer to
such a sprawling question? Kenan acknowledges from the outset the
arrogance of his original purpose in writing this book _ ``to
chronicle, chart, eviscerate, enumerate, analyze and explain the
nature of Blackness.'' But the question _ what does it mean to be
Black? _ so resounded throughout his life that he decided to travel
the country, talk with ordinary Black people in unheralded jobs and
places, and discover through them what it meant to be Black. He
started in 1991 and planned to spend up to a year on the road,
traveling from place to place in a Jeep he named Bucephalus (``for
though I am not an egomaniac,'' he says, ``I am not unambitious'').
In the end, it took six years, and he came back with no answer
other than that he, like the rest of Black America, is a work in
progress. This book is his response to the people and places he
met. It is, he admits, ``a very bookish book,'' full of long
conversations and his newfound sense of peace even without the
answer to his question. To paraphrase Whitman, he says, ``I contain
multitudes.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; FOOTBALL'S BEST SHORT STORIES &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Paul D. Staudohar (Chicago Review, $22)
</P>
<P>
   In Peter Gent's ``Waiting for the Turk,'' a 30-year-old
professional football player faces the end of his career. In
``Sooper Dooper,'' a story composed entirely of dialogue, Frank
Deford writes about the commercial madness surrounding the Super
Bowl (``This ain't no Super Bowl,'' says a small-town reporter.
``It's a supermarket.''). It's a strange alliance, football and
literature, but it works if the names are big enough. Here are
stories by Irwin Shaw, Michael Chabon, Don DeLillo, T. Coraghessan
Boyle, Damon Runyon, John Updike, Grantland Rice and others.
Staudohar edited the previous ``Baseball's Best Short Stories'' and
``Golf's Best Short Stories.'' &QL;

   NY-HOTEL-BARS (New York) _ New York City is filled with
unappreciated treasures. But in the world of food and drink none
are so neglected as hotel bars. They have been here for ages,
planted like pillars around the city. Many are elegantly decorated,
like miniatures of the grand hotels that engulf them. And perhaps
it is for that reason that New Yorkers seem to overlook them. But
beyond the barrier of the hotel lobbies lie some of the city's most
secluded oases, where you can relax over a well-mixed drink, be
treated like a king or simply be as anonymous as the bars
themselves. By Amanda Hesser.

Eritrean food. Both the decor and the food were pleasant surprises.

EXOTIC SPECIES PROMPT FEDERAL EFFORT TO FIGHT BACK IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Graphic available on NYT database) 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The ``Dirty Dozen's'' siege of Texas may lack the
edge-of-your-seat suspense of ``Jurassic Park.'' When it comes to
generating sheer terror, grass carp, wild pigs, water hyacinths and
the other exotic species that make up the Dozen can't compare to
rampaging raptors.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind both, though, is much the same: Man arrogantly
manipulates nature. Nature bites back.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, exotic species deliberately or accidentally
introduced into Texas have devastated thousands of acres, say
officials of the San Antonio-based Texas Nature Conservancy, which
compiled the list of the 12 worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
   That list, identical to one put together by the organization two
years ago, was released earlier this month as President Clinton
signed an executive order creating the Invasive Species Council.
The multiagency panel has 18 months to develop a comprehensive plan
to battle the unwanted exotics. Nationwide, renegade species are
blamed for declines in population of at least 42 percent of
designated endangered or threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   While Africanized honeybees and imported red fire ants have
grabbed headlines in Texas, Nature Conservancy officials say other
species on the Dirty Dozen list have gone about their destruction
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Grass carp have stripped lakes and bayous of all vegetation;
Chinese tallow trees have overwhelmed coastal prairies; water
hyacinths have clogged waterways; salt cedars have sucked springs
dry; and nutria have destroyed valuable wetlands with their
tunnels. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Rounding out the list are feral cats and dogs, European
starlings, turf grasses and Johnson grass.
</P>
<P>
   All these species, said the Nature Conservancy's David Wolfe,
share two significant traits: They have no natural predators in
Texas, and they are extraordinarily adaptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good number of species on this list,'' he said, ``are good
at reproduction anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THEY JUST KEPT EATING AND EATING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Houston fishing guide Mark Marmon, the grass carp is a thing
of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing an average 6 to 10 pounds, the carp _ a non-native
species imported to clear out the weeds in Texas waterways _ is a
better fighter than redfish, more aggressive than mullet. And, best
of all, it thrives in polluted urban waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live in Montana,'' Marmon said, ``can go to the
edge of town and have a nice trout stream. What we do is the same
thing, but we don't need to leave town. We just go down to the
bayou. There are some big Mamous in there.''
</P>
<P>
   For state conservationists, though, the grass carp is an
omnivorous horror _ a prime example of the peril of bringing
foreign species into a new setting.
</P>
<P>
   State biologists introduced many of the fish into East Texas
waterways to eat weeds, said Larry McKinney, Texas Department of
Parks and Wildlife's senior aquatics director. But those fish were
sterile. Other carp, introduced by individuals were not sterile _
and the result was alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Once the carp ate the noxious weeds, experts said, they just
kept eating and eating. All lake life fell victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are voracious eaters,'' McKinney said. ``Some years ago
at Lake Conroe, there were so many grass carp that they cleared all
the vegetation out. I couldn't believe it until I saw it myself,
but they then ate the grass from lawns at the water's edge and
leaves from the low-hanging branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a browse line along the lake shore two to three
inches from the water.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`IT'S A HORRIBLE PLANT' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Root by root, tendril by tendril, plants are the stealthy
predators on the Dirty Dozen list.
</P>
<P>
   Countless East Texas streams are clogged with the
purple-blossomed water hyacinth, which began spreading through
Louisiana bayous after it was exhibited at a New Orleans
agriculture exhibition in the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   In West Texas, the tamarisk or salt cedar _ commonly used as
windbreaks in the desert Southwest _ fill riverbeds and suck
springs dry.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the Chinese tallow _ loved for its brilliant
crimson fall foliage _ is rampaging across the once-pristine
grasslands that surround Galveston Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salt cedar is an arid land plant that has adapted by
robbing water,'' said Fort Davis-based Nature Conservancy biologist
John Karges. ``They extend a deep, deep tap root at the expense of
other things with shallow roots. They're like pine trees in that
they are covered with needles. So they have a huge evaporative
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sterilize the soil, or shade it, so other plants can't
grow. And another thing the little bugger does _ it reproduces and
moves around by wind. You can cut down a tree, but if it's flowered
and produced seed, there will be billions of seeds carried on the
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Karges said a 1961 survey found the salt cedar infested at least
14,000 square miles of the desert Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying that salt cedars have stolen more water from
the Pecos River than the states of Texas and New Mexico ever have
fought over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Galveston County, the Chinese tallow is running
amok over thousands of acres.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, the fast-growing tree's seeds were used in the
manufacture of vegetable tallow for candles and soap; the tree was
introduced to the United States in the 1700s by Benjamin Franklin.
As late as the 1950s, government agencies distributed free tallow
seeds to Gulf Coast farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Park and Wildlife's McKinney lamented, ``It's a
horrible plant. Not many things can eat it. It doesn't have much
structure. And it can displace an entire, diverse fauna.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dumesnil, who manages a Nature Conservancy marsh preserve
in Matagorda County, said tallows, like salt cedars, may poison the
ground around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When tallows come into an area,'' he said, ``they basically
out-compete everything else. It's been said that tallow don't
support invertebrates _ beetles, worms _ that benefit warblers and
other insect-feeding birds. That's to say their wildlife value is
minimal to zero.'' Conservationists battle the trees with
herbicides, selective burning and &UR;  &LR; digging up seedlings. Still the
tallows continue to spread.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, roughly 2 percent of Galveston County was infested by
the trees. By 1990, that area had grown to 16 percent, and by next
year, the infestations likely will have increased to 31 percent of
the county, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
YES, THERE'S A PIG PROBLEM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They're the hogs from hell _ a classic case of Jurassic pork.
</P>
<P>
   Night after night, marauding through West Texas' scenic Davis
Mountains, the wild pigs plow up acre upon acre in a grunting,
squealing feeding frenzy. Nothing stops them. When the pigs are on
the prowl, even mountain lions stand aside.
</P>
<P>
   The pigs _ some thought to be the descendants of hogs brought to
America by Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto in the 1500s _ long
have been a fixture in the East Texas piney woods and the South
Texas chaparral. Now, though, they have spread to the state's most
remote regions. Wildlife experts at Texas A&AMP;M University estimate
the wild hogs are present in more than 200 of the state's 254
counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are becoming quite a problem,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very large feral hogs,'' said Karges. ``They go to wet
areas and wallow. Rocks the size of bread boxes are flipped up. The
ground looks like it's been churned up with bulldozers.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said he has found acre upon acre turned up to a depth
of 2 feet by rooting hogs. ``It looked just like a plowed field,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the markings of captured hogs, Karges said he
believes many are the offspring of domestic porkers that have
escaped captivity. ``In just a few generations, they will revert to
a thin-wasted feral type,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The animals are prodigious breeders, birthing several litters a
year, and formidable fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a mountain lion comes upon a straggler, it's bacon,''
Karges said. ``But mother sows can be quite fierce. Lions normally
won't tangle with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The hogs' threat to endangered species comes from their
willingness to eat anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very wide spectrum of foods they will eat,'' said
Dumesnil in Matagorda County. ``There's predation on small
ground-nesting birds; they'll eat the eggs. They'll eat snakes.
They'll eat dead animals if they're relatively fresh.''

SOUTH TEXAS CITY TRIES TO STEER ITS YOUTH AWAY FROM GANGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DONNA, Texas _ This small Rio Grande Valley city has been in the
news plenty of times, but for all the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, local headlines have detailed the growing
influence of gangs and a rise of satanic worship, against a
backdrop of crooked cops, rampant drug trafficking, chronic
political in-fighting between two factions over control of City
Hall and a water system that almost went dry.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the ghoulish murder of a 12-year-old boy last spring
that caused residents of this dirt-poor town to focus on one major
problem _ how to keep their children from going astray.
</P>
<P>
   ``This murder that happened in Donna was a wake-up call,''
insists Police Chief Miguel Carreon. ``If we didn't do anything
about the gang problem by paying attention to these kids, we're
going to have the same thing happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Carreon said the murder of David Cardenas last April raised
questions about who is minding the children in Donna.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, a seventh-grader living with an older sister, was
murdered shortly after he was dropped off by a family member near a
neighborhood store on a Friday evening. Because relatives thought
he was staying with members of his extended family, he was not
missed until he failed to come home from school the following
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to do something about it,'' Carreon said. ``And
one thing I've seen in this community _ after this tragedy with the
12-year-old _ we're getting more involved; citizens are getting
more involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Carreon has ample reason to worry about the town's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Donna is a city of 15,000 without any large industries, a town
where city parks have been stripped of playground equipment by
vandals and where the city swimming pool was filled in years ago
because it was too expensive to repair. About 85 percent to 90
percent of the residents live at or below the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   With many Donna households headed by single mothers attempting
to raise large families with limited time for teens, the lure of
gangs is powerful. In the past, Donna police have documented the
existence of 26 gangs in the city; they say 23 are currently
active.
</P>
<P>
   Gang-related graffiti marks walls, abandoned houses and
businesses throughout the town despite a stepped-up effort by
police to crack down on spray-painting ``taggers'' and gang
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need are jobs,'' asserts the police chief.
</P>
<P>
   At the Donna Chamber of Commerce, executive director Sylvia
Escamilla tries to organize activities for youngsters. On this
year's calendar are health fairs, car shows, beauty pageants,
appreciation days for notable citizens and safe Halloween
activities. All the details are faithfully faxed by Escamilla to
local media outlets on letterheads with the chamber's hopeful
slogan, ``A New Beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show we were doing something. I send all my press
releases to the newspaper to show Donna is back in gear, or in the
right gear,'' Escamilla said. ``And it's all about getting people
involved. Stop the politics, stop the gossip and let's concentrate
on Donna.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems Donna has with gangs are in some instances
imported, since the school district draws in students from an
89-square-mile area _ far beyond the town limits. Ringing the town
are nearly 60 ``colonias,'' the Spanish word for unincorporated
subdivisions that often lack basic services, and in many of these
remote neighborhoods gangs seem to rule by default.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say 85 percent of the people in the Donna school
district are living at or below the poverty level,'' said David
Simmons, who is the district's tax collector and also chief of the
Donna Volunteer Fire Department. ``I go out and visit the
`colonias' and I see it. We have people living in buses, and it's
like Third World conditions. It's unbelievable, but we have it in
the Donna city limits, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna school officials are trying a number of strategies. For
the last three years, they have used student mediators to counsel
other students having difficulties _ a project known by its acronym
PALS, Peer Assistance and Leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The district also operates a student mentoring program, pairing
troubled students with local college and high school students with
good track records.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Zambrano, at-risk coordinator for the schools, has asked
the school district to boost the 60-student capacity of the
alternative learning center by 50 percent. The center houses
students referred for discipline, attendance, poor grades and other
offenses. But being part of a gang is still a reality in Donna,
Zambrano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come (to the center) from high school or junior
high, nine times out of 10 when asked they will say, `Yes, I'm
either a gang member or I hang out with gang members,''' Zambrano
said.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of diminishing the gangs' sway on youth, Donna citizens
are attempting to revitalize the Boys and Girls Club housed in an
old National Guard armory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna needs to take care of the kids,'' said Barbara Deschner,
a Brooklyn, N.Y., native who was hired last month to run the club.
``They need activities for children, they need programs, they need
services, they need a safety net in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids don't have anything to fall back on. They come from
the poorest homes in the country, unemployment is horrible. They
don't know what it's like to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Deschner said she was appalled to learn that 80 percent of the
children who come to the club have never left town, not even to
visit nearby South Padre Island or a museum or zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs, the wants and the desire are out there,'' she said.
``The money is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'd like to take the kids to see the ocean, but we
don't have any transportation. We couldn't even take them to the
city pool if there was one.''
</P>
<P>
   The club operates almost entirely on grants from outside the
town, and Deschner has no illusions about the availability of local
funding. Instead, she is applying for more grants and trying to
bring a host of youth reading and sports programs underwritten by
large corporations. The club is also looking for a surplus school
bus to shuttle kids from outlying ``colonias'' into town to use the
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to do this on $64,000 a year, and to serve these
kids properly I'd need $250,000 a year. But the community is in
such an impoverished condition that there's no money to raise,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the townsfolk are doing what they can.
</P>
<P>
   The police association held a benefit barbecue and donated the
proceeds to the club. Volunteers have removed the club's boarded-up
windows during a cleanup two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some city officials, like tax collector Simmons, believe the
political bickering has shifted the focus from improving the
community and brought unwarranted negative attention to the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Donna just gets kicked around, and I blame a lot of it on
politics,'' said Simmons. ``These groups are just too busy fighting
among themselves, getting their people (elected), and they're not
thinking about the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But the consequences of ignoring the needs of Donna's youth are
too great to ignore, warns Deschner. ``We either build them up, or
we build prisons.''

COURT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SUE NCAA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday made it harder to sue
the National Collegiate Athletic Association under a law banning
sex bias in educational programs receiving federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling unanimously, the court said that while the NCAA receives
dues from federally financed colleges and universities, that does
not open it to lawsuits under the anti-bias law known as Title IX
of the Education Acts of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   However, the justices left open the possibility that such
lawsuits still may be allowed. The justices told a lower appellate
court to consider other arguments raised by Renee Smith, an Ohio
woman who says she was illegally declared ineligible to play
intercollegiate volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had argued the NCAA can be sued because the dues it
receives from member schools makes it an indirect recipient of
federal funds. But the high court disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At most, the association's receipt of dues demonstrates that
it indirectly benefits from the federal assistance afforded its
members,'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. ``This
showing, without more, is insufficient to trigger Title IX
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's lawyer, Carter G. Phillips of Washington, D.C., said he
was not concerned about today's ruling, adding that Smith has a
good chance of convincing the lower court she still should be
allowed to sue the NCAA because schools have given it control of
athletic programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly live to fight another day,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   During arguments in January, the NCAA's lawyers told the court
that the association was not a federal aid recipient and that
athletes should take up discrimination complaints with the
individual schools.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who lives in Wintersville, Ohio, played volleyball for
St. Bonaventure University in the 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons. She
chose not to participate in the next season, and she graduated in
two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   Smith later pursued a graduate degree at Hofstra University and
a law degree at the University of Pittsburgh. At each, her attempts
to play two more seasons of volleyball were blocked by an NCAA rule
that bars graduate students from competing in intercollegiate
athletics at a school other than the one from which they earned
their undergraduate degree.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawsuit said the NCAA grants men a disproportionate number
of waivers from that eligibility rule. The NCAA said more men seek
such waivers and added that a higher percentage of women are
granted them.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District Court judge threw out Smith's lawsuit, but the
3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated her Title IX claim
last year, saying the NCAA was not ``merely an incidental
beneficiary of federal funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision overturned that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entities that receive federal assistance, whether directly or
through an intermediary, are recipients within the meaning of Title
IX; entities that only benefit economically from federal assistance
are not,'' Ginsburg wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The justices returned the case to the 3d Circuit appeals court
to hear Smith's arguments that she should be allowed to sue the
NCAA under Title IX because it receives federal funds through the
National Youth Sports Program and on grounds that schools have
handed controlling authority over athletic programs to the NCAA.

PAUL ROBESON: BELITTLED, OSTRACIZED _ BUT UNBOWED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year would have marked the 100th birthday of Paul Robeson,
actor, singer, linguist, athlete, scholar, author, political
activist and perceived threat, whose human rights achievements have
been all but belittled in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations and retrospectives have been held across the nation
in honor of the man who adhered to his convictions and paid the
heaviest of prices. An attempt to correct a terrible mishandling of
history? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But also consider this: The controversial Malcolm X has been
honored with a U.S. postage stamp, but there has been no such
recognition for Robeson. Apparently, in mainstream America,
Robeson's achievements are still tainted by the perception _
accurate or not _ that he clothed himself in communism and was
nothing less than a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesdaty night, PBS airs one of the more fairly reported
examinations of Robeson's life. Two hours in length, ``Paul
Robeson: Here I Stand'' uses interviews with friends and family
(including his son, Paul Robeson Jr.), personal papers, letters,
private films, confidential political documents, medical records
and Robeson's wife's diaries.
</P>
<P>
   To thoroughly understand Robeson is to understand the struggles
in which he was engaged and the times in which he engaged in them.
He refused to let success blind him to racism. He refused to sing
before segregated audiences, campaigned against lynching, urged
Congress to outlaw racial barriers in baseball. He spoke on behalf
of aborigine civil rights. As the Cold War intensified, his
political views made him an increasingly controversial figure.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Robeson refused to accept racial servility in
exchange for a position as a privileged black man.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government and its security agencies, such as the FBI,
which kept tabs on Robeson from the 1940s almost until his death in
1976, would have overlooked his support of the Soviet Union, the
American trade union movement, and even his championing of Africa
and African-Americans, if he'd shown the slightest willingness to
accept racial deference and his ``place.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Robeson's pro-Soviet positions remain controversial, we
should recall that his so-called crimes were merely unpopular
ideas, not necessarily active disloyalty to this country. Wednesday
night's documentary shows how, at the height of Robeson's
popularity, he was a national symbol and cultural leader in the war
against fascism abroad and racism at home. ``Here I Stand'' also
documents in detail his downfall. During the McCarthy era, he was
discredited because of his political views and dedication to the
cause of civil rights. The persecution reached a climax in 1950
when Robeson's passport was revoked; he fought for eight years to
get it back.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the FBI and State Department killed his career. There
were no more concerts, recordings, theater, radio broadcasts,
publications.
</P>
<P>
   As writer Lloyd Brown puts it, ``Paul Robeson was the most
persecuted, the most ostracized, the most condemned black man in
America, then or ever.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``Here I Stand'' makes clear is that Robeson's politics
left too large a moral stain on his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   All most history books offer on Robeson is this story: He was
the son of a runaway slave and became the third black man to attend
Rutgers University. An all-American football player, he graduated
from Columbia Law School (he left the profession because no one
would work with a black lawyer) and was the first black man to play
Othello.
</P>
<P>
   Was he a communist? His son, Paul Robeson Jr., says he was not.
The elder Robeson would never answer the question because he
thought it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But Robeson's support of the Soviet Union had less to do with
communism than with his support of freedom, of labor, ]of people of
color, and of working people around the world.

FOOD 'ZINES RAISE COVER PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Food lovers grumble about higher prices, real or perceived, for
bottled water, California wines and a dish of risotto. Now another
of their indulgences undeniably costs more.
</P>
<P>
   Even though consumer prices are holding steady on average,
nearly all the major food magazines have raised their cover prices
recently, from a few pennies to a couple of dollars: on the
newsstand, food costs more than fashion these days. But subscribers
are not affected yet, and those who buy retail seem not to have
reacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even notice that the price of Saveur went up,'' said
Paige Watson, the vice president of Broadway Panhandler, a cookware
store in New York. ``I haven't heard any comments from my customers
about it. The food magazines just fly off the shelves here. And
people have been paying $5.95 for Fine Cooking all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Saveur, published by Meigher Communications, has raised its
cover price to $6 from $5. ``We wish to continue to be the
premium-price magazine,'' said publisher David Kahn. ``Across the
board, affluent consumers are paying more for better quality,
whether it's microbrews from the Anderson Valley or single-malt
scotch from Islay.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saveur's approach to its subscription price is quite the
opposite: it has started offering eight issues, a year's worth, for
$19.95, down from $29.95, and says the lower price will be in
effect nationwide by the end of the year. ``Our advertisers
demanded it,'' Kahn said. ``Advertising correlates directly with
subscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Saveur's single copy sales, accounting for about 13 percent of
total sales, fell 3 percent over the past year, while subscriptions
rose 11 percent, according to a preliminary report by the Audit
Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   At Cook's Illustrated, which went to $4.95 from $3.95, the
publisher and editor, Christopher Kimball, said that a test on
newsstands last year ``found we sold more copies at the higher
price.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With our subscription price of $24.95 for six issues, what we
have done is make an adjustment so people no longer pay less for a
single copy than subscribers,'' he said, adding that his magazine,
which has no ads and is supported by newsstand sales and
subscriptions, isn't especially price sensitive. ``Ours is a
dedicated reader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Shanken, the editor and publisher of Wine Spectator,
which went to $3.95 a copy in January from $2.95, said ``the new
price is a fair price that recognizes the usefulness and quality of
the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charging less,'' he said, ``was actually demeaning to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Food Arts, which he also publishes, he said the new $6
price, up from $4, was ``fair.'' The glossy magazine is a trade
publication, with 92 percent of copies given to professionals free
and few sold retail.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Walker, the chairman of Walker Communications, a
consulting company, said that prices for all magazines, not just
those specializing in food, are rising, in part because wholesale
distributors are consolidating. ``There used to be hundreds of
local companies and it was easier for publishers to make deals,''
he said. ``Now there are less than 50 across the country. The
magazines used to be able to count on 45 percent of the price. Now
they're getting less.'' He said publishers also want to increase
revenues from circulation, not just advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Food &AMP; Wine led the pack, going to $3.95 from $3.50 in
September. In January, Cooking Light raised its price to $3.50 from
$2.95.
</P>
<P>
   But the price of Bon Appetit and Gourmet, both published by
Conde Nast, has crept up this year only to $2.99, from $2.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some testing and found that consumers did not react to
the increase, but it has real implications for us in terms of
revenue,'' said Susan Blattman, consumer marketing director for Bon
Appetit, whose total circulation is about 1 million. ``It's become
an industry-wide phenomenon, and we think there's room for us to
increase the price further.''

<P>
   Four or five of us were sitting in my dorm room in 1987, bored
and broke, discussing what we'd do after college besides owe money.
Someone said he planned to be a famous singer, proving that even in
Claremore, Okla., hope could spring within the soon-to-be
disillusioned hearts of freshmen at Will Rogers State Junior
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' I said, ``my great aunt is Patti Page.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patti Page. Like the street.'' Claremore, her birthplace, had
named a street after her: Patti Page Boulevard. ``She says talent
isn't enough. She says you need luck more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The singer-to-be _ I forget his name _ stared at me, puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean to tell me,'' he said, incredulous, ``that they named
your aunt after a street sign?''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was, as it has always been. My contemporaries are
unimpressed with my claim to relative fame: Aunt Patti, 71, who
charted an incredible 111 singles from 1948 to 1982, Billboard's
greatest female pop star ever, a k a my granny's sister. When I was
7, the strangers I accosted at airports (''My great aunt is Patti
Page!'') had no idea whom I was talking about. Now, thanks to my
generation's appropriation of the cocktail culture, there is a hint
of recognition. Still, ask them to name the person whose sobriquet
was ``the singing rage,'' and they're likely to answer, ``Courtney
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm hopeful that Wednesday night's Grammy Awards will change her
Q-rating, if only slightly. (She's up for her wonderful performance
on ``Live at Carnegie Hall _ the 50th Anniversary Concert.'')
Although it's questionable whether Aunt Patti's category, Best
Traditional Pop Vocal Performance, will be televised, she may at
least be able to claim the title ``Grammy winner,'' a designation
that means more to my generation than it should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited, but I'm realistic,'' Aunt Patti says from her
home in Del Mar, Calif. (She's already picked out a new dress for
the show, one that ``hides what I've put on over the years.'') ``If
I don't win, that's fine. But I think the idea of this Grammy is to
honor what I've done in the business. If that brings new fans,
that's great. But it's not like I'm going to be on MTV soon.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone need not worry about her place in the pop-music
pantheon, it's Patti Page. Born Clara Ann Fowler in 1927, the
second-youngest of 11 children, Aunt Patti performed as Ann Fowler
until she took over a radio spot called ``Meet Patti Page,'' a
fictitious corporate spokeswoman for Tulsa's Page Milk Co. She was
discovered and went to Chicago to sign with the fledgling Mercury
Records. In 1948, with a song written for Vic Damone, ``Confess,''
Aunt Patti had her first hit. It also marked a trademark studio
trick of hers that she repeated on several songs, using multi-track
recordings of herself to provide the background vocals instead of
using an orchestra. (She still makes sure to tell youngsters that
she used the technique before Les Paul.) By 1950, she had her first
No. 1 hit, ``All My Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, she made history with a B-side single to the
Christmas tune ``Boogie Woogie Santa Claus.'' She was finishing up
a show at the Copacabana in New York when people started yelling at
her to ``sing the waltz!'' She didn't realize it, but the fans were
referring to the Christmas tune's B-side, ``Tennessee Waltz,''
which soon topped the pop charts. ``We called up the Mercury
distributor and said, what waltz are they talking about?'' she
says. ``He said, `You must have your head in the sand. We've had to
order more records three times already.''' ``Waltz'' became the
third-bestselling single in history (after Bing Crosby's ``White
Christmas'' and the new champ, Elton John's ``Candle in the Wind
1997'').
</P>
<P>
   She was a huge star throughout the decade, hosting her own TV
variety show _ she received much flak from outraged racists when
she kissed Nat King Cole on the cheek after he performed on her
show _ and cutting more hit records. Her last pop hit, in 1965, was
the title track to the film ``Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte.'' All
told, she sold more than 100 million records.
</P>
<P>
   Many were country songs. In fact, Aunt Patti is widely seen as
the first ``crossover'' artist. Although many C&AMP;W traditionalists
despise Aunt Patti's simple, sweet ballads, her success helped pave
the way for Nashville's boom. As Bob Allen and Pete Loesch wrote in
``The Blackwell Guide to Country Music'':
</P>
<P>
   ``At the outset of the '50s, country music was still very much a
rural cult music in terms of its ... `demographic appeal.' Even in
the late '50s, sales of 25,000 on a country hit were deemed
respectable. Yet at the same time, artists like Patti Page and
Rosemary Clooney were having million-sellers with country songs ...
recorded in a pop style. Thus the sound of ringing cash registers
and the allure of the more lucrative pop-crossover market became
the inspiration for the `Nashville sound' ... (which) shaped the
course of country music ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   So here's hoping that the Grammys, which are supposed to honor
the best in pop and country, give something back to Aunt Patti, who
meant so much to both genres. The awards themselves look pretty
hefty, so if she does win, the next time someone asks if she was
named after a street sign, maybe she'll let me use it to knock the
fool upside his head.

PAUL ROBESON: BELITTLED, OSTRACIZED _ BUT UNBOWED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year would have marked the 100th birthday of Paul Robeson,
actor, singer, linguist, athlete, scholar, author, political
activist and perceived threat, whose human rights achievements have
been all but belittled in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations and retrospectives have been held across the nation
in honor of the man who adhered to his convictions and paid the
heaviest of prices. An attempt to correct a terrible mishandling of
history? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But also consider this: The controversial Malcolm X has been
honored with a U.S. postage stamp, but there has been no such
recognition for Robeson. Apparently, in mainstream America,
Robeson's achievements are still tainted by the perception _
accurate or not _ that he clothed himself in communism and was
nothing less than a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesdaty night, PBS airs one of the more fairly reported
examinations of Robeson's life. Two hours in length, ``Paul
Robeson: Here I Stand'' uses interviews with friends and family
(including his son, Paul Robeson Jr.), personal papers, letters,
private films, confidential political documents, medical records
and Robeson's wife's diaries.
</P>
<P>
   To thoroughly understand Robeson is to understand the struggles
in which he was engaged and the times in which he engaged in them.
He refused to let success blind him to racism. He refused to sing
before segregated audiences, campaigned against lynching, urged
Congress to outlaw racial barriers in baseball. He spoke on behalf
of aborigine civil rights. As the Cold War intensified, his
political views made him an increasingly controversial figure.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, Robeson refused to accept racial servility in
exchange for a position as a privileged black man.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government and its security agencies, such as the FBI,
which kept tabs on Robeson from the 1940s almost until his death in
1976, would have overlooked his support of the Soviet Union, the
American trade union movement, and even his championing of Africa
and African-Americans, if he'd shown the slightest willingness to
accept racial deference and his ``place.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Robeson's pro-Soviet positions remain controversial, we
should recall that his so-called crimes were merely unpopular
ideas, not necessarily active disloyalty to this country. Wednesday
night's documentary shows how, at the height of Robeson's
popularity, he was a national symbol and cultural leader in the war
against fascism abroad and racism at home. ``Here I Stand'' also
documents in detail his downfall. During the McCarthy era, he was
discredited because of his political views and dedication to the
cause of civil rights. The persecution reached a climax in 1950
when Robeson's passport was revoked; he fought for eight years to
get it back.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the FBI and State Department killed his career. There
were no more concerts, recordings, theater, radio broadcasts,
publications.
</P>
<P>
   As writer Lloyd Brown puts it, ``Paul Robeson was the most
persecuted, the most ostracized, the most condemned black man in
America, then or ever.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``Here I Stand'' makes clear is that Robeson's politics
left too large a moral stain on his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   All most history books offer on Robeson is this story: He was
the son of a runaway slave and became the third black man to attend
Rutgers University. An all-American football player, he graduated
from Columbia Law School (he left the profession because no one
would work with a black lawyer) and was the first black man to play
Othello.
</P>
<P>
   Was he a communist? His son, Paul Robeson Jr., says he was not.
The elder Robeson would never answer the question because he
thought it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But Robeson's support of the Soviet Union had less to do with
communism than with his support of freedom, of labor, ]of people of
color, and of working people around the world.

'80S SYMBOLS WE WANNA SEE ON OFFICIAL U.S. POSTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who'd've thought that the decade that brought us MTV and
Reaganomics would turn into a philatelist's dream? Here's the deal:
The good people of the neither-rain-snow-nor-sleet mind-set are
honoring the '80s as part of their ``Celebrate the Century''
program. They've picked images for potential stamps from five
categories and are asking we-the-people to vote for up to three of
our favorites in each category. Balloting, which continues until
the end of this month, is set up on a Web site, stampvote.msn.com.
</P>
<P>
   We can't help but love the people who gave us the handy phrase
``going postal,'' but we think they missed some of the '80s icons
of popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Here, respectfully submitted, are our write-in votes.
</P>
<P>
   Category: Lifestyle
</P>
<P>
   Their picks: Video games, aerobics, minivans, mountain biking,
Cabbage Patch Kids, camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Our choice: Cup holders.
</P>
<P>
   Those wacky postal workers were close, but any soccer mom can
tell you that minivans are OK, but cup holders rock. These nifty
little devices were the real selling points of the minivans. To
each kid, his own juice receptacle, we say. And to each
kid-chauffeur, a sense of peace.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Category: Science &AMP; Technology
</P>
<P>
   Their picks: Personal computers, AIDS awareness, space shuttle
program, compact discs, cable TV, gene mapping
</P>
<P>
   Our choice: Atari's Donkey Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Cable TV? Wasn't that a '70s thing? We suggest replacing it with
the Atari series of video games, specifically Donkey Kong, because
who didn't spend endless zombified hours getting joystick cramp
while trying to reach the next level in this cleverly animated
video game? Sure, it was the same two levels, repeated ad nauseam.
But who could grow tired of battling a giant ape that hurls
fireballs and beer barrels at an Italian plumber? Most importantly,
it introduced the world to Nintendo's future cash cow, Mario. And
by the way, where's the Mario Brothers stamp?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Category: People &AMP; Events
</P>
<P>
   Their picks: Vladimir Horowitz's first Soviet Union concert in
61 years, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the freeing of the American
hostages in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Our choice: ``We Are the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Lighten up, mailmen and -women. Why not choose an event that was
historically and politically important but also involves lots of
easily mocked egos? This was the epitome of rock-star self-impor
... er, charity, in which Michael Jackson and Lionel Ritchie wrote
a song about starving people in Africa, invited several of their
well-fed friends along to sing the song in a video that played
endlessly, and then dropped the subject for most of what remained
of the rest of their careers. We dare the Postal Service to fit all
those big heads on one stamp.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Category: Sports
</P>
<P>
   Their picks: NCAA March Madness, figure skating, Senior PGA
Tour, the Lakers vs. the Celtics, San Francisco 49ers, beach
volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Our choice: William ``The Refrigerator'' Perry doing ``The Super
Bowl Shuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the 49ers had the dynasty, winning three Super Bowls in
the '80s. But the Chicago Bears better exemplified that decade of
excess. In Jim McMahon, they had a bad-boy quarterback with an MTV
haircut (he even appeared on the cover of ``Rolling Stone),'' and
they did a ``music video,'' for crying out loud, featuring all
300-pounds-plus of behemoth lineman ``The Refrigerator,'' shakin'
his booty and rappin' (to be charitable) to ``The Super Bowl
Shuffle.'' Seemed like a real act of hubris till da Bears won that
year. Then it just seemed like an act of cheesiness, and cheesiness
must be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Category: Arts &AMP; Entertainment
</P>
<P>
   Their picks: ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' hip-hop culture,
country music, ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' (the book, not the
movie), ``Cats,'' ``The Cosby Show''
</P>
<P>
   Our choice: A dazzling collage of Michael Jackson's glove,
Madonna's bangles and Mr. T's gold chains.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, nothing said entertainment like bizarre fashion
accessories (besides, why would the Postal Service want to feature
``E.T.'' when the alien communicated by phone?). Heck, why stop at
just three things? There's ZZ Top's beards, Prince's purple
vestments, Bruce Springsteen's denim-clad rear end in front of an
American flag, Spandau Ballet's skinny ties, Cyndi Lauper's
multicolored ... everything, and, of course, hair bands, parachute
pants and spandex.

GIRLS FINALLY GET TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am glad that women's sports are thriving and attracting fans
of all ages, races and sexes. For many women, baby boomers and
beyond, that success is a small bit of retribution for all those
years when we were told that girls are not good at sports. With
time has come enlightenment and more opportunities for young ladies
to pursue their interest in sports. Hooray for time.
</P>
<P>
   It's too late for me, though. No one ever tossed the baseball
around with me in the front yard. No one demonstrated the proper
method to soften up a new catcher's mitt with that oily, creamy
stuff. See? I still don't know what it's called. No one put a ball
on a stick and stood by patiently while I took swing after swing
and somehow managed to miss the large stationary sphere. By the
way, that's pretty funny if you haven't seen it. To this day, I
can't play a position in the outfield because I can throw a ball
only about 20 yards without pulling a muscle. No one ever really
taught me how to throw a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Given my background, I understood why little 6-year-old Bruce
didn't pick his best friend, Holly, to be on his baseball team on
that merciless, hot July day at the park. Bruce and Fuji were the
team captains. One by one, they selected players from the group of
kids assembled there. Holly was sure that Bruce would select her,
maybe not first, but eventually, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. He left her standing there. In fact, she was the last one
standing. She went to Fuji's team by default.
</P>
<P>
   Holly passed Bruce on her way to the catcher's position, which
is where they always put the worst player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you pick me?'' she asked him, her eyes filled to
the rim with tears. ``I'm your best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still my friend,'' he said. ``But you stink at
baseball. I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That made no sense to Holly, but Bruce wasn't trying to hurt her
feelings; he just wanted to win.
</P>
<P>
   The game didn't get off to a good start. Bruce's mostly-boy team
hit three home runs in a row. The girls in the outfield dropped the
balls or let them roll right by. They did manage to fire one ball
toward home plate just as Bruce's pitcher came blasting off of
third base like a cannon. Holly, at catcher, ducked and screamed as
ball and boy approached. The boys laughed at her, even the ones on
her team.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, somehow her team managed to tie the game going
into the last inning. Bruce was up to bat with two outs and a full
count. He hit a pop-up and much to Holly's dismay, she realized
that she would have to catch it. She spun around like a top trying
to follow the ball, then stuck out her hand and closed her eyes. To
our collective delight, some angel put the ball in her glove! But
that's as good as it gets, Holly struck out when her turn came to
bat and the game ended in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Holly asked Bruce, ``Are you still my best
friend?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said. ``And I'm gonna teach you how to bat, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So next time I can be on your team?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he said with a big grin.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's a start.
</P>
<P>
   You go, girls.
</P>

MAN ON A MISSION: ECOLOGIST BUILDS RESPECT FOR THE RAIN FOREST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Wayne Takeuchi first went into the vast rain
forest of Papua New Guinea 11 years ago searching for medicinal
plants that could be used by the National Cancer Institute in the
fight against cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Today, under private grants, the Hawaii native works with the
indigenous clans of the largest island nation in the South Pacific,
teaching them to value the plants for their own sake _ whether they
are ever developed into wonder drugs or not _ and showing them how
to use their natural resources without depleting them over the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 95 percent of the plant specimens growing in New
Guinea are found nowhere else in the world, Takeuchi says, and
although most of the people of New Guinea live in palm-leaf and
bamboo huts and get their food, fuel, medicine and virtually all of
life's raw materials from the forest, they take their natural
treasures for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Takeuchi, who has worked for the Botanical Research Institute of
Texas the past three years, made his first visit to Fort Worth last
week to meet with his associates at BRIT, which is headquartered
here.
</P>
<P>
   In what is known as an Integrated Conservation and Development
Program, Takeuchi is helping a group of 50 clans collect and index
their plants and develop ecotourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for them to believe people will pay just to see the
rain forest,'' Takeuchi says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I help them assess the value of nontimber products, such as
nuts and ecotourism. Things they can do on their own to improve
their economy without sacrificing any of their natural resources,''
says Takeuchi, 46. ``The developing world is very protective of
their biological wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bioprospecting _ finding and developing plants for their
economic value _ has become a political hot potato, and the Papua
New Guinea government has called a temporary halt to that form of
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing now is pure research, not economic
development,'' says Sy Sohmer, BRIT's director, who worked with the
forest service in New Guinea 20 years ago. ``We teach them to
evaluate the resources they have by international protocols.''
</P>
<P>
   Those resources appear to be vast.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1979, every time I went out into the forest, half the
specimens I would bring back would be brand new,'' Sohmer says. ``I
cataloged 127 specimens of trees and shrubs, and half were new
discoveries.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 90 percent of the large South Pacific island was covered
with primary rain forest then.
</P>
<P>
   No one has any idea how many new specimens are still to be
discovered in New Guinea. Thousands of square miles of primary rain
forest _ about 65 percent to 70 percent of the island _ remain with
trees taller than 20-story buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 20 completely unknown areas remaining,'' says John
Pipoly, head of BRIT's floras program. ``We have only satellite
images of them. No biological scientist has ever set foot there.''
</P>
<P>
   By helping the people of New Guinea preserve their own
biological wealth, BRIT also hopes to help, in part, to protect the
world against disasters associated with El Nino's wide-ranging
climatic impact such as last summer's fires in Mexico, greenhouse
gases and global warming, Sohmer says.
</P>
<P>
   Fires destroyed more natural resources around the world in the
last two years than at any other time in recorded history. Many of
the fires were started by people but quickly blazed out of control
due to high temperatures and lack of rain. Thousands of acres of
grassland and rain forests in New Guinea burned, including
protected areas.
</P>
<P>
   When you destroy the forests, you destroy insurance against
future natural disasters, Sohmer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not finding out what the plants are good for, but we are
training the people who live there and own them to be the best
possible stewards of them so they won't just disappear,'' Pipoly
says. ``The stewards of the world are the people living in the
forests and savannas and grasslands.''

HOTEL BARS: SOME OF THE CITY'S MOST SECLUDED OASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City is filled with unappreciated treasures.
But in the world of food and drink, none are so neglected as hotel
bars.
</P>
<P>
   They have been here for ages, planted like pillars around the
city. Many are elegantly decorated, like miniatures of the grand
hotels that engulf them. And perhaps it is for that reason that
they tend to be overlooked by New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the barrier of the hotel lobbies lay some of the
city's most secluded oases, where you can relax over a well-mixed
drink, be treated like a king, or simply be as anonymous as the
bars themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Spending time in one, in fact, can be as much of an escape as a
walk in Central Park _ a brush with seclusion and quiet, a moment
to step out of your citified soul and collect your thoughts. But
unlike Central Park, a hotel bar offers you comfortable sofas,
tinkly music, a great selection of wine and liquor, and, often,
tasty _ and free _ salty snacks.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as you inquire about the protocol for getting a
table _ whether it's giving your name to the host at the King Cole
Bar at the St. Regis or calling ahead to the bar at Morgans Hotel
for a reservation _ you're likely to take to it as naturally as a
splash of vermouth to a jigger of gin.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel bar is indeed an unusual social confluence. From
morning to night, the clientele can vary from delicate women
sipping on rum to portly businessmen lighting up cigars. Some may
be hiding, hovering over a scotch, others may be waiting nervously
for a date to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers drift in and out. Regulars cling to their corners.
Women feel comfortable walking in alone.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel bars have long been a part of city life. When elegant
hotels began cropping up around the city in the last century, said
Michael Batterberry, a co-author with Ariane Batterberry of ``On
the Town in New York'' (Routledge, 1999), hoteliers depended on
their bars to make up for financial losses in their restaurants.
They pushed bar life, which was then customarily only for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They served as the public version of private men's clubs,''
Batterberry said. New York was a boom town then and so the bars
were open from early in the morning until late at night. Men went
there to socialize, to do business, to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Bartenders became creative salesmen. ``A first-rate bartender of
one of the great hotels of the last century was expected to
maintain a working repertory of at least 150 cocktails, shrubs,
slings, punches, cobblers, juleps, smashes, flips and nogs,'' the
Batterberrys write. ``These were consumed at all hours of the day
and night; `cocktails,' however, were first ordered only as
eye-openers.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the drinks may be less flashy, the hours shorter and
the drinkers perhaps less zealous, but that special something that
a hotel bar can capture is no less palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Many of city's hotel bars evoke another age. They have
wood-paneled walls, worn leather banquettes, and bartenders who
still consider drink mixing and casual conversation to be art
forms. Watching Jose Ortiz at the Bemelmans Bar in the Carlyle
Hotel is like watching a dancer. Every motion, from plucking a
napkin off of the stack to placing a skewer of olives over your
martini, is fluid and graceful.
</P>
<P>
   A hotel bartender's pace is generally slower than those in the
outside world, but they pay attention to you. Go a few times and
they will learn your name. You will learn theirs, too.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Winters, a money manager at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
has known Ortiz for 25 years. Other nights, when Winters arrives at
the King Cole Bar, he does not even feign a motion to order. As
soon as Wolfgang Hauck, one of the bartenders, sees him
approaching, he begins pouring him a glass of chardonnay and asks
him how he's been.
</P>
<P>
   If not for skillful bartending, then the snacks at some of the
hotel bars are reason enough to go. At the Bemelmans, for instance,
there are crisp little potato chips, made at the hotel, and pewter
bowls of fat, buttery cashews. Some hotel bars offer full menus.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oak Bar at the Plaza you can order oysters with a
martini, or depending on the strength of your stomach, a Reuben.
And if you manage to get a seat at the Fifty-Seven, Fifty-Seven bar
in the Four Seasons Hotel, don't pass up the food. The salmon
croquettes with caviar, the tuna sashimi, even the salad are all
exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Snacks and a friendly bartender can do wonders, too, to allay
the shock of the bill, which, without a drink, might be difficult
to take. Hotel bars are not cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, no price can be placed on the ambiance, or that
brief feeling of seclusion in a city where escape is the only
antidote to the daily chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The Classics
</P>
<P>
   From the marble tea room in the St. Regis Hotel, the King Cole
Bar may look like an opening to a dark cave, but inside it feels
more like a theater. All attention is drawn to the stage-like bar
and the fabulous Maxfield Parrish mural of King Cole on his throne,
which glows like a warm fire across the back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evenings, the bar is dotted with clusters of men in
suits, huddling in small groups and chewing on cigar ends. There
are often a couple or two who look as though they've been there for
years. The corners of the room are dark and the banquette seating
is low. It is a good place to disappear from the world.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But you are never completely unnoticed. Hauck, 43, the
bartender, keeps a close eye on the level of everyone's drink. On a
recent evening, a customer asked him how long he'd been there.
``Since the beginning of time,'' he said, then roared with
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't happen to be on your way to Lespinasse next
door, there is plenty to nibble on. In fact, bar snacks don't get
much better. A regular said you need a fork and knife to eat the
macadamia nuts in the mixed nuts, which are served in a silver
dish. That's about right.
</P>
<P>
   You can also order a sumptuous feast. That is, if you live on a
trust fund. Prosciutto and melon would be perfect with a martini
there; an order is $19.
</P>
<P>
   The Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle is just as dark and secluded,
but less boisterous. Piano sets twice a night temper the noise
level, and it is often quiet, especially on weeknights. It is a
place for a tete-a-tete, not a business deal.
</P>
<P>
   You can sit alone at the bar, mesmerized by Ortiz, a master of
the martini. On a recent evening, two well-dressed men sat a few
stools apart in silence. Both had been coming for decades. But they
had never met.
</P>
<P>
   The Hideaways
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hotel bars in the city are cloistered within their
hotels. They are small, intimate and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The bar in the Mark hotel, on the Upper East Side, for instance,
never really roars. The noise that rises from the people sitting in
the small hidden chamber is barely audible, more like a purr.
</P>
<P>
   A server in a tuxedo and a woman behind a small bar discreetly
look after their customers as if they were guests in their home. A
bucket of chilled Champagne is near the door and drinks are served
in small, delicate glasses.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of lit cigarettes and perfect manicures but as
in many of the best hotel bars around the city, the crowd is
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place is filled with fashion people,'' said Harriet
Jagger, an editor at Tatler magazine in London in town for Fashion
Week. ``They're from Harvey Nichols,'' she pointed, ``My friend
here's from French Vogue.'' Another night it was full of Asian
businessmen drinking Budweisers from bottles. You never know.
</P>
<P>
   There are even groups of young people settled into the forest
green sofas and miniature floral slipper chairs. ``I don't want to
go to bars that smell like my fraternity house,'' said Robert
Goner, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He does not go to make friends or to eat _ the hors d'oeuvres
are about as good as wedding food _ but to pause before going out
for the night. He has a martini and rounds up friends on his cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cafe Pierre, in the Pierre Hotel, is similar. Swathed in
floral patterns you would expect in a Fifth Avenue apartment, it is
a place you could take your grandmother for a Manhattan, or meet a
date.
</P>
<P>
   Journeys at the Essex House, though, with its masculine
wood-paneled walls and fireplace like a university club, might be
better for your grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The Lounges
</P>
<P>
   Boutique hotels like Morgans, the Mercer and W New York are
redefining hotel life with settings that feel more like downtown
clubs than corporate lobbies. And if you can actually find the
hotels _ few seem to have signs out front _ you will see that they
have also changed the concept of the hotel bar. They have become
more like lounges.
</P>
<P>
   At W New York, the lobby bar is furnished all in natural colors
with shared ottomans divided by triangular pillows and butcher
block tables with checkerboards burned into the top. It is a place
for sprawling and socializing; and the loungers are young.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans bar feels more like a cave. You descend a dark
staircase and enter through velvet curtains. The walls are brick
and hung with candles. A long underlit marble table that stretches
through the center of the room encourages mingling. It is loud and
dark, and you soon forget you are in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these boutique hotel bars teeter on the edge of
obnoxiousness. The long hall of 44 at the Royalton, for instance,
is austere and attracts a publishing crowd. It's the kind of place,
said Adam Peck, a television producer and regular, ``where you sit
there looking fabulous and aggravated.'' Perhaps it is the $13
drinks that are so ``aggravating,'' or the cement steps you must
sit on because all the sofas are taken.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Mercer, though, that exemplifies the kinks that these
new hipper-than-thou hotels need to work out. It feels like the
Calvin Klein store on Madison Avenue, and the hospitality can be
just as minimal. On a recent evening, an experience at the hotel
went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   I entered alone and sat down in a chair that looked comfortable.
All around me were knots of people, some of whom looked barely out
of their teens, dressed like they just walked out of Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   After many minutes, a server finally approached. Instead of
taking my order, she and asked me to move into the bar area: the
comfortable chairs were for hotel guests. So I did and I approached
an empty table. Then, a different server came over to tell me the
empty table was taken.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   I scanned the room and suggested a few places where I could
easily fit. She refused and then directed me to the bar downstairs.
There I stood for 10 minutes. No one approached this time. Not even
to take my order. It was a corner of neglect in one of New York's
most convivial arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a choice of some of the best hotel bars in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   BEMELMENS BAR The Carlyle, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600.
Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.; Sunday, noon to 1
a.m.; Monday, 11 a.m. to 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiance: Dark and sedate, with lots of corners to tuck in to.
Pianists at 5:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Both the daytime and nighttime
bartenders have been there for 40 years, so they know how to mix a
martini.
</P>
<P>
   CAFE PIERRE The Pierre, 2 East 61st Street; (212) 838-8000, ext.
6499. Hours: Daily, noon to 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiance: It could be a French Embassy tearoom. The bar is dark
and empty and the cheese puff snacks depressing; the beautifully
covered chairs that line the long, narrow room are the places to
settle in. A pianist begins playing at 8:30 p.m. daily.
</P>
<P>
   FIFTY-SEVEN, FIFTY-SEVEN The Four Seasons, 57 East 57th Street;
(212) 758-5757. Hours: Monday to Saturday, 3 p.m. to 1 a.m.;
Sunday, 3 p.m. to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiance: The drinks are as big and beefy as the pin-striped
clientele. It is a beautiful space paved with silky wood panels,
but not beautiful enough to make it worth battling the crowds at
cocktail time. Later, when tables are open, you can order off the
smart bar or restaurant menu: tuna sashimi, steak, even
strawberries with lemon sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   44 The Royalton, 44 West 44th Street; (212) 944-8844. Hours:
Tuesday to Saturday, 3 p.m. to 1:45 a.m.; Sunday to Monday, 3 p.m.
to 12:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiance: A sleek, austere corridor lobby filled with chic
women. At lunch and after work it has the volume of a college
cafeteria. Station your party in different spots to scout a free
table; or, if you're really ambitious, try to snag a seat in the
tiny, round vodka room. For $13 you can get a good Kir royale, a
hard cement step to sit on and a lot of attitude.
</P>
<P>
   JOURNEYS Essex House, 160 Central Park South (Avenue of the
Americas); (212) 484-5159. Hours: Sunday to Saturday, noon to 12:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiance: An old-style men's club with a lot of women filling up
the leather sofas. There is a fireplace with gas logs and a small
room with a fountain that's worth a peek.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wildly unpredicatable crowd. In a single evening you
could witness people making business deals, a failing blind date
and a group of 20-somethings whooping it up.
</P>
<P>
   KING COLE BAR The St. Regis, 2 East 55th Street; (212) 350-6998.
Hours: Monday to Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.; Friday and
Saturday, 11:30 a.m. to 2 a.m.; Sunday, noon to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiance: A theater-like setting with hosts who control the
seating like ushers. Go early or after 7 p.m., and dress well. The
many regulars do business on their cell phones or sit in silence.
If the bar nuts _ the best in town _ are not filling enough, there
is a menu with everything from chicken consomme to caviar. Make
friends with someone who will pay.
</P>
<P>
   MARK'S BAR The Mark, 25 East 77th Street, (212) 744-4300. Hours:
Daily, noon to 1 a.m.

CALIFORNIA PRICES STILL AT A PREMIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the year that California wine prices,
which have climbed steadily to what would have been unimaginable
levels a decade ago, eased off. At worst, the increases were
expected to slow down; at best, there might even be a few price
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The phylloxera epidemic, which decimated the North Coast
vineyards for a decade, had run its course. The old acreage was
coming back and thousands of new acres had been planted. The talk
in wine country was that winemakers would be filling swimming pools
with their surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Only it never happened. True, at 2.9 million tons, 1997 was the
biggest overall grape harvest ever in California. True, at 2.2
million, 1998 was the second biggest, but that was still a drop-off
of 13 percent from 1998, and so there remains a serious shortage of
wine. Good wine, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are buying wine _ expensive wine _ like crazy,''
said Jon Fredrikson, president of Gomberg &AMP; Fredrikson, wine
industry consultants in San Francisco. And as always, supply and
demand set the price.
</P>
<P>
   In Napa and Sonoma counties, the best-known American
viticultural areas, the 1998 crop was down 30 percent from 1997.
The important grapes suffered the most. Chardonnay was off 37
percent in Napa, 30 percent in Sonoma and 18 percent in Monterey.
Merlot, current darling of the suburban set, was off 10 percent
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   So grape prices rose: they went up 11 percent over all in Napa
last year and 10 percent in Sonoma. Prices for the top wine grapes
there set records with the 1998 crop, according to Motto, Kryla &AMP;
Fisher, a wine-business consulting firm in the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Just as an example: Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon grapes sold
for about $2,250 a ton in 1998, a 62 percent increase in just five
years. During the same period, grape prices in Sonoma County rose
85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to ever higher prices, ``the premium wine boom is
the biggest factor,'' said Vic Motto, a partner in the consulting
firm. He added, ``The premium wine market has outstripped the
growth in the general economy throughout the economic boom of the
1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredrikson cited several factors for increased demand: important
improvements in wine quality, the economic boom and particularly
the relative affluence of the aging baby boomers, the widespread
belief that wine contributes to a longer, healthier life and, less
quantifiable, perhaps, a general celebratory attitude brought on by
the approach of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to the predicted wine glut?
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortages in the three vintages before 1997 and the continued
boom in sales have been absorbing the 1997 vintage as soon as it
hits the market,'' Motto said. ``By the time the 1998 vintage is
released, the 1997's will be long gone, along with consumer hopes
for an oversupply of great wine at bargain prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather, of course, played a part, too. With many new vineyards
beginning to produce in 1998, the potential for another record was
there, but nature didn't cooperate. Last winter, El Nino rains
delayed budding by as much as a month, then spring rains hampered
flowering and pollination. A cool summer slowed ripening and only a
warm, dry October enabled growers to harvest a respectable grape
crop.
</P>
<P>
   Another principal factor in the shortage of premium California
wines is the rapidly expanding export market. ``Exports comprise
the second biggest market for California wines outside of the state
of California itself,'' Fredrikson said. ``Big retailers are
screaming bloody murder. They want to know why, when they are
unable to find hundreds of top California labels, the wine is being
shipped abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer? Wineries, like so many other businesses, have their
eyes on a potentially huge global market, and want to protect their
futures.
</P>
<P>
   One segment of the market that is suffering now because of the
large 1997 and 1998 crops in California is French bulk wine. During
the phylloxera blight, millions of gallons were sent to California
to be bottled and sold as moderately priced wine. Much of that
ended in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Overall imports were up only 1 percent, with French bulk wines
showing a big drop-off. Fredrikson, for one, does not think that is
necessarily bad. The French wines, many of which came from the
Languedoc region, ``got us over the hump,'' he said, ``but they
just don't deliver the flavor Americans prefer. They are drier,
more austere.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to wines that are bottled where they are grown,
several countries are making inroads in the American market. Last
year, Australia and New Zealand imports, together, were up 17
percent, to 3.2 million cases. Italian imports were more than four
times that.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean to the consumer? Collectors of
California trophy wines, the $150 cult wines made in batches of 100
cases or less a year, will have to pay more over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, the $6 bottle will probably go to $11, the
$15 bottle to $25 _ you get the picture. But don't despair. With a
little effort, terrific wines can still be found at reasonable
prices. Just count on a lot of them being Italian.

   &UR; TINKY WINKY FALLOUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I think the Rev. Jerry Falwell showed great courage when he
revealed in the National Liberty Journal that the purple Teletubby,
Tinky Winky, is gay.
</P>
<P>
   I have always suspected Tinky Winky was gay but I never told
anyone for fear I would be laughed at or made fun of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you a little old to be watching Teletubbies?'' is one
of the questions I feared being asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do you expect of something named Tinky Winky? It's
not exactly a name you'd give to a professional wrestler, you
know,'' is another.
</P>
<P>
   But Falwell has demonstrated many times over the years that he
is not afraid of looking or sounding like a fool. While some people
may wonder why a man of his accomplishments (I still get all tingly
when I think of the time Falwell urged General Motors to withdraw
its sponsorship of the TV sitcom ``Ellen'' after the main character
revealed her homosexuality) would waste his time outing a cloying,
purple puppet that some of your more discerning 2-year-olds have
trouble stomaching, I think Falwell should be congratulated for his
courage and unwavering sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   While some conservative televangelists might have just said that
Tinky Winky is gay and let it go at that, Falwell took it one step
further: He offered proof. Not only is the name Tinky Winky
suspicious in itself, but there is the purple coloration. Purple is
the gay-pride color, which is something I did not know but Falwell
obviously did.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of Tinky Winky's antenna. It is shaped
like a triangle. Triangle shapes are another symbol of gay pride,
which is something, again, that I did not know but Falwell
obviously did.
</P>
<P>
   And let us not forget for a minute the far from insignificant
matter of Tinky Winky's purse. Tinky Winky's spin doctors, of
course, denied that Tinky Winky carries a purse but described it,
instead, as a ``magic bag.'' This pathetic attempt at damage
control is unlikely to change anyone's mind about Tinky Winky's
sexual persuasion, least of all the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing about all of this is that by ``blowing the
whistle,'' so to speak, on Tinky Winky, Falwell has given the show
free publicity and may have unwittingly enhanced viewership as
curious people tune in in the sick hope of catching Tinky Winky and
Dipsy doing the dirty deed. (This is one example of what the
editorialists term the ``fallout'' of the Clinton scandal.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say what, if any, effect this controversy will
have on the preschoolers who are the core of Tinky Winky's fan
base. Boys might learn that it is unwise to carry a purse when
appearing on national television, at least not during those times
when the Rev. Jerry Falwell is watching. Girls might think twice
about dyeing themselves purple (definitely a good thing) or about
doing up their hair in the shape of a triangular antenna (probably
a good thing).
</P>
<P>
   For parents, the lessons are more obvious. For one thing, you
should never, ever, under any circumstances, name your son or
daughter Tinky Winky. Also to be avoided are the names Dipsy,
Laa-Laa and Po, as these are the names of other Teletubbies on the
show who have come into contact, if you will, with the morally
challenged Tinky Winky.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should also avoid watching ``Teletubbies'' (not that big
a sacrifice, by the way) in case Tinky Winky and his friends are
putting out subliminal messages more nefarious than the usual ones
urging the purchase of sugary cereals and expensive toys.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Falwell did this nation a great service by outing Tinky
Winky. Now, if he could just get something on Barney, we'd be
eternally in his debt.

A PINOT NOIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acacia Vineyard Pinot Noir 1995, Beckstoffer Vineyard, Carneros,
Calif. About $40.
</P>
<P>
   Acacia Winery's 1997 Carneros Pinot Noir, at $25, is a
first-rate wine and not too difficult to find. But another pinot
from Acacia, a bit older, is well worth hunting down: the 1995 from
the Beckstoffer Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when pinot noir was becoming more than a curiosity
in California, Acacia produced as many as six separate versions of
the wine in a single year, each from a different vineyard. When the
phylloxera blight hit, there was a serious retrenchment. Then, with
the 1995 vintage, the Beckstoffer was offered for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Acacia claims that the pinot noir vines from Beckstoffer are
among the oldest in the Carneros region, which cuts across the
lower ends of both Sonoma County and the Napa Valley. Full bodied
is not a term that is often applied to a good pinot noir but it is
certainly appropriate here. The Beckstoffer is a big and supple
wine with deep color and plenty of fruit. In short, it is a
formidable wine.

A TWO-DAY MARINADE GIVES ZEST TO SEA BASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the fourth of eight columns by Rick Moonen, the executive
chef and an owner of Oceana in Manhattan. His collaborator on these
columns is Dorie Greenspan.  
 By RICK MOONEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If cooking is as much alchemy as chemistry, here is the dish to
prove it: Chilean sea bass metamorphosed by a two-day submersion in
a miso marinade, then broiled until it is as brown and shiny as a
perfectly barbecued rib.
</P>
<P>
   Two days is a long time to marinate anything, particularly fish,
but it takes that long for the marinade to work its magic. It is a
blend of orange juice and zest, brown sugar, sake, a light miso
paste and the pungent chili paste called sambal oelek.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean sea bass, which is actually Patagonian tooth fish,
starts out as what I call a Jell-O fish: its flesh is soft, wet and
oily. Steam it and its texture will remind you of soft-boiled eggs.
But cover it with the marinade and all that changes, strikingly.
</P>
<P>
   The marinade's salts and sugars act as a cure and turn the soft
fish into one that flakes in large, firm shards. Marinated, the
Chilean sea bass comes to resemble cod, but creamier and richer.
</P>
<P>
   And after two days, it is not just the texture that changes. The
fish is imbued with the salty, sweet, bitter, acidic flavors,
complexity and exotic richness of the marinade's ingredients, many
of them rooted in the traditional cooking of Japan, and all of them
intensified when the fish is cooked.
</P>
<P>
   I top the glazed fillets with cilantro leaves and surround them
with a salad of mango and scallion greens splashed with a citrusy
dressing, an integral part of the dish.
</P>
<P>
   The fish calls for the coolness and sharpness of the salad and
its dressing, whose flavors are haunting but immediately appealing.
The crisp citrus taste in the dressing comes from the
citrus-flavored soy sauce called ajipon, and from yuzu kosho, a
chili paste that includes yuzu, a Japanese citrus fruit prized for
the oils in its skin. To pull the flavors into balance, I add
mirin, a sweet Japanese rice wine, and rice wine vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to make a few shopping trips to collect the
ingredients for this dish, but I promise you they will be worth
it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MISO-GLAZED CHILEAN SEA BASS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes, plus 2 days for marinating the fillets &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 oranges
</P>
<P>
   1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
</P>
<P>
   { cup light-brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   } cup sake
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups light miso paste (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sambal oelek chili paste (see note)
</P>
<P>
   6 skinless fillets of Chilean sea bass, each about 7 ounces
</P>
<P>
   \ cup ajipon (see note)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup mirin (see note)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup seasoned rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   \ cup soybean oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon yuzu kosho (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots, peeled and finely shredded
</P>
<P>
   { daikon, peeled and finely shredded
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 ripe mango, peeled, pitted and cut into short, thin strips
</P>
<P>
   3 scallions, green parts only, thinly sliced diagonally
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs cilantro, leaves only. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare marinade: Using a vegetable peeler, remove zest
(avoid the white pith) of 1 orange in about 6 wide slices. In a
small saucepan, combine slices of zest, orange juice and brown
sugar. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until reduced to
one-third. Turn heat to its lowest setting, and stir in the sake,
miso paste and chili paste. Stir for 10 minutes, then remove pan
from heat. Transfer to a bowl, and cool quickly by placing over
ice.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place fish and marinade in a large zipper-lock plastic bag,
making sure fish is coated with marinade. Press out the air, and
seal securely. Refrigerate for 2 days.
</P>
<P>
   3. To prepare yuzu dressing: Finely grate the zest of remaining
orange. In container of a blender, combine grated zest, ajipon,
mirin, rice vinegar, soybean oil and yuzu kosho. Puree until
smooth. Set aside at room temperature, or refrigerate up to 4 days.
</P>
<P>
   4. Preheat a broiler with a rack 8 inches from source of heat.
Remove fillets from marinade, and place on a metal baking pan. Add
a few spoonfuls of water, and brush fillets with just enough
marinade to glaze them. Broil until deeply browned and cooked
through, about 7 minutes.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &UR; TINKY WINKY FALLOUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I think the Rev. Jerry Falwell showed great courage when he
revealed in the National Liberty Journal that the purple Teletubby,
Tinky Winky, is gay.
</P>
<P>
   I have always suspected Tinky Winky was gay but I never told
anyone for fear I would be laughed at or made fun of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you a little old to be watching Teletubbies?'' is one
of the questions I feared being asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do you expect of something named Tinky Winky? It's
not exactly a name you'd give to a professional wrestler, you
know,'' is another.
</P>
<P>
   But Falwell has demonstrated many times over the years that he
is not afraid of looking or sounding like a fool. While some people
may wonder why a man of his accomplishments (I still get all tingly
when I think of the time Falwell urged General Motors to withdraw
its sponsorship of the TV sitcom ``Ellen'' after the main character
revealed her homosexuality) would waste his time outing a cloying,
purple puppet that some of your more discerning 2-year-olds have
trouble stomaching, I think Falwell should be congratulated for his
courage and unwavering sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   While some conservative televangelists might have just said that
Tinky Winky is gay and let it go at that, Falwell took it one step
further: He offered proof. Not only is the name Tinky Winky
suspicious in itself, but there is the purple coloration. Purple is
the gay-pride color, which is something I did not know but Falwell
obviously did.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of Tinky Winky's antenna. It is shaped
like a triangle. Triangle shapes are another symbol of gay pride,
which is something, again, that I did not know but Falwell
obviously did.
</P>
<P>
   And let us not forget for a minute the far from insignificant
matter of Tinky Winky's purse. Tinky Winky's spin doctors, of
course, denied that Tinky Winky carries a purse but described it,
instead, as a ``magic bag.'' This pathetic attempt at damage
control is unlikely to change anyone's mind about Tinky Winky's
sexual persuasion, least of all the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing about all of this is that by ``blowing the
whistle,'' so to speak, on Tinky Winky, Falwell has given the show
free publicity and may have unwittingly enhanced viewership as
curious people tune in in the sick hope of catching Tinky Winky and
Dipsy doing the dirty deed. (This is one example of what the
editorialists term the ``fallout'' of the Clinton scandal.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say what, if any, effect this controversy will
have on the preschoolers who are the core of Tinky Winky's fan
base. Boys might learn that it is unwise to carry a purse when
appearing on national television, at least not during those times
when the Rev. Jerry Falwell is watching. Girls might think twice
about dyeing themselves purple (definitely a good thing) or about
doing up their hair in the shape of a triangular antenna (probably
a good thing).
</P>
<P>
   For parents, the lessons are more obvious. For one thing, you
should never, ever, under any circumstances, name your son or
daughter Tinky Winky. Also to be avoided are the names Dipsy,
Laa-Laa and Po, as these are the names of other Teletubbies on the
show who have come into contact, if you will, with the morally
challenged Tinky Winky.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should also avoid watching ``Teletubbies'' (not that big
a sacrifice, by the way) in case Tinky Winky and his friends are
putting out subliminal messages more nefarious than the usual ones
urging the purchase of sugary cereals and expensive toys.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Falwell did this nation a great service by outing Tinky
Winky. Now, if he could just get something on Barney, we'd be
eternally in his debt.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says winter weather is like Ken Starr.
Just when you think you've seen the end, there's more.
</P>
<P>
   If we understand the situation in Kosovo, we're sure we don't
understand the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Balk, our spring training correspondent, says some pitchers
look unhitable. But he thinks it would be a good idea to hit some
of their agents.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary Rodham Clinton runs for the Senate from New York, she
won't be the first outsider to do so. Apparently they hire senators
there the way the Yankees hire pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Giuliani says he'd be more interested in running
for the Senate if his opponent were Mrs. Clinton. Rudolph vs
Hillary. Sounds like an 1840s children's book that didn't sell
well.
</P>
<P>
   People over age 80, says Mr. Clinton, are the fastest-growing
part of our population. Also, ironically, the fastest-shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know what is going to happen everywhere in the world
in the next two years,'' says the president. See? He can tell the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot rest,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``until America works for
every American.'' Bad news for the sofa business.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge has held Secretaries Rubin and Babbitt in
contempt for failing to produce documents. Because the government
produces too many documents as it is, shouldn't they be praised?
</P>
<P>
   A new report says federal agencies finally are making progress
on the Y2K computer bug. You can tell you've got a problem if your
computer, instead of ``Intel Inside,'' says ``Insect Inside.''

   &UR; TINKY WINKY FALLOUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I think the Rev. Jerry Falwell showed great courage when he
revealed in the National Liberty Journal that the purple Teletubby,
Tinky Winky, is gay.
</P>
<P>
   I have always suspected Tinky Winky was gay but I never told
anyone for fear I would be laughed at or made fun of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you a little old to be watching Teletubbies?'' is one
of the questions I feared being asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do you expect of something named Tinky Winky? It's
not exactly a name you'd give to a professional wrestler, you
know,'' is another.
</P>
<P>
   But Falwell has demonstrated many times over the years that he
is not afraid of looking or sounding like a fool. While some people
may wonder why a man of his accomplishments (I still get all tingly
when I think of the time Falwell urged General Motors to withdraw
its sponsorship of the TV sitcom ``Ellen'' after the main character
revealed her homosexuality) would waste his time outing a cloying,
purple puppet that some of your more discerning 2-year-olds have
trouble stomaching, I think Falwell should be congratulated for his
courage and unwavering sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   While some conservative televangelists might have just said that
Tinky Winky is gay and let it go at that, Falwell took it one step
further: He offered proof. Not only is the name Tinky Winky
suspicious in itself, but there is the purple coloration. Purple is
the gay-pride color, which is something I did not know but Falwell
obviously did.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of Tinky Winky's antenna. It is shaped
like a triangle. Triangle shapes are another symbol of gay pride,
which is something, again, that I did not know but Falwell
obviously did.
</P>
<P>
   And let us not forget for a minute the far from insignificant
matter of Tinky Winky's purse. Tinky Winky's spin doctors, of
course, denied that Tinky Winky carries a purse but described it,
instead, as a ``magic bag.'' This pathetic attempt at damage
control is unlikely to change anyone's mind about Tinky Winky's
sexual persuasion, least of all the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing about all of this is that by ``blowing the
whistle,'' so to speak, on Tinky Winky, Falwell has given the show
free publicity and may have unwittingly enhanced viewership as
curious people tune in in the sick hope of catching Tinky Winky and
Dipsy doing the dirty deed. (This is one example of what the
editorialists term the ``fallout'' of the Clinton scandal.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say what, if any, effect this controversy will
have on the preschoolers who are the core of Tinky Winky's fan
base. Boys might learn that it is unwise to carry a purse when
appearing on national television, at least not during those times
when the Rev. Jerry Falwell is watching. Girls might think twice
about dyeing themselves purple (definitely a good thing) or about
doing up their hair in the shape of a triangular antenna (probably
a good thing).
</P>
<P>
   For parents, the lessons are more obvious. For one thing, you
should never, ever, under any circumstances, name your son or
daughter Tinky Winky. Also to be avoided are the names Dipsy,
Laa-Laa and Po, as these are the names of other Teletubbies on the
show who have come into contact, if you will, with the morally
challenged Tinky Winky.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should also avoid watching ``Teletubbies'' (not that big
a sacrifice, by the way) in case Tinky Winky and his friends are
putting out subliminal messages more nefarious than the usual ones
urging the purchase of sugary cereals and expensive toys.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Falwell did this nation a great service by outing Tinky
Winky. Now, if he could just get something on Barney, we'd be
eternally in his debt.

GOP GOVERNORS STEP TOWARD BUSH ENDORSEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michigan Gov. John Engler said Tuesday that many of
his Republican colleagues are ready to endorse Texas Gov. George W.
Bush ``with an eye toward winning'' the 2000 presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   An endorsement from the governors is important, Engler said, to
galvanize support and create a network ``to get our candidate
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``National campaigns are hard. It's not too early to start
thinking about what we need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said he canvassed the 31 GOP governors over the weekend
to gauge support for Bush and found about two-thirds would support
the Texas governor, who has not yet announced that he is a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana said the endorsement would be
released when 15 or more signatures are collected. That could come
within days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of my colleagues looked at 2000 with an eye toward
winning, and we feel George W. is a candidate who can run strong,
coast to coast,'' Engler said on the final day of the National
Governors' Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was honored by the support he has received from
fellow Republicans during the gathering of governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of friends who, I guess, want to stand up and
say, `I'm for George W.,''' Bush said after a closed-door meeting
with Texas lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, though, reiterated that he would continue to work on state
business in the Texas Legislature before making a presidential
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to announce an exploratory committee within weeks
that will allow him to test the waters and begin raising money for
a national campaign once the state's legislative session ends in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a job to do. I'll be in my state, doing my job, doing
the job I was elected to do,'' said Bush, 52, the son of former
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bush said he was undecided about running for the
presidency, lawmakers from his state are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he look undecided to you?'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is the clear, dominant front-runner in this
race, and the odds are he is going to win the election,'' said
Gramm, who ended his failed presidential bid in 1996 after the Iowa
Republican Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's stature as a candidate who can bridge gaps
between the party's moderate and right-wing factions, and his
powerful allure among Hispanics in Texas, not all 31 of the
nation's Republican governors are prepared to endorse the Texan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, the New York Republican who is often
mentioned as a presidential candidate, praised his colleagues for
``taking an active role and stepping out in front'' by supporting a
candidate early in the presidential nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki said he would not join just yet in supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to sign the letter,'' he said of the
endorsement driver among GOP governors. ``I am not going to endorse
a candidate who hasn't declared. I am not endorsing any candidate.
It's too early in the process for me.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters said his landslide re-election in November _
with 49 percent of the Hispanic vote and strong support from other
minorities and women _ is an electoral blueprint that can help the
GOP reclaim the White House after eight years of the Democratic
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Connecticut Republicans want to attract more
African-Americans, more Hispanics,'' Gov. John Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said a letter from Republican governors endorsing a Bush
candidacy would be ``more for his encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said an endorsement would advance a message of inclusion
that some Republicans fear will be overshadowed by rhetoric coming
from the religious right-wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tenure and experience as a state executive also attract
the support from many of the governors.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating has joked that Bush is the
``governor of a country down there in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some governors, meanwhile, have voiced their support for other
potential candidates who may seek the GOP nomination, like former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, former Vice President Dan Quayle,
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, the former Red Cross president and wife of 1996
GOP nominee Bob Dole, has launched an exploratory committee and has
high ratings in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But governors have been cool to her potential candidacy because
she has not held an elective office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are serious about winning, then I don't think we are
going to nominate somebody who has never run for an office
before,'' Engler said.

NUN'S MEDIEVAL MUSIC RE-ENGINEERED FOR MODERN TIMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By   DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR; _  &LR; Hildegard of Bingen is an unlikely figure for
20th-century pop veneration, yet here at the end of the millennium
the 12th-century German mystical nun, herbalist and composer is
building quite a fan base, bolstered recently with an atmospheric
CD by Jocelyn Montgomery, produced by David Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish-born, classically trained Montgomery first learned
Hildegard's music in London, with a vocal group that focused on
early medieval music.
</P>
<P>
   After years of singing Hildegard's music in churches, busking
with madrigal singers on London streets and working in other
classical music settings, she landed her first record deal, to sing
Hildegard. Then she had to find a producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man who suggested going ahead and doing a solo recording
felt that it needed a contemporary context,'' Montgomery said. ``We
threw out several names and David's came up. He was in the process
of building an amazing studio in his (Hollywood Hills) home. He
heard me sing a little bit of it and was immediately interested in
going in the studio after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch had long collaborated with Montgomery's husband, film
producer Monty Montgomery, on film and TV projects, and had some
background producing soundtracks related to his work. But his
offbeat reputation (he created the TV series ``Twin Peaks'' and
films ```Blue Velvet'' and ``Eraserhead'') still made Lynch an
unusual choice to update 800-year-old sacred music, Montgomery
concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Even odder was her choice for co-producer: German documentary
maker and Hildegard aficionado Heidrun Reshoeft, with whom
Montgomery spent a week in the Rhine River Valley convent where the
nun lived.
</P>
<P>
   But the odd combination of talents, nonetheless, paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting ``Lux Vivens'' (on Mammoth Records) is an
ethereal, almost cinematic album of monkish mood music for the
post-medieval. It's just that getting there was, perhaps
unsurprisingly, more like making a movie than an album.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, as recording began on each song, someone would
read translated versions of Hildegard's surreal Latin lyrics to
Lynch, so he could visualize the song's meaning and imagery,
Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely was directing the process in a great way, and
encouraging and insightful about what would set up a mood and bring
things out vocally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With those images in his mind, Lynch had Montgomery sing each
piece in virtually unbroken takes ``to not interrupt the flow of
the chants,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she, Lynch and other musicians would record instrumental
tracks (she plays violin and accordion) that then were radically
modified _ the pitch altered as much as three octaves _ and turned
into washes of background sound that lapped around the edges of her
crystalline voice.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lynch worked in sound effects, such as the repeated
unsheathing of a sword in ``Battle and Aftermath'' and pastoral
nature sounds behind several other songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt like he was transported back to the time of the
Crusades; he had this ongoing theme,'' Montgomery said. ``He was
seeing things as he heard me sing, and maybe that's the difference.
He's seeing visions as he directs.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a sometimes-otherworldly sound that feels far
different from the often gorgeous but respectfully authentic
re-creations of Hildegard's music by other artists.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery said she felt ``completely OK'' with modernizing
medieval church music in that way. The result, she said, may be
more viscerally true to the passionate and evocative mysticism that
inspired Hildegard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having had the experience of doing (Hildegard performances in
churches), I may have felt _ maybe not consciously _ that doing it
that other way was frustrating, that something wasn't coming
through, wasn't being expressed,'' Montgomery said. Taking the
music out of its sacred setting freed her to get to the music's
center, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just interesting how it still came together as a piece
and still did something for the music,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   She now plans to leave Hildegard's music alone for a time, while
she explores more contemporary recordings with more conventional
music producers. But Montgomery said she had no regrets about the
unusual path that led to ``Lux Vivens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have done it this way because I could have
become an unchallenged classical musician,'' Montgomery said. ``And
I've been given an opportunity to go a different way. It really was
quite an experience.''

   Warren Christopher, the former U.S. secretary of state, once
described Bosnia as ``the problem from hell.'' Kosovo is proving to
be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, NATO is on the verge of unloosing bombs on Serbian
positions as yet another deadline is reached. And once again
Slobodan Milosovic is taking the allies to the wire and possibly
beyond. This time we need to be doubly cautious before committing
ourselves to an act of war.
</P>
<P>
   Threats of bombing have worked in the past as a means of curbing
Serbian aggression against the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, as they
did eventually in constraining Serbian massacres in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But on this occasion the U.S. is waving the stick as a means of
forcing a peace plan. It is by no means certain that the threats
are as effective or as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, the rights and wrongs of the two sides are not as
clear. The peace proposals worked out in Rambouillet have been
rejected not just by the Serbs but also by the Albanians, who look
as if they want to use NATO intervention not to achieve a
settlement, but to pursue their own agenda of complete
independence.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the use of force, far from frightening
Belgrade, is threatening to divide the allies.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans seem gung ho, the Europeans are much less
enthusiastic about unleashing the bombers in the face of Russian
opposition, without more specific sanction from the U.N. Nor are
even the British convinced that the bombing alone can achieve its
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   That, even at this 11th hour, is what the West needs to remember
in this continuing crisis. The objective is the acceptance by two
sides of a peace proposal to give Albanians autonomy while
preserving Serbian territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of force may aid the negotiations. But if neither
side really wants peace, then bombing won't help. &QL;

<P>
   Choucroute Garnie is the Alsatian equivalent of that
quintessential New York combination of franks and sauerkraut. But
while the French treat this hearty dish as common fare, it has been
elevated to a restaurant specialty here. And it's easy to see why
it appeals on both levels.
</P>
<P>
   Choucroute is just French for sauerkraut, or fermented cabbage,
but what makes it so irresistible is the garnish: a variety of
unabashedly heavy meats _ some smoked or salted, some not, all
usually pork.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonings are simple, traditionally little more than
juniper berries and onion with a little goose or duck fat or lard.
Served with strong mustard, it is the ultimate cold weather dish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Rustic'' is the adjective usually applied to choucroute (after
``heavy''), but the dish is easily dressed up. At Lutece, Eberhard
Muller breaks the mold by seasoning sauerkraut with foie gras fat
and topping it with pheasant breast, a sausage made of pheasant
leg, foie gras and a foie gras sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Equally fascinating are the ever-increasing fish-based
variations, usually called something like ``choucroute de
poissons.''
</P>
<P>
   At Destinee, in Manhattan, the Alsatian-born chef, Jean-Yves
Schillinger, pairs phyllo-wrapped sauerkraut with steamed halibut
and vegetables. Kerry Heffernan, the executive chef at the new
Eleven Madison Park, uses a combination of fresh cabbage and leeks
in his ``choucroute'' of salmon and trout.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lenox Room on the Upper East Side, David Cunningham's
freshwater choucroute features walleyed pike, crayfish and
crisp-fried smelts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the fish idea is apparently not new. ``Everyone was a little
suspicious of choucroute de poissons when we first saw it in
Paris,'' said Andre Soltner, the former chef of Lutece and a native
of Alsace, ``but then we were reminded that people made choucroute
with fish in Alsace 200 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading New York choucroute destination, at least at the
moment, is Les Halles, where for three years the owner, Jose
Meirelles, has named February choucroute month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I originally put it on the menu because I like it so much,''
he said, ``and it was difficult to find in restaurants. We sold a
few that first year. This month, though, we'll serve almost as many
choucroutes as steak frites.'' He makes two more-or-less classic
versions, one with duck sausage and foie gras, the other with
monkfish, scallops, smoked salmon, fish sausage and caviar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Choucroute is tradition on a platter. Soltner spoke of it
lovingly for nearly an hour. On the proper technique for washing
the sauerkraut: ``You must use both cold and hot water.'' On the
cooking wine: ``Any dry white wine will work, but the right wine is
Alsatian riesling.'' On the perfect combination of meats: ``Don't
forget the salted ham hock.'' And on the final touches: ``Take all
the meat out and stir a little kirsch into the choucroute.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he acknowledged that choucroute is essentially a
home dish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soltner said he never put it on his menu, and Jean-Georges
Vongerichten, probably the city's best-known Alsatian, said, ``It's
not a dish to serve at restaurants, because you must eat it the
moment it's done so the sauerkraut remains crunchy and you get the
best balance of flavors and textures.'' Yet, he conceded that many
believe it's best after several reheatings.
</P>
<P>
   Choucroute can be grand or simple, and it encourages
experiments. Nearly everything is up for grabs, especially if you
imagine yourself in the position of its peasant inventors _ in
midwinter, with plenty of sauerkraut, some wine and a hearty
appetite. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sauerkraut is truly the soul of choucroute, but there's no
reason to start from scratch. Almost no American chefs make their
own for their restaurant creations.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy fresh sauerkraut in delis on the Lower East Side, at
butcher shops that sell it in plastic bags or, where many chefs do,
at Schaller &AMP; Weber, 1654 Second Avenue (near 84th Street), (212)
879-3047.
</P>
<P>
   Soltner, a longtime customer, flatly declares that the shop's
sauerkraut (above) makes a choucroute that's ``just as good as any
made in Alsace.'' Steer clear of cans, and of any sauerkraut that
contains anything other than cabbage, salt, and possibly sugar. It
will keep for at least a month in a tight container in the
refrigerator.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Creating new media for the Internet is, for all
concerned, a learning process and the latest to learn a (rather
painful) lesson is Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slate,'' the online magazine run by the U.S. software
behemoth, has decided to stop charging for access to its service
after what it admits was a miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, ``Slate'' started charging new subscribers just
under $20, in what was seen at the time as a watershed for the
industry. There would be no more free lunches. Now, lunch is free
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, we chickened out,'' said Michael Kinsley, editor
of ``Slate.'' ``Maybe in the future, when the Web's commonplace,
people will happily pay for access to premium sites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll reevaluate our decision about this on a regular basis,''
said Rogers Weed, publisher of ``Slate,'' shortly after the company
announced it would start charging. But Weed won't be reevaluating
very much: he has now moved on to another division of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley wrote a humorous and self-deprecating explanation of the
shift. ``No, no, you see there's always been a mix of free and paid
stuff,'' he explained. ``We're just changing the mix... OK, OK,
sure: We're backing down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you feel like jerks?'' he asked himself. ``Not really.
OK, maybe a bit. But look: This is terra incognita.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for switching back was the surprisingly strong
rise in advertising, said Scott Morroe, the new publisher of
``Slate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising market on the Web has continued to expand at a
remarkable pace,'' he told subscribers. But one reason it began
charging for content was the growing competition for advertising.
``Advertising alone is not going to do it for a good number of
sites,'' Weed said just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason is more compelling. ``Paid subscriptions for
content (other than smut and investments) simply have not grown as
expected,'' said Kinsley. And so ``the biggest problem with
remaining paid was that doing so would restrict our advertising
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slate'' will continue to charge for its e-mail services _
including the review of the morning papers which lets everyone feel
they've read the New York Times, even when they haven't.
</P>
<P>
   It will also charge for its archives and the weekly print
edition that's downloaded from the ``Slate'' site and has proved
very popular. But everything else will be free once more.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a premium on just capturing an audience at
the moment, with everybody seeking the maximum number of hits. But
in the longer term, things may not be very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web readers surf,'' wrote Kinsley. ``They go quickly from site
to site. If they really like a particular site, they may visit it
often, but they are unlikely to devote a continuous half-hour or
more to any one site the way you might read a traditional newspaper
or magazine in one sitting. This appears to be in the nature of the
Web, and not something that is likely to change.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for advertisers, they ``don't seem to place any special
value on reaching paying subscribers. That was a bit surprising,
since traditional magazine advertisers usually require paying
subscribers.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Microsoft's retreat on ``Slate'' was just a
marketing miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salon,'' another webzine that competes on similar territory,
never made that leap to charging for access. But it did create a
special access area for ``members only,'' with some extra features,
and a range of merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   This seems to have been a better bet: keep the audience, but
persuade a number of them that they are getting something extra,
rather than _ as Microsoft did _ make it look as if you are taking
something away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling was that the Web was about building a sizeable
audience and community, and then selling to that community,'' said
``Salon'' president, Michael O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't about paying for content _ at least not our type of
content. For the most part, we think the Web has provided mostly
free content.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Microsoft has had frequent reverses in its strategy for
interactive media, and still doesn't seem to have got it quite
right. But the ``Slate'' story also shows the flaw in treating the
Net as just an extension of the media.
</P>
<P>
   There is some evidence that Kinsley, who came from conventional
print journalism to the shiny new webzine world, hasn't found it
such an easy transition.
</P>
<P>
   Once editor of the ``New Republic,'' one of Washington's most
talked-about magazines under his tenure, he left to join Bill Gates
when it seemed the Web was the future. But he's rethought that at
least once since then.
</P>
<P>
   He very publicly sought the editorship of the ``New Yorker''
when Tina Brown departed, but lost out to David Remnick.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley has indicated, if humorously, that all may not be quite
well with Microsoft. He wrote puckishly that Bill Gates took news
of the decision to stop charging very badly: ```But you promised me
$20 a reader,' he sobbed, borrowing a Kleenex from a nearby Nubian.
`You promised, you promised, you promised'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike did not even talk to Bill about this,'' said Weed. ``Mike
has been poking fun at Bill since the first issue. This is a
problem for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not any more it isn't. &QL;

WITH A LITTLE ENDORSEMENT FROM FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, March 2)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She pulled a small capsule from her pocket, flicked her eyes
over to the next table, leaned in close and whispered ``gingko.''
Gulping it down with coffee, she explained she'd first been
introduced to gingko in Hawaii. It made her feel sharper, she said.
She doesn't get stuck putting the right face with the wrong name
like she used to.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote down gingko in big letters on my list.
</P>
<P>
   Before gingko, there were others, including St. John's Wort, the
lightweight's alternative to Prozac. I once found myself in the
parking lot at the grocery store, ripping into a new bottle of St.
John's Wort, like some serenity addict, seeking the calm my friend
had found with this herb. Of course, there was Echinacea, the
herbal way to get through cold and flu season, right up there next
to chicken soup and Vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   I can look at just about everything in my bathroom shelf as
first endorsed by a friend. Kay's gingko, Terry's St. John's Wort,
Sandie's garlic pills for cholesterol, Barbara's valerian root for
insomnia, Emily's aromatherapy soap for tired muscles, somebody's
small vial of lavender oil for headaches.
</P>
<P>
   I trust my doctor to give me good medical advice but to keep up
on the latest trend in supplements, I rely on my friends. Everyone
has a favorite wonder herb, a vitamin that helped their mood,
improved their sex life, got them through the flu, saved their
marriage. And they're so willing to share.
</P>
<P>
   I was an early proselytizer for a natural progesterone cream
made from yams that some say balances your estrogen, others say
relieves stress and many more think prevents their skin from
looking like an avocado.
</P>
<P>
   You may scoff about treating yourself with leaves and twigs, but
perhaps you have an aloe vera plant in your bathroom for small
burns and mosquito bites. And didn't Grandmother's beloved castor
oil come from a bean?
</P>
<P>
   It's true that one person's miracle plant can be another's waste
of money. This stuff doesn't work for everyone, but then neither
does ibuprofen. When I pushed the hormone cream on a friend she
broke out in hives. Another tried St. John's Wort and got real
cranky, mostly because it didn't produce the desired effects.
</P>
<P>
   When I brewed my sister a pot of ginger tea she took a whiff and
asked for Lipton.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal remedies are not just for leftover hippies. They're big
enough that the major drug chains now sell them and medical
journals debate the merits of gingko and garlic. They're pretty
seductive. One can be pretty good at saying no to drugs and still
succumb to peer pressure when it comes to vitamins, herbs and
fantastic balms.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe celebrity endorsements, but I'll try just about
anything I can get in the health food department if a friend swears
it delivers extra energy, lessens anxiety and moves you naturally
into that state once known as mellow.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people who tell you when to cut your hair and
change your glass frames. If they say ginseng works for the 4 p.m.
slump, you try it.
</P>
<P>
   There are skeptics. We were discussing some new energy booster,
one of those with three letters instead of a name, and Mary
wondered, ``People brag that it gives them such a lift but how come
when you call them up they're always taking a nap?''
</P>
<P>
   Mary's lucky, though. She can improve her day with a new
lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   I heard about one woman who takes a Chinese herb to keep her
hair from going gray and while it does remain an honest dark brown,
so does her mother's at 75, which could mean either mom's on the
herb too or they just have good hair genes.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Jane, usually so conventional you'd expect her to call
911 before an herbalist, now is hooked on primrose oil for both PMS
and easing the pain from an old tennis injury.
</P>
<P>
   It can go beyond vitamins and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a bottle of orange-flavored baby aspirin I bought after
meeting a woman on a rafting trip who says she pops one every
morning to keep from ever having a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico I heard about a face cream coveted by visiting
Americans. I finally tracked it down, smeared it on and waited for
the results. It put a nice gloss on a sun tan but no miracles
occurred, even though I began to notice that a number of my country
women did indeed have remarkable skin for their vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, my friend had to go and point out that they were the
Americans who came to San Miguel de Allende for face lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it's a baby boomer conceit, a belief that there is
something magical and likely found in nature that will allow us to
do it better, to play longer, work smarter, sleep sounder and age
tautly.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gail Sheehy said, today 50 is 40, 40 is 30.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone know much about kava?

   Warren Christopher, the former U.S. secretary of state, once
described Bosnia as ``the problem from hell.'' Kosovo is proving to
be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, NATO is on the verge of unloosing bombs on Serbian
positions as yet another deadline is reached. And once again
Slobodan Milosovic is taking the allies to the wire and possibly
beyond. This time we need to be doubly cautious before committing
ourselves to an act of war.
</P>
<P>
   Threats of bombing have worked in the past as a means of curbing
Serbian aggression against the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, as they
did eventually in constraining Serbian massacres in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But on this occasion the U.S. is waving the stick as a means of
forcing a peace plan. It is by no means certain that the threats
are as effective or as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, the rights and wrongs of the two sides are not as
clear. The peace proposals worked out in Rambouillet have been
rejected not just by the Serbs but also by the Albanians, who look
as if they want to use NATO intervention not to achieve a
settlement, but to pursue their own agenda of complete
independence.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the use of force, far from frightening
Belgrade, is threatening to divide the allies.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans seem gung ho, the Europeans are much less
enthusiastic about unleashing the bombers in the face of Russian
opposition, without more specific sanction from the U.N. Nor are
even the British convinced that the bombing alone can achieve its
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   That, even at this 11th hour, is what the West needs to remember
in this continuing crisis. The objective is the acceptance by two
sides of a peace proposal to give Albanians autonomy while
preserving Serbian territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of force may aid the negotiations. But if neither
side really wants peace, then bombing won't help. &QL;

THE EGGS ARE THE SAME, BUT THE NAMES ARE CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Egg drop soup, a cliche of American Chinese restaurants, has a
less-well-known Italian counterpart, stracciatella. These soups
demonstrate how easy it is to transform a basic dish in spirit,
moving from one cuisine to another almost as quickly as you can
change your mind about which you prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Both are based on a simple principle: eggs curdle when dropped
into boiling stock or water. When they are used to thicken a sauce
or stew, the heat is kept low, for a smooth, creamy result.
</P>
<P>
   In egg drop soup, whether Chinese or Italian, you do just the
opposite: keep the heat relatively high so that the eggs cook in
shreds, or curds. The result is a lightning-fast soup of substance.
</P>
<P>
   Egg drop soup is best flavored with soy sauce, chopped scallions
and a bit of sesame oil. Stracciatella is flavored with freshly
grated Parmesan cheese (Parmigiano Reggiano is essential for best
flavor) and a suspicion of garlic; some chopped parsley is a
radically untraditional but acceptable addition, at least for
heretical Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Both rely on stock _ don't make these soups out of water and
expect them to taste like anything _ and are pretty good even with
canned stock. I find either variation quite filling, but to make
them into a real one-pot meal I add some chopped greens _ spinach
or watercress is especially good _ and finely chopped boneless
chicken or shrimp, all of which will cook in about the same time as
the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   (My daughter persuaded me to add cooked thin egg noodles to the
Chinese soup, and we both liked that version.) To accommodate the
added solids, however, increase the amount of stock by about half
(six cups instead of four).

</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
</P>

</P>
<P>
   { cup chopped scallions, both white and green parts
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sesame oil, or to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring 3 cups stock to a boil over medium-high heat in a 6- to
8-cup saucepan. Beat remaining stock with eggs and soy sauce until
well blended.
</P>
<P>
   2. When stock is boiling, adjust heat so it bubbles frequently
but not furiously. Add the egg mixture in a steady stream, stirring
occasionally until eggs gather together in small curds, 2 or 3
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Taste, and add salt if necessary (or more soy sauce). Then
add plenty of pepper, the scallions and the sesame oil. Taste
again, adjust seasonings and serve.

 &HT;    BIPARTISAN PUSH TO WEAKEN OR ABANDON INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than a year of bitter partisanship over
the investigation of President Clinton, Democrats and Republicans
may have found an issue where they agree: Neither party likes the
independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute as it exists today should not be reauthorized,''
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said Tuesday. His Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee will begin Wednesday to consider the fate of the
law, which has triggered 21 executive branch investigations over
two decades. The law is scheduled to expire in June unless Congress
renews it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden is on those who want to keep it alive in its
current form,'' Thompson said, holding out the possibility of a
dramatically scaled-down version.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long objected to the law, which they have seen
as a weapon wielded against Republican presidents during the
Iran-Contra probe of the Reagan administration. Now many Democrats,
angered at Kenneth Starr's investigation of Clinton, also oppose
it.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat
on the governmental affairs panel, argued for revamping the
independent counsel system, which was originally passed after the
Watergate scandal to restore public trust in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything will be gained by abandoning this
law,'' Lieberman said. He also urged that the debate over the law
``not be allowed to be a referendum on Judge Starr's performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the witnesses scheduled to testify at Wednesday's
kick-off hearing have favored either scrapping the law altogether,
or narrowing its scope.
</P>
<P>
   Former attorney general Griffin B. Bell and former Senate
Republican leader Howard H. Baker Jr. are slated to tell why they
found the statute ``seriously flawed'' in a recent joint study.
Bell, a Democrat who is now an Atlanta lawyer, has long held that
independent counsel investigations run the risk of becoming a
``search for a crime to fit the publicly identified suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   The current statute calls for an independent counsel whenever
the attorney general finds ``credible evidence'' of wrongdoing by
the president, vice president or by a cabinet member or other high
administrative official. The aim was to give investigations more
credibility. Independent counsel probes have resulted in more than
50 criminal convictions, including 13 under Starr.
</P>
<P>
   However, even some of the former independent counsels are
joining in the criticism of the statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law can't be saved and it shouldn't be,'' said Joseph
diGenova (cq), a former independent counsel whose investigation
exonerated the Bush administration of improperly examining the
passport files of then-candidate Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make federal law enforcement, with its vast powers,
able to focus on one person, you create a very dangerous
situation,'' said diGenova, a Republican who also will be
testifying at Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   DiGenova said the problem does not lie with Starr or any
particular independent counsel but with the establishment of the
position itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every tactic that Ken Starr used is exactly the tactic that
the Clinton Justice Department uses every day in courthouses all
over this country,'' diGenova said. ``They subpoena family members,
mothers, fathers, psychiatrists, priests _ you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   DiGenova said he would have used those same tools, but he said
he opposes concentrating all those powers in an independent probe
aimed at a single official. ``There are all sorts of remedies'' for
investigating high government officials, diGenova said, citing the
decision to appoint a special investigator of President Nixon
during Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the attorney general use the regulatory authority she has
had since the Teapot Dome scandal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that would not be enough, warn those who still champion the
independent counsel law .
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very important act,'' said Arthur Christy, a
special prosecutor during the Carter presidency, who is scheduled
to be one of the few proponents of the unpopular statute to speak
at the Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without it, we could have all sorts of trouble. It's very
simple: Suppose you have a cabinet member accused of a felony, and
you've got the attorney general investigating his fellow cabinet
member?'' Christy said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers keeping the current law, but he suggests reducing the
number of officials covered to about 20, instead of the
approximately 70 officials who are now potential targets.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson suggested that he might consider keeping independent
counsels but limiting their jurisdiction to just three officials:
the president, vice president and attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman held out the possibility of a pool of independent
counsels, selected in advance, to be called on when needed. And
another participant in the debate, former appeals court judge
Robert Bork, has proposed that Congress set up a permanent panel of
investigators to oversee the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   A few members of Congress are seeking to change the law instead
of eliminate it. Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., has proposed a measure to
rework the statute and add more financial oversight. He has won one
Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. Cynthia McKinney of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   However, any effort to salvage the independent counsel statute
faces an uphill struggle, now that its past defenders have joined
its longtime foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a post-Watergate liberal notion and it was a
disaster,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., a one-time
advocate said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, an opponent whose committee has jurisdiction over the
law, said, ``I am not convinced that it has not outlived its
uselessness.''

SEVERAL HYDRANGEAS DO WELL IN THE SOUTH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have wanted a hydrangea in my yard since I first saw Donna
Reed hiding from James Stewart in the movie ``It's a Wonderful
Life.'' They had just left her high school dance. I love the sound
of that hydrangea and the way it moved.
</P>
<P>
   Will you please provide any information you have on this bush?
Will it do well in the South?
</P>
<P>
   A: What a great memory. Yes, hydrangeas do well in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than one hydrangea to consider for your garden.
``Hydrangea macrophylla,'' the large-leafed shrub with the large,
rounded clusters of pink or blue blooms, flowers in late spring.
Soil acidity can alter flower color. For bluer blooms, sprinkle 2
tablespoons of aluminum sulfate or sulphur around the plant in
early fall. This will promote a more acidic soil. To encourage pink
blooms, sprinkle a cup of dolomitic lime around the shrub. This
boosts alkalinity. Water well after any application.
</P>
<P>
   This hydrangea, also known as French or garden hydrangea, has
large, coarsely toothed leaves and large, domelike clusters of
flowers. Some love this plant for what they see as old-fashioned
blooms. Others see the blooms as gaudy. These hydrangeas vary in
height according to variety, but many of these garden types are in
the 3- to 5-foot height range. The blooms, like them or not, dry
well.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in this big-leaf species are those hydrangeas with
blooms that resemble lacy caps. The blooms are made up of fertile
and sterile flowers. ``H. macrophylla'' `Mariesii Variegata,' for
example, produces delicate pink or blue lacecaps and variegated
foliage. This does well in our garden and matures to 4 or 5 feet in
height.
</P>
<P>
   Oakleaf hydrangea, ``Hydrangea quercifolia,'' is a woodsy
deciduous shrub that can reach 6 feet in height and has large
oaklike foliage that turns a reddish-purple in fall. Large clusters
of creamy-white blooms appear in late spring or early summer. Bark
may exfoliate on mature branches. This is a great addition to any
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrangeas are deciduous and lose their leaves during winter.
You may be tempted to prune at this time, but do not prune until
after the shrub flowers in late spring or you'll remove the buds.
(I understand there is one variety, `All Summer Beauty,' that is
the exception to this rule. This variety flowers on current year's
growth. I have not seen this plant locally.)
</P>
<P>
   Hydrangeas like morning sun and afternoon shade, and they grow
well here in bright shade. A well-draining, organically enriched
soil is best. Use an organic mulch, too. Shrubs that are healthy
and growing well in an organically enriched soil will require
little or no supplemental fertilization, but if needed, a
slow-release, balanced fertilizer can be applied in early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrangeas, like azaleas, need adequate water, especially during
the hot, dry summer months. Keep the soil moist but not soggy.
Mulch will help preserve soil moisture and help moderate soil
temperature in summer and winter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; The leaves on my snapdragons are looking sickly. The top
sides have yellowish areas. There are brownish, raised ringlike
areas on the undersides of the foliage. What is this?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; That is rust, a fungal disease. If the plants are severely
infected, I often just remove and destroy them rather than try to
stop the pustules from spreading. But the disease can be
controlled, if caught early, by dusting the foliage _ making sure
to get the undersides _ with sulfur. There are other fungicides as
well, but make sure the one you use targets rust.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the garden area clean. Remove any fallen, infected leaves.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Note: Remember to remove spent flower stalks on snapdragons,
as well. This encourages the plant to regrow and produce more
stalks, and in turn gives you more blooms. Apply a liquid, balanced
fertilizer to encourage more bloom cycles until the hot weather
gets the best of these cool-season annuals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many years ago I saw garlic being grown as a houseplant. It
was beautiful, with long wooden tendrils. Can you help me learn how
to do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: How unusual. I've seen garlic grown in containers, but have
never seen it grown as a houseplant. Garlic is a member of the
onion or allium family. I'm afraid I don't know of any that produce
wooden tendrils. Perhaps with age, those with twisting stems get
woody. (Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding your letter.) Serpent
garlic, ``Allium sativum var. ophioscorodon,'' for example,
resembles common garlic but is larger and has stems that coil,
straighten, then continue upward growth. Does this sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   We plant garlic in the garden in Houston in late September and
October for May/June harvests. Some gardeners start individual
cloves in small containers of potting soil prior to setting the
plants in the vegetable bed. The small pots are placed where they
receive morning sun and afternoon shade to encourage good growth.
</P>
<P>
   You could try this and just continue growing the garlic in
containers. Simply buy a good head of garlic from the grocery. Peel
the papery skin and divide the cloves. Start the individual cloves
in plain clay pots (with drainage holes) filled with a good soil
mix. Plant the individual cloves, tip up, an inch or so deep and
about 4 inches apart if planting more than one in a (larger)
container. Keep the soil evenly moist.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pots in a window where the plants will get a half-day
of sun, and apply a liquid fertilizer regularly once the plants are
growing. Grow the garlic on a patio or balcony, if possible, and
bring the plant indoors for short visits. Fresh air is always best.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic bulb formation occurs in response to lengthening days in
the spring; however, this has to be preceded by a relatively long,
cool growing period that makes fall planting ideal. Providing this
cool condition indoors would be tricky. But perhaps you only want
the plant(s) as ornamentals. If so, you could start cloves now and
see what happens. I would like to know how your garlic progresses.
</P>
<P>
   The garlic plant is cold-hardy, able to withstand freezing
temperatures. As the days become longer in the spring, bulbs form
rapidly. Garlic will also bolt, or produce seed stalks, but this
doesn't seem to inhibit the production of good-sized bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   For those who wish to plant garlic in the garden this fall,
boost the soil with an abundance of organic matter. Good drainage
is essential. To ensure good drainage, create ridges in the bed and
plant on top of these. Garlic is a relatively heavy feeder, and
side dressing with a nitrogen fertilizer is beneficial. Water.
</P>
<P>
   To harvest in late spring/early summer, pull the garlic, shake
off excess dirt and hang it in a shaded, dry area for several
months. Use as needed. Or, break into individual cloves and freeze
in freezer jars to avoid flavoring ice.
</P>
<P>
   Note: I'm wondering if you possibly saw the climbing onion,
``Bowiea volubilis,'' a novelty houseplant with a large, green bulb
(planted with half its girth above the soil line) that sends up
nearly leafless, branched stems that will twine around a support.
These plants can be 3 or more feet long. The small flowers are
greenish-white. This plant prefers partial sun, average room
temperature, a well-draining soil that is kept moist during the
growing season and on the dry side otherwise.

   Three Americans Win Bread-Baking Championship
</P>
<P>
   Any doubts that bread in American shops and restaurants has
vastly improved should be erased by the news from Paris, where last
week the United States won bread-baking's world cup, the Coupe du
Monde de la Boulangerie.
</P>
<P>
   The contest, pitting teams from 12 countries, began in 1992; an
American team qualified in 1994 and came in sixth. Two years later,
Americans won in the specialty bread and baguette category.
</P>
<P>
   On the winning team were two instructors from the Greystone
campus of the Culinary Institute of America in St. Helena, Calif.:
Thomas Gumpel, who won in the artistic design category, and Robert
Jorin, who baked sweet breads and pastries. Jan Schat, the third
team member, responsible for baguettes and specialty breads,
teaches bakers at Il Fornaio, a chain of bakeries in California.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese Cheeses
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese cheeses are so new to American markets that the
traditional, artisanal varieties are not even mentioned in the
encyclopedic ``Cheese Primer'' by Steven Jenkins (Workman, 1996).
But a few kinds are now being imported and are well worth
discovering.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a blend of cow's, sheep's and goat's milk, has a mildly
acid tang with added spiciness from its rich paprika rub. It's a
relative bargain: $6.99 for eight ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Evora, a semihard sheep's milk cheese, is crumbly, yellowish and
pleasantly sharp ($10.99 for six ounces).
</P>
<P>
   Queijo Azeitao is a mild-tasting sheep's milk cheese that
develops a soft, satiny interior when ripe, not unlike Torta del
Casar from Spain. But such sumptuousness comes at a price: $16.99
for a nine-ounce round. Like Evora and, increasingly, cheeses from
other countries, it is made with a vegetable coagulant derived from
thistles, not with animal rennet.
</P>
<P>
   Ribafria, a mellow, buttery goat cheese ($7.99 for seven
ounces), puts the appetite on edge with the heat of the crushed
black peppercorns that crust it.
</P>
<P>
   All four are available at Murray's Cheese, 257 Bleecker Street
(Cornelia Street), in Manhattan, at the prices above. Some are also
sold by Agata &AMP; Valentina, 1505 First Avenue (79th Street);
Zabar's, Broadway and 80th Street, and Fairway, 2127 Broadway (74th
Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132d Street). Prices vary.
</P>
<P>
   Not Mom's Hamantaschen
</P>
<P>
   Tradition usually prevails when it comes to hamantaschen, the
triangular pastries that symbolize Purim, which begins Monday
evening. Prune, poppy-seed and apricot fillings sum it up. But
Black Hound, 170 Second Avenue (11th Street) and at the Mall at
Short Hills, fashions the most delicious little hamantaschen around
and fills the flaky glazed pastry with the likes of chocolate and
pecan-honey in addition to poppy seeds and first-rate apricot
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   And no prune, because Amiram Dror, the owner, said, ``I had a
bad experience with prunes as a child.'' Available through March 3
at $20 a pound; with a day's notice they can be delivered in
Manhattan for an extra charge: (800) 344-4417. &QL;

   SAN MATEO, Calif. _ If MTV Networks Chairman Tom Freston gets
his way, generations of couch (set ital)and(end ital) mouse
potatoes will soon be howling, ``I want my MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable network giant, whose channels include MTV, VH1,
Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite and TV Land, announced a major online
expansion Tuesday, including new music and children's World Wide
Web sites to further extend its reach ``from cradle to, well,
near-grave,'' says Freston.
</P>
<P>
   The online expansion will give MTV Networks' fans of all ages
more of what they want when they want it, including music, music
news and information, children's activities and a chance to
purchase a piece of American pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   The new Web sites and services also will extend the global reach
of MTV Networks, which already reaches a quarter of the world's
television households in 85 countries and territories ranging from
China to South Africa with shows geared to local languages and
customs. MTV plans to run both sites from new offices in San Mateo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we can count on is that entertainment and media will
become ever more individualized for people around the globe,'' says
Freston, 53, who worked as a bartender in the Caribbean and a
clothing merchant in New Delhi before helping to launch New
York-based MTV in 1981. ``That's the point of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV Networks will launch its eclectic music site, tentatively
called the Buggles Project, in June, and its large secure site for
children, tentatively called Project Nozzle, in September.
</P>
<P>
   Fans also will soon be able to shop on all MTV's Web sites,
including its more TV-focused MTV.com and nick.com, thanks to the
networks' recent purchase of Red Rocket, an online toy retailer.
</P>
<P>
   The Buggles Project will provide a huge network of online radio
stations from which Web surfers can pick and choose to create a
station that suits their tastes and can flow, or ``stream,'' into
their computers around the clock. The new site is named for the
Buggles, a band whose music video, ``Video Killed the Radio Star,''
was the first to appear on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The network, which MTV acquired with Imagine Radio in Brisbane,
Calif., ``already is streaming 100 radio stations,'' says Freston.
``So if I like West African guitarists, hip-hop and classical
music, I could create a personalized radio station that reflects
those preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Rugrats'' set can turn to Project Nozzle, which will
feature online activities and games created by and for kids. MTV
purchased Nvolve, a Web development company in San Mateo, Calif.,
to create a safe site for kids by requiring parents to register
them online for access to bulletin boards, chat and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   MTV Networks' new online sites will enhance its cradle-to-grave
appeal it started with its TV channels, where kiddies watch such
shows as ``Blue's Clues'' on Nickelodeon, teens and young adults
tune into MTV, Baby Boomers view rock documentaries on VH1 and
grandparents tune into ``I Love Lucy'' on Nick at Nite or ``The
Lone Ranger'' on TV Land.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To hold on to its wide range of viewers, MTV Networks has
already retooled at least two channels and changed the way it
reaches its core teen and young adult fans.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of appealing to teens solely via the MTV channel, MTV
Films, with Paramount Pictures (both are owned by Viacom), is going
after them at the cinema. New movies include ``Varsity Blues,''
about high school football in small-town Texas. Released last
month, it already has taken in more than $48 million at the box
office. On Friday, Paramount and MTV Networks will release ``200
Cigarettes,'' a comedy set in New York's East Village on New Year's
Eve 1981. Its cast reads like a Who's Who of young Hollywood,
including Ben Affleck, Courtney Love and Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV cable channel also underwent a makeover. ``It veered off
its mark in the mid-1990s,'' says Freston, as it moved away from
music and toward vapid veejays and game shows. To get back on
track, he says, MTV hired hosts who care more about the music they
present than what they look like. ``Carson Daly is not a glamour
boy, and that's the point,'' Freston says of the host who's dating
Jennifer Love Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand its viewers, the channel sent researchers
into the closets and record collections of 100 young adults last
summer to study their pop culture tastes. It also has set up a
studio overlooking Times Square that raised its profile with both
artists and audiences.
</P>
<P>
   MTV Networks turned Nickelodeon into a must-see channel for
children when it spent about $30 million in the early 1990s to
develop animated hits like ``Rugrats'' and ``Blue's Clues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed Nickelodeon to be more about entertainment, because
when it was `educational' kids didn't like it,'' Freston says.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Blue's Clues,'' live-action host Steven Burns never talks
down to his young audience. Instead, he and his animated dog, Blue,
enlist young viewers to help to look for clues and solve problems.
``Rugrats'' revolves around cartoon babies, but it is closer in
spirit to ``The Simpsons'' than ``Barney'' as it mocks the yuppie
behavior of parents Stu and Didi Pickles.
</P>
<P>
   The goal behind such programming, says Freston, ``is to develop
shows that kids like and will stay with until they know it's time
to move on to MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV Networks' toughest task may be to figure out how to reach
Boomers past age 50. ``I don't know that a music video network is
an approach that will work for them,'' says Freston. ``In our
cradle-to-grave coverage, we're sort of missing the grave part. For
now, internally at MTV we're calling it VH2.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, MTV Networks will offer increasingly customized
entertainment for ever-larger audiences. ``The one thing we can
count on as we move into the next millennium,'' Freston says, ``is
the continued de-massification of the media worldwide.''

TOMATOES RIPE FOR PLANTING IN EARLY SPRING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Any way you slice it, the best-tasting tomatoes are
home-grown.
</P>
<P>
   For best results in the home garden, plant early.
</P>
<P>
   Diehards have already seeded tomatoes indoors. Daredevils may
have already transplanted outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us will find tomato transplants in local nurseries,
ready to go into a sunny, organically enriched, well-draining bed.
Several garden centers are already stocked.
</P>
<P>
   For many, March is tomato time, but a February head start is
hard to pass up when the weather is as mild as it has been this
winter. Whatever your planting date, keep an eye on the weather to
avoid being caught off guard by frost.
</P>
<P>
   While tomatoes don't like cold weather, it's important to plant
them in early spring, as many varieties won't set if night
temperatures climb above 72 degrees. For those of you new to the
area, it warms quickly here. An early start gives you a better shot
at a good harvest before the summer heat shuts down production.
</P>
<P>
   When you visit your nursery you'll see small, plastic tabs in
each tomato pot. Read these, as they not only give the variety name
but other useful information _ whether the tomato is determinate or
indeterminate and to what extent it is disease-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Determinate tomatoes have vines that put on little growth once
fruit is set, so you get a short harvest time. Indeterminate vines
keep growing after fruit sets, and tomatoes in various stages of
development may be on the vine at one time. The harvest may last
months.
</P>
<P>
   Buy stocky transplants and only disease-resistant varieties.
These will hold up best in our warm, humid climate. Disease
resistance for a particular variety is indicated by V for
resistance to verticillium wilt and F for resistance to fusarium
wilt. N means a tomato is resistant to nematodes, T that it is
resistant to tobacco mosaic virus and A for resistance to
alternaria.
</P>
<P>
   Methods vary among tomato gardeners, but all agree that tomatoes
are most productive in full sun. An organically enriched,
well-draining soil is important, too. Prior to planting, work in 40
to 60 pounds of compost per 100 square feet, some cottonseed meal
as a nitrogen source and bone meal as a phosphorus source that will
encourage root growth, which in turns promotes better flowering.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the bottom leaves from each tomato transplant, then plant
deeper than it grew in the small pot. New roots will grow along the
buried portion of the stem, and since tomato plants are heavy
feeders and can become so large here, a heavy-duty root system is
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Mulch around the plants to help retain soil moisture, reduce
weeds, discourage soil-borne diseases and keep future fruits clean.
The mulch will keep soil temperatures down during warm weather and
enrich the soil as it breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   Place a heavy-duty tomato cage around each young plant. It is
too difficult to cage a large plant. You'll break the stems. Wrap
the cage with fiber row cover. This keeps bugs and diseases at bay
and gives the plants a good, healthy start. The cover also will
provide protection should we have a late frost. Don't worry: Light
and water penetrate these covers.
</P>
<P>
   Good air circulation is vital to tomato health, and caging helps
improve air movement within a plant.
</P>
<P>
   Again, fertilization schedules differ among tomato growers. Some
use fertilizers created especially for tomatoes. One successful
gardener begins biweekly applications of fish emulsion when
transplants have been in the ground a week. Others apply this
monthly. Some advocate side-dressing with a nitrogen source
(21-0-0) every three weeks when the first tiny fruit appears. The
goal is to supply nutrients, but keep in mind that while tomatoes
like nitrogen, too much may trigger brown spots on the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Even soil moisture will prevent fruit from cracking, discourage
blossom drop and blossom-end rot. To help ensure a harvest for
Memorial Day picnics, beat the birds. Harvest tomatoes when they
show a first blush on the bottom of the fruit.
</P>

   The group of female American tourists danced a crowd-stopping
dance of the veil. Outside the vast shrine in the center of Mashad,
Iran, the women struggled with their chadors, shroudlike garments
that cover all but the face and must be secured with one hand held
under the chin. There are no hooks or zippers to make the job
easier.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough that we were already wearing scarves on our
heads and loose garments that hid the shape of our torsos. This was
the holiest pilgrimage site in Iran, the place where Imam Reza, the
eighth of the 12 imams, or religious leaders, in Shiite Islam, died
in the ninth century and is buried. And even though the shrine
itself was off limits to non-Muslims, we were allowed to walk
through the outer courtyard, watch an informational film at a
foreign reception center and tour the museums on the vast compound.
But only if we disguised ourselves in the veils that our guide
handed out as we emerged from our bus.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian schoolchildren giggled at the sight. A grizzled Iranian
man asked to have his picture taken with us. One of the men in our
group threw his sportcoat over his head and jumped into the
picture.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the equivalent of feet-binding in China, anything to keep
women off-balance!'' complained Isabel Jacobs, a retired history
teacher from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I came here, I believed in women's liberation,'' said
Dorothy Wright, a retired teacher of English literature from
Middletown, N.J. ``Now I believe in women's domination!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even I, who have been going to Iran as a journalist for 20
years, have never gotten used to this unwieldy garment, which lets
me take notes only if I hold it together in my teeth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of Iran's revolutionary regime, which took
power in 1979, tourists _ particularly American tourists _ were
considered dangerous invaders bent on sullying Islamic purity with
Western culture. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of Iran's
revolution, liked to rant about ``the Western sickness among us,''
stating plainly that ``there is no fun in Islam.'' Indeed, I never
went to Iran for the night life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, American tourists are no longer considered as ugly
as they once were. Iran's regime is beginning to smile back, luring
them with its treasures: the monumental ruins of ancient Persia,
the intricately patterned mosques of Islam, the glittering palaces
of the shahs, the landscapes of snowcapped mountains and rice
paddies and palm-studded deserts. For about two years, intrepid
Americans have ventured in, most of them on group tours organized
by U.S. and Canadian companies, but some on customized private
visits.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pace of the visits quickened after January 1998, when Iran's
smiling president, Mohammed Khatami, used an interview with CNN to
initiate a ``cultural exchange'' of intellectuals, artists and
tourists to break down what he called ``the wall of mistrust''
between the United States and Iran. The steep drop in oil prices in
the past year has contributed to Iran's eagerness to attract
dollar-carrying Americans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The family and friends of my 18 traveling companions thought
they were crazy to come. We were, after all, in a country that the
Clinton administration considers the world's most active fomenter
of terrorism, that once held U.S. diplomats hostage and that has no
official relations with the United States. Consular matters are
handled by the Swiss, whose country represents American interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in late November, just days after our return home, a bus
carrying 17 American business executives returning to their hotel
from the airport was attacked by a small band of angry young men
wielding clubs and bats who smashed the bus windows and chanted in
Farsi, ``God is great! Death to America!''
</P>
<P>
   The driver sped off across town to another hotel, where the
group sought refuge until they could make it safely back to their
own. The Americans remained under the protection of the Swiss. The
Swiss ambassador escorted the group to the airport for its
departure the next night.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the attack, a hard-line newspaper had announced
that the group included spies disguised as tourists. And afterward,
the organization claiming responsibility issued a communique
stating, ``Your children performed their first operation against
American spies.'' It added, ``Iran is no place for American Yankees
and our next operation will be the performance of our slogan `Death
to America.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured; Iranian officials loudly condemned the
attack and American visitors have been left unharmed since then.
But the incident was a chilling reminder that Iran is not a benign
place, even to visit. And it just as easily could have been our
group, which included a retired Navy captain and a retired Foreign
Service officer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But our small band was intrepid, well traveled and well
prepared. Members talked knowingly of the volcanic sands of
Guatemala, the cashews of Mozambique, the barracudas of Belize.
They carried medical kits that included sutures and hypodermic
needles. They knew how to check the tires of domestic airplanes.
They could find the 24-hour supermarket in Tehran to buy caviar and
the synagogues in Isfahan on their own.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our 14-day journey took us through Tehran, Mashad, Kermanshah,
Hamadan, Kerman, Bam, Yazd, Shiraz, Persepolis, Isfahan, Kashan and
Qum. We were free to go wherever we wanted and, except for military
installations, airports, mosque interiors and some museums, took
photographs as we wished.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Americans came for various reasons. Lois Clark, a retired
teacher, and her husband, Daniel, a retired radiologist, from Iowa,
were struggling to understand the culture that shaped their
Iranian-born son-in-law. Martha Habermann, who runs a nursing home
in upstate New York, called it ``the frisson of doing something
adventurous.'' Ronald Endeman, a lawyer from San Diego, counted
Iran as the 235th country he has visited so far (but then, he
counted places like Sicily and Hawaii as countries, too).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Our guide was Hossein Shams-ol-mali, a retired teacher who
couldn't quite support himself and his wife on his small pension.
No matter that his English was flawed and his explanations opaque.
Shams, as we called him, was a gentleman, ever patient with our
endless questions. (Why are there no dogs on the street? Do Jews
serve in the Army? Do dervishes really whirl?) He also played
bellman and waiter when necessary.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our tour was run by Bestway Tours and Safaris, of Vancouver,
British Columbia, although several of us who had booked through
Absolute Asia, a New York-based company, didn't know that until we
arrived. We also discovered that Bestway had charged tour members
only $2,790 for their trip, excluding air fare; we had paid
Absolute Asia $3,125.
</P>
<P>
   Absolute Asia explained in a letter that the additional cost
covered ``personalized itinerary planning'' as well as visa
processing. (In fact I had arranged my own visa.)
</P>
<P>
   Iran's tourist infrastructure functions surprisingly well,
considering how few high-paying tourists have ventured in over the
last two decades. The hotels built during the 1970s oil boom have
seen better days, but have been renovated and function fairly well.
Domestic air travel is cheap, remarkably safe and on time.
Pharmacies are well stocked. Persian cuisine is a delight (when one
can get away from the ubiquitous kabobs); fresh fruits and
vegetables are grown throughout the country, and in Tehran the tap
water is considered better than the bottled variety.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But our tour bus was in need of repair and cleaning. The
air-conditioning blew hard through the holes where overhead lights
should have been. There were no seat belts and no toilet. The
choking air pollution from leaded gasoline fumes can be troubling
for people with respiratory problems, particularly in the big
cities such as Tehran and Isfahan.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Except at the mosques, the women in our group took risks with
their dress almost from the start. Our guide made the mistake of
telling us at our first orientation that we did not have to wear
the poorly sewn, ankle-length polyester coats handed out at the
beginning of the tour. So some women donned their husbands' shirts
over pants and exchanged their scarves for hats. It was
unseasonably hot, so we even dared to go bareheaded on the bus,
which elicited wide-eyed stares (but no arrests).
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were uncomfortable incidents when perfect strangers
told us we were misbehaving. For instance, when one female tour
member posed for a photograph with a group of giggling Iranian
women in their chadors in Mashad, a man barked at the women not to
allow their faces to be photographed.
</P>
<P>
   Bending the rules did not extend to alcohol. When security
guards at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport discovered several tiny bottles
of liquor in the suitcase of one tour member, there were threats to
confiscate our luggage, hold up our departure and even try the
alleged culprit in an Iranian court. Eventually, the security guard
and airport police were paid off; we made our flight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were times when political reality and the official
animosity toward the United States intruded. Some of my fellow
travelers were offended by a neon sign at Tehran's airport
announcing in English that, ``In future, Islam will destroy Satanic
sovereignty of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With one hand they're telling us we're demons,'' said Ms.
Wright. ``With the other hand, they're taking our money.''
</P>
<P>
   We happened to be in Isfahan on the 19th anniversary of the
seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, which began the 444-day
nightmare of U.S. diplomats held hostage and led to the rupture of
diplomatic relations with Iran. Banners hanging throughout the city
proclaimed ``Death to America'' in Farsi and ``Down With U.S.A.''
in English. We were kept far away from the city's demonstration _
largely of schoolchildren bused in for the event _ at a sports
stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lead story on the television news that night showed footage
from demonstrations in more than a dozen cities around the country.
The only problem was that some of the footage obviously came from
the archives. Still, members of our group were not amused. ``I've
been smiling at people up to now,'' said Fritz Wright, a retired
engineer. ``At this point I don't know whether to smile at them or
not.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our tour did not include a drive-by of the confiscated U.S.
Embassy compound in Tehran, for years a school for training
revolutionary guards. But I took two of the members of our group
for a firsthand look on our last day. Its walls had been freshly
painted with anti-American images, including a giant head of a
skeleton as the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trip, the official animosity towards the United
States government contrasted sharply with the shock and sheer joy
of ordinary Iranians in encountering Americans who liked Iran well
enough to come touring. ``In China, people come up to you and talk,
but they don't kiss you and say they love you like they do here,''
said Ms. Habermann. When I told a porter in the hotel in Hamadan,
which is off the foreign tourist track, where I was from, he looked
bewildered. ``Who let you in?'' he asked.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What makes it especially difficult to penetrate the country is
that Iranians operate in two worlds. Behavior is much more relaxed
in the privacy of one's home, where even the most devout Muslim
women remove their head coverings. And in secular families, one may
even be offered a shot of bootleg vodka or a glass of homemade
wine. For the most part, our group operated in a parallel universe,
seeing the externals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there were moments of discovery, many of them disheartening.
Katharine Loring, an emergency room nurse and bicyclist, said that
Iran would be a great place to take a bike trek, but then learned
that men and women must ride bikes on segregated tracks. Endeman,
the lawyer, gave a young Iranian woman friend of mine a good-bye
hug in front of our hotel in Shiraz, and she recoiled in fear: Men
and women who are not close relatives are not even supposed to
shake hands.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inside the shrine of the brother of Imam Reza in Shiraz, where
women wept and moaned as they begged God for favors, Ms. Loring
cuddled the baby of a mother of two. ``Take my baby to America,''
the mother said matter-of-factly. ``She is better off growing up
there.'' When Ms. Loring balked, the woman said she could take her
7-year-old daughter instead, much to the horror of the girl, who
clutched her mother's leg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The American women were incensed that Iranian women have to ride
in the back of the bus. And then there was the incident of the
restaurant toilets in in Shiraz. The men's was a familiar Western,
chairlike model; the women's was, as in most places, a porcelain
hole in the ground that required squatting. The women simply barged
past the male attendant into the men's room. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And it was those restrictions, those arbitrary limits on
freedom, that irritated Mel Jiganti, a retired judge from Chicago
who came carrying a paperback copy of the Koran. ``The only other
place I've ever felt like this was in the Army, when I had a
sergeant who had arbitrary power over me,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then the magic of Iran took over.
</P>
<P>
   We sought refuge from the stares and smog on the footpaths of
the enormous Bagh-e Eram in Shiraz, a sprawling public garden
filled with 200-year-old cypress, pomegranate, salt cedar and sour
cherry trees, musk roses, coxcomb and honeysuckle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We soaked in the view of palm groves in the desert from the top
of the medieval mud-walled citadel and town at Bam, then sipped
mango juice at a charming teahouse there run by an Iranian woman
who beckoned with the words, ``We are waiting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   We left the world of Shiite Islam far behind in Hamadan at a
mausoleum with a basket of yarmulkes at the entrance and a wall
engraved with the Ten Commandments in Hebrew. There, according to
legend, Esther and Mordecai are buried.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered a wedding reception at our hotel one evening in
Shiraz and ventured in for a peek. The sister of the bride
introduced us around to the other women, dressed in fancy cocktail
dresses, their hair lacquered, their faces beautifully made up.
They danced in a conga line led by the bride. The men, meanwhile,
were banished to a separate room, just as at an Orthodox Jewish
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Persepolis, the seat of Persia's ancient kings and
Iran's most important archaeological treasure, that awed the
Americans. Walking through the vast remains of the palace started
in the sixth century B.C. by Darius the Great reduced our garrulous
group to few words.
</P>
<P>
   So should Americans who have been everywhere else go to Iran?
``If you wait until it gets more efficient, all the spontaneity and
surprise will be lost,'' said Cynthia Katz, a part-time travel
agent from Nyack, N.Y., as we walked through the vast, perfectly
proportioned 17th-century square in the center of Isfahan. ``When
this place starts looking like the Sistine Chapel with wall-to-wall
people, it's not going to be fun anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Miner, the chairman of the Chicago-based Mid-America
Committee, who had led the tour of the Americans who were attacked,
admitted in an interview that he might have gone to Iran too soon.
``I don't think Iranians are ready for Americans _ even tourists,''
he said. ``I don't think there is anyone in that country who can
protect you.''
</P>
<P>
   Logistics
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to go it alone as a tourist in Iran. Technically,
tourists must be invited by the Iranian government. A number of
U.S. companies provide organized tours and can facilitate the visa
application process. In the absence of diplomatic relations, it is
probably safer traveling with a tour operator known to Iranian
authorities. Inventive travelers can add on their own personalized
itineraries. On our tour, one woman in her 60s spent several days
before our arrival traveling with a female guide to the ancient
ruins in Susa, and several days afterward at the Caspian Sea. She
said this part of the trip went better than our tour.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with a prepaid tour also allows one to avoid taking a
large amount of cash. The embargo theoretically precludes Iranians
from cashing traveler's checks drawn on American banks or accepting
American credit cards. However, on this trip I used a Mastercard
from Chase Manhattan at hotels in Tehran and Isfahan. The staff
could not explain how it circumvented the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Tour Companies
</P>
<P>
   I bought my tour through Absolute Asia in New York, (800)
736-8187; it was operated by Bestway Tours and Safaris (see below).
Tour members who booked through Bestway paid less than the $3,125 a
person that Absolute Asia charged. Ken Fish, president of Absolute
Asia, said the company was now dealing directly with an Iranian
company and had 15-night tours for $2,625 and $2,895 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies selling tours to Iran include the following:
</P>
<P>
   Bestway Tours and Safaris, Vancouver, British Columbia, (800)
663-0844. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Travel in San Jose, Calif., (800) 332-9787.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Distant Horizons in Long Beach, Calif., (800) 333-1240.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Geographic Expeditions in San Francisco, (800) 777-8183.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to put together an itinerary directly with an
Iranian company such as Iran Ziggurat Tour &AMP; Travel Agency, (9821)
643-9539, fax (9821) 643-9538. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A number of Western airlines fly to Iran, and tickets can be
booked through tour operators. I use VTS Travel, (703) 790-9779, a
small agency in Vienna, Va., owned by Vajihe Tahbaz, a charming
Iranian woman.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hotels
</P>
<P>
   Many of the better hotels were once part of American hotel
chains and have been renovated. Most hotel personnel speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight hotels where we stayed during our tour, only one,
the Akhavan Hotel in Kerman, was inadequate. Guests complained of
leaky toilets, dirty carpets and insects.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some hotels of note; tax of 18 percent is added to all
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ISFAHAN _ Grand Abbasi Hotel, (98-31) 22-6011, fax (98-31)
22-6008. This 218-room hotel built around the skeleton of a
caravanserai is by far the best place to stay in Iran, with
dazzling carpets, tile work and carvings. Ask for a room in the
original part of the hotel. Doubles start at $95.
</P>
<P>
   SHIRAZ _ Homa Hotel, (98-71) 28-001, fax (98-71) 48-021, has
been renovated and provides good service.It is where wealthy local
people hold their weddings. Doubles from $95.
</P>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ Karoon Hotel, (98-21) 890-1848, fax (98-21) 890-1962,
is a small, simple inexpensive hotel in the center of Tehran with a
welcoming manager, worn carpets and temperamental plumbing and
phones. Doubles from $40.
</P>
<P>
   Laleh Hotel, (98-21) 65-5021, fax (98-21) 65-5517, has towels
and glasses still bearing the Inter-Continental logo. Most of the
staff is friendly and eager to please. Doubles from $99.
</P>
<P>
   Homa Hotel, the former Sheraton, (98-21) 877-3021, fax (98-21)
879-7179, is newer than the Laleh, but the staff is not as nice.
Doubles from $120.
</P>
<P>
   Food
</P>
<P>
   Many of Iran's best restaurants (and all its fine wine cellars)
closed with the coming of the revolution two decades ago. Our group
ate mainly in hotels, where the food was plentiful and reliable but
not special. The best way to dine in Iran is to get invited to a
private home, difficult but not impossible even for first-time
visitors because Iranians are so hospitable.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite restaurants is Ali Qapoo in Tehran, (98-21)
878-4120, less because of the food than the lively atmosphere and
the musicians (only male) who play traditional music. Dinner, about
$33 for two.
</P>
<P>
   There are many different kinds of khoresh, slowly simmering
stews served with rice. The best is khoresh fesenjoon, a duck stew
cooked in walnut and pomegranate sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Caviar is expensive in restaurants, when it is available; better
to go to the 24-hour Refah supermarket chain in Tehran. Good hotels
have refrigerators in the rooms.

 &HT;    ISRAELIS ABROAD EXPECTED TO FLY HOME FOR ELECTIONS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM During elections in other countries, activists try to
``get out the vote.'' In Israel, they try to fly the vote in.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand Israelis, in a series of competing and
hush-hush political airlifts, are expected to come from America and
Europe to cast their ballots in elections this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The influx is apparently a result of Israelis' dedication to
politics, their penchant for traveling and living abroad, and a
system that allows absentee ballots to only a select few.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are individual Israelis headed back, but the country's
national airline, El Al, is offering election discounts for those
wishing to return. And, reportedly, several competing groups are
arranging charter flights for voters leaning their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be kind of a race between (airlift) efforts,'' said
Israeli political analyst Daniel Elazar, of the Jerusalem Center
for Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for prime minister are May 17, with an almost certain
run-off on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Yedioth Aharanot, Israel's largest daily newspaper, reported
recently that five unnamed organizations, ranging from the left
wing to the ultra-Orthodox right wing, were organizing subsidized
flights back for the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the report is difficult because some of the groups do
not want to tip off their rivals. Ultra-Orthodox groups deny that
they are involved, as the left wing activists allege.
</P>
<P>
   But, it is widely believed that ultra-Orthodox Israeli citizens
from New York returned on subsidized flights in 1996 to vote for
election winner Benjamin Netanyahu. Accounts may be exaggerated,
but they have prompted protests in the Israeli parliament and now
opponents want to use the same tactic to counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli voters are ready to oblige. The small, tense, country,
still faces a war in Lebanon and occasional terrorism on its
streets _ factors that motivate citizens to want to vote. And
people living overseas who take politics personally are willing to
pay hundreds of dollars, missing school or work, to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli law allows them to stay on the voting rolls even if they
are out of the country for years and have not voted in the previous
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 elections showed why activists think it's worthwhile to
fly in their allies.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu defeated Shimon Peres by a mere 29,457 votes out of
about 3.1 million cast. Considering that voter turnout was 79
percent typical here, but mammoth by American standards there is
not much slack within the country for picking up new votes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, absentee ballots are available only to Israelis in
special services, such as the diplomatic corps. Israel, a country
that used waves of immigrants to strengthen its claim to the land,
never wanted its citizens to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But many do leave, to study or work for a few years, or to live
permanently under dual citizenship in another country. Gavri
Bargil, an organizer of the New York-based group Kesher, estimates
that there are 300,000 Israelis living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kesher, formed in the last few months, seeks to maintain
connections between Israelis overseas and back home. But Bargil
said the elections provided the urgency for starting the group,
which is organizing flights for voters at discounted rates.
</P>
<P>
   He said the goal is to fly a few thousand people to Israel for
the run-off election at a cost around $450 each, half of the
typical price.
</P>
<P>
   Bargil said the group does not ask how people will vote, which
would be illegal. But, he concedes that the offer might be of most
interest to people who are dissatisfied with Netanyahu's current
right-wing government.
</P>
<P>
   Bargil himself used to head the left wing Peace Now, Israel's
largest political group.
</P>
<P>
   A European effort, apparently loosely aimed at left wing voters,
is attempting to fly Israelis home for just a $50 contribution.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the widely rumored ultra-Orthodox efforts in 1996
may be small this time.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the ultra-Orthodox efforts are hazy. The Chabad,
or Lubavitch Jewish movement, was accused of flying in voters in
1996. A spokesman in Israel said the group did not then and will
not this time.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rabbi Tzvi Berkowitz, director of the Chabad youth
organization in Miami, said that he had heard rumors ``that
something is going on . . . if it is a rumor or an actual act they
are talking about, I cannot tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Liebman, an Israeli professor in politics and religion
at Tel Aviv's Bar-Ilan University, said the Lubavitch Jews will try
to keep a ``low profile.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, they have been disillusioned with Netanyahu, who
they have accused of breaking promises by turning over land to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were severely burned,'' Liebman said. ``I don't think the
ultra-religious parties, at this point, are that worked up.''

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Food was not exactly the highlight of my year in Africa. It was
1969. The Biafran war was on.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember much about Biafran cuisine, frankly, but I know
it involved a lot of stockfish. Stockfish is dried cod, stiff as a
board, and mercenary cowboys flew tons of it into the rebellious
little enclave from an island called Fernando Poo.
</P>
<P>
   I went along once, sitting on top of the cargo in the back of a
wheezing DC-3, where I had a better view of the pilot than I
wanted. He had only one hand on the controls, since he needed the
other to hold a bottle of Scotch. He was as stiff as the stockfish.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nigerian side of the lines, I usually ate groundnut stew.
Groundnuts are peanuts, sort of. The stew was just about as awful
as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry as usual on a visit to Sierra Leone, I plowed into
something listed as ``pepper steak'' on a hotel menu. The dining
room was dark, and I admit I didn't examine my plate closely. It
was a steak, sort of, but the thing had been saturated with
incendiary chilies, not the benign black peppercorns I expected. I
was on a liquid diet for a week.
</P>
<P>
   A prudent man takes evasive action, so I ate a lot of the time
in the agreeable little Lebanese restaurants that you used to find
in African cities.
</P>
<P>
   I also rejoiced when the news took me to former French colonies,
which were still pretty French. I jumped at things like a $20
Cavaillon melon in Cameroon (that's 20 1969 dollars, remember) and
a lovely Mediterranean loup, or bass, fresh off the plane from
Marseilles, perfectly grilled over fennel twigs in a desert hotel
in Niamey, Niger.
</P>
<P>
   Eating spiny lobster in Dakar, Senegal, you could almost imagine
yourself in Nice. Monomaniacs, the French, but they do eat well.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Africans I met had more important things on their
minds. They were too busy either fighting for their lives or
scraping a living to pay much attention to food, as long as there
was enough of it. The privileged elites were too busy aping the
Europeans who had just given them their freedom to pay much
attention to local food traditions.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a week or so in 1969 with guerrillas fighting to gain
independence for Eritrea, then a province of Ethiopia. Neither they
nor I had much to eat. It seemed highly unlikely then that the
rebels would win, but they finally did, after a devastating 30-year
war. It seems almost unbelievable that the fighting has resumed in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to me, of course, that one day I would sit
down to sophisticated meals in an Eritrean restaurant worlds away
in New Haven, but that happened, too.
</P>
<P>
   Caffe Adulis, a block from the Yale University campus, is a
byproduct of the war that created modern Eritrea, an East African
country of 3.5 million along the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   I guess you would call it an ethnic restaurant. Invited for
lunch, I went along expecting ``ethnic'' decor: you know, two weary
travel posters and a half-dead philodendron. Instead, I found a
clean-lined, two-level space, airy and immaculate, with handsome
chairs, butcher paper covering the linen on the tables and lively
semiabstract pictures on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   That was one surprise. Another was the food. My wife, Betsey,
who doesn't have much time for Birkenstocks or Lonely Planet
cuisine, loved it, and so did I. It made up for a lot of culinary
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was created by three refugee brothers named
Ghebreyesus _ Ficre, 36, Gideon, 38, and Sahle, 28, the sons of a
judge _ who escaped in the 1970s from the chaos in Asmara, the
Eritrean capital, and came to New Haven at the suggestion of their
sister, who was working with a church group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She chose it, Gideon said, ``so we wouldn't get involved in all
the big-city craziness but we'd be close enough so she could keep
an eye on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ficre is the cook (and the painter of the pictures on the
restaurant's walls). Before opening the cafe in October 1992, he
toiled in other people's restaurants in New Haven for a dozen
years, which may account for the consistency of his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't excellent one day and awful the next, the way some
are,'' said his brother Gideon, who works in the dining room with
Sahle.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the subtlety and complexity of Eritrea's cooking,
which Ficre Ghebreyesus interprets as the spirit moves him, that
makes Caffe Adulis so distinctive. If geography has cost Eritrea
dear, politically, in the form of long years of foreign domination,
it has conferred great benefits, gastronomically, by opening it to
the influences of three continents.
</P>
<P>
   Indian spices, the collard greens of sub-Saharan Africa, the
hummus of the Middle East and the couscous of North Africa mingle
with Greece's feta cheese and the pasta of Italy, once Eritrea's
colonial master.
</P>
<P>
   Two staples define Eritrean cuisine. One is injera, a moist,
spongy sourdough crepe made from teff, a kind of millet grown in
the East African highlands. Its slightly sour taste offsets the
sweetness of some of the food that it accompanies, either in a kind
of Eritrean burrito, with lentils, salads and seasonings rolled
into it, or as a scoop for picking up other foods.
</P>
<P>
   The second is berbere, a blend of spices and sun-dried peppers,
about the size of banana peppers, grown in the East African
highlands. The hot yet mellow flavor cannot be duplicated, Ficre
Ghebreyesus insists, with anything grown in Mexico or Louisiana. He
imports berbere and other spices from his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   One of the regulars at Caffe Adulis is Robert Ferris Thompson, a
charismatic Yale professor, who explores the links between the
painting, sculpture, music and dance of Africa and those of the
United States and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   He drops by one evening and orders ``Master T's Favorite'' _
jalapenos stuffed with tomatoes, onions, garlic and scallions and
moistened with olive oil. Taking in the scene, he makes notes on a
corner of the paper tablecloth; when he is finished, he rips it off
and takes it home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A's favorites _ not, alas, so listed on the menu _ were
menchetabish, a dry beef curry with a surprising hint of rosemary;
a wonderfully balanced salad of seared tuna cubes, fava beans,
onions and bitter greens (arugala, collards, spinach), and a killer
coconut sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Alexander, Ficre's wife, who directs the poetry center
at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., called the sorbet ``an
ideal ending, with one perfectly clean note.'' Quite so.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. A's favorite? She was thrilled by a vegetarian dish, one of
several offered, called two-tomato gig, a creamy, hearty
combination of oven-roasted whole tomatoes that collapse and
caramelize as they cook, with mozzarella cheese, bermuda onion and
arugula.
</P>
<P>
   A house specialty is shrimp barka, whose list of ingredients
vividly underlines the multicultural origins of Eritrean cooking.
Pan-seared jumbo shrimp are served in a quickly cooked tomato
sauce, flavored with basil and red onions and topped with Parmesan
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Italian, right? Not exactly. Unsweetened coconut and dates, from
Africa, also figure in the mixture, and the whole is served over
basmati rice from India.
</P>
<P>
   Another shrimp dish uses an equally unlikely combination of
ingredients: tomatoes, onions, garlic, hot peppers, scallions ...
and ultracrisp strips of cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   A third shrimp creation is served on fettuccine, strictly al
dente.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is all this authentic?'' I asked Ficre, a little dubiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tricky word, authentic,'' he replied. ``Tricky idea. Food
ideas move around the world very quickly today, and if you went to
Eritrea, you'd find American touches here and there. There are tens
of thousands of Eritreans living in the United States, and when
they go home, they take new food ideas with them. For us, that's no
more foreign than pasta once was.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Haven, salsas and portobello mushrooms have found a place
in Ficre's kitchen, as has guacamole. In New Haven, the drinks list
is longer. There are African beers, like Mamba from the Ivory Coast
and Xingu, a dark brew from Brazil, but also first-class wines from
a half-dozen countries, including Domaine Drouhin, a standout pinot
noir from Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   This is no cheap and cheerful student hangout; some main courses
cost as much as $16 to $19. But it has been a success from the
start, attracting students, professors, theatergoers and
townspeople, to say nothing of businessmen and lawyers, who often
book the cafe for office parties. On weekends, there is a wait of
up to 90 minutes for tables.
</P>
<P>
   Brought to America by slaves, African ingredients and dishes
have long since entered the culinary mainstream here; Southern
standbys like okra, gumbo and black-eyed peas, among others, all
have their origins in Africa. But they have never achieved the
cachet of some Moroccan dishes, like b'stilla, a sweet-savory
pigeon pie, or Algerian couscous.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Ghebreyesus brothers is one small sign that
African food, cooked and served with flair, can have broad appeal.
Another is a new book, ``The Africa Cookbook: Taste of a
Continent,'' by Jessica B. Harris, a professor at Queens College
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I stumbled across yet another, in an unlikely setting:
Arizona. There on the wide-ranging, almost recklessly eclectic menu
of Roxsand, a Phoenix restaurant, I spotted piri piri shrimp among
the appetizers. A vibrant saute of shrimp in olive oil with garlic
and chopped peanuts, it was taught to Roxsand Scocos by a waiter,
whose family had fled South Africa years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She confessed with some embarrassment that she used Tabasco
sauce instead of peppers from Africa, but the dish tasted terrific,
anyway _ every bit as good as the piri piri shrimp I ate a couple
of years ago in a waterfront dive in Cape Town.

ANCIENT MONUMENT COMPLEX IN EASTERN TURKEY IS ENDANGERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ One of Turkey's most imposing archaeological
monuments, a collection of ancient thrones and giant busts on Mount
Nemrut in the eastern part of the country, is deteriorating and in
urgent need of protection, according to archaeologists and other
experts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nemrut ruins are the legacy of a little-known kingdom called
Commagene, which gained its independence from the Seleucids in 162
B.C. and was annexed to the Roman province of Syria 234 years
later. Historians call the kingdom semi-Iranian, and its kings
professed a version of the Zoroastrian faith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pre-eminent among these kings was Antiochus I, and it was he who
built the colossal heads and the rest of the vast monument on Mount
Nemrut, which lies in the Anatolian highlands 510 miles east of
Ankara and 100 miles north of the Syrian border. The heads, some of
them nine feet high, represent deities, among them Zeus, Hercules
and Apollo, as well as eagles, lions and the king himself, together
with his ancestors. He built it as a funerary monument to himself
in the hope that he would be remembered long after his death, and
it seems he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   One travel guide describes the Nemrut ensemble, which includes
reliefs, a cave cistern and ruins of columns, as ``one of the most
awesome sights in all of Anatolia.'' Another calls Antiochus ``a
deluded king and creator of this grandiose folly.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1960s, when a rough road was built to the mountaintop,
it was accessible only by foot, a walk of two days. The road is now
paved, and the site draws many tourists, among them American
soldiers from the Incirlik air base 220 miles away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNESCO placed Mount Nemrut on its list of World Heritage Sites
in 1987, and it was made a national park the following year. As
more people became aware of the site, efforts were made to protect
it, but none has been carried to completion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it has received public attention around the world
since its discovery in 1881, the Nemrut monument has never been
fully appreciated in Turkey,'' the archaeologist Nezih Basgelen
wrote in a new book about the site. ``Unfortunately, just as
earthquakes and the harsh climate in the region have taken a toll
on the monument, uncontrolled, ever-increasing tourism also
threatens the site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One solution to this problem is to move the original statuary
and steles to a protected area and replace them with copies,''
Basgelen suggested. ``Before further damage occurs, a comprehensive
restoration and conservation project must be undertaken on Mount
Nemrut.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Dutch businessman and architect, Maurice Crijns, has formed a
foundation aimed at preserving the Nemrut monument. The foundation
has produced a five-year plan that Crijns estimates would cost $2.7
million. He said the foundation can pay for the first year or two
of work, and he believes that private donors will provide the rest
once the project begins. The plan has been endorsed by Turkey's
culture ministry, but for reasons that are not clear, the ministry
has not given him final permission to begin. Asked for comment, the
ministry said that Crijns' plan was ``still under consideration.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crijns recently met with President Suleyman Demirel and received
his blessing for the project. But so far even that has not produced
final permission for work to begin. ``Many people in Turkey don't
know how valuable this monument is,'' Crijns said. ``It's very
unknown, and unknown makes unloved. You can see pictures of it in
every travel agency in Holland, but they never say where it is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the monument is deteriorating very fast,
partly because of nature and partly by the hands of humans,'' he
continued. ``If it is not protected, within a few years there will
be nothing to protect anymore. Part of the monument is made from
soft sandstone, which cannot bear the harsh climate or the kind of
treatment it is getting from people. They are having picnics on the
rocks, making fires _ well, let me not start complaining.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the preservation plan drawn up by Crijns and his
International Nemrut Foundation, based in the Dutch town of
Eindhoven, guards would be posted at the site, the giant statues
would be restored, sandstone reliefs would be given protective
shields, and a museum would be established. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Last October the culture ministry told us we had permission to
begin work and that we should bring our team,'' Crijns said. ``We
were all there _ people from Holland, Germany and Turkey _ but the
dossier did not arrive. We called Ankara and they said `No problem,
it will come tomorrow.' But it never came, and after a week we had
to send everyone home.''

NO CRITICAL MASS YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Try as they might, President Clinton's critics
cannot make much of a woman's recently surfaced allegation that 21
years ago he raped her in a hotel room and in the process bruised
her lips.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many problems with the story, including the fact
that unlike other reports of his sexually predatory habits this
involves violence, a characteristic Clinton seems not to have.
</P>
<P>
   Our adulterous president wants to make love but not war.
</P>
<P>
   The stale charge by Juanita Broaddrick, a woman concealed as
``Jane Doe No. 5'' in an appendix to Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's report to Congress, is potentially sensational. Rape is
definitely not consensual sex. A future president of the United
States is not supposed to behave like boxer Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Whip Tom DeLay alluded to Broaddrick's murky
presence to energize House impeachment support and even predicted
that if a majority of senators knew about her, they would convict
the president. But DeLay isn't the Senate. And he certainly isn't
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since Broaddrick went public with her accusation in an interview
on the Wall Street Journal's anti-Clinton editorial page Feb. 19,
the public has calmly managed to contain itself. Most media
commentary ignored the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   This indifference bewilders the moral purists. Are we so bored
by our exhaustive studies of the president's raging testosterone
that we really mean it when we say enough is enough? Is there no
point of critical mass at which a final explosion will be triggered
to destroy this guy's support?
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, common sense and the facts will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The rape charge comes as an afterthought, an anticlimax.
Conservatives had spread the rumor for months to influence the
impeachment process, sometimes implying physical abuse far beyond a
bruised lip.
</P>
<P>
   By now, everything that can be done to punish a president for
sexual misbehavior has already been tried on Clinton, except a
criminal indictment for obstruction of justice. That may yet come
after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no criminal case to raise here, even though rape is
a felony. The statute of limitations has expired. This is ancient
history. The law does not pursue accused rapists into eternity,
even though House Republicans may want to.
</P>
<P>
   And more than a legal dodge is involved. The charge is just that
_ a charge. Broaddrick herself denied a rape had occurred when she
was initially subpoenaed in the Paula Jones case. She changed her
story when pursued by Starr's investigators. But an FBI statement
in an appendix to the Starr House report calls her account
``inconclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC-TV interviewed her before the Wall Street Journal but did
not run her account because it could not be adequately
corroborated. Clinton's presence in the hotel at the time could not
even be established.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the supposed event, Broaddrick told friends she
had been raped. After Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky became
public, he told some associates about it. Yet his account of what
happened turned out to be misleading and self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and the House impeachment prosecutors had hoped Broaddrick
would bolster another accusation of obstruction of justice to add
to their impeachment articles. But she insisted that Clinton had
never threatened retaliation or tried to influence her story in any
way. So she became irrelevant to the impeachment process, and her
name did not surface publicly during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Does she now become relevant to the political process of keeping
alive the accumulated picture of President Clinton as an immoral
influence in order to hurt Democrats in the 2000 election? Only if
you can accept without evidence that Clinton, a man who has spent
his life working to make people adore him, is really capable of
physically attacking anyone. Not even Paula Jones claimed that.

A STILL ILL-DEFINED GERMANY DEFINES FOREIGNERS AS ENEMIES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUBEN, Germany _ Fresh white paint has been applied where Nazi
swastikas were daubed, and, where the young Algerian immigrant lay
and bled to death, carnations, tulips and irises are strewn.
</P>
<P>
   For Farid Guendoul, 28, the end came suddenly in this depressed
eastern German town. Here the hopes of a studious young man in
flight from the Algerian blood bath met the racist violence spawned
by Germany's uneasy unification of a capitalist west and a formerly
Communist east.
</P>
<P>
   The evening began innocently for Guendoul at the Dance Club.
Then a group of neo-Nazi skinheads arrived. An altercation. Frantic
flight. An attempt to plunge through the glass door of an apartment
building as his pursuers screamed ``Auslaender raus!'' _
``Foreigners Out!'' A severed artery in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bled to death in 15 minutes,'' said Petra Hertwig, a
spokeswoman for the state prosecutor's office in the nearby town of
Cottbus. Four neo-Nazi youths have been arrested on charges of
manslaughter and breach of the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The image of a young Algerian hounded to his death on Feb. 13 by
racists hurling abuse has shocked Germany, stirring ministers to
appeal for ``civic courage'' to fight xenophobia and prompting
renewed questioning about the country's immigration policy. Yet, in
its way, this was a predictable death.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Brandenburg, surrounding Berlin, has become home to
a particularly noxious form of racism. As in most of the former
East Germany, unemployment is high, disappointment with a decade of
``capitalism'' rampant, closed habits of mind still widespread and
anger simmering. Last year, 93 racist attacks were recorded there,
including several that led to severe injury.
</P>
<P>
   While the situation in the western part of Germany is far less
tense, the problems of Brandenburg underscore the difficulties
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder faces in trying to push through new
laws that would make it easier for many of Germany's seven million
foreigners to become German citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In Guben, on the Polish border, where Guendoul arrived 18 months
ago to seek asylum, the large textile factory of the communist era
has closed. The hat factory limps along. The chemical plant uses
one-tenth of the labor force of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of its 10,000 industrial jobs in 1989, 2,000 are left today and
the unemployment rate has reached 23 percent. More than 6,000
people have departed. That leaves a population of 27,000 in this
town, where the hopes kindled by the fall of the Berlin Wall have
turned to ashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people expected a different kind of development, and
they are disappointed,'' said Gottfried Hain, the mayor. ``There is
a general feeling of being besieged by competition, and that can
lead to resentment of foreigners. Among young people, the search
for identity gives rise to these rightist gangs.''
</P>
<P>
   The town is particularly tense because it lies on the Polish
border. Many of the more than 100,000 asylum seekers who pour into
Germany every year cross that border and the nearby Czech border
seeking to benefit from Europe's most liberal asylum laws.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 are lodged in the two centers for asylum seekers
in the Guben area, low-slung prefabricated homes surrounded by
barbed-wire fences. The rooms are adorned with pinups, televisions
blare constantly, and the air is heavy with the pall of boredom,
stale food and unwashed clothes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a peculiarly German labyrinth, formed by an uneasy
combination of a still-liberal attitude toward asylum seekers
rooted in memories of what political persecution can mean and a
growing bureaucratic wariness driven by the pressure of foreigners
on an ailing economy. Guendoul walked into it, never to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a son to me,'' said David Nicette, the director of
the center where Guendoul (who used the name Oman Ben Noui in
Germany) lived. ``He learned German in 18 months. He was one of the
most studious people here, and he wanted to go to college to do a
technical course. But he was stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Guendoul was rejected for asylum last year.
What can be a very long period of limbo began. Appeals are
permitted, but they can take years. Pending judgment, the foreigner
is not allowed to work or to attend a university, or indeed do
anything but wait.
</P>
<P>
   Guendoul waited. He was by no means alone. At the center, there
are children who were born there and who are already in school.
Some asylum seekers have been here more than seven years. Everyone
receives food, lodging, free medical care, about 400 marks a month
($220) in cash and coupons valid in local stores, and 500 marks a
year ($280) for clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere gets very bad,'' said Nicette, who came to
Germany 12 years ago from the Seychelles. ``The foreigners here are
bored and angry. Many drift into crime. And those in the town think
the asylum seekers just want to live off German welfare. When
foreigners go to doctors, they sometimes get screamed at.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nicette said, he was putting gasoline in his car at a
gas station when a skinhead came up to him, grabbed the hose,
hurled it to the ground and shouted ``Auslaender raus!'' Two police
officers were watching. They did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of committed neo-Nazis, the kind who drove
Guendoul to his death, appears to be small, racism seems
deep-rooted in towns like Guben.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern part of Germany was an essentially closed society
for 44 years _ from 1945 to the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was
under one form or another of dictatorship for 56 years _ from
Hitler's rise to power in 1933 until 1989. Anger at disorienting,
and generally disappointing, change has embittered minds that were
long closed and essentially nationalistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, the East German Communists thought of themselves as
the best Communists,'' said Barbara John, Berlin's commissioner for
foreigners. ``There was a strong thread of nationalism. And there
was no openness to foreigners because there were hardly any. All
this, with the steep economic decline that has followed, creates a
dangerous brew.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkhard Schroeder, the author of several books about neo-Nazis,
said that young people looking for a ``third way'' in the eastern
part of the country were drawn to the old Hitlerian mixture of
nationalism and socialism. ``Opposition against capitalism tends to
have a brown color for many young people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brahine Bensaci, another Algerian asylum seeker, was a friend of
Guendoul. They went out together the night of his death. Bensaci
saw an argument in the Dance Club between the neo-Nazis and a group
of Vietnamese men. ``I was frightened,'' he said, ``and I saved my
life by leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Guendoul stayed until about 4:30 in the morning. He left with
another Algerian named Khaled and a young man from Sierre Leone
called Isaaka, both of whom have since been moved out of Guben.
Soon after the three young men left the club, the neo-Nazis started
pursuing them in cars.
</P>
<P>
   As they tried to escape by plunging in terror through the glass
door to an apartment building, Guendoul cut himself. It took 15
minutes for the police to arrive, witnesses said, and 12 more for a
doctor to come. By then, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things the police did was to arrest the young
African, Isaaka, holding him in handcuffs for eight hours before
conceding their mistake. Two days later, the swastikas _ now
painted over _ appeared next to the door. They amounted to a
predictable signature on a crime foretold.

Several thousand Israelis in a series of competing, and
semi-secret, political airlifts are expected to come from America
and Europe to cast their ballots in elections this spring. The
influx is apparently a result of three traits that mark the Israeli
character, a dedication to politics, a penchant for traveling and
living outside their country and, finally, a system that does not
allow voting by absentee ballots. As a result, not only are
individual Israelis headed back, but the country's national
airlines is offering election discounts and, reportedly, several
competing groups are looking to charter flights for voters leaning
their way. ``It will be kind of a race between efforts,'' said
Israeli political analyst Daniel Elazar, of the Jerusalem Center

`CHARLOTTE GRAY': LOVE AND SECRETS IN WARTIME FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his new novel, ``Charlotte Gray,'' the hugely talented
British writer Sebastian Faulks continues his exploration of the
mingled themes of love and war. This book is set in wartime England
and France and involves a star-crossed pair of lovers caught up in
the tangled politics, treacheries and heroics of clandestine
actions against the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   So many subjects, so many disparate fates, so much good and evil
is explored here (there is even a subplot involving a sort of
recovered-memory syndrome) that ``Charlotte Gray'' sometimes
threatens to explode into its constituent genres. But there is no
shortage of dramatic tension, excitement or persuasive period
detail, and Faulks, whose last book was the highly praised
``Birdsong,'' certainly does know how to write.
</P>
<P>
   The main character is the eponymous Charlotte Gray, whom we
first encounter on a train from her ancestral Scottish home to
London, where she wants ``to do something to help'' _ namely, work
for a plastic surgeon trying to patch up the British soldiers and
pilots wounded in the first months of World War II. In her train
compartment, Charlotte meets two men who work for some secret
government department. Telephone numbers are exchanged. Once in
London, Charlotte settles into a flat with two partygoing
roommates. She meets a dashing British flier named Peter Gregory,
quits her boring job with the plastic surgeon and calls one of the
men from the train. She is recruited as an agent for G section,
which specializes in helping the nascent French Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, who is a wonderfully intelligent, reflective
creation, falls for Gregory, the pilot. ``Once her feelings for
Peter Gregory had crystallized, she found it hard to picture
herself in a previous epoch, while the days of transition
themselves seemed lacking in self-awareness, almost comically
confused. She loved him. How could she once not have loved him?''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory is then lost when his plane crashes in France. Charlotte
is sent to France on a separate mission (her fluent French
qualifies her for this task), one that is supposed to take 10 days
or so, followed by a pickup by a small plane and a return to
England. But she knows even before she parachutes into the French
countryside _ inside the collaborationist non-occupied half of the
country, ruled over by Marshal Philippe Petain _ that she is going
to stay there and look for Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   She does, and here, still in its early stages, is where Faulk's
novel begins to spread in many different directions. What starts
out as a wartime romantic adventure, Charlotte's perilous search
for her lover, broadens into a portrait of occupied France, with
the themes of collaboration, anti-Semitism, character and tragedy
splashed onto Faulk's vivid canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elements are what might emerge as the stock figures in
a wartime melodrama, except that Faulk invests them all with a
memorable individuality. Two Jewish boys, ages 7 and 4, are being
harbored by villagers after the deportation of their parents. A
member of the Resistance named Julien (code name: Octave) works to
protect the children and, more generally, to preserve something
good in collaborationist France by making provisions for an
eventual uprising.
</P>
<P>
   One of Faulk's more biting figures is an unctuous schoolteacher,
Claude Benech, who is easily persuaded by Petainist propaganda and
joins the pro-Nazi French militia. Another collaborationist is Paul
Pichon, dispatched from Paris by something called the Inquiry and
Control Section, which enthusiastically seeks to fulfill Jewish
deportation quotas approved by the collaborationist government.
</P>
<P>
   Another memorable character is Levade, Julien's father and a
painter of some note who lives hermitlike in an abandoned castle.
He is a Jew turned Catholic, a wounded veteran of World War I and a
kind of ruefully perceptive, acidly disillusioned witness to the
accumulated inhumanities of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But holding the entire, sometimes unwieldy construction together
is Charlotte, whose keen moral sense gives her a sort of layered
awareness. She is worthy of the attention we devote to her in
Faulk's nearly 400 pages, even when his plot slips over the line of
plausibility. Like his other chief characters, both exemplary and
villainous, Charlotte carries her private concerns into her role as
a historic actor. Benech, for example, is a loser, an unhappy,
penny-pinching bachelor. ``The austerity of the new regime brought
out something doughty in him: he was a man of destiny whose fated
hour had come.''
</P>
<P>
   Buried in Charlotte's past is a mysterious family secret,
something to do with her father, whose nightmarish experience of
World War I led him to impose his own psychic burdens on others.
The lesson seems to be that the personal is indeed the political,
or, put differently, that later generations are never free of the
traumas suffered by earlier ones. Charlotte's relationship with
Levade, her love for her Royal Air Force pilot, her determination
to do good, which is less a matter of courage than of inner
necessity, are all related to the unassimilated and yet nameless
wound inflicted by her father.
</P>
<P>
   Do we really want to know this, even about admirable Charlotte?
There is something gratuitous about this psychological history.
``Charlotte Gray'' essentially belongs to the genre of the war
adventure, and it does not have quite the vascular strength to deal
with all the meaning Faulks pumps into it. It is a love story and a
spy story and a story about historical injury as well as a story
about the Holocaust, the politics of Vichy and the particulars of
the infamous camp at Drancy, where French Jews, including children,
were assembled before being deported to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk is a prodigiously talented writer whose literary ambitions
exceed what would seem to be the natural limits of the intrigue he
lays out. Yet thanks to the complex, enchanting vehicle of
Charlotte and Faulk's grasp of political and moral history, he
manages to make it work.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains and gusty winds will pound the Pacific Northwest
Coast again Wednesday as another in a series of storms moves
ashore. Rainfall amounts of over 2 inches are likely in some areas
while heavy snows bury the Cascade Mountains. The additional
snowfall will exacerbate the already high avalanche threat. Only
scattered showers are expected in eastern Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, tranquil weather will cover the Southwest and
western Plains as high pressure aloft supports sinking air and
abundant sunshine. The sunshine will contribute to unseasonable
warmth from western Kansas to the Southwest deserts.
</P>
<P>
   A band of light to moderate snow will spread into the Upper
Mississippi Valley as low pressure dives southeastward. One to 3
inches of snow will fall from northern Illinois to the upper
Peninsula of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, high pressure will dominate the southern states,
promoting ample sunshine and seasonal afternoon temperatures from
Florida to Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy wet snow and rain will fall over the central Carolinas
and Virginia as a storm system begins to develop over the warm Gulf
Stream waters. The storm will move toward the northeast Wednesday
afternoon, bringing the chance of snow to Long Island and Cape Cod
late Wednesday and Thursday night. The heaviest precipitation,
however, is expected to remain over the open waters of the
Atlantic, as upper level steering winds act to move the storm
offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the interior Northeast will be partly to mostly sunny
and chilly as high pressure moves overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Mounting Snow
</P>
<P>
   The vast, thick ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are the
largest of earth's land glaciers, covering over 50,000 square
kilometers. Mountain glaciers are much smaller, but they are not
restricted to polar latitudes. The Cascade Mountains in Washington
and Oregon, for example, house glaciers, largely due to a spate of
winter snowfall and the favorable chill of high elevation. This
month, snow has been falling at prodigious rates in the Cascades,
with nearly 20 feet of snow since February 1 at Mt. Baker in
Oregon. Snow will continue to mount Wednesday as another Pacific
storm comes ashore.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York Gov. George Pataki and Rep. Sherwood
Boehlert, R-N.Y., announced Tuesday $5.2 million in federal grants
to help protect the state's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 individual grants range in size from $600,000 for a
program to manage the use of phosphorous that spills into the water
supply in Delaware County to $15,000 for a watershed education
effort in the Town of Somers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These grants will help watershed communities and New York City
pay for much-needed sewage improvements, help communities develop
long-term water quality protection programs and protect the
viability of farms in the watershed while reducing pollution
runoff,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki was in Washington for a four-day National Governors'
Association conference.
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert, who obtained the funds through the Federal Water
Resources Development Act, said the money would allow New Yorkers
``to meet the challenges of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert is the chairman of the House water resources and
environment subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's strong leadership and my position in Congress
have made a powerful team for securing funds for the towns and
villages that dot the watershed,'' Boehlert added.
</P>
<P>
   The 8 million residents of New York City and 1 million upstate
New Yorkers receive their drinking water from an area stretching
over eight counties in the Catskill Mountains and along the Hudson
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   These counties are considered the New York City watershed, which
includes 60 towns and 11 villages.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are aimed at fulfilling an agreement struck in 1995
among New York state and federal officials requiring communities in
the watershed to protect the water supply from sewage discharges
and pollution runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Following are the federal grants announced for the New York
projects.

NARAS CHIEF WORKS FOR THE GRAMMY GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: ``Tonight'' refers to Wednesday, Feb. 24).  
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Michael Greene is as familiar and sought-after a
figure in the music industry as the small but mighty statuette he
represents _ the Grammy Award.
</P>
<P>
   As president and CEO of the National Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences (NARAS) _ the professional association for musicians,
songwriters, record producers, engineers, and other creative and
technical music industry personnel _ Greene oversees the entire
Grammy awards process, as well as heading the academy's charitable
arms, MusiCares and the NARAS Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Greene deals with everything from public school music programs
to reaching out to artists using drugs to booking acts for the
annual Grammy telecast, which takes place tonight at the Shrine
Auditorium &UR;  &LR; in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He also sometimes gets caught in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a nightmare, period,'' he says. ``I mean,
between all the bad press the academy got and Soy Bomb and Ol'
Dirty Bastard rushing the stage during the show, it was a bizarre
year.''
</P>
<P>
   With 925 nominees and just 14 performance slots on the
three-hour program, Greene must say ``no'' more often than he'd
probably like. Tonight's 41st annual Grammy ceremony, hosted by
Rosie O'Donnell, includes a music in film segment; a B.B. King/Eric
Clapton number; a tribute to Duke Ellington featuring Wynton
Marsalis, Herbie Hancock and Natalie Cole; and a performance by
Luciano Pavorotti.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the prestigious best record and best album slots are
dominated by female nominees Lauryn Hill (the first woman to lead
the awards, with 10 nominations), Celine Dion, Madonna, Brandy,
Monica, Sheryl Crow and Shania Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Son of a big-band leader, Greene is ideally suited to his job.
He began his career first as a recording artist and producer and
was president of recording studios, a music publisher, CEO of one
of the nation's first cable TV advertising companies, president of
one of the world's first cable video music channels, general
manager of a major market UHF television station, founder of the
first nationally distributed video music channel launched on direct
broadcast TV. And prior to becoming the first full-time president
and CEO of NARAS in 1988, he headed one of the industry's largest
post-production houses.
</P>
<P>
   It was while earning his BA degree in business that the
Atlanta-bred Greene entered the industry as an artist for Warner
Bros.' Bizarre/Straight label, later recording for GRC and Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's still a touch of Granny in the Grammys, Greene
has made some significant progress since the '80s. Among other
things, after years of hearing that the awards have little to do
with current music trends, the academy developed committees and
secret review panels to determine nominees in important categories.
</P>
<P>
   We met with the affable record academy chief for a wide-ranging
interview in his comfortable office suite at NARAS headquarters in
Santa Monica. Greene, in the midst of fielding urgent calls from
entertainment titans, was having a self-described ``Pavorotti
moment'' as he negotiated with the superstar's agents for a
performance slot on tonight's telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year's awards suffered through some bad press over the
distribution of funds from the academy's charities, unexpected
guests on stage and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Greene: There's always 10 or 12 journalists gunning for me each
year. When you look at the educational and charitable stuff we do,
the fact that I get up on stage and lambaste Newt Gingrich and go
after the secretary of education and use our podium as an advocacy
platform for music people, I make a lot of people angry.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the 925 nominees all have record companies, and record
company executives are not used to hearing the word ``no'' from
people. It gets very nasty. So when you have a journalist who calls
up any of them and offers anonymity to roast Mike Greene, it
becomes `I'll show him. I'll get him back.' When I'm the focus,
it's bad. It takes the focus off musicians and people that should
be getting the attention. In the end, the board extended my
contract and gave me a raise.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was going through your mind last year when Soy Bomb (an
extra on the show who removed his shirt to reveal the words ``soy
bomb'' written on his bare chest) joined Bob Dylan on stage?
</P>
<P>
   Greene: He got through as one of Dylan's dance troupe. It wasn't
like he came from the side or the front. It seemed like part of the
act at first. My fear in these situations is someone's going to
harm the performer. This year, we're doing a different kind of
screening of the extras. But we don't want the show to feel like a
lockdown. Rosie O'Donnell said during our first production meeting,
`What's going to be our Soy Bomb moment this year?' If there wasn't
a danger element, I woulQ't be worried about it, but we're taking
additional precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can we expect tonight?
</P>
<P>
   Greene: Madonna's opening the show on a beautiful set with
30-foot screens and a Japanese bridge where she'll be revealed in
this gorgeous red dress _ and dancers that look like rocks in
geisha outfits. Plus, we're using an orchestra a lot this year with
Aerosmith, Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion, Alanis Morissette,
Pavorotti and the music in film segment with James Horner and John
Williams. We're also giving the Latin-pop award on the air, which
we haven't done in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Rosie's a first-time Grammy host. How was she chosen and what
do you look for?
</P>
<P>
   Greene: One of the first things I did when I became chairman in
the late '80s was convince people to move away from music artists
as hosts. This has been a tradition we're very happy with. When we
looked at Rosie, we felt there was a good possibility of doing some
cross-promotion between her show and our show for the month prior
to the ceremony. When we first approached Rosie, we got a no. About
a week after that, I was at an event with her and walked over to
her, got down next to her chair, and for two minutes I just went
with all the reasons why she should do it. I said, ``I don't want a
yes or a no, I'm going to go back and eat my dinner. Call me.'' So,
they go to thinking about it, and she called and said, ``Yeah, I
want to do it.'' And it has worked out great because she's a music
fan, and the public recognizes that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Grammys often get taken to task for gaffes such as Jethro
Tull winning the 1988 hard rock/metal category. How do these things
happen?
</P>
<P>
   Greene: Over some pretty strong objections, that category was
added before we had a voting constituency. It was one of those
I-told-you-so things. Since then, dance is the best example. There
were good reasons to add a dance category earlier than we did, but
until we had the voting constituency in place, we would've had
people voting by name recognition _ Janet Jackson would've won
every time. Now, the only product currently eligible are recordings
created specifically for the dance market. And I think the winners
in that category have been good ones.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of political pressure is the academy under from the
cities of Los Angeles and New York in terms of where the show will
take place each year?
</P>
<P>
   Greene: They both want it, but they're both civil about it. New
York and Los Angeles both have about the same number of academy
members. The real pressure is regarding performances on the show.
It's brutal. During the first years I was here, the Grammy Awards
wasn't a big deal, and we begged to get people on. Now, we beg for
people not to threaten us when we say no.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the new Staples Center downtown look to the academy?
</P>
<P>
   Greene: I firmly believe this will be the last year we're in a
small venue (like the 6,000-seat Shrine). From now on, we'll either
be at Staples or Madison Square Garden. One of the smart things
Staples did was bring us down there and actually move steel in the
plans for us. As a result, we have a very Grammy-friendly venue
because we participated to a degree in the architectural
renderings. Next year, it'll either be at Staples or the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your annual address normally touches on the year's important
issues. What will you deal with this year?
</P>
<P>
   Greene: I'd like to mention some of the new research on the
connection between music and the mind. But I'll probably skate
through a little education stuff and welcome everybody and then go
straight to the life achievement awards. I generally like to let
sleeping dogs lie in terms of the endowments and the arts
environment in education, which seems a little friendlier this
year, so you won't have to suffer too long with me this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a onetime touring musician yourself, how do you feel when
you see how maligned musicality and musical prowess is in some
quarters of the industry?
</P>
<P>
   Greene: I'm afraid we have to remind people there are some great
musicians and singers, and it's OK to sing in tune, and it's OK to
have memorable melodies. There's a whole sludge field of commercial
radio that doesn't care at all about great music, niche music or
indigenous music. There's some great rock music going on. It's not
just Korn and Metallica. We have a responsibility to fight for
musicality. And it is a fight in the light of radio and the fact
that the current voice of rebellion for kids is pretty limited in
terms of musical content.

 &HT;    TURKEY AGAINST THE WORLD: COUNTRY FEELS ON TRIAL AS KURD LEADER
FACES POSSIBLE DEATH PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey A soft-spoken and kindly school teacher, Aylin
Atligan becomes downright frightening when the subject is Abdullah
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Turks, she regards the jailed Kurdish leader as a
ruthless terrorist who deserves the pain his militant Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) dished out for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in the death penalty, but I will not feel
sorry in this case. To hell with what the rest of the world says.
We need to hang this man as soon as possible,'' said Atligan, 27,
as she shopped for groceries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Turks were joyous last week at the capture of Ocalan, they
find themselves this week increasingly defensive against what they
regard as a growing international chorus attempting to tell them
how to try and sentence their Public Enemy No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit called outside criticism ``an
unacceptable affront to Turkish justice.''
</P>
<P>
   From Turkey's top leaders to the people on the streets, the
sentiment reflects the rigid emotional and political battle line
drawn long ago over the country's Kurdish minority and their goal
of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan was formally arrested Tuesday on charges of treason in
his first appearance before a judge since he was captured last week
in Kenya. Hated by the Turks but a hero to the minority Kurds,
Ocalan could hang if found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no simple case of crime and punishment. The case
contains deep undercurrents of Turkish pride and resentment at
Europe's role in protecting the rights of what the Turks view as a
terrorist movement. After a wave of violent Kurdish protests swept
Europe last week, the whole world in watching the Ocalan trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a normal trial, it's a global event,'' said
Huseyin Bagci, a political scientist at Middle East Technical
University in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights groups and some European governments
have raised concerns about where Ocalan will receive fair
treatment. He has been detained for a week without the ability to
consult with a lawyer, legal under Turkish law, and he will be
tried before a security court, which combines civilian and military
judges, which critics argue cannot render an independent decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's hearing Tuesday took place on the prison island of
Imrali, in the sea of Mamara, and was closed to the media and the
public. How and when Ocalan's trial will proceed has not been
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders have vowed to give Ocalan a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   But weighing heavily, too, is a thirst for revenge against a man
whose guerrilla army is considered responsible for more than 30,000
civilian and military deaths in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey has two options and it is a Hobson's choice: Apply the
death penalty after a quick trial before a security court _ this
would satisfy the desire of the Turkish people's emotions. Or, hold
a fair trial that would satisfy world opinion,'' said Sedat
Aslantas, a lawyer for Turkey's independent Human Rights
Association, a group which is representing Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   While a Turkish lawyer from the group was assigned to Ocalan's
case, he was not allowed to travel to the island for the hearing.
In another sign of deep Turkish public sentiment, protesters
surrounded his car shouting: ``Shame on you!''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights officials in Turkey were frustrated in their
efforts to learn details of the secretive hearing on the island 35
miles southwest of Istanbul. Naval boats have been deployed around
Imrali and military helicopters patrol overhead. Outsiders have
been barred from the nearest coastal town on the Turkish mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Gun Kut, a political analyst at Bosphorus University, said he
believes human rights groups and others are unfairly prejudging
Turkey regarding Ocalan's upcoming trial. He believes authorities
will hold an open trial and perhaps even televise it to demonstrate
to the Turkish public and the world the strong case against Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes that parliament, which must approve the
execution of a death sentence and hasn't done so in over a decade,
will not vote for it in the case of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically it won't be advisable and everybody knows that,''
he said. ``Why create a hero? Why create a martyr out of somebody
who the entire Turkish public has already branded as a treacherous
murderer?''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish security courts had already opened several cases against
Ocalan in absentia before his arrest last week. The cases have
proceeded but cannot conclude without his presence. Officials have
said the cases may be combined into one trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan was a brutal and effective guerrilla leader seeking
self-rule for his stateless people. Many Kurds did not endorse his
harsh tactics. Still, he has come to represent their struggle
against Turkey's equally hard treatment of its Kurdish minority of
12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kurds do not share the same minority rights as ethnic Greeks and
Armenians living in Turkey. It is illegal to broadcast or to teach
the Kurdish language. The southeastern mountains, where most of
Turkey's Kurds reside, is governed under authoritative civil
restrictions akin to martial law.
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Greece have asked the European Union to insure a fair
trial for Ocalan, one that would avoid the death penalty he faces
under Turkish law. They would make such procedures a condition for
eventual Turkish membership in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish issue has, in part, prevented Turkey from being
considered for membership in the European Union. In a review last
November of Turkey's application for membership, the European
Commission cited ``persistent violations of human rights and
important deficiencies in the treatment of minorities,'' including
the Kurds.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
AMERICAN MASTERS: HERE I STAND 
Directed by: St. Clair Bourne 
Produced by: Chiz Schultz 
Time: PBS, Wednesday 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Paul Robeson died in Philadelphia on Jan. 23, 1976, the
legendary actor, singer, and political activist was hardly
remembered in his own country. Here was an All-American football
player who graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Rutgers University in 1918
and, with honors, from Columbia Law School five years later. He
starred in plays, including Eugene O'Neill's ``The Emperor Jones''
and Jerome Kern's ``Show Boat.'' In 1930, he traveled to London,
where he became the first black man to star in a major production
of ``Othello.'' He entertained the Loyalist troops during the
Spanish Civil War and spent time in the Soviet Union, where he was
lauded as one of the great artists of the 20th century. Yet, when
he died, there were no parades. He just passed on. In some cases,
the obituary of one of the most talented, intelligent, tough
Americans who ever lived was merely a postscript.
</P>
<P>
   This two-hour ``American Masters'' special, ``Here I Stand,''
helps restore the reputation of one of the greatest Renaissance men
in American history. For many Americans, both black and white,
Robeson was simply a Communist _ a traitor to his country and a
Soviet sympathizer who was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize. But Paul
Robeson was never simply anything. He was a complicated man with
complex ideas about everything. And this nonfiction account goes a
long way toward exploring a life that never collapsed under the
awesome weight of racial and political stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   Through vintage footage and interviews conducted with many of
his associates _ including Harry Belafonte, Uta Hagen, Ossie Davis,
and Paul Robeson, Jr. _ Robeson emerges as a man who never betrayed
what his eyes saw and his ears heard and his mind thought. He knew
that his ideas of equality and justice for African-Americans would
be met with hostility and violence yet he never wavered. Even when
he was denied access to concert halls and his passport revoked by
the State Department, he fought back. Even when the media ignored
him and he was unable to make a living as an entertainer, he didn't
cave in. He was that rarest of human beings, a man of principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased with the way it turned out,'' said Paul
Robeson Jr., referring to the ``American Masters'' special from his
home in Brooklyn. Robeson Jr., who contributed material from his
archives to the program, said that some of the footage, especially
the film and recordings the producers received from the Russians
just a few weeks before air time, has never been seen on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really appreciate about the show is that you really get
a sense of my father's evolution through the epochal changes in the
country,'' he said. ``He was an established worldwide star and the
first American actor of that stature to be so political. What also
made him special is that he challenged the system a full two
decades before the civil rights movement started. Then it was truly
radical. This show places him in historical context.''

WHITE HOUSE SUMMIT SHOWS LINGERING STRAINS FROM IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton huddled Tuesday with
congressional leaders from both parties for the first White House
legislative summit in 19 months, with officials vowing
post-impeachment cooperation to rescue Social Security, cut taxes
and bolster public education.
</P>
<P>
   But partisan maneuvering lurked in the wings as Clinton and
Republican congressional leaders met face-to-face for the first
time since the House impeached the president on Dec. 19 and the
Senate acquitted him of perjury and obstruction of justice charges
on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long struggle over Clinton's sexual dalliance with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky never came up during an
Oval Office meeting that lasted more than an hour, according to
White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the congressional leaders vowed to work together in
the months ahead. Vice President Al Gore also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all took and oath and I think we intend to follow it,''
Clinton said during a photo session at the outset. ``We owe it to
the American people and I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., set the tone for the meeting with a
full-page advertisement in some of the nation's newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to move on and focus our attention on an
agenda that strengthens the nation,'' the two Republicans said in
an open letter to Americans. ``In the coming months, we look
forward to working with the president, our colleagues in the House
and Senate, and you on these and other issues important to securing
a brighter future for you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet strains lingered from the impeachment struggle. Lott and
Hastert, emerging from the White House summit, refused to express
trust in the president's leadership in the aftermath of the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert voted to impeach Clinton in the House; Lott voted to
convict and remove Clinton from office in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I trust _ I trust the ability of the
people, here in the Congress, in the government to work together to
do what we need to do for the people,'' Lott said. ``That's where
the real trust should be _ the trust in us doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, referring to the question of trust, said: ``We are
starting to work to put together ideas, and that's the first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans also showed signs of trying to
position their parties for the 2000 presidential election. Clinton,
Lott and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., outlined
separate litmus tests for future cooperation that raised questions
about whether compromise or confrontation lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Republicans that he will not compromise his State
of the Union proposals to reserve 62 percent of the projected $4.4
trillion budget surplus over the next 15 years to help keep Social
Security solvent and 15 percent of the surplus to protect Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Lott set his own criteria for bipartisanship, telling reporters
that Clinton must lean on Democratic members of the stymied
17-member bipartisan commission on Medicare to shake loose a
compromise rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to get some of his people to participate (in a
deal),'' Lott declared. ``It's very important and this week is
critical and I urge the president to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, leading the House Democrats' efforts to retake control
of the House in 2000, challenged the Republican House speaker to
quickly schedule votes on cherished Democratic priorities _
Clinton's proposal to strengthen patients' rights to sue health
maintenance organizations, Democrats' proposed increase in the
minimum wage and bipartisan legislation to overhaul federal
campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that can happen,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials emphasized that it was too early for real deal-making
on the budget. Congress has until the end of September to consider
the president's fiscal 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certain that down the road, as we get into more specific
issues, we'll be looking at ways we can find common ground,''
Lockhart said. ``I think you're slightly ahead of yourself by
expecting this to be a horse-trading meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said the meeting alone was ``a sign of trust''
developing between political rivals. Republicans ``want to work
with'' Clinton, Gephardt said, adding: ``They realize that if
they're to get the people's business done, they have to work with
the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Lockhart and Gephardt emphasized Clinton's warning to
GOP congressional leaders that the White House will not bargain
away a proposal to extend the solvency of Social Security and
Medicare _ two middle-class entitlement programs imperiled by the
impending retirement in 2011 of the first of 77 million post-World
War II baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Congress will ``have to work through some of
the details,'' but Republican endorsement of the approach remains
``a threshold issue,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt called Clinton's plan ``a threshold decision that we
all have to make'' before considering GOP priorities such as tax
cuts, ending the tax code's penalty on married couples filing joint
tax returns and GOP initiatives on public and private education.
</P>
<P>
   With the Medicare commission facing a March 1 deadline for
delivering recommendations to Congress, the White House did not
rule out that Clinton might intervene as Lott insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's spokesman added: ``We think that it's
important to allow the commission to do its work, report out what
their ideas are, and then we'll take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials agreed on potential benefits from the first
bipartisan White House legislative summit since July 1997 _ six
months before the Lewinsky scandal became public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton found the gathering ``very constructive,'' Lockhart
said. ``There was a good atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said officials will ``work together, hopefully across the
party lines in the Congress and with the administration, to do what
the American people expect of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the leaders
ought to get together more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do it in the way we did it this morning is productive, it's
constructive, and hopefully, it will lead to some real action on a
number of these fronts,'' Daschle said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Standing on a sidewalk amid a small mountain of
suitcases and gifts, Wu Liuyi mentally girded herself to board the
rickety unheated bus that two and a half days later would deliver
her to her house and pre-teen daughter near the southeastern city
of Wenzhou.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, two tiers of reclining seats were already crammed with
the blankets, coats and food of three dozen other migrants heading
home for Chinese New Year this month. The cramped, dark interior
resembled a communal space capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wu, who owns a small leather workshop in Beijing, seemed ill
suited to the journey in her blue blazer and black heels. But ever
since she and her husband left their farming village for factory
work in Beijing in 1992, this daunting pilgrimage from the place
they live to a distant ``home'' has become a family routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do?'' she said, herding her 7-year-old son to the
bus. ``I have to see my daughter, and I'm taking my son home to
start school this year.''
</P>
<P>
   China is on the move these days, with an estimated 10 percent of
the population now migrating from their official place of
residence, mostly in search of better jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of young Chinese are moving one step up the job chain _
those from tiny villages move to small cities to find work, and
those from small provincial cities move to large cities.
</P>
<P>
   But rural migrants like Ms. Wu remain perpetual outsiders in
China's cities, with little hope of securing the coveted urban
residence permits that would allow them to build an entirely legal
life here.
</P>
<P>
   Registered at birth as residents of rural towns, they remain off
the books in a city like Beijing, ineligible for most good jobs and
housing subsidies, paying a steep price to enroll children in the
few public schools that might admit them, unable even to register a
car or bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   And so every Chinese New Year, most of these estimated 100
million migrants return to their hometowns, producing what Chinese
demographers call the largest seasonal migration in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Significant numbers of Chinese have been leaving their villages
in search of work only since the end of 1984, when the government
eased its rigid system of residency permits, allowing people to
travel for temporary jobs. The trend has snowballed in recent years
for a variety of reasons, including improvements in transportation
and communications, the emergence of privately owned factories and
a growing surplus of rural labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``After many years, reform and openness, fortune-seeking, has
become possible,'' wrote Xie Jinyu, a demographer at Nankai
University who has studied the migrants.
</P>
<P>
   For most rural migrants, the goal is simply to earn money to
take home, in part because they retain strong emotional ties to
their villages and in part because it is nearly impossible to get
an urban residence permit anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rural migrants have become a fixture in China's
cities: ragged men clutching hammers around construction sites and
women selling snacks at street stands. They have provided a vast
new pool of cheap labor that has allowed urban factories to
prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence is transforming urban life, mixing together
China's distinct regional cultures, but also giving rise to a new
rootless urban underclass.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the week Ms. Wu prepared to travel to Wenzhou, in
Zhejiang Province, that city's gleaming new train station was
filled with a ragtag collection of rural migrants who were
themselves heading back to their hometowns for the New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly men from distant dirt-poor villages, they had come to the
small but prosperous coastal city in search of factory or
construction jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make money farming, and it's very hard to find work
in my hometown, so I came here,'' said Zong Jiaohua, 27, who worked
at construction sites in Wenzhou for the last year. Zong, from the
poor inland province of Jiangxi, said he had previously worked in
Jilin Province in the far northeast, and before that in Hainan, the
island province in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But he had little money for all his efforts and said he was not
sure where to go next. ``I had planned to get married when I went
home this time,'' Zong said. ``But without a real job that's not
very realistic, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Zheng Lin, 23, from Shanxi Province in northern China, said he
had spent the last year doing piecework in a shoe factory in
Wenzhou. He said the money was good but the work tenuous and
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can earn $250 a month if you're fast,'' said
Zheng, who was killing time until his midnight train playing cards
on the old duffel bag that held all his earthly possessions. ``But
if the factory has no orders, you may have nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these migrants are between 18 and 35 with junior high
school educations, and they tend to work in unskilled low-wage jobs
in the private sector. Their movements have helped fuel China's
economic growth in recent years, as businesses and unskilled
laborers have become increasingly willing and able to follow the
market's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes have made it much easier for us to hire people
from across the country, and that has allowed us to expand our
business,'' said Joseph Chen, the urbane owner of a button factory
in Qiaotou on the outskirts of Wenzhou. ``It has also made it far
easier for us to develop contacts with customers, to have official
sales representatives elsewhere. The old system didn't work very
well for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Job agencies have sprung up to channel the labor across this
vast nation, but word of mouth often guides the flow. Xu Bin, 32,
who works in a badge factory in Wenzhou, said he had gotten his job
through an employment agency in Boyang, his hometown in Jiangxi
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, a few people from my town came and now a lot
more have followed,'' he said. ``Everyone at home knows that this
area has developed quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Luo Lichun, 23, who was tending vats of dye at another button
factory in Qiaotou, said she would be unemployed in her poor
farming town in Sichuan. ``A friend came home and told me there was
good work here, so I came,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But life is not easy for these migrants, even those with good
jobs, who often live at the fringes of the local society. Their
lack of an official urban residence permit constitutes a major
disadvantage in cities like Beijing, where housing, education and
other social benefits are still mostly state-controlled. The
government allows relatively few Chinese to change their official
residence each year, and most of these are well-educated people
moving for government jobs or marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In the cities, the migrants often do piece work in small
factories, working more than 12 hours a day. They live together, in
the backs of workshops, in small private apartments or spare dorms.
One study of a migrant community in Beijing estimated the average
living space at less than 2 1/2 square yards per person.
</P>
<P>
   On the grounds of a former state tire factory on Beijing's south
side, low barracks-style buildings now house hundreds of small,
unheated, one-room clothing workshops, each with a tangle of sewing
machines and cutting tables in front and a jumble of beds in back.
All are owned and staffed by migrants, mostly from around Wenzhou.
</P>
<P>
   In workshop No. C1027 recently, a half-dozen migrant workers
were toiling over fur-trimmed leather coats, while a few others
took breaks in the ``living area'' _ four bunk beds somehow crammed
in a corner behind a curtain made of old blankets. A row of
chickens and pig trotters hanging from the rafters and a
coal-burning stove on a back stoop completed the accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Many migrants said that living conditions were far better at
home. But what they were looking for was something else: money, job
experience, a bit of adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work seven days a week,'' said Li Fenglian, 21, from
Sichuan, as she prepared to venture out from C1027 into the streets
of Beijing. ``But I came because it was a new opportunity to see
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities like Beijing have had to cope with the massive influx of
generally poor rural immigrants and the social troubles their
presence has supposedly spawned: rising crime rates, beggars on the
street and an explosion of sexually transmitted diseases. The
migrants do not qualify for most local government social
assistance, though some private groups have taken up their cause.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of growing urban unemployment, the Beijing municipal
government last year announced that it would forbid rural migrants
from taking certain types of jobs in the hopes of encouraging some
of the estimated 3 million unofficial migrants to go home; the
city's official population is 12 million. The government has
occasionally bulldozed the unofficial neighborhoods where migrants
from a particular province or ethnic minority have clustered and
opened businesses. But the effect is short lived.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Beijing tried repeatedly to expel the
residents of ``Zhejiang Village,'' a chaotic jumble of sweatshops
and stalls in south Beijing, where most migrants from the Wenzhou
area, including Ms. Wu, live. But each time, within months, the
small leather workshops, the day care centers and the pungent
street markets selling the dried shrimp, yellow wine and other
delicacies popular in Wenzhou popped back up again.
</P>
<P>
   And today, the government has seemingly made a bit of peace with
this city-within-the-city that has become home to a hundred
thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're figuring out ways to administer it rather than
suppress it,'' said Dai Jianzhong, a sociologist at the Beijing
Academy of Social Sciences. ``Through licenses and rent, the area
generates a lot of income for Beijing.''

&HT;        ECONOMIC EXERTS SAY 'A NATION OF INVESTORS' WILL DRIVE
POLICY.
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 -- The growing number of middle class stock
market investors are fast becoming a powerful force in government,
a panel of economic experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who invest are the invisible hand in American
politics,'' said economist Lawrence Kudlow. ``We have become a
nation of investors. Now that the impeachment trial is over, their
issues will crystalize in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Kudlow along with stock market executives, securities regulators
and lobbyists, discussed how a ``nation of stockholders'' was
changing politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of American families are invested in the market.
That's five times more investors than in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting taxes, privatizing Social Security, and creating a more
competitive health care system, are three issues where investors
are hoping to see progress, Kudlow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that rich people sold stock to a bunch of rich
people, said Patrick Campbell, who is chief operating officer of
the Nasdaq-Amex Market Group. ``But I've met the tow truck driver
who invests and reads Barron's.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties will find it crucial to consider the
interests of investors in the stock market, Kudlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors take a more modern approach these days -- frequently
using the Internet to research decisions. Kudlow said access to the
Internet and television financial news has led to a trend of ``day
trading,'' which is when someone buys and sells stock in the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   The middle class investor class is growing because many are
motivated by a desire to increase the wealth in their 401K and
other retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of optimism and faith in the market,'' Kudlow
said. ``The investment class wants to make sure government can help
them with their retirement goals. The investor class votes and has
made these issues bipartisan issues.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's antenna picked up on the investor class'
desire to see Social Security be somewhat privatized. Clinton wants
to invest a part of the federal budget surplus in the market to
fuel Social Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Kudlow said dealing with an on-line investment company takes
away the personal rapport between an investor and his broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My broker can say 'No,''' Kudlow said. ``But my computer
cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Feigin, executive director of the North American
Securities Administrators Association, warned against on-line
investment scams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were pulling a scam, and I didn't use the Internet, I
should be sued for fraud malpractice,'' Feigin said.

(With NY-CHILI-RECIPE)

 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jane and Michael Stern were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding great chili in New York is like finding great pastrami
in Des Moines,'' he said warningly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like barbecue in New York,'' she added. ``It's never very
good. We are constantly being shlepped around by people telling us
they've found great barbecue here, and it never is. What Michael
and I have based food searches on for the last 12,000 years is
eating regional food in its region. To me, the great Manhattan meal
is at Katz's or Ratners. We had blintzes there a few days ago, and
the sour cream was  &UR; fabulous &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Sterns have agreed to eat chili at three
different places to see if any can equal those included in their
latest book, ``Chili Nation'' (Broadway Books, 1998). Their
expectations were low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of any really good chili is that the flavor of the
chili pepper itself plays a significant role and that does not
necessarily mean hot,'' Stern said. ``New York City has a low chili
consciousness, even though New Yorkers like to think they know
everything about everything. We don't know why people here don't
think that much about chili. It's like asking why people in
Cleveland don't care that much about pastrami. They just don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sterns have arranged to visit two restaurants with a
southwestern theme, Tapika, and Cowgirl Hall of Fame, along with
one Mexican restaurant, El Parador Cafe, which makes chili con
carne for its staff, but will serve it to customers on request.
After decades of eating chili here, Stern said the only great place
was the long-defunct Alamo Chile House on West 44th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chili Nation'' is the Stern's 25th book. Their specialty _
both on and off the table _ is Americana, including their
best-selling ``Elvis World'' (Knopf, 1987) and two editions of
``Road Food'' (Knopf, 1986), their guide to ``America's best
diners, small-town cafes, BBQ joints and other special eateries
serving great inexpensive regional food,'' which has sold more than
250,000 copies. Coast to coast, they know where to find the
freshest lobster rolls, the fluffiest pancakes, the crispiest
catfish. They write monthly for Gourmet magazine and weekly for
Conde Nast's Epicurious Website.
</P>
<P>
   When Robert Gottlieb edited The New Yorker, they wrote articles
about rodeo, cafeterias, chili peppers and parrots, but after Tina
Brown took over, they never heard from the magazine again. ``We
didn't know any celebrities,'' Stern said laughing. ``We only wrote
about people like the woman who founded the Northeastern Rat and
Mouse Club in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Sterns make light of their accomplishments, it has
been their advocacy of regional cooking, tracking with an almost
anthropological zeal how a community's food reflects its way of
life, that has helped push it into the culinary mainstream over the
last 15 years. They still sense remnants of what Stern calls
``anti-American snobbery in the food world,'' and the couple pride
themselves on never having been to France. ``We like eating swanky
food, but for us the exploration of food is less about what's on
the plate and more about what it expresses of its culture,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember very well when we started in the early '70s, it was
us vs. them, and the enemy was Gourmet magazine,'' he continued.
``All that food snobbery with no respect for what ordinary people
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   It was James Beard, actually, who was one of the first in the
food establishment to appreciate what the Sterns were doing.
Stern's family, he said, was less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we published the first edition of `Road Food,' they took
a look and said, `You go out all around America and write a guide
to  &UR; treyf &LR; ?''' Stern said, using the Yiddish word for nonkosher.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know the half of it. This is a man who can debate
the finer points of a snout sandwich the way other people
deconstruct a cabernet.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, thankfully, the fare is more pedestrian. At Tapika,
they are served roasted brisket and black bean chili, with a hot
sauce on the side. Mrs. Stern tries hers and wrinkles her nose.
``It tastes a little school lunch to me,'' she says. ``It's
minestrone-like in a weird way.'' She shakes her head at the hot
sauce. Stern tastes it, too, and sighs. ``New York is not our
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   They do like the steak here. Peter Luger and Ben Benson's are
favorites. And they are loyal to the Oyster Bar and Lundy's. But as
far as chili goes, they are ready to move on. Midtown traffic makes
restaurant hopping feel more like crawling. But it's a chance for
Mrs. Stern to show off her new red flamenco shoes. Flamenco dancing
is her latest passion, one that Stern does not share.
</P>
<P>
   After living and working together for 30 years, the couple, who
are both 52, have a remarkable rapport. They don't interrupt each
other as much as share their sentences, and each seems to have an
ample sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working together has been great for our relationship,'' Stern
says. ``We have to keep our egos in check, be respectful of the
other person. Most couples are much meaner to each other than the
people they work with.''
</P>
<P>
   As the car inches along, Stern says: ``We wrote `Chili Nation'
because chili is probably the only single dish that has a
representative example everywhere in this country. And it's so
intrinsically a democratic dish _ it's associated with chain gangs
and diners. The connotations are so of the people. It's food as
folk art vs. the foodies notion of it as high art.''
</P>
<P>
   El Parador Cafe is practically empty. OK, let's get down to
business. The waiter serves the chili.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very authentic Mexican,'' Mrs. Stern says. ``And this
is a helluva better hot sauce than chili No. 1. But it's still not
like anything in our book.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern agrees, and it's back to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Although the couple can eat up to 10 meals a day on the road,
they have learned to pace themselves. Because they frequent what
they call mom-and-pop cafes, they're aware that the owners notice
when they don't clean their plates, so they tend to cart around a
lot of leftovers. ``We once sent some slabs of ribs through the
X-ray machine at O'Hare,'' Mrs. Stern says. ``We were stopped and
searched. They thought we had someone's rib cage in our carry-on
bag.''
</P>
<P>
   As for their writing, Stern says they have no system: ``Whoever
writes the first draft gives it to the other. We take copious notes
while we're eating. Most of the time, the owners don't notice or
care. Or they think we're with the health department.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Sterns are not traveling, they live in Connecticut with
two dogs and a parrot, and each keeps a horse at a nearby stable.
They are in love with cowboys and feel right at home at Cowgirl
Hall of Fame. Stern looks at the menu: ``If you get the chili,
would you mind if I get the corn dog? One of my lifelong quests is
to find the best corn dog.''
</P>
<P>
   After ordering, Mrs. Stern puts a thermos on the table. ``I
brought some real Texas red, from the recipe in our book,'' she
says. She spoons some out. It is superb, tasty with a long strong
glow of chili pepper. It is not in the same league as either of the
first two chilies, or unfortunately, Cowgirl's, which Mrs. Stern
proclaims ``bland and watery.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is happier: ``Not a bad corn dog. Not my epiphany,
but not bad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Sterns met at Yale in 1968; she was earning her MFA in art,
he was there on a fellowship in art history. Mrs. Stern, who was
born in Manhattan, was the daughter of a shoe designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 5, he moved me and my mother to Nogales with the
idea that he would sell pumps to the Indians,'' she recalls. ``We
spent five years in the desert baking, and when we moved back to
New York, my mother left him, and we went to live with my gay
cousin Wally, who was an opera singer in the village. James Beard
was one of his friends, and when I met him as an adult, he told me,
`You used to sit on my lap when you were living with your mother at
Wally's.' Life is such a weird coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern was born in Chicago and raised in the suburb of Winnetka.
His father worked as a traveling salesman. ``My mother could do
three dozen things with Stouffer's spinach souffle,'' he says
admiringly. He graduated from the University of Michigan, before
arriving at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Stern had a job sorting slides. ``I looked up one day, and
there was this really killer-looking guy with shoulder-length hair
and a motorcycle jacket,'' she recalls. ``I couldn't think of what
to say, so I said, `What's your sign?''' She laughed. ``Instant
amour. He invited me to a documentary on Howard Hawks, which I
thought was a bird film.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been together ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Have they thought of expanding their franchise to include Europe
or Asia? They shake their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the food we write about requires knowing its
context,'' he says. ``If we're in a small town in Alabama, we know
the clues and cues. And I already feel a tremendous frustration
about what a big country this is. The more we've done, the more we
find we haven't done. We just spent a week in St. Louis tracking
down gooey butter cake, and two weeks after we got back, someone
sent me a list with places to try, and we hadn't been to one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Mrs. Stern adds, she has no intention of abandoning her
passion for eating in ``ancient Cantonese restaurants.'' Her
favorite is the Pekin Noodle Parlor in Butte, Mont. ``It's
unchanged since 1955,'' she says. ``They serve the Chinese food
with French fries and a lettuce and tomato garnish.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern nods delightedly. ``It's so weird and wonderful,'' he
says. ``Someone else can do the rest of the world.''

GREENSPAN SEES STRONG U.S. ECONOMY THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
predicted that the U.S. economy will remain strong for the rest of
the year but that growth will slow and inflation will rise a bit
from last year's levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. economy's performance should remain solid this
year,'' Greenspan told lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee
Tuesday in delivering the Fed's semiannual review to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that there are ``several risks'' on the horizon
including continued economic slowdowns in Asia, Latin America and
Europe that could further depress demand for U.S. exports and tip
the U.S. economy into a recession. The U.S. trade deficit was a
record $168.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects the underpinnings of the U.S. economic
performance are strong,'' Greenspan said. ``But after eight years
of economic expansion, the economy appears stretched in a number of
dimensions, implying considerable upside and downside risks to the
economic outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   He said another risk to the economy would be a drop in stock
prices that could hurt consumer confidence and spending. He again
suggested that the stock market was ``overvalued,'' a concern he
first raised in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of gross
domestic product, which is the nation's total output of goods and
services. Greenspan and several other economists have said stock
market gains of the last few years have made consumers feel
comfortable spending money on items they might not normally
purchase in slower economic times.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Fed's report noted that Americans bought record
numbers of computers, cars and houses last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the economy grew about 4 percent, which is well above
the Federal Reserve's target range of 2 percent to 2.5 percent, and
the inflation rate was 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently it was believed that if the economy grew more
than 2.5 percent, it would spark inflation. But for several years
it has grown faster without doing so.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, the Fed is forecasting U.S. economic growth to
slow to 2.5 percent to 3 percent and inflation, as measured by the
consumer price index, to be between 2 percent and 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gone so well for so long we cannot explain what's
been happening with conventional economic theory,'' said Sung Won
Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo and Co. So far, Sohn and other
economists see no signs of a slowdown and expect growth during the
first quarter of 1999 to remain at about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Tuesday by the Conference Board, a leading
business research organization, also suggested the economy would
continue to run at its current clip for a while. The report showed
that consumer confidence rose for the fourth straight month in
February by 3.2 points to 132.1.
</P>
<P>
   While discussing the risks that could hurt the U.S. economy,
Greenspan said its ``surprising'' robustness could continue to defy
his and other economists' expectations. Even he said he isn't sure
what is allowing the economy to grow so quickly without sparking
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said one-time occurrences such as low oil prices that
kept inflation extremely low in 1998 are unlikely to be repeated,
but he said larger, more permanent forces may be at work to make
the economy ``less inflation-prone than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the fact that American businesses have held prices of
their products relatively constant for several years partly because
of competition from overseas but also because of changes in
technology that have made some goods less expensive to produce.
Computers, for instance, have allowed U.S. workers to become more
productive, which has helped companies offset the cost of wage
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also said that until recently many workers were
willing to trade wages increases for job security, which helped
keep pay hikes low. Now, Greenspan said, many companies are
``unwilling to raise wages any faster than they can support at
current price levels.''
</P>
<P>
   But if inflation does begin to rise, Greenspan suggested that
the Fed will increase interest rates in order to slow economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   His comments initially sent the Dow Jones industrial average
down 90 points, but it later recovered most of the loss, closing
down 8.26 at 9,544.42. The NASDAQ rose 34.34 points to close at
2,376.35.

MOUSE IN THE KITCHEN: BAKING TIPS ON THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SHELLY BELZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the winds shake the windows, what could be more
comforting than a warm oven and the smell of baking bread? Though a
computer is not essential to produce the effect, the Internet is
ready to help the baker, and for those who want the goods without
the baking, it also offers places to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to a baker's Camelot'' is the greeting at
www.kingarthurflour.com. The site, run by a company going back to
1790 and boasting that it has never added chemicals to its flours,
offers tips, recipes and even well-illustrated baking ``classes.''
</P>
<P>
   The tips are built into the recipes. For instance, an
introductory note for a recipe for the ``very lightest'' ciabatta,
an airy, slipper-shaped loaf for a sandwich or dipping in soup,
advises that more water will be needed this time of year than in,
say, August, when the flour has been in a humid kitchen all summer.
</P>
<P>
   The people at King Arthur describe themselves on the Web site as
avid bakers. It shows. A recipe for ``crusty Old World sesame
braid'' is in two parts _ for a starter, and then the dough _ and
both parts call for cool water, the temperature favored by
professional bakers to slow the action of yeast.
</P>
<P>
   The online classes are given by Barbara Lauterbach, who owns and
operates the Watch Hill Bed and Breakfast in Center Harbor, N.H., a
distant neighbor of King Arthur, in Norwich, Vt. In a series of
photographs, she takes her charges through maple walnut scones,
whole-wheat granola bread and three other recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The King Arthur catalog, a mail-order storeful of bakers'
supplies and equipment, is pictured on the site, with a number to
call for a copy: (800) 777-4434. Unfortunately, none of that
baker's bounty can be bought on line.
</P>
<P>
   Another good flour company site is www.whitelily.com, based in
Knoxville, Tenn. Like King Arthur, White Lily says that its flour
is higher in protein than all-purpose flour because of a high
percentage of hard wheat. The site describes the company as ``a
Southern tradition since 1883,'' and biscuits are its specialty.
There's a page with four steps and four pictures for light
biscuits. One of the tips is to place the unbaked biscuits on a
sheet an inch apart for crusty sides, or almost touching for soft
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Other recipes include apricot orange bread and cranberry nut
bread, and some that change daily or weekly, like a cranberry
danish breakfast round and Italian turnovers with tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The flour can be bought online, along with White Lily baking
mixes. There are also premiums, including T-shirts and posters.
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly useful site is the Free Internet Bread Recipe
Archive (http://idt.net/wordup/bread.html). Surprising because the
laissez-faire principle of Rick van Valkenburg, who runs the site,
is ``send your favorite bread recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   He posts or links to what comes in, with the idea of making this
a worldwide recipe exchange. To judge by recipes from South Africa
and Norway, with ingredients in metric units (equivalents sometimes
given), he seems to have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Two perfectly bakable recipes from the archive's more than 100
traditional and bread-machine recipes are for Irish brown bread
(using American whole-wheat flour) and ``Duncan's rustic grain
bread,'' which Gerry Duncan, its creator, says is low in fat and
high in protein, freezes well and when toasted goes with chevre.
</P>
<P>
   For answers to baking questions, a good place for prompt,
knowledgeable responses is Baker Boulanger (www.betterbaking.com),
the site of Marcy Goldman, a food writer in Montreal. Besides
answering questions, she has 400 bread and cake recipes on her
site.
</P>
<P>
   This month, she offers Mardi Gras pancake recipes _ which can be
enjoyed even now, a week after Shrove Tuesday, a k a Fat Tuesday or

   The Baldwin Hill Bakery (www.baldwinhill.com) occupies an old
farm in rural Massachusetts, where a whole-grain sourdough bread
with macrobiotic overtones is baked in the Flemish desem tradition.
The desem is the sourdough starter, a fermented culture of the
stone-ground wheat (grown without synthetic fertilizer, herbicide
or pesticide) and water from a 500-foot-deep well. No yeast is
otherwise added.
</P>
<P>
   The breads also contain sea salt from the coast of Brittany. A
loaf made from spelt, an ancient member of the wheat family,
indicates that perhaps not enough sea salt is used. That bread is
tightly textured with a strong grain flavor. It is not like biting
into an airy brioche, but it makes you feel that you are doing
something healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Other Baldwin Hill varieties are whole wheat, sesame wheat, rye,
raisin spelt, raisin cinnamon and rice. There are also lighter
breads. The site has a price list, and the breads cost less than in
stores but can be bought only in quantity. Customers may buy a
mixed batch of six loaves for $12 to $13.80, plus shipping and
handling charges.
</P>
<P>
   One bread baker advises that loaves can be frozen without
risking freezer burn, by wrapping them first in a plastic bag, then
aluminum and then in another plastic bag. The number for orders and
information is (978) 249-4691.

   For years, the Collin Street Bakery in Corsicana, Texas, has
been known for a rich Christmas cake that is as close to a solid
block of pecan as a cake can be. ``We have our own pecan shelling
facility in Corsicana,'' Bob McNutt, the president of the bakery,
wrote by e-mail. ``It is the largest single shelling plant in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The bakery is now online at www.collinstreetbakery.com and is
selling that cake, made from a century-old recipe from Wiesbaden,
Germany, all year round (regular size, almost two pounds, is
$16.15). True to its pecan mission, the bakery is also offering,
among other temptations, apricot pecan cakes, praline pecan
cheesecake, pecan pie, fudge pecan pie and apple pecan crumble.
Orders can be placed at the Web site or at (800) 292-7400.

   Exotic Produce
</P>
<P>
   Fanciers of exotic fruits, vegetables and seasonings will be
glad to know that Frieda's, the country's leading specialty produce
distributor, based in Los Alamitos, Calif., is online, at
www.friedas.com. The company was founded in 1962 by Frieda Caplan,
who first made her mark on America's food tastes by persuading
stores to sell fresh mushrooms instead of canned ones. Another coup
was renaming the Chinese gooseberry to create a world kiwi
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For retail customers, Frieda's has a collection of baskets
(click on Frieda's by Mail). An exotic fruit basket includes the
signature kiwis, Asian pears, horned melons, tamarillos and
cherimoyas (five pounds, $72; eight pounds, $87). A basket of
seasonings popular with cooks includes elephant garlic, dried hot
chilies, dried exotic mushrooms and shallots (eight pounds, $57).
The site also has photos and explanations of exotic fruits and
vegetables, along with dozens of recipes detailing what to do with
a tamarillo or a cherimoya. Orders by e-mail or by calling (800)

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW COMES UNDER FIRE AS EXPIRATION NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the independent counsel law under attack from
both parties, two key senators on Tuesday predicted that the
statute won't be renewed in its present form when it expires June
30.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, which begins hearings on Wednesday into whether
to renew or kill the Independent Counsel Act, told a news
conference that ``this law won't be renewed as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he worried that the intense media spotlight placed
on independent counsels ``pressured'' them to produce results,
regardless of the merits of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dangerous situation,'' he said. ``The independent
counsel is tempted to show his salt, to prove he is up to the task,
and the longer it goes, the more pressure there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his doubts about the law, Thompson promised to give the
statute a fair review. ``We're not going to stack the deck against
the law by only calling in witnesses that are against it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the witness list would include Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr and Attorney General Janet Reno, as well as former
special prosecutors and attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is coming out of the woodwork over this law, but I
still believe that the onus is on the people who want to keep the
statute around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One those people is Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the top
Democrat on the Government Affairs Committee. Standing by
Thompson's side, he said no senators wanted to keep the law in its
present form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without changes to the law, there is almost no chance it will
survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he wants an independent counsel law, but with
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans opposed the law when it was passed in the wake
of the Watergate scandal after President Richard M. Nixon ordered
the attorney general to dismiss special Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox after Cox refused to drop a subpoena for Nixon's
incriminating White House tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Under Presidents Reagan and Bush, congressional Republicans
complained that the statute permitted independent counsels to
conduct politically-inspired investigations. Independent Counsel
Lawrence Walsh's probe into the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal
was the GOP's chief example.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, upset over the six years and $48 million
Walsh spent investigating the Reagan and Bush administrations,
almost didn't renew the act in 1993. But a newly-elected President
Clinton lobbied for the law and won.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when a three-judge federal court panel appointed
Kenneth Starr to investigate Clinton, Democrats have repeated many
of the criticisms of the independent counsel voiced earlier by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one issue on which the Republicans were right, and we
were wrong,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law requires the attorney general to
seek the appointment of an independent counsel when there is
substantial and credible evidence of a crime by any one of 49 top
federal officials, including the president. A panel of three
federal judges then picks an attorney for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor has an unlimited budget to hire aides and
investigate _ a frequent point of criticism. Starr has spent nearly
$50 million on his investigation of allegations against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With approval from the attorney general and the appointing
judges, the independent counsel can broaden investigations far
beyond the original mandate, another target of the law's critics.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's mandate, for example, began with inquiries into
Clinton's land deals and widened repeatedly, finally to the Monica
Lewinsky scandal that led to his impeachment and trial. The Senate
acquitted Clinton Feb. 12, on the two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he and other senators were wary of continuing to
give prosecutors such broad powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent counsel has unlimited money and unlimited
time, and operates without any of the checks placed on a normal
prosecutor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that although Starr's investigation of the
president has generated much of the recent criticisms against the
independent counsel statute, his committee's hearing will not be a
``referendum'' on Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be the Kenneth Starr show, nor is it
going to be the Lawrence Walsh show,'' he said. ``It's going to be
about the law and what to do with it.''
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one member of Congress has formally offered
suggestions on how the law could be changed. Last month, Rep. Jay
Dickey, R-Ark., introduced a bill that would continue the
independent counsel law but with restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey's bill would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Give the attorney general more power to investigate
allegations before requesting an independent counsel;
</P>
<P>
   _ Require that the scope of the investigation be narrowly set;
</P>
<P>
   _ Require special prosecutors to have their budgets approved
after two years;
</P>
<P>
   _ Bar independent counsels from practicing law privately while
serving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit the subject matter of an investigation to issues that
arose during the official's tenure in office, not before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue the way we are going with independent counsels,
we risk losing the support of America,'' Dickey said in a letter to
the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least 20 independent counsels appointed in
the last 20 years (some appointments were made under court seal),
with both Republican and Democratic presidents, cabinet members and
other officials as their targets. Total costs of these
investigations now stand at more than $133 million. Five
independent counsels are currently at work, investigating Clinton
and four present or past members of his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress lets the law lapse, such investigations would be
handled by the Justice Department. The attorney general would
retain authority to turn an investigation over to a special
prosecutor in the manner followed in the Watergate probe of Nixon.

HUSBAND PUZZLED BY WIFE'S DISAPPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

   MODESTO, Calif. _ Although he had not heard from his wife for
the better part of two days, Jens Sund of Eureka was so confident
of her resourcefulness and reliability that he played a round of
golf before he realized that something was definitely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how unworried I was,'' a chastened, exhausted Sund said
Monday. ``Now, I'm worried as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Carrington Sund, his wife of 21 years, ``did not do
things spontaneously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is treating the disappearance of Carole Sund, 42, their
daughter Julie, 15, and Silvina Pelosso, 16, a family friend from
Cordoba, Argentina, as a possible kidnapping. They have not been
seen since they left their motel in El Portal, on the edge of
Yosemite National Park, on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say they have no hard evidence of foul
play. But they do have Carole Sund's wallet, found Friday on the
median strip of a busy Modesto street by a teen-age girl. It
contained her driver's license and several credit cards, but the
cash was missing. Sund said his wife had withdrawn $200 from an ATM
in Merced the previous Sunday and probably carried hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible,'' Sund, 43, said with resignation as he
patiently gave interviews _ in Spanish and English _ at a motel in
Modesto, half a mile from where Carole Sund's wallet was found.
</P>
<P>
   Because the safe return of his wife and the two girls may still
be possible, Sund has offered a $250,000 no-questions-asked reward
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund is a principal in Eureka-based Carrington Co., which
owns shopping centers in California, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada,
Oregon, Texas and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Her family, the Carringtons, has been prominent in Sonoma County
real estate development for more than a century. Jens Sund is a
vice president of Carrington Co. His wife has her own independent
business as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sund said he had received no calls hinting at a ransom demand.
</P>
<P>
   Mariposa County sheriff's Sgt. Doug Binniweiss, the lead
investigator in the case, said Carole Sund's wallet was being
examined by the FBI, but declined to say if fingerprints or other
evidence had been found on it.
</P>
<P>
   Search teams combed the highways leading into Yosemite and the
roads within it on foot and snowshoe, and scanned the area from the
air in helicopters and planes, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The red 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix, California license plate
4BMV025, which Carole Sund rented from Avis, has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   If it were still in the Yosemite area, ``we would have located
it by now,'' Binniweiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Sund said the family had never received threats or even any
hints that they might be targeted for a crime. Carole Sund had been
active ``in a very low-key way'' as a volunteer schoolteacher in
parenting classes and other programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sund discounted a radio report Monday that Pelosso might have
encountered someone in an Internet chat room who might have meant
danger to her or to the family. The girl was not adept at using the
computer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Pelosso, Silvina's mother, has flown in from the central
Argentine city of Cordoba, where her family has a bottling plant
and a cattle ranch. She was distraught and mystified when
interviewed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Silvina ``had had absolutely no problems, no threats,'' her
mother said. ``She was happy here _ tranquil, she felt very
protected, even though she couldn't keep the pace. She wrote that
people were always rushing.''

FACING THE MUSIC AT THE GRAMMYS: ACADEMY EXECUTIVE DOGGED BY
MISHAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the Shrine Auditorium, preparations were under
way for the 41st Grammy Awards ceremony, to be broadcast Wednesday
night on CBS. Drums, banners and giant cinder blocks were carted
hurriedly through the theater as employees in headsets dashed in
all directions; Aerosmith and Celine Dion labored through long
rehearsals with string sections; Bonnie Raitt stopped in for an
online conference, and Brian Wilson took a tour of the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Wandering calmly through the chaos was Michael Greene, casually
dressed in a sweatshirt and baseball cap. His unassuming presence
hardly conveyed that as chief executive of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, which presents the Grammys, he has
become one of the most controversial figures in the music business.
His supporters hail him as a musical philanthropist who brought the
Grammy Awards up to date; his critics paint him as a self-serving
egomaniac raking in money under the guise of charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of enemies,'' Greene said. ``I've got 925
Grammy nominees and only 14 performance slots on that show. So all
the rest of them are mad at me. We've got over 4,000 people on the
waiting list for tickets to this show _ from Nelson Mandela's niece
to Steven Seagal. I can't get those people in, and they all hate
me. Then you've got the record companies: they all have acts they
want to break and their own ideas about how to program the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, whose father was a big-band leader in Atlanta, is a
saxophonist and composer with two albums to his name. Eleven years
ago, he became president of the academy. Since then, membership in
the organization has grown from 3,500 to 14,000, while the scale of
the production and its television audience have greatly expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Greene also started two charity arms of the academy, which have
had some of their practices questioned. Musicares provides
financial assistance to substance abuse programs for musicians, and
the Naras Foundation focuses on music education.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for example, he announced the construction in Los
Angeles of the first of several planned retirement homes and drug
treatment centers for musicians as well as a new program that will
include classical music CDs in the packages of new mothers leaving
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most rigorous duties of the academy's chief
executive is to take the heat when the organization's 10,000 voting
members grant top awards to albums that are not exactly standard
bearers for a year in music, as in 1995 when Tony Bennett won Album
of the Year for ``MTV Unplugged.'' Greene has usually shared the
consternation of his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most nervous part of my existence all year is when those
winners are announced,'' he said. ``I'm a rock musician and I love
jazz, but some of the popular music forms leave me just a little
unfulfilled. So I'm in the same boat as everyone else on Grammy
night. There's good stuff that happens, like Ry Cooder winning with
``The Buena Vista Social Club'' last year, but if ``Titanic''
cleans up this year, I'll be having a couple of martinis.''
</P>
<P>
   Nominations and final votes in most categories are open to all
the Grammy's voting members. But three years ago, Greene instituted
a 25-person review board to pick nominations in top categories,
which he said would eliminate fluff pop like ``Macarena'' from the
running. This has quelled some criticism, but musical taste has
been the least of Greene's problems lately.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's recent troubles began in New York last year during a
news conference announcing the nominees for the 1998 awards. When
an aide to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani complained because the mayor was
not allowed to announce any of the nominations (which are typically
read only by musicians), Greene was accused of losing his temper
with her and making threatening statements, behavior he has denied.
As a result of the incident, Giuliani said Greene was out of line
and that the Grammys could return to Los Angeles for all he cared.
(The show usually alternates between Los Angeles and New York.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite Giuliani's condemnation, Greene said that next year the
Grammy Awards could still take place in New York at Madison Square
Garden, which is competing for the show with the new Staples Center
arena in Los Angeles. ``I've got to patch things up with the mayor,
and we will,'' Greene said. Speaking of top record executives, he
continued, ``Tommy Mottola and Doug Morris and everybody there is
saying, `Get the show back to New York now!'''
</P>
<P>
   A comment from Giuliani could not be obtained in time for
publication.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Greene said that everybody but one party
regretted the events surrounding the press conference. ``I wish I'd
never gone in that green room that morning,'' he said.
``Misunderstandings happen, especially when they're communicated by
third parties. Any time I'm the focus of anything like that it is
bad for the music industry, it's bad for our membership, it's bad
for the Grammys. CBS thinks it helped ratings, though. They loved
it. They said, `Aren't you going to get into a fight with
Riordan?''' (Richard Riordan is the mayor of Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   Greene's troubles worsened when The Los Angeles Times published
a series of articles raising questions about his stewardship. Among
other things, the paper reported that Musicares spent only about 10
percent of the money it raised on charitable works; questioned why
the academy charged the Naras Foundation $500,000 for using the
Grammy trademark; said that the $700,000 bonus Greene received in
1997 was the largest ever paid to an executive of a nonprofit
organization, and reported that he tried to interest record labels
in releasing a CD of his own music during Grammy-related meetings,
which could create a conflict of interest because Greene gets to
decide who performs at the Grammys.

 LOS ANGELES: the Grammys. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Polygram-owned Mercury Records eventually made a deal to
release the CD, though it was dropped when Polygram was sold to
Universal. Mercury was working on a deal to release the album but
abandoned it during the controversy.)
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the articles, Greene defended the payment for the
Grammy trademark, saying it was a ``good business relationship''
that since 1994 has helped increase foundation revenue from less
than $1 million a year to more than $3 million a year, and that his
bonus was appropriate for a business-league trade association. He
added that he received no payment for operating the charities and
contended that 60 percent of Musicare's revenue went to its
programs.
</P>
<P>
   He was unapologetic about trying to release a CD of his music,
and when asked if this request to music companies represented a
conflict of interest, he simply said, ``I'm a musician and there's
not much I can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing that happened in that is I didn't get to
finish my record,'' Greene continued, adding that next month he
would travel to Connecticut to mix the record before giving it to
his lawyers to find a label for it, with proceeds earmarked for
music charities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Greene found himself at the center of another
contretemps. An online music site called MP3.com, one of the
Internet's largest clearinghouses for legally downloadable songs,
tried to place an advertisement in Grammy magazine. But the
magazine would not run the advertisement because, it explained in a
letter, it had limited advertising space and because of MP3.com's
``somewhat controversial nature.'' This letter seemingly put the
Grammys in the same club as the record industry establishment,
which is trying to stop the encroachment of Internet sales on its
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Greene said that he was a passionate supporter of the online
music market, and that the money was rejected because the magazine
was being taken off the newsstand and had stopped accepting
advertisements. The staff member who wrote the letter has since
said that the opinions were his and not those of the Naras.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's Grammy Awards promise to score more favorably,
at least musically, with critics than in previous years, even
though Greene describes 1998 as ``a mediocre year for music.''
Sheryl Crow, Garbage, Madonna, Shania Twain and Madonna have been
nominated for Album of the Year, none of whom would embarrass
Greene as winners.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lauryn Hill, who was nominated for 10 Grammy Awards,
more than any other artist this year, is at the center of a lawsuit
by four musicians called New Ark. They claim that Ms. Hill denied
them proper songwriting and production credits on her album, ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' as well as on a Grammy-nominated
track by Aretha Franklin that Ms. Hill is credited with producing.
Ms. Hill and her lawyers adamantly deny the charges, which are
common in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person wins a Grammy and it is later adjudicated and the
rights issue is reversed, we very quietly get the Grammy to the
right people,'' Greene said. ``We've done it before without telling
anybody. We try to preserve the dignity of the people involved.
This is something nobody knows, but the Grammy belongs to the
academy in perpetuity. The artists and their direct blood estate
can keep it as long as they want, but if the IRS tries to take it
away, they can't. We've done that with several people, including
Willie Nelson. I remember I once walked into a silent auction and
there was Jascha Heifetz's Grammy for auction, and I picked it
right up and walked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are held in New York or Los Angeles and whether
they are mired in scandal or trouble-free, the Grammy Awards in
2000 will probably not be as interesting as the ceremony in 2001,
when everything is up for grabs. In 2001, not only does CBS's
contract to broadcast the show expire, but so does Greene's
contract with the Naras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get asked twice a day, `So what are you going to do after
this?''' Greene said. ``But as long as we can keep growing and I
can keep dealing with music people, they'll have to throw me out
because I really love what I do.''

   FILM-MART (Santa Monica, Calif.) _ The year's biggest event for
Tinseltown's major players comes on March 21 when Academy Awards
are presented; for everyone else, it's Thursday. For hundreds of
mid-level producers, the American Film Market is where the rubber
meets the road as 7,000 participants from 71 countries, including
China for the first time, descend on Santa Monica for nine days. By

   LAX-HOMES (Los Angeles) _ There is nothing fancy about the way
real estate analyst Craig M. Silvers predicts housing prices. He
uses a big crystal ball visible from the San Diego Freeway: Los
Angeles International Airport. Silvers measures the change in
passenger traffic through LAX, crunches some numbers and comes up
with an estimate on which direction housing prices will move. By

 &HT;    WHY DO YOU NEED TWO COPIES OF WINDOWS?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Why are most consumers who already have a current
Windows license required to buy another copy of the Microsoft
operating system when they upgrade their computer to the latest
model?
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers are likely to raise that issue Wednesday at
the Microsoft antitrust trial when they cross-examine Joachim
Kempin, a Microsoft senior vice president who rides herd over the
software giant's dealings with personal computer makers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In industry jargon, the PC firms are known as ``original
equipment manufacturers'' or ``OEMs.'' While Microsoft supplies
Windows directly to hundreds of OEMs, it deals primarily with the
industry's ``Big Seven'': Acer, Compaq, Dell, Gateway 2000,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Packard Bell/NEC.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's defense team has charged Kempin with rebutting a key
facet of the broad case that the Department of Justice has lodged
against Microsoft. It is the charge that Microsoft's contracts with
the OEMs oblige them to favor the Internet Explorer browser, built
into the latest versions of Windows, at the expense of the
Navigator browser developed by a Microsoft rival, Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But in his direct testimony released Tuesday, Kempin argues that
the charge is unjustified. ``The government's testimony about this
subject _ which comes from economists, not any OEM witnesses
testifying in open court _ is mostly based on a mistaken (or, at
best, confused) premise,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The government argues, in effect, that this ``premise'' should
be upheld by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson by finding
that Microsoft sought to illegally misuse its vast Windows market
power to seek control of Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Kempin's 33-page brief does not address the issue of mandatory
Windows pre-loading, a policy which has become the focal point of
several public anti-Microsoft demonstrations in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Computer hardware executives generally cite two reasons behind
for this policy: inhibiting software piracy and limiting the
support costs they would incur after users failed to load the
Windows operating system properly on ``bare'' hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the ``Big Seven'' makers note that most of
the machines they build for business customers can be purchased
with a non-Windows operating system such as Linux, or even with no
system.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the issue of flexibility in the Windows operating
system, Kempin notes in his direct testimony that Microsoft allows
the ``Big Seven'' to modify the Windows 98 startup sequence in two
ways.
</P>
<P>
   They can replace the registration ``wizard'' in the Windows 98
boot sequence with software that offers to sign up the customer
jointly with both the OEM and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they can add their own software to allow computer
buyers to sign up for Internet access with one or more providers
selected by the OEMs. That software can run automatically, prior to
any customer opportunity to use the standard ``Internet Connection
Wizard'' feature of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say these procedures have become a rising
source of revenue for big hardware vendors.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORY  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SUBURBIA-FILMS (Undated) _ In the last generation suburbia has
evolved in startling ways, becoming ever more varied by race, class
and ethnicity and eluding the grasp of all but a handful of
perceptive artists and entertainers. As highbrow films like Todd
Solondz's ``Happiness'' and popular-culture phenomena like ``The
Brady Bunch'' revival peddle the same old cliches, reaping money
and praise by pandering to audiences that share their smug
presumptions, figures as disparate as the author Junot Diaz of
``Drown,'' the filmmaker Tamara Jenkins of ``Slums of Beverly
Hills'' and the comic D.L. Hughley of the television series ``The
Hughleys'' are presenting the complex portrait of suburbia circa
2000. By Samuel G. Freedman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CRUEL-INTENTIONS-FILM (Los Angeles) _ It is the next logical
development in Hollywood high concept: the literary teen movie,
bringing together young people and their Cliff Notes in a way that
ends the need for all those dreary literary classics that clutter
up the high school experience. Think of the possibilities!
``Clueless II: Why Anybody Would Read Jane Austen,'' ``Lolita:
Summer Vacation!'' and ``I Still Don't Know What James Joyce Was
Talking About Last Summer.'' For the younger crowd there would be
the inevitable ``Ernest Hemingway Goes to Camp.'' Or just in time
for back to school ``Little Women: First Blood.'' It was just such
an impulse that gave Roger Kumble, 32, a former video store clerk,
the inspiration for ``Cruel Intentions,'' which he wrote, and later
directed, as `` `Dangerous Liaisons' in high school.'' The film
navigates the shiny surfaces of an Upper East Side world of Gothic
brownstones and even more Gothic behavior. And as with ``Dangerous
Liaisons,'' it is a place where sex is neither furtive nor fun: it
is a weapon of mass destruction. By Bruce Newman.
</P>
<P>
   JAWBREAKER-FILM (Undated) _ ``Jawbreaker'' is the latest in a
slew of high school comedies aimed at the bulging demographic blip
of millennial teen-agers. Already we have had ``Varsity Blues'' and
``She's All That,'' each of which has gobbled up nearly $50 million
at the box office. Opening next week is ``Cruel Intentions,'' an
upscale Manhattan teen version of ``Dangerous Liaisons'' that has
much in common with ``Jawbreaker.'' After that come ``American
Pie'' and ``Ten Things I Hate About You.'' A cursory look at the
high school movies that have opened or are about to open might
reinforce the cliche that the more things change, the more they
stay the same. Now as in the 1950s, the decade that invented the
modern teen-ager, the American teen movie portrays high school as a
brutal social and sexual testing ground whose pecking order puts
handsome jocks and pretty cheerleaders at the top and relegates
misfits, nerds and arty types to social serfdom. By Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews: ``The Mineola
Twins'' and ``Captains Courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANNIE-OAKLEY-THEATER (Undated) _ The woman at the first preview
was surprised. ``It's good,'' she told a friend. ``I thought I
would hate it. I had dinner with some people, and they said, `What
are you seeing?' I told them `Annie Oakley' and they said,
(italics)`Why?'''(end italics) The answer to that question is
Bernadette Peters, who stars in the revival of Irving Berlin's
``Annie Get Your Gun,'' opening on Thursday at the Marquis Theater
on Broadway. By Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LIZZIE-BORDEN-OPERA (Undated) _ The composer Jack Beeson, 78,
concedes that in the context of American contemporary music, his
opera ``Lizzie Borden,'' which had its premiere at the New York
City Opera in 1965, is probably considered musically conservative.
Despite its angst and dissonance, the score is tonally grounded,
hews often to recognizable keys, has stretches of sweet lyricism
and set-piece arias, and even incorporates a likeness of a
Protestant hymn tune and a pastiche of a Victorian parlor song.
Operagoers can judge for themselves on Saturday evening, when
``Lizzie Borden'' returns to the repertory of the company that
presented its premiere but in a new production directed by Rhoda
Levine and conducted by George Manahan. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC-SALES (Undated) _ The good news from most of the
world's major classical-music labels is that the gloom of recent
years has largely been dispelled. Granted, classics account for
only 2.3 percent of the American record market, just less than jazz
(2.5 percent), according to Soundscan, a company that tracks sales.
But the executives who run most of the major labels say their
divisions are profitable and the future is secure. The bad news is
that this profitability has been attained through a series of
bloodlettings in recent years. Staffs have been cut, artists have
been jettisoned and project lists have been pared. By Alan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS-MUSIC (Undated) _ If, as they say, religion is the
opium of the masses, many composers today are heavy users _ and
pushers. Not a day goes by, it begins to seem, not a blessed day,
without a new recording of new music steeped in devotion. By
Matthew Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   OLD-CLASSICAL-COMPOSERS (Undated) _ Grandparents rule. There
never was a time before when American composers of classical music
were so old: Elliott Carter, Henry Brant, Milton Babbitt, George
Perle, Lou Harrison, Leon Kirchner, Ralph Shapey and Gunther
Schuller count among the most venturesome creative musicians of the
present day, all of them going strong at ages ranging down to 73.
The definition of ``young composer'' in this context has to be
someone still under 50, and so far there are not too many high
achievers among them, as a listener was reminded at the recent
Focus festival in Manhattan of the Juilliard School, ``Toward the
Millennium, Part 1.'' By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   BORIS-GODUNOV-OPERA (Undated) _ Mussorgsky, who either didn't
finish his operas or finished them twice, has always been a
yammerer's delight. His works inspire interminable discussion as to
who he really was, what he really meant, which (or whose) version
is best and why. Any review of a performance of ``Boris Godunov''
has to start with a description of just what it contains and an
evaluation of the performers' textual choices before the quality of
the performance can even be broached. A new recording by the Kirov
Opera of St. Petersburg, conducted by the indefatigable Valery
Gergiev (Philips 462 230-2; five CDs), seeks to still the yammering
by presenting both of the composer's originals _ the practically
all-male 1869 version, and the 1872 score replete with a Polish
princess and four little animal ditties for other women's voices _
in what are billed as meticulously faithful reproductions. By
Richard Taruskin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Andy Warhol began painting
Campbell's Soup cans nearly four decades ago, it wasn't long before
Pop Art became accepted as the Next Big Thing in the world of fine
arts. The newest development in a modernist tradition that had
already absorbed the shocks of Cubism, Dadaism and Abstract
Expressionism, Pop Art was quickly recognized as a movement ready
made for museum catalogues, history books and skyrocketing auction
prices. But if you turn the words Pop Art around and apply them to
music, suddenly you have a debate about cultural values and
hierarchy, about entertainment and art, that has never been fully
resolved. By Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY-MUSIC (Undated) _ Country has long been packaged as the
classical music of simple American folks. The transformation of
hillbilly entertainment into an official repository of our national
traditions has extended from the fancy naming of the Grand Ole Opry
in 1927 to the appointment of William Ivey, the director of the
Country Music Hall of Fame, to the chair of the National Endowment
for the Arts in 1998. Not only Nashville's music industry, but also
the ``alternative'' country made by rock- and folk-schooled rebels
can be discouragingly orthodox, its vintage trappings turning
cultural preservation into historical tourism. Yet country music is
also grounded in dislocation _ in the stories of people facing
upheaval in their home towns, their families, their daily routines.
By Ann Powers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-CLASSICAL-MUSIC (Undated) _ Here's one you may have heard
before: Jazz is America's classical music. It's a declaration that
is always intoned with great seriousness and a touch of
argumentative pride; the intent is to grant jazz the respect it
undeniably deserves. But that formulation has always left me
skeptical, and I've come to think that it does current jazz more
harm than good. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PEACEABLE-KINGDOM-ANTIQUES (Williamsburg, Va.) _ Edward Hicks,
the early 19th century painter and Quaker minister, is a commanding
figure in American folk art. Hicks' works, especially his
``Peaceable Kingdom,'' paintings, continue to bring top prices in
the market: last month a version from 1837 was auctioned at
Christie's in New York for $4.7 million, a record for folk art. By
Rita Reif.

SENATE GROUP TO PROBE MEXICO'S EFFORT AGAINST DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the deadline nears for the Clinton
administration to decide whether to recertify Mexico as a
drug-fighting ally, the Senate wants to know how whether Mexico is
diligently helping the U.S. war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate's Narcotics Control Caucus, Sen.
Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, said many members of Congress are
disappointed with Mexico's drug-control efforts. Grassley will
preside Wednesday over hearings that examine Mexico's efforts to
combat drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus will hear from Raymond W. Kelley, U.S. Customs
Service commissioner; Admiral James Loy, commandant of the U.S.
Coast Guard; Rand Beers, assistant secretary for the Bureau of
International Narcotics in the State Department; and Thomas A.
Constantine, administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said he wants the hearing ``to send a signal that we
aren't totally satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has until March 1 to decide whether to
certify to Congress that Mexico has fully cooperated in the war
against drugs. Failure to win certification could require a cutoff
of U.S. aid and a U.S. vote against World Bank loans to the
offending countries. The administration also could choose a middle
course, deciding to decertify a country but waive the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton indicated last week when he met with Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo that he will recertify Mexico as a
committed ally in the fight against drugs. Congress then has 30
days to vote to overturn a presidential decision on certification.
</P>
<P>
   One critic of Mexico's drug-control efforts in the past, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she will wait until after the
hearing to decide whether to try to block recertification of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top levels of the Mexican government are trying'' to stem
drug trafficking through more infrastructure and technology,
Feinstein said. On the other hand, ``indications of money
laundering, and a lack of arrests and drug seizures don't look
good,'' she said in an interview. ``The cartels are flourishing and
that's of deep concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have complained that Mexico seized less heroin and
cocaine last year than in previous years. They also cite declines
in the number of drug seizures, arrests and investigations in
Mexico last year. There also have been concerns about widespread
corruption in Mexican law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that about 400 tons of cocaine cross the
2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexican border each year. U.S. officials also
say Mexico is a major producer of marijuana, opium and
amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who has also criticized
Mexican anti-drug efforts in the past, said she ``has concern about
the certification process,'' adding: ``I think we need another
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in their right mind thinks we are making the progress
we need to make,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., who chairs the Senate
Agriculture Committee, predicted Mexico's certification will be
renewed as it has been 12 times since 1986 when Congress began
requiring the administration to certify annually that
drug-producing countries are cooperating with U.S. anti-drug
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to a pragmatic choice,'' Lugar said. ``I would
guess that when push comes to shove, we would recertify and
continue to work with Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The prior certification have sparked some criticism in Congress
and occasional efforts to cancel the administration's decision to
recertify. Those efforts have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown University political science professor John Bailey,
who is scheduled to testify at the hearing Wednesday, also
predicted Mexico will be recertified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't decertify a country you have a 2,000-mile border
with,'' he said. ``The relations are so vast and deep that
decertification isn't a real option.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico ranks as the United States' second-largest trading
partner, having surpassed Japan and its much larger economy. Canada
is the No. 1 U.S. trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said the United States is partly at
fault for failing to contribute enough money and manpower to help
curb drug production at the source in Mexico and other
drug-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't concentrated on the supply side as much as we could
have,'' Hatch said.

GOP LEADERS SOFTEN THEIR CALL FOR 10 PERCENT TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Stands for REPUBLICAN-DISUNITY)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Clinton administration opposed to a flat
10 percent tax cut, Republican congressional leaders on Tuesday
struck a more conciliatory posture, saying an across-the-board tax
cut is only one of several ways of returning surplus revenue to
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are for tax cuts,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., told reporters after meeting with Republican governors.
``There are a lot of different ways to do that. They may be a mix,
or they may be across the board, but tax cuts will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., made clear his
preference for a 10 percent across-the-board cut. He cited an
example of a 30-year-old single female taxpayer in Jackson, Miss.,
who would receive $500 back under a 10 percent cut, but nothing
under the proposed marriage penalty tax cut, one of the chief
alternate proposals discussed in the last session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the marriage penalty would reduce taxes on
joint-income married couples who now pay more taxes than they would
if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lott said ``tax relief'' can be achieved through
``a rate cut and/or some cut like the marriage penalty tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The willingness to consider tax cuts other than a 10 percent cut
contrasts to previous Republican insistence on an across-the-board
cut.
</P>
<P>
   At a GOP rally in Warren, Mich., last week, Lott stood
underneath a banner saying ``Listen to America _ Tax Cuts for
Everyone,'' and asked the crowd: ``Do you want this surplus spent
by Washington, or do you want it returned to the people?'' The
budget surplus is estimated at $2.56 trillion over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has opposed the 10 percent cut, arguing it
would favor the wealthy. Clinton prefers what he terms ``targeted''
tax cuts to individuals in need. For instance, Clinton in his
budget plan earlier this month proposed tax credits for individuals
caring for elderly relatives, and credits for work expenses of
disabled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Republicans agree on one thing: About 60 percent of
the surplus must be earmarked to save Social Security, which will
not be able to pay full benefits to retirees in 2032 unless
something is done to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
said that considering the size of the budget surplus, the Social
Security system can be shored up and about $900 billion can be
returned to tax payers over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators want a tax cut, but are not overly
particular what form it takes, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Surplus revenues, he said, ``can be used for an across-the-board
type cut or any of the various popular reductions that are musts
for the American people. I don't sense any polaraziation of one
versus the other here.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent Republican expressed disappointment that
Republican congressional leaders appeared to be backing away from
the 10 percent cut. Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin told reporters
that Republican lawmakers ``should have an identity. It should be
10 percent across-the-board (tax cut)'' that GOP lawmakers should
approve even in the face of a certain White House veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will differentiate between Republicans and Democrats and
show the American public that there is a difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a veteran Republican governor widely credited with
being the moving force behind welfare reform after starting an
early version in Wisconsin in 1987, blasted the GOP congressional
leadership for being ``too tepid. They need to stand up and be
aggressive and develop their own plans, instead of always being on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson linked the Republican loss of five seats in the House
last November to last year's budget deal with Clinton which gave
the administration significant victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to stand up to Clinton,'' Thompson said.
``And I think as a result of that, Republicans stayed home (on
Election Day) and Democrats came out and we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, a Republican who is this
year's chairman of the National Governors' Association, said
Republicans shouldn't view Clinton's positions as the sole measure
of the success or failure of the party's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans should not hesitate nor apologize for their value
systems,'' he said. ``We should be able to jointly advance an
agenda for prosperity and growth. I think we're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if about the view that Republican lawmakers gave away too
much in last year's budget agreement, Keating said ``people's knees
should not knock over Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton was impeached ...
The thing to do is not be afraid to do the right thing (at a time
when) Mr. Clinton happens to be the president.''
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, Keating said with a broad smile on his face, ``I
think he (Clinton) wants what's best for the country, too!''

WHO WILL WIN MUSIC WORLD'S TOP TROPHIES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The girls' night out this evening at the 41st
annual Grammy Awards makes hip-hop diva Lauryn Hill the gal to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   We predict Hill, leading the nominations with 10 nods, will take
home five of the famous trophies shaped as miniature gramophones
when the awards are presented at the Shrine Auditorium and on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's seductive solo debut album, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn
Hill,'' will probably win for album of the year and r&AMP;b album,
while the 23-year-old New Jersey native should get votes for new
artist and producer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Here are our picks for some of the night's biggest honors. The
eligibility period for the Grammys _ the second-most-watched awards
show after the Oscars _ runs from Oct. 1, 1997, through Sept. 30,
1998, with a total of 925 nominees in 95 categories.
</P>
<P>
   RECORD OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Easy _ Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On,'' the ``Titantic''
love theme that sold 26 million copies. Never does a dollars 'n'
cents dud get this award, while movie hits have won in four of the
last six years. &QL; 
ALBUM OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Proven Grammy favorite Sheryl Crow (``The Globe Sessions'') and
the sorely overlooked Madonna (``Ray of Light'') compete with
Shania Twain, Hill and Garbage. Hill's widely praised
``Miseducation'' gets it. &QL; 
SONG OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Five of the past six winners have been movie-related. That's why
Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On'' will win this songwriters' honor for
composer James Horner and lyricist Will Jennings. &QL; 
NEW ARTIST
</P>
<P>
   Often the kiss-of-death category _ Christopher Cross, anyone? _
but this year Hill will probably gather more votes than competitors
Backstreet Boys, Andrea Bocelli, Dixie Chicks and Natalie
Imbruglia. &QL; 
FEMALE POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   Dion again _ her first in this category. &QL; 
MALE POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   The favorite is Eric Clapton's ``My Father's Eyes,'' although
we'd rather see Eagle-Eye Cherry's ``Save Tonight'' get the nod. &QL; 
POP PERFORMANCE BY A DUO OR GROUP
</P>
<P>
   Aerosmith's ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'' could get it, but
we predict the swing thing will fuel the Brian Setzer Orchestra's
first Grammy win for the ubiquitous ``Jump Jive an' Wail.'' &QL; 
POP COLLABORATION WITH VOCALS
</P>
<P>
   Grammy gets a much-needed shot of credibility by voting odd
couple Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach into the club for ``I
Still Have That Other Girl.'' &QL; 
DANCE RECORDING
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's adventurous ``Ray of Light.'' An English accent _ real
or faked _ usually helps in this category. &QL; 
POP ALBUM
</P>
<P>
   Madonna wins again for ``Ray of Light.'' &QL; 
TRADITIONAL POP VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bennett ordinarily wins here _ but he didn't release an
album during the eligibility period. however, old-time crooner Jack
Jones did _ and it's a tribute to Bennett. Need we say more? &QL; 
FEMALE ROCK VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   Even though critics' fave Lucinda Williams has a shot at this
trophy for ``Can't Let Go,'' watch Alanis Morissette get the vote
for the radio hit ``Uninvited.'' &QL; 
MALE ROCK VOCAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   Crazy, man! John Hiatt's ``Have a Little Faith in Me'' was
nominated even though it first came out in 1987. But the late Jeff
Buckley will probably garner the sympathy vote for ``Everybody Here
Wants You.'' &QL; 
ROCK PERFORMANCE BY A DUO OR GROUP WITH VOCAL
</P>
<P>
   The record academy is probably as intimidated as everyone else
by Courtney Love's raving lunatic act, so Hole's ``Celebrity Skin''
will get the golden gramophone. Watch her break it. &QL; 
HARD ROCK PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the academy makes a surprise left turn _ and votes
for Marilyn Manson's ``The Dope Show.'' &QL; 
METAL PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   As much as we'd like to see those gasoline-powered Nashville
kittens get the nod, we won't be surprised when Metallica wins in
this category for the fourth time. &QL; 
ROCK SONG
</P>
<P>
   Morissette's ``Uninvited'' again, although the more deserving
winners would be Mick Jagger and Keith Richards with Richard
Ashcroft for the Verve's glorious ``Bitter Sweet Symphony.'' &QL; 
ROCK ALBUM
</P>
<P>
   The academy honors studio savvy and votes inducts ``Version
2.0'' by Garbage. &QL; 
ALTERNATIVE MUSIC PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   Beastie Boys' ``Hello Nasty'' gets the trophy. &QL; 
SONG WRITTEN FOR A MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   A little ditty from ``Titanic'' might have a chance.

ETHNIC ALBANIANS GIVE TENTATIVE AGREEMENT TO PEACE SETTLEMENT FOR
KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (See related KOSOVO-FIGHTING, KOSOVO-REACT) 
(fe) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ In a last-minute turnaround, the ethnic
Albanian delegation at the Kosovo talks agreed in principle on
Tuesday to a peace settlement, turning what appeared to be an
almost certain collapse for the Clinton administration's peace
efforts into a limited success.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the deadline of 3 p.m. for the end of the talks
here, the ethnic Albanians presented Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and five other foreign ministers a declaration that
promised to sign the peace settlement after two weeks of
consultation with the population at home.
</P>
<P>
   The three-paragraph declaration was dragged out of the
delegation after the chief American negotiator, Ambassador
Christopher Hill, entreated them to look into their hearts. Their
statement saved the two-and-a-half-week talks that attempted to
resolve the conflict in Kosovo with a proposal that calls for NATO
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials acknowledged that the
result was far from what they needed to pressure Slobodan Miloevic,
the Yugoslav president, who remains opposed to NATO peacekeepers in
Kosovo. The U.S. strategy was to get the ethnic Albanians
completely on board so that Western negotiators would have more
leverage to squeeze Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Without a final answer from the Albanians, it will be hard to
carry out the threat of NATO bombing, meant to force Milosevic's
hand. Now the process essentially goes on hold for two weeks, and
diplomats fear Milosevic will try to exploit this delay by making
inroads against the Kosovo Liberation Army on the ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The conference organizers _ Albright and the five other foreign
ministers _ said they would reconvene on March 15 in an unspecified
place in France to complete the process and to come to what they
called a quick conclusion on a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who appeared relieved that her investment of three
days of coaxing and admonishing the ethnic Albanians had partially
paid off, emphasized that the ethnic Albanians ``have a
responsibility to make their `yes' an unequivocal `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 16-member ALbanian delegation said that it would take the
proposed peace agreement back to Kosovo and explain its elements to
the roughly 1.8 million ethnic Albanians. Both the delegation and
the foreign negotiators said they believed the consultations at
home _ discussions in political circles and among citizens _ would
result in a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   They said it would be a popular document because it gives
considerable autonomy to the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the population of Kosovo, a province within the Yugoslav
republic of Serbia. It would also enable them to get rid of almost
all the Serbian police and Yugoslav soldiers in Kosovo and would
bring in 28,000 NATO-led soldiers to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian delegation, which the Americans had expected
to be the easier side to convince during the negotiations, balked
at the peace agreement until the last moment _ in large part
because of the objections of five members from the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the rebel group that has been fighting against the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   One delegate for the guerrillas, Hashim Thaci, was the last
objector. But he was finally brought around when Hill and then
another member of the delegation, Vetan Surroi, isolated him in
discussions on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block that Thaci had persistently raised _ the
separatist rebels' insistence on holding a referendum at the end of
a three-year interim period _ was addressed with a face-saving
reference to a referendum at the end of the declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration says that the delegation understands that at the
end of the interim period Kosovo ``will hold a referendum to
ascertain the will of the people.'' While exactly what this
referendum means was left unclear, negotiators said that it would
not be legally binding and that a vote for independence would not
force the Serbs to grant independence. But the reference to a
referendum appeared to be enough to satisfy the demands of Thaci
and others who see a vote as a crucial first step toward eventual
independence. The agreement right now offers Kosovo autonomy but
would keep it as a province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that in the next two weeks, when the ethnic
Albanians were back home selling the agreement, the threat of NATO
airstrikes against Milosevic would be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   But once a new round of negotiations convenes on March 15, they
said, the threat of airstrikes would renew the pressure on
Milosevic to agree to the use of NATO-led ground troops as
peacekeepers that he has so far vigorously resisted.
</P>
<P>
   The British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said at the joint
news conference of foreign ministers, that the secretary-general of
NATO, Javier Solana, was still empowered to order airstrikes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albright said the Serbian delegation, headed in the last days by
Milosevic's close ally, Milan Milutinovic, had given a qualified
yes to the political aspects of the peace agreement, including
autonomy for Kosovo. But, she said, they remained ``unengaged'' on
the administration's insistence that the peacekeeping force in
Kosovo be led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs said in a written declaration to the foreign ministers
that they would discuss the possibility of an ``international
presence'' in Kosovo. This proposal was an effort to accept less
than a NATO force, and Albright said she found it unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ethnic Albanian acceptance was only conditional and
the Serbs had barely come to the table, Clinton administration
officials said that the next two weeks in Kosovo could be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic could use his forces in Kosovo to try to create havoc
for the Kosovo Liberation Army on the ground, making the guerrillas
perhaps less eager to settle than their representatives in
Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said there had been a substantial buildup of
Serbian police forces and Yugoslav army troops inside Kosovo and on
the borders between Serbia and Kosovo in the last several weeks.
This could indicate that Milosevic was preparing for renewed
fighting, they said.
</P>
<P>
   To get the conditional acceptance, Albright offered some
incentives to the ethnic Albanian delegation, which were intended
to show that the United States is a friend of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Washington will open a visa office in Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, she promised, so that ethnic Albanians will not have to
travel to Belgrade, the Serbian capital, to get consular services.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials of the Kosovo Liberation Army will be
brought to the United States for training in how they can transform
themselves from a guerrilla group into a police force or a
political entity, much like the African National Congress in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end it appears to have been Hill's 11th-hour appeal
combined with the leadership of Surroi, the publisher of the
biggest circulation newspaper in Kosovo, that turned the tables.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said that he tried to prepare the delegation on Monday
night for the consequences of failing to stop a war that has
squandered civilian lives in the last year and could get worse. He
said he asked the delegates to think about how they would think of
themselves as individuals a week from now if they rejected the
opportunity for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, as the foreign ministers were waiting for
the ethnic Albanians' final decision, Hill said he went into the
delegation room and sensed it was clear that a majority wanted to
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, he pointed to a delegate and asked, ``Do you want
to sign?'' The answer came back: ``Po,'' the Albanian word for yes.
Hill said he got a succession of ``Po's'' until he got to Surroi,
who stood up and started speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vetan said, `OK, we can get this worked out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Surroi proposed a text of what became the declaration. Hill
suggested that a translator sit at a computer in the room and type
the words on the screen. There were no objections in the room, and
with that, Hill said, the foreign ministers had what they needed.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi has worked during the talks as a bridge in the delegation
and had tried to bring the five guerrillas around.
</P>
<P>
   He said late on Tuesday afternoon: ``This was done by consensus.
We have everyone on board. What we have achieved here is Albanians
working together. The biggest argument we saw was that this is an
opportunity for peace.''

 &HT;    Louis J. Salome was the Middle East and European correspondent
for Cox Newspapers and The Palm Beach Post for 9 1/2 years. In
1991, he visited a camp operated by the military arm of the
Kurdistan Workers Party. In the wake of recent events in the
region, Salome reflects on that trip in this story.
 &HT;    By Louis J. Salome
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONTEH, Lebanon _ On the wall of the camp library, next to a
cluster of rifles, was a large photograph of everyman's
revolutionary, Che Guevara. Standing upright on a shelf was a copy,
written in Turkish, of Karl Marx's Das Kapital, which kissed the
cover of an illustrated biography of Nikolai Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   A little dated here, I thought, recalling the fall of the Berlin
Wall almost two years earlier. It was early September 1991, and I
was spending a couple of days at a remote mountain training camp
with some of the most notorious, effective and anachronistic
guerrillas in the Middle East: The military arm of the Kurdistan
Workers Party, known as the PKK and led by Abdullah Ocalan, a
Turkish Kurd who was then the most elusive, if largely unknown,
Kurd in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 7 1/2 years later, Ocalan (pronounced OH-cha-lan) has
become a larger-than-life global figure. He was captured in
mysterious circumstances in Kenya on Feb. 15, and was returned with
great celebration to Turkey for trial. Tuesday, he was formally
charged with treason, and prosecutors are seeking the death
penalty. Kurdish exiles throughout Europe greeted Ocalan's capture
with massive protests, firebombings and kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, the PKK described the rugged, barren mountains of
Yonteh in eastern Lebanon as ``a no man's land,'' which is a
captivating name for a people without a country.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Guevara, Marx and Lenin library was a small
amphitheater, with four rows of wood benches, covered by a canvas
held aloft by thin, buckling saplings. This was where the camp
commander turned library sessions into political indoctrination.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to think that the awed Kurdish recruits from Turkey,
guerrillas in training, believed that the tent remained standing
only because of the will of their all-powerful leader, Ocalan, a
blown-up photograph of whom dominated the amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   All around this guerrilla boot camp were photographs of
``martyrs,'' PKK fighters who trained here and died fighting in
southeastern Turkey for political autonomy and against Turkish
repression. The martyrs represented the blood part of the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the library was the military training ground, where men
and women recruits wearing Nike and Adidas athletic shoes hardened
themselves for attacks inside Turkey by dodging live bullets,
crawling under barbed wire and somersaulting through rings of fire.
</P>
<P>
   This training camp, its only one outside of Turkey, represented
the hard political and military core of the PKK, which since 1984
has caused havoc far beyond its numbers in Turkey. Ocalan is the
Guevara, Marx and Lenin of the PKK, which in ideological terms is
mired somewhere in the mid-Fifties.
</P>
<P>
   From their base in Lebanon, a steady stream of PKK guerrillas _
200 to 300 fresh recruits every three months _ traveled overland to
Turkey. There, they took over Kurdish towns, established PKK cells
and trained more guerrillas for attacks against the Turkish army
and civilians. They also provoked the Turkish army into attacks
that nearly obliterated Kurdish towns _ and in many cases turned
Kurds against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
   As worshipped as he is by the PKK guerrillas, Ocalan is not the
god of the Kurdish people, as many as 25 million of whom are
scattered across the mountains, historically known as Kurdistan, in
Iran, Iraq, Syria, Armenia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   He is not even the god of the Turkish Kurds, most of whom,
despite poverty and government attempts to suppress their identity,
reject the PKK's violent methods that have killed about 37,000
people in Turkey and brought the devastating force of the Turkish
military crashing down on Kurdish towns in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The violent protests by Kurds across Europe gives the impression
that the protesters must all be members of the PKK or that Ocalan
is a leader to all Kurds. They are not and he is not.
</P>
<P>
   Many are protesting the treacherous manner in which Ocalan, who
is still one of them, was captured and the way he is likely to be
treated by the tough Turkish authorities who believe they can crush
the PKK by erasing Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds are also protesting the repressive political, social,
economic and military conditions that exist in Turkey and which
continue to smear Turkey's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, the Kurds are also using Ocalan's capture
to inform the world that all 25 million of them remain stateless.
</P>
<P>
   Divided by the states where they live, by tribal and political
allegiances that make them willing and unwilling pawns in regional
and international affairs, the Kurds are as complex as the region
where most of them live.
</P>
<P>
   Most Kurds are secular Muslims who belong to the main Sunni
sect. PKK members are more secular than most, devoted to what they
call ``scientific socialism that can be applied to the reality and
conditions of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Six miles from Lebanon's border with Syria and not far from the
Bekaa Valley, which was notorious for its Iranian-linked guerrilla
bases, the PKK trained with the permission of Syria, which
controlled Lebanon then and still does.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1991, I watched recruits _ 200 of the 10,000 of whom had
trained at the Lebanon base since it opened in 1984 _ march with
notebooks and rifles into the library for part of the political
indoctrination that gave them as much a reason for existing as
their military training.
</P>
<P>
   I listened to their political lessons that cemented internal
discipline and built esprit de corps. I ate with the recruits,
talked with them and watched their commander, Numan Salman,
distribute green jackets that had three U.S. flags on each label,
which said American Field Jacket, M-65.
</P>
<P>
   I watched the recruits, men and women, carry Soviet-made
Kalashnikov rifles, U.S.-made M-16s, Turkish-made J-3 rifles, and
J-1 rifles, which are used by NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weapons are not a problem for us. The Middle East is full of
weapons,'' Salman said, with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   I also lived for weeks at a time _ in 1991, 1992 and 1996 _ with
Kurds in Syria, Iraq and Turkey. Saddam Hussein drove the Iraqi
Kurds from northern Iraq after the Gulf War in 1991, but that was
not the PKK's war. Only when the Iraq-Turkey border later became a
defenseless zone did the PKK cross the mountains into Iraq and use
the frontier as a staging area for attacks in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish soldiers would kill any Kurds who tried to cross from
Iraq into Turkey. I know, because when I tried to escape from Iraq
in 1991, border guards, thinking I was a Kurd, said they would kill
me if I tried to cross the river.
</P>
<P>
   Until late last year, Ocalan was sheltered in Damascus, Syria,
from which he traveled often to the PKK base in Lebanon. And with
Syria looking the other way, the PKK sometimes launched attacks
across the Syria-Turkey border, until heavy Turkish military
pressure halted the attacks and late last year forced Syria to
expel Ocalan and send him on the futile search for asylum that led
to his capture.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, I located what Syrian Kurds told me was
Ocalan's refuge in Damascus, but I was never able to spot him
there.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 million Kurds live in northeastern Syria near its border
with Turkey and Iraq, but the Kurdish military presence there
centered mainly around Kurds from Iraq, not Turkey. No friend of
Saddam Hussein, Syria opened its border with Iraq in a vain attempt
to help the Iraqi Kurds resist him after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   I have interviewed Jalil Talabani, Massoud Barzani and Sami
Abdul Rahman, the main tribal leaders of the Iraqi Kurds, and
listened to each attempt to delude the world, and probably
themselves, into believing that a victory against Saddam Hussein
was just around the next mountain when a rout awaited them in a
nearby valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish fighters in Iraq are called Peshmergas, which means
``men who are facing death.'' Peshmergas are mountain clansmen who
wear baggy tribal clothing with bandoliers of bullets that
crisscross their bodies, broad sashes across their waists and cloth
bands wound around their heads. They look like mountain fighters
from another century.
</P>
<P>
   The Peshmergas are brave but underarmed and anachronistic
mountain fighters compared to the PKK guerrillas, who are backed by
a political ideology that gives them political cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   As outdated as it is, the PKK's Marxist-Leninist philosophy
provided the glue that kept the organization together. The PKK
never wavered in one other respect: Abdullah Ocalan, the man they
call ``Apo,'' gave PKK guerrillas their intellectual and military
reason for being.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, one recruit said back in 1991, ``is everything for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now his capture gives Ocalan the stature among other Kurds he
never had before. Ironically, the fact that Ocalan is in a Turkish
prison proves he is one Kurd who succeeded.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the year's fiercest battle yet in South Lebanon,
three Israeli officers were killed and five soldiers wounded early
on Tuesday by Shiite Muslim guerrillas who attacked them with
grenades and machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   As Israeli radio played mourning music, politicians visited the
wounded and television cameras recorded the funerals, the
casualties set off the latest round of soul-searching here about
the 20-year-long Israeli military presence in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But the soul-searching is cyclical. It arises when coffins force
the question of whether there is any reason for Israel to continue
risking young soldiers' lives inside Lebanon; it dissipates when
the burial images fade. And on Tuesday there was already a
half-hearted quality to the questioning as minor domestic political
events distracted the country's attention.
</P>
<P>
   To Claude Balahsan, however, the anguish of the day could not be
greater. His son, Eitan, a 30-year-old major, who commanded the
special army unit that came under fire, was the first killed. And
Balahsan's faltering voice, choked with emotion, pleaded on Israeli
radio for his loss to serve as a catalyst for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot keep having the troops serve as cannon fodder for
the settlements in the north,'' said Balahsan, who lives on a
settlement in the north. ``I'm turning to the government way up
there to get it together and start thinking. It can't be that every
week or two, a soldier dies, two soldiers die. It can't go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis awoke on Tuesday morning to an eerie but increasingly
familiar black box on the front page of their newspapers. Inside
the box, in white letters, the headlines told of heavy fighting in
South Lebanon. But the typography has grown to be code. Israelis
knew that it meant there had been deaths, but that the army censors
weren't ready to let the news go public.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army and spokesmen for Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed
Shiite guerrilla group, offered different versions of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis said that just after midnight, the elite
paratroopers unit slipped over the invisible border between
Israel's 9-mile-deep security zone in South Lebanon _ which it
occupied in 1985, saying it needed to protect its northern towns _
into South Lebanon proper. They were heading toward Hezbollah bases
when they crossed paths with a group of from three to five
guerrilla fighters who were scouting the area, the army said.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Hezbollah in Beirut said its special
guerrilla force penetrated Israel's security zone, and ambushed the
Israeli soldiers there. Hezbollah said it suffered no casualties,
The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that Hezbollah opened fire, that the clash was
fierce and deadly, and that Israel retaliated with air strikes
early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The incident brought the first casualties of the year. After
Balahsan fell, the others killed were Lt. Liraz Tito, who was to
turn 22 on Tuesday, and Lt. David Granit, 22. The five wounded
soldiers were evacuated to Israeli hospitals during the heavy
gunbattle that followed.
</P>
<P>
   For some Israelis, resolving the conflict on their northern
border is as vital a concern as making peace with the Palestinians.
Every year brings a fresh death toll _ 21 soldiers died last year _
and with every wavelet of deaths, there are renewed calls for a
unilateral troop withdrawal from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Beilin, the 4th-ranking member of the Labor Party, sent a
``Dear Misha'' letter to Defense Minister Moshe Arens on Tuesday,
suggesting that he devote the remainder of his term to Lebanon.
Elections are scheduled for May 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in the short time left in your term, you pull the army out
of Lebanon, you will be remembered as the person who brought the
Israeli movie of folly to an end,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But most military experts here believe that the best, if not the
only, solution to Israel's enmeshed presence in South Lebanon is to
negotiate its withdrawal, preferably with Syria, which effectively
controls Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Arens, in fact, made it bluntly clear in a speech on Monday that
he did not consider Lebanon worth talking to. In unusually frank
language, he called Lebanon a ``puppet state'' controlled by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all the trappings of an independent country,'' he said
in a speech here to the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations. ``It has a president. It has a parliament. It
is a member of the United Nations. It has ambassadors. But it is a
noncountry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the world goes along with the charade, but everyone
knows it is a charade,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government was
``weighing alternatives all the time.'' But his opponents in the
race for prime minister _ Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader, and
Yitzhak Mordechai, the Center Party leader _ say they would
immediately reopen negotiations with Syria over Lebanon and the
Golan Heights.

MUSEUM RETURNS ONCE-STOLEN SCULPTURE TO INDIA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 15 years ago, the Manhattan's Asia Society
learned that a 1,000-year-old Indian relief sculpture in its
collection had been stolen from a provincial museum in Dhubela, in
central India. The government of Madhya Pradesh state asked for the
return of the piece, which John D. Rockefeller III, the Asia
Society's founder, had donated to the museum in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after many intermittent discussions, the society
worked out the details of the return with Indian officials, joining
the small but growing number of museums that are voluntarily
surrendering items of cultural heritage to their countries of
origin.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles said it
would turn over three important antiquities from its collection to
the Italian government. In October, the Denver Art Museum returned
a carved wooden lintel to Guatemala after discovering that it had
been looted from a Mayan temple there in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   And the Association of Art Museum Directors, facing both an
increase in claims from governments and stepped-up criticism from
some archeologists, decided late last month to revise its code of
ethics. The result may be to clarify what is expected when museums
acquire items that a foreign country considers part of its cultural
patrimony, when the items should be repatriated and when museums
may, in general, reduce their holding through deaccession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 25 years this issue is going to blow up,'' said
one museum director who insisted on anonymity. ``And our code of
ethics position on buying is not so clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The code, last revised about nine years ago, deems it
unprofessional for a museum director ``to acquire knowingly or
allow to be recommended for acquisition any object that has been
stolen, removed in contravention of treaties and international
conventions to which the United States is a signatory, or illegally
imported into the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not say anything about what questions should be asked
about an item's previous ownership before it is considered for
acquisition. That loophole, combined with the word ``knowingly,''
seems to allow museums to remain in willful ignorance about an
object's past.
</P>
<P>
   The code's language also fails to address acquisitions made
between 1970, when Unesco adopted a convention against illicit
trade in cultural property, and 1983, when the United States joined
the Unesco pact. And it is silent on items that were exported
illegally under the laws of other countries but without violating
American import regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Vishakha N. Desai, the president of the museum directors'
association and the director of the Asia Society's galleries, at
Park avenue and 70th street, declined to predict how the code would
be changed, but said, ``I want this to be done within a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultural patrimony issue is thornier than it may appear, and
opinions on the subject vary widely. At one extreme are some
archaeologists who object to the removal of any object from any
excavation site lest it lose its context.
</P>
<P>
   At the other are dealers, collectors and curators of antiquities
who portray themselves as propagators of knowledge and preservers
of cultural objects that might be lost if left to the elements or
in the hands of countries too poor to guard or care for them.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: because of the flourishing trade in
antiquities, the plunder of ancient sites is growing, which
sometimes leaves museum directors in a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something is proven to be stolen, people are happy to
give it back,'' Ms. Desai said. ``But when it's a general claim
that if you have any object from this place, it must be stolen,
that's when it's difficult for institutions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before agreeing to return the 11th-century Indian sculpture, a
mother and child figure hewn from cream sandstone, which
Rockefeller's records show that he purchased from a London dealer,
Ms. Desai asked for proof that it was looted, which became clear
from old museum catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   She also asked for assurances that the sculpture would be well
taken care of and requested some logistical aid. ``We feel he
bought it in good faith,'' she said of Rockefeller, who died in
1978. ``So we asked the Indian government to pay for its return and
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture was on display at the Asia Society only
occasionally. ``It's a very fine piece, but it's not an exceptional
piece,'' said Ms. Desai, who declined to give a precise value but
estimated it would sell today for less than $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that patrimony problems are growing, she said, ``This
issue has not received the kind of attention that it should because
it was not as hot as Holocaust-era art.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the museum association, prompted by growing awareness
that museums may hold art that belonged to victims of World War II
looting, pledged last June to search their collections for such
works. Those searches are now in progress.

FAILED OPPORTUNITY AMID A SEARCH FOR DEMOCRACY

<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France - The partial agreement that Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright dismissed only days ago as unacceptable is
all she left with Tuesday as the Kosovo peace talks here ended.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the nature of high-wire diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, told skeptical reporters
that they were missing the big picture. The talks had not ended in
failure, he explained, despite the fact that neither of the warring
parties had signed a settlement. Rather, the talks had ended as a
vindication of democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovar Albanians, he said, had agreed to the settlement in
principle and wanted to sign it but had waited only because they
wanted to consult with their supporters back in Kosovo. ``They
won't sign until they go through a democratic process,'' Rubin
said. ``Those of us who support democracy have to respect that. We
believe in democracy, as we hope any reporter from a democratic
country would.''
</P>
<P>
   But as any reporter who has visited Kosovo could inform Rubin,
there is no democracy in Kosovo, just as the United States and its
allies could not impose a settlement for Kosovo in Rambouillet
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington view on the talks was generally harsh. ``We don't
have anything,'' said Ivo Daalder, visiting fellow at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank, and a foremr Bosnia
specialists with the National Security Council. ``We don't even
have a piece of paper because there is no signature. All we have is
a promise to negotiate on the implementation of an agreement that
no one has signed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to where we were in January, before the massacre --
back to shuttle diplomacy, back to trying to figure which plan will
be acceptable to which side,'' Daalder continued. ``Soon, we could
be back to war in the middle of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Daniel Serwer, senior fellow at the Washington-based US
Institute of Peace, ``The best you can say now is that this is very
odd. No one knows what to say, no one knows who won and who lost.
The one thing the US said going in that was absolutely necessary
was a complete agreement and the ground force to ensure it. They
have neither now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians, said Serwer, ``snatched defeat from the jaws of
victory'' by failing to sign immediately the political agreement
that would have given them leverage over the Serbs. And the Serbs
lost the opportunity to secure their sovereign hold over Kosovo for
at least the next three years and avert the possbility of NATO air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The western alliance, he added, is in disarray and may have lost
its best chance to stop war from breaking out in the heart of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Some were more sanguine about the prospects for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US and NATO got as much as they could have given that
there wasn't even a proper Kosovar delegation before Rambouillet,''
said Joseph V. Montville, director of preventive diplomacy at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``They bought some
time to work out the details, but there is a plausible end to the
fighting now.''
</P>
<P>
   According to international observers and human rights groups,
the Serbs shoulder most of the blame for the suffering in Kosovo.
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic unilaterally ended Kosovo's
autonomy in 1989, suspending local government, dismissing ethnic
Albanians out of state jobs and crushing Albanian culture and
language for those who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) flourished in that
repressive climate and last year launched a quixotic uprising
against the powerful Serbian security forces, who responded by
crushing the KLA and killing civilians where the KLA was in
control.
</P>
<P>
   The ``democratic consultation process'' to which Albright and
Rubin referred amounts to a group of self-appointed rebels deciding
if they can live with a deal that sidesteps their demand for an
independent Kosovo and calls for them to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   While the KLA undeniably has the support of most ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, it has never consulted ordinary Kosovars in
any meaningful way on its tactics, even though those tactics have
put civilians and their property in the crossfire of the KLA and
Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ethnic Albanians who have had the temerity to speak out
against the KLA have been murdered, or, as the KLA would put it,
summarily executed for collaborating with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But as the White House seeks to put a positive spin on the
desultory news here Tuesday, the fight over Kosovo is now about
democracy. What initially became an attempt to end the latest
bloodletting in the Balkans has become an effort to support the
democratic aspirations of the Kosovar Albanians over the despotic
inclinations of the bad boy of the Balkans, Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Albright conceded that she would have preferred the Kosovar
Albanians take ``a good deal,'' but she said that she respected
their request to consult with their people because it showed a
healthy appreciation for the very democratic values which the US
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Serbs agreed, all they'd have to do is make a phone
call'' to Milosevic, Albright added. But, she argued, the logistics
to gain consensus among the Kosovar Albanians is much more
complicated. As a result, Albright gave them until March 15 to
deliver their verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, under questioning, Rubin acknowledged that there really is
no deadline. The ``democratic consultation process'' is essentially
open-ended. Under questioning, neither Albright nor any other
representative of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans could
explain the mechanisms under which the Albanians will consult their
people, or how such a consultation would amount to a democratic
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright contends that the reluctance of the Kosovar
Albanians to sign a deal is understandable, similar reticence by
Milosevic is duplicitous. Milosevic, she said, ``failed to seize
this opportunity for progress. The Serbs moved forward as they saw
the Albanians move close to a yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin dismissed suggestions the Milosevic was laughing at the
Kosovar Albanians, who squandered a chance to keep the pressure on
him. ``President Milosevic may have woken up with a smile on his
face,'' he said, ``but he's going to sleep with a major headache.''
</P>
<P>
   The same, however, could be said for the White House and their
European allies.

ANALYSIS: SERBS CLAIM TALKS A SUCCESS, AND FEW DIPLOMATS DISAGREE

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The official Serbian news media played
Tuesday's ambiguous outcome of the Kosovo peace talks at
Rambouillet, France, as a considerable success for Belgrade, and
few diplomats here argued the point.
</P>
<P>
   Given the deep fractures within the ethnic Albanian delegation,
which required all of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
attention, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has had to make no
irrevocable decisions, despite weeks of intense Western pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having to face the choice of submission to American
dictates or knowing his territory would be bombed, Milosevic now
has another three weeks to think through the best outcome for
himself and his military.
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic's fundamental decisions have only been
postponed, one senior Western diplomat said, ``He will be seen as
having outwitted Washington for now, and that will help him at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has shown himself at least as reasonable as the ethnic
Albanians about a political settlement for Kosovo. And he has not
had to adjust his opening position _ that he will not allow foreign
troops into Kosovo, even though he is expected to do so later.
Kosovo is 90 percent ethnic Albanian but Milosevic considers the
province an integral part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic has said that, when
negotiations resume on March 15, the Serbs are ready to discuss
``an international presence in Kosovo'' to carry out political
arrangements of any agreement. And other Serbs have floated ideas
that include leavening Western forces with lots of Russians, whose
ethnic and religious ties make them more acceptable to the Serbs
and whose country is not a NATO member.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav deputy prime minister, Vuk Draskovic, a recent,
more liberal addition to the government, said on television on
Tuesday night that ``he has no objection to someone from abroad
helping us to implement the deal in Kosovo and helping to disarm''
the Kosovo Liberation Army, the insurgency fighting for Kosovo's
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his news media are already emphasizing that, under
any expected agreement, Kosovo would remain within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic will also be able to make the point that the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which the Serbs have been fighting since last
spring, may be more stubborn and more committed to independence,
rather than autonomy as a part of Serbia, than the United States
appeared to assume.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic thus reinforces his reputation as a shrewd tactician
and tweaker of superpower pretensions. He also avoids an early
strain within his own government _ especially with the
ultranationalist Radical Party leader, Voijislav Seselj, who
appeals to those who consider Kosovo the beating heart of Serb
nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Serbs, even those who are sophisticated in Western
ways and culture, feel some ``shame,'' as one Serbian official said
Tuesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity, ``that it will be
in our generation that we will lose Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   And Milosevic can avoid a budding conflict with Montenegro,
Yugoslavia's other republic, whose officials have said that they
would be ``neutral'' in any conflict between Belgrade and NATO.
Western officials think that Milosevic, who tends to rule from
crisis to crisis, will create a new one over relations with
Montenegro as soon as the Kosovo issue is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Tijanic, a former information minister who is the
chief editor of BK Television, an independent station, said that
Milosevic, as always, ``only takes into account his political
position, and makes decisions designed to strengthen and not
endanger himself, no matter what harm he does to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But what most concerns Western diplomats here _ and the foreign
ministers on Tuesday in Rambouillet _ is how hard Milosevic will
push the war against the rebels in Kosovo over the next three
weeks. Already, Serbian military and police movements in Kosovo
have upset Western officials, who say with justification that the
Serbs are violating last October's cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the officials then acknowledge that the rebels are
also provoking clashes with the Serbs, as both sides maneuver for
better positions on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It is this three-week limbo between peace conferences _ with the
threat of NATO air strikes lifted but no armed NATO peacekeepers on
the ground _ that one Western diplomat here called ``the most
interesting test yet of whether Milosevic wants to confront the
West or find a way to make himself a partner.''

EVERYONE'S TO BLAME BUT THE HOMETOWN HERO

<P>
   POZHAREVAC, Yugoslavia - At the smoky Tropicana cafe here in the
hometown of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, brawny men drink
thick Serbian coffee and talk. Most are unemployed. All complain
about the bad economy, the constant threat of a NATO air strike,
and the possibility that they will lose control over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And they all agree who to blame: America. Western media. A
U.S.-led, global conspiracy to destroy the long-suffering Serbs.
Anyone, it seems, but their local hero and national leader,
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is responsible for me not having a normal life,'' said
25-year-old Mirko Lazic, sporting a pistol in the back of his
jeans. ``We love American music, American movies. But when the
first bomb drops, you are going to end up in the cellar'' as a
hostage, he told an American reporter matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens here are ready to defend themselves and their famous
neighbors, the Milosevic family. The Yugoslav president and his
wife have a villa here, and their son, Marko, owns the Madona disco
_ the biggest disco in the Balkans, locals say.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of victimization among Serbs is as deep as their
defiance against the West. Here is a republic whose psyche remains
rooted in a lost battle against the Turks that occurred more than
600 years ago in its souther province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs suffered heavily during both world wars, when, they point
out with hurt looks, they sided with the United States. More
recently, they have lost wars with the previously-aligned republics
of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come you didn't help us when the Croats were slaughtering
us'' in the Croatian war of independence against Yugoslavia?
demanded Zoran Djordjevic, 30. ``Even then, they were against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's influence and size in the region has shrunk
dramatically and could diminish further if it loses control of
Kosovo. It still faces crippling economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Serbs complain with bafflement and menace, they are
being victimized both by the ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' who are
trying to wrest Kosovo for themselves and by the United States,
which the Serbs accuse of supporting the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear now that America, from the beginning, was an
advocate of Albanian separatism and terrorism,'' an angry Yugoslav
Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has portrayed the Serbs as ``animals, guilty
of everything,'' while the Albanian guerrillas have been presented
as ``victims and peaceful,'' he said. ``For the last few years,
Serbs have been punished severely for the program of Greater
Serbia. Now, you are punishing us again for the project of Greater
Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs here still seem baffled by the international criticism
levied against their government. During the reign of communist
leader Josep Broz ``Tito,'' Yugoslavia enjoyed good relations with
both the communist and capitalist worlds. Now, Yugoslavia has few
friends and many detractors in the world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the only way Americans can communicate with us, with
Tomahawks?'' asked Dejan Negic, 29. ``Can't they realize we are not
animals?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the conflict with the Kosovar Albanians exploded a year
ago, the Serbs have concluded that they are casualties of a massive
conspiracy against them. They insist that there is a powerful
Albanian lobby in Washington pulling strings at the White House and
the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs in Kosovo have blamed the deaths of Albanians on the
Kosovo Liberation Army, claiming that it is either weeding out
moderate Albanians or are killing its own to gain Western sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, this theory runs squarely into the face of hard
evidence to the contrary. When five Albanians were found in January
riddled with bullets on their tractor, the Serbian Minister of
Health, Labor and Social Services, Miodrag Kovac, described the
incident as a ``traffic accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Atrocities committed against Albanians in Kosovo were
``provoked,'' Draskovic said. He predicted that the Albanians --
given the 20-day rest before peace talks resume -- will
deliberately provoke the Serbs again by committing violence against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the state forces must react,'' Draskovic added. But
he is convinced that the West will then use this display of force
to justify more anti-Serb rhetoric and perhaps bombing. ``OK, bomb
us then,'' he said, slamming his fist on the table. ``We will
defend ourselves. Probably, we will lose.''

SHIFTING FUNDS WILL NOT KEEP SOCIAL SECURITY SOLVENT, BUDGET
EXPERTS WARN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Budget experts warned members of Congress on
Tuesday that President Clinton's plan to save Social Security would
not address the long-term structural problems of the retirement
system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed that over the next 15 years almost
two-thirds of the federal budget surplus be devoted to Social
Security, which is scheduled to fall short of funds by 2032.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration's proposal is not a simple cash infusion
to the retirement fund. Instead it involves a complicated budget
maneuver that would give Social Security more treasury securities,
which could eventually be redeemed to pay obligations to retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Experts testifying before the Senate Budget Committee said that
shifting funds did not address the central problem facing Social
Security _ that the payroll taxes earmarked to pay retirees'
benefits will be insufficient for the bulging baby boom population
as it ages.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller General David Walker told the senators that the
president's plan dodges the ``fundamental changes'' that must be
made to keep Social Security solvent. Those changes are likely to
be more painful than the president has proposed, such as increasing
the payroll taxes or reducing benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no free lunch,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker told the Senate panel that the president's plan also set
a dangerous precedent of using general tax revenues, rather than
the specially earmarked payroll tax, to fund Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes us away from an insurance concept to a welfare
concept,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker praised the part of the administration's plan that would
involve paying down the public debt, which would invigorate the
economy and give the government more ability to borrow in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others noted that the debt reduction would occur
regardless of whether the surplus was earmarked for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., agreed
with budget experts' assessment that the president's plan was
insufficient to address Social Security's long-term needs.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said the president had misled the country when he
boasted that his plan would save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he has put off reforming Social Security in a
meaningful way,'' Domenici said, noting that he and Texas
Republican Sen. Phil Gramm would soon unveil their own Social
Security plan.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats defended the president's plan as a beginning to extend
the life of the retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed with Clinton's insistence that most of the
surplus be earmarked for Social Security, saying that otherwise
future Congresses would be tempted to use it for tax cuts or
spending increases.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, also endorsed the proposal to set aside the
surplus for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is appropriate to set aside 62 percent of the
surplus until Social Security is saved,'' Archer said at a hearing.
``We have the resources, the economy is strong, and the time is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer also praised the president's proposal to use the stock
market to increase the retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a breakthrough. It is without precedent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Archer said he and the White House disagreed on how those
investments should be made. The Houston Republican opposes the
president's plan to let Social Security system officials invest a
portion of the retirement money in the market, arguing that it
would give the government too much control of private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Archer approves, however, of letting individuals invest their
retirement funds in the market, a concept that is included in the
president's budget. Clinton has proposed the USA accounts, which
would allocate a portion of the surplus for individual retirement
plans that could be invested in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said that ``while the USA plan doesn't in itself do
anything to save Social Security, it represents another potential
building block upon which we should make progress.''
</P>

GREENSPAN SAYS FED READY TO ADJUST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan told the US Senate
Tuesday that the economy's long-running expansion is at risk,
requiring the central bank to stand ready to move interest rates in
either direction.
</P>
<P>
   Fed watchers who read the tea leaves of Greenspan's twice-yearly
report to the Senate said the chairman would be more inclined to
raise interest rates than to lower them. However, Greenspan
signaled the agency is unlikely to do anything at the next meeting
of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee on March 30, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the chairman told us very clearly there will be no
change in interest rates one way or another for a good while,''
said Wall Street economist Allen Sinai of Primark Decision
Economics in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The general tenor of Greenspan's report to Congress was
positive, especially given he sees ``no evidence'' of inflation.
Indeed, threats to the economy derive from its strengths _ not
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan cited a tight labor market that may hike wages,
soaring stocks that could deflate, and high and potentially
unsustainable levels of household and corporate debt.
</P>
<P>
   As though to bolster the chairman's implicit concerns about a
``torrid'' rate of economic growth, consumer confidence rose in
February in response to record high levels of optimism about the
current environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, nobody has questioned at all that the dramatic
acceleration that we've seen in some technologies and the marked
increase in productivity and profitability of American businesses
has undoubtedly had a significant impact on underlying prices of
all capital assets, including equities,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautioned, ``After eight years of economic expansion,
the economy appears stretched in a number of dimensions, implying
considerable upside and downside risks to the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   If concerns grow, ``monetary policy must be ready to move
quickly in either direction,'' the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the economy expected to continue expanding early this
year, analysts said the Fed is more likely to increase rates to
cool it down. If rates do change, Greenspan ``indicated that odds
are when they do make a move it will be to higher rates,'' Sinai
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the bond market reacted negatively to news of a
firm interest rate policy for the foreseeable future. The yield on
30-year US Treasury bonds rose to 5.43 percent from 5.36 percent
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks ended down 8.26
points, closing at 9544.42.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar came under pressure after Greenspan told the Senate
Banking Committee the US currency could weaken if the US trade
deficit keeps rising. In a question and answer session, Greenspan
said he saw no evidence that foreign investors were less willing to
hold dollars. The trade deficit rose to a record $168.59 billion in
1998, as US demand continues to exceed consumption by sluggish
Asian and overseas economies.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar inched up to 120.95 Japanese yen, from 120.90 yen at
Monday's close, and retreated against the euro, which rose to
$1.1007 from $1.0969 after hitting a new low overnight at $1.0942.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's testimony followed news the economy grew 5.6 percent
in 1998's fourth quarter, and 3.9 percent for the full year. It was
a remarkable finish to a year in which financial crises unfolded
around the globe and threatened to lap at US shores.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan predicted Tuesday the ``economy's performance should
remain solid this year'' amid lower oil prices, and rising
productivity, due to investment in technology.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned oil prices ``are not likely to fall further,'' and
hinted at concerns about inflation, due to a labor shortage in many
markets.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual admission, the Fed chairman indicated that
aggressive rate cuts last fall _ three times in two months _ to
avert crisis may have been overdone.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan's stellar reputation on Wall Street remains
intact. Under his rein, the Fed was praised for acting decisively
last fall when Russia's economy sank and Long-Term Credit Bank ran
into deep trouble due to its wildly leveraged investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Between the end of September and mid-November, the Fed reduced
the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans to 4 3/4
percent, from 5 1/2 percent. For one of those reductions, Greenspan
moved without calling an FOMC meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan may be considering whether he should ``take back one
of those three-quarter-point cuts. That would bring the rate back
to 5 percent,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, who have for the most part given the economy its
kick, have showed no signs of slowing their spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, based on a
survey of 5,000 households, rose 3.2 points in February, closing at
132.1.
</P>
<P>
   One component of the index, which measures consumers' current
mood, climbed from 172.9 in January to a record 178.4 in February.
It was the highest since the board began the survey 32 years ago.

 &HT;    Turner South to showcase region on cable
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting today is expected to announce plans for a
new cable TV channel called Turner South, its first new
entertainment channel in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South will be launched this fall and feature 24 hours of
movies, sitcoms, regional news and sports geared toward a Southern
audience. Initially, most of the programming will come from the
vast film and TV library of Turner Broadcasting, now a unit of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   But the channel also plans to show original programming. It has,
for example, developed a one-hour show in partnership with the
magazine Southern Living.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South is the first new entertainment channel launched by
the Atlanta-based programming giant since its purchase by Time
Warner three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The channel is to be formally announced today at a 10 a.m. news
conference at the company's Techwood campus in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is launching its new channel at a difficult time. New
channels are scrapping to find distribution among cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Turner South will not be announced today with any
distribution deals. Today, most new channels begin life on direct
broadcast satellite services such as DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Turner Broadcasting is nothing if not tenacious. Its last
new entertainment channel, Turner Classic Movies, was launched five
years ago and has only recently began to reach a critical mass of
30 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South will feature games by the Atlanta Braves, Hawks and
the new hockey franchise, the Thrashers. All teams are owned by
Turner Broadcasting. Their games are now aired on Turner
Broadcasting cable channels TBS and TNT, as well as on other
channels such as ESPN and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the strategy behind Turner South is to recoup games,
especially for the Braves, that have been lost to other channels
over the years through changing contracts with the leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South would be the first regional entertainment channel,
although there are several regional sports channels. But what the
channel really represents is a new spin on an old idea at its
parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting began more than 25 years ago with the
satellite broadcast of Channel 17 as the TBS SuperStation. It
became one of the first cable TV channels and reached viewers
across the nation but especially in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Ted Turner conceived TBS as a way to bring baseball and
other shows to small towns in the South without a lot of choice in
TV programming.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years TBS has evolved into a channel with broad
appeal and more than 70 million subscribers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting executives began to feel that the regional
market was going unmet. Recent marketing studies by the company
confirmed that there was still a demand for a ``Southern'' channel.

 &HT;    Turner builds new hi-tech studio
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting is more than half done with the
construction of a new production studio on its Techwood campus,
company officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The facility, to be called Turner Studios, is expected to be the
largest all-digital production studio on the East Coast when
completed early next year. Construction on the $37 million building
began about one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said it would take two years to complete and we are right
now on schedule or a little bit ahead,'' said Turner Broadcasting
spokeswoman Terry Cerisoles.
</P>
<P>
   The new facility is adjacent to the home of the company's
entertainment cable TV channels, which include TBS, TNT, Cartoon
Network and Turner Classic Movies. There are three other buildings
on this campus, two of which have been built in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The 127,000-square-foot studio, the shell of which is nearly
completed, will serve these entertainment channels. It will be
equipped with $15 million in digital recording and editing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The building will actually house three studios, a four-story
tower and a post-production unit. Its digital facilities will be
largely used to film promos and lead-ins to the company's many
entertainment shows. Most of the company's original content will
continue to be filmed in Los Angeles and on location around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The studio will also enable the company to produce HDTV shows
and translate old shows into this new format, expected to become
the standard in the next decade. HDTV is a digital form of
television that is much sharper than current standards.
</P>
<P>
   Wiring of the building is expected to begin in June or July,
says Cerisoles, with completion due sometime in January 2000.

LIBERTY MAY CANCEL PURCHASE OF SOCIETE GENERALE MANAGEMENT UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Liberty Financial Cos. is considering canceling its
plan to acquire the ailing US mutual fund unit of French bank
Societe Generale SA, sources familiar with the troubled transaction
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The disintegration of the deal, sealed only six months ago,
comes amid a dizzying decline in the unit's assets due to troubled
overseas markets and investor uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is valid to say the company (Liberty) is considering
calling the deal off,'' one person close to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling may prompt legal action from a spurned Societe
Generale, according to a second source close to the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Saying only ``the closing has not gone through,'' Societe
Generale spokesman Justin Lamont declined to elaborate. Liberty
spokesman Hal Thayer also declined to comment, citing
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Liberty's agreement last August to buy New
York-based Societe Generale Asset Management Corp. for $216 million
was supposed to be a match made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty, a group of eight financial services firms, would have
gained a marquee money manager in prominent international investor
Jean-Marie Eveillard, who overseas the six Societe Generale mutual
funds, which focus on international stocks and bonds. Eveillard
would have gained marketing muscle and, presumably, new business
for his funds, which at the time of the deal had $5.2 billion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was viewed as further evidence of the premium that
asset management firms, especially those with a renowned head, can
command in an era of consolidating financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Then Russia collapsed in August, barely a year after Asia's
turmoil began. World markets were roiled.
</P>
<P>
   Returns at Societe Generale funds, once among the highest flyers
around, sank. Panicked investors yanked out cash, helping cut the
funds' total assets nearly in half to $2.8 billion. Hard hit was
the flagship SoGen International fund, which had $4.4 billion in
assets in September 1997, its peak, but has since seen redemptions
of $1.5 billion, including over $800 million last year, according
to Morningstar Inc. Today the fund, which Eveillard has run for two
decades, has only $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The degree of decline has been such that I'm not sure you
could make this deal work,'' one financial source said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty had cautioned last November, when outflows at Societe
Generale accelerated, that it might use its contractual option to
pay less for the firm. The contract requires Societe Generale to
meet certain asset level benchmarks if the deal is to go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what Liberty wanted, but the company had protection
and is choosing to use it,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty declined to assume administrative functions of the
Societe Generale funds last week, signaling that the agreement was
in trouble. Under the terms of the contract, Liberty has until
March 31 to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Eveillard, 59, for three decades one of the world's best known
investors in undervalued overseas companies, has seen his
often-lucrative investing style suffer in recent years. An
adventurous, go-anywhere investor, he will buy international bonds
or hold cash if he can't find stocks he likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until two or three years ago, he had done quite well,'' said
Morningstar analyst Hap Ryans. Explaining how an investor whose
funds had double-digit returns in previous years could be punished
for being out of favor with the market, Ryans called the
agreement's unraveling a reflection of ``the what have you done for
me lately school of investing.''
</P>
<P>
   While other asset management deals have been known to collapse _
Nationwide Financial Services's failed bid for Pilgrim Baxter &AMP;
Associates is a recent example _ agreements that are made public
and then flop are relatively rare, according to industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty's step back hurts not just Eveillard, who reportedly
owns around 20 percent of the firm he heads; it is also a
disappointment for Liberty, which wants to expand its fund
offerings at a time when competition is keen for prime fund firms.
Liberty, whose holdings include The Colonial Group Inc. and
Steinroe &AMP; Farnham Inc., derives around two thirds of its business
from its Keyport Life Insurance Co. unit. Liberty oversees $61
billion in assets.

 &HT;    WITH CORDIAL MEETING, CLINTON AND CONGRESS RETURN TO POLICY
 &HT;    460&AMP;adds.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton played host to congressional
Republican and Democratic leaders Tuesday at an Oval Office coffee,
muffling any lingering impeachment rancor with the restorative
rhetoric of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the two parties disagreed over key issues such as tax
cuts and the future of Social Security, though they found the
beginnings of common ground in each area.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long effort to unseat Clinton, however, did not come up
during the businesslike 90-minute meeting _ a testament to the
remarkable recuperative powers of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job here in Washington is to do the people's business, and
that's what we're going to do,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., who voted less than two weeks ago to remove Clinton
from office. ``We're going to work together, hopefully across the
party lines, in the Congress and with the administration, to do
what the American people expect of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoed House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., ''We are starting
to work to put together ideas, and that's the first step'' toward
restoring working relations between the White House and the
Republican majorities in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to do that,'' Hastert said. ``And we are
going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked before the meeting how he could sit down peaceably and go
to work with those who tried to end his presidency, Clinton said it
was simply part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all took an oath, and I think we intend to follow it,''
Clinton said. ''We owe it to the American people, and I'm looking
forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., agreed that the atmospherics were
encouraging at the session, the first bipartisan leadership meeting
at the White House in 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a good thing to do,'' said Daschle. ``We ought
to do it more frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned repeatedly on the subject of trust, both Lott and
Hastert refused to declare their faith in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I trust,'' Lott responded at one point. ``I
trust the ability of the people, here in the Congress, in the
government, to work together to do what we need to do for the
people. That's where the real trust should be, the trust in us
doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said, however, that a mixture of trust and necessity
led the Republicans to sit down with Clinton so quickly after his
Senate acquittal to try to map out the legislative future together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the meeting is a sign of trust. I think they want to
work with him,'' Gephardt said. ``They realize that if they're to
get the people's business done, they have to work with the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting, which also included House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, R-Texas, was not all backslaps and handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Most talk was devoted to Clinton's proposal to set aside 62
percent of the anticipated federal budget surplus over the next 15
years to shore up the Social Security program, and another 15
percent to buttress Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans have expressed some support for Clinton's
Social Security proposal, the party also regards a huge budget
surplus as something to be corrected through tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While the party is divided over how to structure such a cut,
Republicans are united behind the position that much of the
anticipated surplus _ projected to top $4.4 trillion over 15 years
_ should be returned to the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is the American taxpayer is overtaxed,'' said
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Lott advocated a 10 percent across-the-board cut in income
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a 30-year-old young person working, with a college
degree, and you make $32,000 a year, a 10 percent tax rate cut
would mean about a $500-a-year
</P>
<P>
   increase in being able to keep the money you earn,'' said Lott.
``I think that's attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said he opposed the proposal for two reasons. First, he
said, it would jeopardize Clinton's vision of setting aside the
vast majority of the anticipated surplus to shore up Social
Security and Medicare. Second, he said, 80 percent of the benefits
of such a cut would accrue to the top 20 percent of income tax
payers, the relatively wealthy Americans who least need such
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats prefer targeted tax relief, aimed primarily at
lower-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed, for instance, a half-trillion dollars in
tax relief, over 15 years, in the form of subsidized savings
accounts for low-income and moderate-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Democrats would negotiate with Republicans over
some types of targeted tax relief _ such as a small cut to correct
the ``marriage penalty,'' or the extra taxes a married couple pays
compared to two single people with the came income. In exchange, he
said, Republicans should support a $1-an-hour increase in the
minimum wage, now $5.15 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said he saw other opportunities for bipartisan
cooperation as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if the speaker would schedule a patients' bill
of rights, a minimum wage increase, and campaign finance reform in
the next month, we could get all three of those measures passed in
a bipartisan way,'' said Gephardt. ``And I hope that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Privately, aides described the meeting as a mostly formal, but
not awkward, return to business for politicians divided over the
past year about how to respond to a sex-and-deception scandal
relished by few members of either party on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some element of weariness to this,'' said a Democratic
aide. ''We're happy to get back to what we all came here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And while many Americans find it hard to understand how
politicians could so quickly make peace after such spirited
division, career campaigners insist that burying past grudges is
part of the turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're professionals,'' said the aide, who spoke on
background. ``They're hired to do a job.''

ANTI-CANCER DRUG APPEARS HEADED FOR HUMAN TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ The most closely watched experimental cancer
drug in decades, endostatin, is being made in large quantities,
appears to have no toxic effects on monkeys, and should enter its
first human tests later this year, a scientist from EntreMed Inc.,
the drug's developer, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to ask the US Food and Drug Administration in
the second half of 1999 for permission to begin initial safety
tests in a few dozen human patients, said B. Kim Lee Sim, an
EntreMed research official who briefed scientists at a meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making the drug in kilogram quantities to supply our
human trials,'' said Sim. The endostatin has been made to proper
specifications and is ready for Phase I clinical tests, which are
designed only to demonstrate safety, not that the drug can combat
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sim said that monkeys given a single injection of a massive dose
of endostatin showed no ill effects. But that doesn't mean that
adverse side effects may not be encountered in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The Phase I tests could take a year or more, said Dr. Joanna C.
Horobin, an EntreMed vice president. Although Phase I trials are
officially only to evaluate safety, researchers look for hints that
a drug may be having some desirable effect.
</P>
<P>
   But Horobin said it may be difficult to tell from early testing
whether endostatin works. Unlike conventional cancer drugs,
endostatin starves tumors by destroying the blood vessels that feed
them. Such drugs, known as angiogenesis inhibitors, may not kill
tumors, but could keep them in check for years. Thus, standard
yardsticks for evaluating cancer drugs may not apply to the new
drugs, say researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if it didn't show any effects in Phase I trials, we still
would probably go on'' to expanded Phase II testing involving many
more patients, said Horobin at the meeting here on angiogenesis
drugs, sponsored by the Institute for International Research.
</P>
<P>
   Although as many as 30 angiogenesis inhibitors are already in
early human testing in the United States and Europe, many cancer
patients and the general public have focused on endostatin and
another blood vessel inhibitor, angiostatin, because they have
demonstrated astonishing potency in mouse tests, shrinking massive
tumors to the vanishing point. No other angiogenesis inhibitors
showed such stunning potency in animal tests.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders in the angiogenesis field said these less-potent
drugs could prove very useful, by slowing a cancer's growth and
lengthening and improving the quality of a patient's life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike conventional cancer drugs that attack tumor cells with
toxic effects that unavoidably harm normal tissue, angiogenesis
inhibitors are targeted at the tumor's blood vessels, and seem to
have many fewer side-effects than standard drugs, such as nausea,
hair loss and effects on bone marrow. If so, they would likely be
given over long periods to keep cancers under control, probably
with radiation or other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 25 or 30 years we'll be looking at cancer as a chronic
disease, like arthritis,'' said Dr. Peter Polverini, a longtime
angiogenesis researcher from the University of Michigan Dental
School.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin and angiostatin are fragments of larger proteins made
naturally in the body. Discovered in the Boston laboratory of Dr.
Judah Folkman at Children's Hospital, endostatin and angiostatin
are part of an enormously complex group of substances that regulate
the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenenis), which occurs in
early development of the fetus, and in later life in wound healing
and the reproductive functions of the female uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two drugs, endostatin has become the front-runner because
it has proven easier to manufacture. Last week, Bristol Myers
Squibb said it was abandoning work on angiostatin for now because
after spending millions of dollars, the firm has not been able to
make the drug in large quantitites with consistent effects.
</P>
<P>
   But Sim of EntreMed, based in Rockville, Md., said that her
company remains optimistic about angiostatin and is continuing its
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using a different system'' from that of Bristol Myers,
yielding a smaller form of the angiostatin, and ``it is on a
parallel path'' to endostatin but is not as far along, said Sim.

CLINTON, GOP LEADERS VOW TO WORK TOGETHER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Republican leaders in
Congress pledged Tuesday to set aside impeachment rancor and work
together on key issues as the two sides met at the White House for
the first time in 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress returned to Washington after a weeklong
break following the Feb. 12 Senate vote to acquit Clinton of House
impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all took an oath and I think we intend to follow it. We owe
it to the American people, and I'm looking forward to it,'' Clinton
told reporters as congressional leaders from both parties sat on
either side of him.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said later they too wanted to find common
ground for this legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, the
Republican leaders joined Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., for the
first bipartisan session at the White House since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The breach between the White House and the Republican leadership
began before the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, back to the budget
battles of 1997. A White House official said the ``problem was not
from our end'' and that Clinton was willing to meet with the
Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job here in Washington is to do the people's business, and
that's what we're going to do. We're going to work together,
hopefully across the party lines in Congress, and with the
administration to do what the American people expect of us,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who voted to convict Clinton and remove him from office,
has been outspoken since the vote in criticizing the president and
expressing his lack of trust in Clinton. But Lott repeatedly
refused to answer a question about whether he now trusts the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I trust. I trust the ability of the people
here in the Congress, in the government, to work together to do
what we need to do for the people. That's where the real trust
should be, the trust in us doing the job,'' Lott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hastert's first meeting with Clinton as the House
speaker. He assumed the top House role in December after the
resignations by Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., both victims of the Lewinsky scandal. Gingrich
resigned following lackluster Republican election results in
November and Livingston stepped aside after acknowledging
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   During the White House session, which lasted more than an hour,
the president pressed Lott and Hastert to save 62 percent of the
government's expected surplus for Social Security and 15 percent
for Medicare reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders offered no promises but have made clear
they already are rethinking the 10 percent across-the-board tax cut
the party was trumpeting as the centerpiece of its legislative
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 15 House moderates and some conservatives have balked
at an across-the-board tax cut, considering it unlikely to pass or
too expensive. They now favor limited tax cuts targeted to the
marriage penalty or other, more modest areas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans only have an 11-seat majority in the House, making
it more difficult for House leaders to pass legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of types of tax cuts on the menu,'' Hastert said
when asked about the prospect of a 10 percent tax cut. ``Some
people are talking about across-the-board tax cut. There's marriage
penalty. There's reduction for the earnings test on seniors in
Social Security. There's a lot of things we're looking at. And I
think whatever we do, it's going to be part of a mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders said after the meeting that Republicans must
make a ``threshold decision'' to save 77 percent of the surplus for
Social Security and Medicare. They contended that an
across-the-board tax cut would make it impossible to save the
surplus for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle maintained the Democrats also supported targeted tax
cuts such as those for long-term health care, child care and
Clinton's proposed USA Accounts for a retirement tax credit.
``Those kinds of things are essential and we're going to be
spending a lot of effort and working with our Republican colleagues
to make that happen,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt challenged Hastert to bring up the dormant patient bill
of rights, a minimum wage increase and campaign finance reform all
within the next month. ``We could get all three of those measures
passed in a bipartisan way,'' Gephardt predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Clinton made clear to the Republicans during the
meeting that he hoped they would endorse his ideas for the surplus
in the next few weeks so they could begin work on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   After their White House session, both Republican and Democratic
leaders attended the closing session of the National Governors'
Association meeting. Governors of both parties have asked Congress
to return to some semblance of civility that was missing during the
impeachment debate in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Thomas Carper, D-Del., chairman of the NGA, said he sensed
``a new civility'' since the governors have been in town and noted
the governors demonstrated that their respectful exchanges are
``the way the people of our nation expect us to address our
business and to conduct theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Leavitt, R-Utah, said he hoped the governors meeting
``contributed to the momentum to a new period of civility in
Washington. I hope that that continues for at least a period so
that we can get some of the things done that so badly need to be
done before we get into a period of what will undoubtedly be hard
campaigning to dictate our direction.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The celebrations of Paul Robeson continue on
Wednesday night on ``American Masters,'' an illuminating if
worshipful two-hour biography of a once contentious figure in
process of rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of what has gone before during the year of his
centennial, ``Paul Robeson: Here I Stand'' is meant to do justice
to a man who was treated most unjustly by his own country's
officials even as he was acclaimed around the world for his voice,
his acting and his commitment to what many at the time saw as the
struggle against fascism and on behalf of the so-called common man.
</P>
<P>
   But as in the other tributes, the political part of his career
continues to cast a shadow: his unwavering support of Stalinism is
explained and excused as a reaction to racism and exploitation in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the anti-communist passions that blasted Robeson's
career in the 1950s have long since subsided and a cadre of
revisionist historians now hold that Stalin was less malicious than
advertised, some viewers may still be left wondering how to square
Robeson's stand for human rights in so many places with his support
for the Soviet state during the era of the gulag.
</P>
<P>
   The program, to be shown on PBS at 9 p.m. in the New York area,
duly records Robeson's athletic and academic accomplishments at
Rutgers University, where he won every available honor.
</P>
<P>
   His successful but complicated movie career is perceptively
scrutinized. Most of his screen roles, adapted to the formulas of
the Hollywood studios of the 1920s and '30s with their Stepin
Fetchit stereotypes, remain embarrassments. Yet we see moments
Wednesday night when the man's physical presence manages to defeat
the demeaning material.
</P>
<P>
   In his popular recordings, particularly of spirituals and folk
songs, Robeson awakened generations to their heritage and
entertained millions more. By the 1930s, he was an international
star. His biographer, Martin Duberman, reports that in 1940,
``Robeson was the most famous black man in America.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage in the early 1940s, his tour de force as Othello _ a
black man making love to and murdering a white woman _ is recalled
by his Desdemona, Uta Hagen. She remembers him less for his ability
as an actor than for their affair, which, in a deliciously
Shakespearean twist, roused the justified suspicions of Jose
Ferrer, her husband and the play's Iago.
</P>
<P>
   Although his Othello was a hit, it was not his acting that
brought Robeson worldwide fame, but his music, which resounds
through these two hours and which he used as a political weapon. By
this account, it was a visit to the Soviet Union that began his
abiding affection for that land as the champion of socialism and
equality.
</P>
<P>
   The reminiscences of old comrades like Howard Fast and Pete
Seeger and younger followers like Harry Belafonte recapture the
enthusiasm he stirred among what his son, Paul Robeson Jr., calls
``progressive'' audiences.
</P>
<P>
   During his Popular Front phase, he toured the Loyalist lines of
Spain's civil war and sold war bonds in America. In an effort to
explain how his father could sympathize with Soviet Jewish
intellectuals after World War II yet utter no criticism of their
top persecutor, Stalin, the younger Robeson says, ``His was a world
of relative evils.''
</P>
<P>
   For the politically like-minded, the voice and the ideology came
powerfully together. When in 1950, during the height _ or depths _
of the nation's anti-communist zeal, Robeson's passport was taken
away, he was demonized by Communist hunters (though he was never
shown to be a party member) and he was acclaimed by elements of the
left as a martyr. The return of his passport in 1958 came too late
to reinvigorate his career or his health, and his final years were
marked by depression and seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Robeson's name may be dimly remembered, if at all, by
many viewers. Except perhaps for those still carrying on the wars
of the 1950s, the arguments over his politics have become a
footnote to a remarkable American odyssey; the politics seem now
less interesting than the man himself, so true to his convictions
yet so blind to reality.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's program, being a birthday party, tries to
avoid the discomfort of Robeson's affinity for a totalitarian
state. It's the sort of occasion at which one celebrant can speak
of the 1948 Progressive Party, that instrument of old-left relics,
as being a broad political coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of the admirers assembled here and the family
members who cooperated with the producers, ``Robeson'' turns the
camera and the soundtrack on its hero's accomplishments as a
performer, his courage in defying authority and what he still means
for those who remember his glory days.

CLINTON, CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TALK ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton met for the first time Tuesday
with House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republican leaders who
had sought to remove the president from office, as both sides
attempted to show they can work together despite lingering bruises
from the impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee and pastries in the Oval Office, Clinton, the GOP
leaders, and their Democratic counterparts, laid out competing
visions for using projected budget surpluses and shoring up Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   While a Clinton aide said impeachment was not discussed during
the hourlong meeting, it is clear the issue has severely damaged
the already tenuous relationship between Clinton and Republicans in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate voted 11 days ago to acquit Clinton, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott called the president untrustworthy.
Tuesday, while not backing down from that earlier assessment, the
Mississippi Republican skirted the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I trust. I trust the ability of the people,
here in the Congress, in the government, to work together to do
what we need to do for the people,'' Lott told reporters after the
White House meeting. ``That's where the real trust should be, the
trust in us doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, a Republican from Illinois, also avoided answering
whether he trusted Clinton. ``We are starting to work to put
together ideas, and that's the first step,'' he said. After that,
``we can frame the debate, so we can move forward for what the
agenda is for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart said Clinton
considered the bipartisan meeting with congressional leaders, his
first in 19 months, ``constructive,'' and he said the atmosphere
was good. Lockhart said the president thinks the best way to regain
the trust of Capitol Hill is to work with lawmakers on issues
Americans care about.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton said at the start of the meeting, ``We all
took an oath, and I think we intend to follow it. We owe it to the
American people, and I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Lott and Hastert at the White House were House Majority
Leader Richard K. Armey, Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle
and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   After a 13-month sex scandal that resulted in Clinton's
impeachment by the House but acquittal by the Senate, Gephardt said
it was time to turn to legislative issues. ``We just need to get on
it and get it done, and start making progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans and the White House share some of the same
priorities _ using part of the budget surplus to shore up Social
Security, finding ways to fix Medicare and improve education _
their approaches differ.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Clinton want to use 77 percent of the budget
surplus to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare, and for
targeted middle-class tax credits, military pay raises and other
new government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, on the other hand, want to return some of the
surplus to taxpayers in an across-the-board tax cut, though some
GOP moderates are beginning to back away from that idea because of
the political risk of supporting a tax cut that Democrats claim
would benefit the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of types of tax cuts on the menu,'' said
Hastert. ``Some people are talking about an across-the-board tax
cut. There's marriage penalty. There's reduction for earnings tests
in seniors and Social Security. There's a lot of things that we're
looking at.''

TV NOTES: STRONG NUMBERS FOR NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the usual gloomy talk about fickle television watchers who
incessantly flip to cable channels, February so far has brought at
least some good cheer to each of the six broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Stephen King mini-series, ``Storm of the Century,'' stood
up to the powerful competition from NBC better than expected on
Thursday, even up against the much advertised episode of NBC's
``ER'' in which George Clooney made his final appearance as Dr.
Ross. Although the 12.0 household rating for ``Storm'' (each rating
points equals 994,000 homes) was modest, it raised ABC to a 10.6
average household rating for the night, its best Thursday rating in
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   NBC still clobbered the competition, with above-average numbers
for its entire lineup, topped off by a 23.8 household rating, a 37
share (percentage of sets in use) and more than 35.7 million
viewers for ``ER'' (nearly twice the 19.1 million who watched
``Storm'').
</P>
<P>
   Together, ABC, NBC and Fox, with a special called ``World's Most
Shocking Medical Videos,'' helped increase overall broadcast
viewing by more than 10 share points; 71 percent of all television
sets in use were tuned to broadcast networks, rather than the usual
60 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABC deserves credit because they gambled'' in scheduling Part
3 of their King mini-series against ``ER,'' said Marc Berman of
Seltel Inc., a consultant to television stations who follows
ratings patterns closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves that despite all the talk of network erosion, if the
networks are aggressive and find the right programming, people will
watch,'' Berman added. ``They'll watch less cable. They'll come
back to the networks if given the right mix of program choices.''
</P>
<P>
   David Poltrack, executive vice president for research at CBS,
agreed. ``In this new environment of broadcast shares of 60, with
40 percent of the people wandering all over the place,'' he said,
``there is enough noncommitted audience out there to bring you a
significant gain on a given night, regardless of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Larry Hyams, Poltrack's counterpart at ABC, said that
Thursday's main message to him was that ``Stephen King has a very
loyal audience that tuned in for his mini-series and stayed with it
no matter what the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the mini-networks, WB and UPN, had sweeps success stories.
For UPN, it was a two-hour special episode of ``Star Trek:
Voyager'' on Feb. 17 that pulled the network's best household and
young-adult ratings in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   For WB, it was an early-sweeps event, the Feb. 8 episode of
``Seventh Heaven,'' in which twins are born to the family. It
became the first WB show ever to break into the top 50 for a week
(it was 35th), with a 7.3 rating that was a record for the network.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come in the sweeps: CBS has the Grammy Awards on
Wednesday night with Rosie O'Donnell as host; NBC has its
special-effects-laden new version of ``Alice in Wonderland'' on
Sunday, and ABC has perhaps the most talked-about special event of
all, Barbara Walters' two-hour interview with Monica Lewinsky,
scheduled for next Wednesday night at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Not Choosing Suicide
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, ``60 Minutes'' provoked a hornet's nest of debate by
showing a videotape of Thomas Youk's death from fatal doses of
drugs administered by Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the crusader for
legalizing assisted suicide. This Sunday, ``60 Minutes'' will
present another side of that story: five people who have Lou
Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as Youk did but
who have chosen to live and cope with it.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hewitt, the executive producer of the CBS magazine program,
said he and Mike Wallace, the correspondent on the report, had been
deluged with calls and mail from friends of people with Lou
Gehrig's disease, urging that those people's stories be broadcast,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Mike and I were on Larry King's show,'' Hewitt said,
referring to the CNN host's talk show, last Nov. 30, about a week
after the Kevorkian report. ``And someone called in and said, `Did
you ever think about finding people who opt to live and not die?'
And we said right then on the air, `That's a very good idea.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is the correspondent on this report, too. Hewitt said he
was not trying to make amends for showing the Kevorkian videotape.
``No, I was listening to our viewers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``Inasmuch as the Kevorkian story caused such a
rumpus, we decided we owed it to them to look at the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Alphabetical Oscars
</P>
<P>
   Turner Classic Movies, eager to show off its extensive
collection of vintage films, always makes March all-Oscar month:
nothing but Academy Award-nominated movies or movies with
Oscar-nominated performers for 31 days, 24 hours a day. Now in its
fifth year, the young cable network is giving the Oscar theme a
twist this time: Oscars from A to Z.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, with ``Above and Beyond'' (1953) at 6 a.m., the
network will schedule its assorted Oscar oddities in alphabetical
order for the rest of the month, ending with the 1969 Costa-Gavras
thriller ``Z,'' of course.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one exception: Turner couldn't find an
Oscar-nominated film whose official title started with the letter
X.

 &HT;    BUSH QUIETLY PREPS FOR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 28, 1999.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For weeks now, David Beckwith has felt a lot like a
character in a Samuel Beckett play, his eyes upon Texas, looking
for signs that George W. Bush, the state's governor, possibly the
most popular Republican in the country, had decided to seek the
GOP's 2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot like 'Waiting for Godot','' said Beckwith, who
served in the presidency of the governor's father, George H.W.
Bush. ``So many people have been holding fire, waiting to see what
the governor was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the main characters in Beckett's play, two vagrants
who never really do anything beyond the trivial, the governor of
Texas has quietly laid the groundwork for a presidential campaign,
even as he has kept so many in the GOP ranks _ like Beckwith _
guessing about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   While the national media has been focused almost exclusively on
the impeachment trial of President Clinton, Bush has successfully
wooed commitments from an impressive array of campaign ``players,''
from grassroots organizers in such key states as Iowa and New
Hampshire to financial rainmakers on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the popular perception that Bush is losing ground
to other candidates (by waiting), the hidden story is how
extensively his agents are lining up supporters behind the
scenes,'' said Larry Sabato, an expert on presidential elections at
the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Eight other Republicans also have been recruiting campaign
aides: former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, abortion foe Gary
Bauer, former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, magazine
publisher Steve Forbes, Ohio Congressman John Kasich, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, former Vice President Dan Quayle and Sen. Bob
Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But none has come close to corralling the caliber of campaign
players that are waiting in the wings for Bush. And none has
anything approaching the unprecedented bandwagons of Congress
members, governors and state legislators who have pledged their
support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The only misstep by Bush so far was his failure to sign Steve
Grubbs, an outgoing state party chairman, to organize Iowa. Iowa is
scheduled to host the first voting - in local caucuses - in the
presidential contest next February. Forbes snatched away Grubbs
even as Grubbs and Bush representatives were negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fortunes in Iowa will rest with Thurman Gaskill, a state
senator who is a longtime friend of the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, which hosts the nation's first presidential
primary, Bush is hoping to win over the state's other senator, Judd
Gregg, and former Gov. Steve Merritt. Both supported the governor's
father in 1988 and 1992, but they both are also close to the
party's 1996 nominee, Bob Dole, and are remaining uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   Fundraising is not one of Bush's weaknesses. He has commitments
from Bush presidential campaign veterans Mel Sembler of Florida,
Wayne Berman of Washington and Heinz Prechter of Michigan to help
raise money. He also has lined up Californians Howard Leach of San
Franciso, Alex Spanos and Gerald Parsky of San Diego, Brad Freeman
of Los Angeles and Tim Draper from Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, his uncle, Jonathan Bush, an investment banker, is
ready to help pull money out of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The one piece that will complete the puzzle is a top-notch
strategist, and many political experts expect former Christian
Coalition executive director Ralph Reed to sign on with the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signing up Reed will be equivalent to the New York Yankees
acquiring Roger Clemens,'' said Darrell West, a political scientist
at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Kasich, widely regarded as a second tier
candidate, is the one rival who has assembled a campaign
organization that rivals Bush's in credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich has one of the party's best known pollsters, Ed Goeas. He
has a veteran communications director, Ed Gillespie. Among his
fundraisers are Jim Rappaport, chairman of the Massachusetts GOP.
In Iowa, he has Karen Slifka, a rising star in state politics,
organizing the state. And in New Hampshire, he's got Bruce Berke, a
veteran of Reagan, Bush and Dole campaigns, and Rep. John Sununu,
the son of the former governor.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who runs closest to Bush in the polls, has
surrounded herself with veterans of her husband's campaigns: Robert
Davis, a Washington lawyer; Mari Maring Will, the communications
director for the Dole '96 campaign; consultant Melinda Farris and
Stewart McLaurin, who supervises her office in Washington.
Agribusiness giant Dwayne Andreas, a longtime friend, is expected
to lend a fundraising hand. Dole also is wooing New York consultant
Kieran Mahoney, a longtime adviser to former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who relied on personal wealth and media buys in his 1996
campaign, is paying more attention to the ground game this time
around. In addition to signing Grubbs in Iowa, he has the backing
of Bobbie Gobel, the head of the Iowa Christian Coalition, and
Nancy Streck, Pat Buchanan's organizer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign chairman is former Sen. Warren Rudman of New
Hampshire, a popular figure in the Granite State. He also has a
fundraising whiz, Carla Eudy, and some of the best known
strategists in the GOP: Kenneth Duberstein, Michael Deaver and Vin
Weber.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has the backing of former Gov. Terry Branstad in Iowa.
And his fundraiser is Ted Welch, a prodigious former fundraiser for
the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle and Bauer probably have the closest thing to grassroots
organizations. Quayle's campaign is fueled by the work of Campaign
America, the political action committee formerly run by Bob Dole
and the source of $6 million in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also has an experienced campaign director, Kyle
McSlarrow, who worked in the Senate majority leader's office under
Bob Dole and Trent Lott after running unsuccessfully for Congress
in Virginia. And Quayle has the backing of former New Hampshire
Governor and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is counting on grassroots anti-abortion voters to power
his campaign. In the last election cycle, his political action
committee raised $7 million, largely on small donations. In
addition, he has raised $15 million for the Family Research
Council, the nonprofit organization he has headed for 10 years.

 &HT;    Health care and Internet key topics at expo
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Click on health.
</P>
<P>
   The junction of Internet and health care is the crossroads
between the nation's fastest-growing medium and the largest _ and
perhaps most problematic _ sector of America's $6 trillion-a-year
economy.
</P>
<P>
   With health care representing about 14 percent of that economy,
technology is already a major part of the industry. Attesting to
that union are the approximately 17,000 attendees in Atlanta at the
annual health care Information Management Systems Society. On the
exhibit floor are representatives of nearly 500 companies that
apply software, computer and networking to the delivery or
management of health care.
</P>
<P>
   But the hottest trend is the use of the Net. Just ask the folks
at WebMD, perhaps Atlanta's highest-profile, health-related Net
start-up company. Or the folks at McKesson HBOC, which recently
swallowed Atlanta-based HBO &AMP; Co. The company, has Web sites for
its various units and has invested in WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   And on the floor of the HIMSS conference at the Georgia World
Congress Center, the buzz is about the Internet's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that everybody down there has some sort of Web-based
play or is about to roll one out,'' said William J. Michalak, vice
president of research at Interstate/Johnson Lane. ``There are a
myriad of proposals, depending on the niche. The development of Web
applications is so early stage, anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those jostling for position are older companies that
already have a large presence in hospitals, clinics or physicians'
offices _ companies like McKesson HBOC, IDX Systems Corp. or
Medical Manager Corp. That headstart gives them brand recognition
and could translate into Web power, too. Go to any browser, search
for health or health care or medical information and look at a long
list of offerings _ including some based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But companies that have created themselves specificially for the
brave new Net world may zip past the old ones. Stakes are high for
the transition to a Net-centric economy, and health care is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that make health information an Internet
sweet spot,'' said Bill Bass, analyst at Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people who are interested in health information
often have an instatiable appetite for it. Moreover, the Net
permits rapid establishment of ``communities'' around various
diseases or conditions. Sufferers or families who might have been
isolated in years past, now can quickly connect via the Net to
others going through the same thing. Sites and mailings exist for
scores if not hundreds of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The search for information too can lead in myriad directions _
for caregivers or consumers. To the latest on a disease or on
medications. To lists of providers. To an outlet for griping about
health maintenance organizations. To alternative treatments. To
advice about nutrition or weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   One site trying to tie most of them together is WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   In filing for an initial public offering of stock, WebMD cited a
projection by research company Cyber Dialogue that about 30 million
Americans will surf the Net searching for health and medical
information next year. Those people will spend $150 billion for
health-related products, the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   That's at least partly because viewers of health care sites have
a different attitude about spending money, Bass said. ``You become
price-insensitive when you are worried about your health.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving the interest in health are demographics: millions of
professionals and other affluent Net users are the so-called Baby
Boomers edging deeper into the malady-pocked years of middle-age.
Moreover, they are often coping with aging parents. And the
fastest-growing group on the Net is probably the over-55 crowd.
</P>
<P>
   With all that in mind, companies with very deep pockets are
ready to spend a lot of money to advertise to those users. Jupiter
Communications has estimated that purchases of online advertising
for health and medical companies will surge to $265 million within
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Rates for health care surfers already are already cresting.
General rates for advertising on the Net run about $15 per 1,000
views, Bass said. Yet, health care sites may get more than $100 for
the same number of looks. ``Those are very valuable eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   But how to get in front of those eyes?
</P>
<P>
   Among the many health sites on the Net are many for consumers,
some for doctors. Some that simply compile links, some with
articles, some connecting the user to companies. Atlanta-based
Medirisk offers databases and analytical tools aimed at helping
health care orgnizations be more productive and profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Bass warns against trying to be all things to all users. ``What
I don't see is a site dominating both business-to-business and
consumer. It's just very hard to be good at both.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Net itself, some of the more ambitious Internet
companies see connections as their value.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Atlanta-based ADAM Internet Health Inc. sees itself
as a ``component'' in someone else's Web machine. The nine-year-old
company, which got started making CD-Roms for use in training.
ADAM, never criticized for the quality of its work, has had its
financial ups and down and has recently reshaped itself to focus on
the Net. ADAM has its own Internet site, of course
(http://www.adam.com). But the company's greatest opportunity may
be in licensing its work to other Net companies, said Robert S.
Cramer Jr., co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM's illustrations and annotations will become part of another
company's software, an arrangement that is already placing ADAM's
work in front of many more eyes than before, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become the visual component standard of Web health
care. This will begin bearing fruit immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD's connections are right up-front. The company has
alliances with McKesson HBO, CNN, E-Trade, MedQuist, Envoy Corp.,
DuPont and CompuServe _ some of them involving an investment in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these companies are involved in helping health care
evolve,'' said Jay Gilbertson, president and chief operating
officer of WebMD. ``They have found in delivery of data a way to
improve the quality of care as well as the cost of care.''
</P>
<P>
   And like other aggressive Net companies, the shining ambitions
cannot quite reach into the many dark corners of uncertainty.
WebMD's perspectus lists a series of reasons to doubt its promise:
The industry is new, the company's business model is basically
untested, WebMD will likely lose a lot of money for awhile and
can't even begin to predict future revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the Net. The lurking uncertainties that would
strangle a traditional IPO only add to the lure here. What matters
is the hope.
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure, WebMD has a plan. The company last fall started
marketing itself to doctors who pay a monthly fee for a service
that delivers messages, news and health information over the Net.
More than 10,000 doctors have signed up, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   But WebMD is also going after the huge audience of consumers _
the many millions of patients, potential patients and relatives of
patients, who are increasingly going to the Net in search of
information or aid. For them, WebMD offers free access _ but not
the same medical data as for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   That prescription calls for WebMD to mix several business
models.
</P>
<P>
   Money should come from subscriptions _ paid by doctors or,
perhaps, their employers _ and from advertising on the consumer
side.
</P>
<P>
   Net experts tend to be bullish about WebMD, but skeptical about
its business model. After all, the Net continues to evolve and no
single, clear path to profits has yet emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of false starts,'' Michalak said.
``Everyone has to be a lot more patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The Net has already tried and rejected several ideas for making
money. For instance, the ``push'' model in which a user would have
a steady stream of reports or announcements ``pushed'' to his or
her desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   And subscriptions, too, are doomed, said Bass. ``Unless you are
an adult entertainment site or doing some kind of investment tips,
it is all advertising. Subscriptions are not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, online magazine Slate recently abandoned its
pay-for-access policy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some abandoned ideas are recycled in a new guise. For
instance, the notion of delivering data to a user is again being
discussed _ but the data must be customized so that the user really
wants it.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneering that strategy _ with a twist _ is Medcast, a nascent
Atlanta subsidiary of the Greenberg News Network, founded by former
Esquire publisher Alan Greenberg. Medcast customize information for
physicians _ an idea at odds with WebMD's approach, which is a kind
of portal _ Net jargon for a gateway to a range of sites, services
and sources.
</P>
<P>
   And while Medcast has a Web site, the company rejects the tag of
a Web company.
</P>
<P>
   ``WebMD is just a Web page,'' said Wayne Pines, Medcast head of
public affairs. ``This is a comprehensive and specialized news and
information service. And 70 percent of the physicians who see it
sign up on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the stories are downloaded into doctors' computers,
along with various news and financial channels.
</P>
<P>
   Medcast's 55-member team, which includes a number of former CNN
reporters, analyzes research and articles from medical journals,
then writes its own stories . ``We are the largest medical news
gathering staff in the world,'' Pines said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Republican leaders of
Congress held their first formal meeting in 19 months on Tuesday in
a businesslike but chilly session that appears to have done little
to pacify the cold war between them.
</P>
<P>
   The president and those in Congress who tried to remove him
because of the Lewinsky scandal clearly suffer from a deep lack of
trust and remain far apart on major substantive issues, from tax
policy to the federal role in local schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his allies, bolstered by polls that show the
president retaining the support of the American people and broad
backing for his substantive agenda, believe they occupy the high
ground of domestic politics. They are inviting the Republicans to
do business with them _ on Democratic terms _ but are prepared to
resume partisan warfare when it suits their purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The chief issue dividing the parties is what to do with
trillions of dollars in projected budget surpluses over the next
decade. Clinton, with solid support from Democrats and the public,
proposes to reserve most of the surplus to shore up Social Security
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to devote a large proportion of those surpluses
to tax cuts but are feuding among themselves over the specific
contours of tax relief. Some GOPleaders want a 10 percent
across-the-board tax cut; other members prefer limited, targeted
tax credits, like an end to the so-called marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting between Clinton and the bipartisan
congressional leadership _ the first such formal encounter since
July 1997 _ marked the beginning of serious talks about the year's
legislative agenda. Little congressional business has been done
until now because of the extraordinary spectacle of Clinton's
impeachment trial, which consumed the first five weeks of the
congressional calendar.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader, and
the House speaker, Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., met with their
Democratic counterparts and Clinton in the Oval Office to start the
process of disengagement from a trying year of scandal,
investigation and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert fell into pugilistic metaphors to describe his first
face-to-face meeting with the president since Hastert was elected
speaker in January. His ascension came as a result of a separate
allegations of marital infidelity involving the former
speaker-designate, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert described the meeting as ``an opening round'' in what is
expected to be a months-long bout over policy and political
positioning. ``It was a good first start,'' Hastert said in a brief
interview in the Capitol. ``It was just what I would say, touching
gloves before you got going.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's spokesman said that the speaker and other Republicans
were wary of Clinton's intentions, suspecting that he plans to
offer policies that Republicans are certain to reject and then use
the resulting gridlock as a campaign issue in 2000. It was a
strategy that worked for the White House and congressional
Democrats in 1998, when, against historical precedent, the party
holding the White House picked up seats in Congress in the sixth
year of a presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we deal with the budget surplus,'' said John Feehery,
Hastert's press secretary, ``we need also to deal with the trust
deficit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hastert and Lott both ducked questions from reporters about
whether they could trust Clinton after his repeated lies about the
Lewinsky affair and the White House campaign of vitriol against
Republicans in Congress who pursued his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate acquitted Clinton on charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice 10 days ago, Lott said in an interview that
he could no longer trust the word of the president and did not
answer the question of whether he still respected Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When asked on Tuesday whether he could trust the president to
keep his word on pledges of bipartisanship, Lott said: ``I'll tell
you what I trust. I trust the ability of the people, here in the
Congress, in the government, to work together to do what we need to
do for the people. That's where the real trust should be, the trust
in us doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and Democratic leaders tried to adopt an
air of magnanimity, promising to lay down their arms and seek
accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered only one brief comment before the meeting,
saying all sides had an interest in working together. ``We all took
an oath, and I think we intend to follow it,'' he said. ``We owe it
to the American people, and I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, said that
Republican leaders had expressed willingness to work with Clinton
on strengthening Social Security, health care, education, campaign
finance and other major policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realize that if they're to get the people's business
done, they have to work with the president of the United States,''
Gephardt said after the Oval Office meeting. ``And by their being
here today and going through what I thought was a positive meeting,
I think there was a lot of good, positive developments to come out
of this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt quickly scratched a line on the ground and dared
Republicans to cross it. He said that the president's plan to
reserve 77 percent of future budget surpluses for Social Security
and Medicare was a ``threshold decision'' that must be accepted by
Republicans. Until they do, Gephardt said, Clinton and the
Democrats will not discuss any specific plans for allocating excess
federal funds, including any possible tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House political adviser said that, for now at
least, Clinton and Democratic leaders are in agreement that
compromise on major spending and social issues is both good
politics and good policy.
</P>
<P>
   Another presidential adviser said that Clinton, despite his
optimistic tone now, did not expect much progress this year on the
ambitious agenda he spelled out in his State of the Union message
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with Republicans will continue to be strained by
bitterness on both sides from the impeachment fight. And the
current Democratic unity could be frayed by the diverging interests
of congressional Democrats, who want to seize control of the House,
and Clinton, whose top priorities are repairing his image and
electing Vice President Al Gore as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   But even without movement on major domestic issues, this adviser
said, Clinton is in position to dominate the public stage on
foreign policy issues, from the Middle East to the Balkans and from
international economic upheaval to the continuing threat of
terrorism.

BLAIR NUDGES BRITAIN CLOSER TO THE EURO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also SWISS-EURO) 
(mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a milestone announcement that pushed Britain closer
to joining Europe's single currency, Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Tuesday offered Parliament a tentative schedule for membership _
provided the British people agree and the economic terms are
considered right.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond hinting at possible entry between 2002 and 2005, however,
he gave no firm timing for Britain to abandon the pound and its
position as the last major European economy to remain outside
11-nation Euroland. Blair and his aides avoided any suggestion of
an exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had promised since last year to give some kind of
blueprint for Britain's possible entry, and the announcement
appeared timed to precede a routine meeting of European leaders in
Bonn, Germany, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we announce today is not a change of policy. It is a
change of gear,'' Blair told Parliament. He drew taunts from
William Hague, leader of the opposition Conservatives, that the
timetable _ called the Outline National Changeover Plan _
represented a ``national hand-over plan, to hand over the economic
and political freedoms of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political opposition, the government's commitment to
a written plan moved Britain's contentious political debate over
its future relationship with the Continent to a new level, creating
the clear impression that Blair was committed to Britain's
membership. By publishing a timetable, moreover, he seemed to give
momentum to the process of joining the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's spokesman said membership in the euro currency
represented ``the biggest decision that this prime minister and
this government are going to face.'' Tuesday's announcement was the
latest sign of declining opposition to the currency among those
European nations outside the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The euro came into use in all electronic forms of trading, like
stock markets and government transactions, on Jan. 4 after a
lengthy period of economic convergence among its member countries.
Notes and coins are to enter circulation in January 2002. The
smooth introduction has generally eased opposition to the euro in
Denmark and Sweden, while Greece, the fourth member of the European
Union outside the euro, is trying to get its economy in shape to
join.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to the broad outlines of previous statements _ but for
the first time offering a timetable _ Blair's plan foresaw a
four-month period between a government decision to join the euro
and a referendum seeking the approval of the British people. Then,
the timetable envisioned a 24-30 month period when Britain would
lock its currency into the same irrevocable relationship with the
euro that the other 11 currencies now have. After that time, there
would be a six-month period when euro notes and coins would phase
out the pound.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's spokesman said the timetable would begin to run
``barring unforeseen circumstances'' after Britain's next scheduled
elections, which must be held by May, 2002. That could mean a
referendum in late 2002 and British membership anytime between then
and 2005.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The government itself will be making active preparations for
the euro in the belief that it will be in this country's interests
to join in the future should our economic tests be met,'' Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged tens of millions of pounds to help make government
departments ``euro-compatible.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's conditions revolve around whether there is
``sustainable convergence'' between the British and Euroland
economies. But, additionally, the British authorities are looking
for evidence of greater economic flexibility on the Continent,
positive gains for investment and the British financial services
industry, and guarantees that euro membership would not lead to
greater unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   British benchmark short-term rates are 5.5 percent compared with
3 percent on the Continent. But long-term rates are much closer,
with a spread of about half a percentage point, Blair said. British
inflation is comparable with inflation in the euro nations, but
British joblessness is half the Continental average of about 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Blair is treading a narrow line between
euro-skeptics, including some in his own party, and pro-euro
legislators in both the government and the opposition. Above all,
he faces the prospect of fierce opposition from newspapers.

COMMISSION WANTS MORE FUNDING FOR RESEARCH ON INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning that the nation's economic future is at
risk, a presidential advisory committee plans to recommend that
federal financing for advanced research in the field of information
technology be doubled over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The report, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is a result
of nearly two years of study by the 26-member presidential
commission _ a group divided about equally between leading
university researchers and executives from technology companies
including Intel, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, IBM and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The group's appeal for increased federal research funds for
computing and telecommunications at a time when these industries
are thriving is based on the view that the government has a unique
role to play in supporting research that is the seed corn of new
businesses 10 or 15 years in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from the microchip to the Internet, the report notes,
can be traced to fundamental research bankrolled by the government
years ago. That role, the advisory group insists, needs to be
strengthened. The vast majority of the proposed funds would go to
universities, not private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investment in most areas of information-technology
research has been flat or declining for nearly a decade, adjusted
for inflation, largely because of the push to curb government
spending in general and because the end of the Cold War brought a
contraction in military-related research. Yet the erosion in
financing has come as the nation's economy has become increasingly
dependent on this sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is mainly an investment in the key asset of the
information age _ trained people nurtured at universities,'' said
Bill Joy, a founder of Sun Microsystems and co-chairman of the
advisory committee. ``It's a societal investment. What we need to
create is a Silicon Continent, not just Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The businesses that produce computers, semiconductors, software
and communications equipment have accounted for one-third of the
growth in production of the American economy since 1992 and have
created millions of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But while the industry is flourishing, companies are under more
and more competitive pressure to shorten their horizons, as product
generations often last a year or less and long-range research is
given short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information technology is a field where the United States
leads the world, and it's important to understand how that
happened,'' said Larry Smarr, the director of the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, who is a member of the advisory group. ``What we
have today can be traced to federally funded long-term research in
universities.''
</P>
<P>
   There is already some evidence that the White House and federal
agencies may be receptive to the appeal by the president's
Information Technology Advisory Committee. In the aftermath of the
group's interim report, issued last August, the Clinton
administration proposed in January an increase of $366 million, or
28 percent, in federally financed research for information
technology in fiscal year 2000, which begins in September.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said on Tuesday that he strongly
supported the group's conclusion that ``the government needs to
increase its investment in long-term information-technology
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the advisory committee recommends that annual federal
financing for information-technology research increase by $1.3
billion during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory group concluded that the government-backed research
should focus on four areas: software, scaling up the Internet
infrastructure, high-end computing and the impact on society and
the work force of information technology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Software research, the group's report says, should be directed
increasingly at designing software that can be used as smaller,
reliable and re-usable building blocks _ ``component-based software
design.''
</P>
<P>
   The report warns that the nation has become ``dangerously
dependent on large software systems, whose behavior is not well
understood and which often fail in unpredicted ways.'' It cites as
examples the big-system headaches experienced by some government
agencies, like the Federal Aviation Administration, and the
difficulty of fixing the year 2000 problem in major computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The infrastructure research, the report says, is needed to make
the move to an increasingly wired world in which today's 30 million
computers connected to the Internet could become billions of
devices from hand-held computers to household appliances, all
linked to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for increased spending to accelerate the
performance of supercomputers that can be used for sophisticated
applications like weather and climate forecasting, advanced
manufacturing design and development of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The group also recommends the creation of up to five ``virtual
centers,'' financed annually with up to $40 million each. In the
report, these centers are termed ``expeditions into the 21st
century'' or ``time machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with the most advanced computers _ hundreds or a
thousand times more powerful than today's desktop machines _ the
centers would allow computer scientists and others to experiment
with the technology that will become affordable and widespread a
decade later.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual recommendation from technology elites, the group
also called for social science research on the impact of
technology. These include the issues of access to technology,
upgrading of workers' skills and encouraging increased
participation in the computer sciences by women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology is becoming so important to people's lives and
their economic opportunities that as a nation we have to make sure
that everything is done so that everyone is connected,'' said
Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of IBM's Internet division
and a member of the presidential commission.

 &HT;    Customers switching gas marketers
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of Atlanta Gas Light Co.'s customers have
signed up to purchase natural gas from marketers, and the rest
aren't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   The utility's latest monthly update today is expected to show
about 455,000 of its 1.5 million customers have switched service
four months after the start of deregulation. That's 31 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Public Service Commission is seeking
legislation to ensure all AGL customers are placed with marketers
by next winter. The bill is expected to be introduced in the
General Assembly by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to get the marketers to take over and get AGL into
the pipes business and not selling any gas,'' said the bill's
sponsor, House Majority Whip Jimmy Skipper (D-Americus).
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta Journal-Constitution spot-check Tuesday of what the
average residential customer paid for gas service in February
showed most marketers charging within $3 of one another. The price
comparison includes nine of the 12 marketers now serving former AGL
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gas Light's price was more than $11 higher than the $60
average price offered by the marketers. The utility's
weather-sensitive rates were pushed upward by balmy temperatures
earlier this month. The current cold snap, however, is lowering
AGL's charges.
</P>
<P>
   Price comparisons are difficult to make, since some marketers
lock in rates for up to three years to ensure against price jumps,
while the rates of others fluctuate monthly and include separate
interstate gas pipeline charges. In addition, the value of
promotional ``free gas'' offers and other giveways also vary.
Marketers also calculate ``base charges'' for delivery of gas
differently.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Service Commission has been debating whether require
marketers to file their rates with regulators to provide more
information to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   PSC Chairman Stan Wise opposes the proposal as ``government
intrusion in the marketplace'' but has urged marketers to ``give
customized quotes to consumers that disclose all charges.''
</P>
<P>
   SCANA Energy has added a ``bill calculator'' to its Internet
site, allowing consumers to figure monthly costs to the penny.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC wants all AGL customers to be assigned to marketers by
Sept. 30. Regulators wants to avoid a repetition of the furor
earlier this year over AGL rates that led to a settlement with
regulators and ordered $14.5 million in customer refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Current law requires that 33 percent of the gas sold in each of
nine separate delivery areas be provided by marketers before the
PSC assigns AGL's remaining customers at random to marketers. The
update due today from AGL is expected to show the Newnan, Augusta
and Macon areas have passed the 33 percent threshhold, and Atlanta
is getting very close.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, however, would give the PSC authority to order
random assignments, regardless of progress made in the nine areas.
Wise said the measure is intended to ensure that areas where
switches are lagging are not left stranded with AGL for another
high-cost heating season.
</P>
<P>
   Wise expects the measure to have the support of top legislative
leaders, including House Speaker Thomas Murphy (D-Bremen), and be
enacted with the signature of Gov. Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   AGL would still, under the legislation, operate as a
distribution company responsible for transporting gas to homes and
businesses, but would no longer sell gas.
</P>
<P>
   Customers would get plenty of written notice before they are
assigned to marketers and be able to switch again without charge if
they don't like their assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is being supported by both AGL, which is anxious
to lay to rest the controversy over its winter rates, and
marketers, who want to simplify their sales efforts and add to
their customer rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine the confusion of trying to explain to
customers in Carrollton and Douglasville why they're (being
assigned) at a different time when they're 15 miles apart,'' said
Deborah Latham, president of Roswell-based Peachtree Natural Gas.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the random assignment, AGL's latest customer count
confirms that the state's deregulation has outpaced any other major
U.S. utility restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
   The random assignment system is what makes Georgia's program
unique and will allocate marketers two customers for every one they
can sign up now.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, in Washington this week to attend the National Association
of Regulatory Utility Commissions annual meeting, said he's getting
lots of questions about the Georgia program. ``They're intrigued by
it,'` Wise said of his colleagues from other states.
</P>
<P>
   With random assignment fast approaching, marketers are retooling
their sales pitches. There's no sign yet of Ginsu knife or toaster
oven giveways yet, but changes are afoot:
</P>
<P>
   Warren Darby, senior vice president of SCANA Energy, said the
South Carolina-based supplier plans to start putting a ``limited
time only'' label on its popular offer of $50 in free gas and
``start winding it down'' in advance of random assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-based Shell Energy and United Gas Management, an affiliate
of a Canadian gas marketer, both plan to add variable monthly rates
to the fixed rates they are currently offering.
</P>
<P>
   Shell is hitting the streets today with a trademark
yellow-and-red mobile van that will visit Shell service stations
and shopping malls to sign up customers.
</P>
<P>
   Peachtree Natural Gas has started basing its separate charges
for interstate pipeline capacity on actual gas usage. Atlanta Gas
Light made the same change as part of its settlement with the PSC.

US TO ENLIST ELDERLY IN FIGHT AGAINST MEDICARE FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After six years of fighting Medicare overbilling with teams of
auditors and prosecutors, the federal government is trying to
enlist new soldiers on its fraud squad: The 39 million elderly and
disabled people who receive Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors and other health care providers are objecting that
the campaign _ to be kicked off by rallies Wednesday in Miami,
Dallas, Seattle, Boston, and other cities _ will poison a
relationship that is supposed to be therapeutic and trusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will stigmatize all doctor-patient relationships,'' said
Dr. Jeffrey Modest, medical director of Uphams Corner Health Center
in Boston. ``It's reminiscent of the old `welfare queen' stuff,
when everybody on welfare was stigmatized by focusing on the few
who did commit fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign will attempt to persuade Medicare patients to
scrutinize their bills and call doctors, hospitals, medical
equipment suppliers, and other providers if they see something
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   If Medicare patients are reluctant to confront health care
providers directly, the government invites them to call a ``fraud
hotline,'' with the enticement of a $1,000 reward if their tips
lead to substantial monetary recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Elder advocates are expecting a big response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found that nine out of 10 people are willing to help
if they knew how to define fraud,'' said Lee Norrgard of the
American Association of Retired Persons. ``They think it's their
personal responsibility and they are willing to participate in the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, which boasts 32 million members, is throwing its
weight behind the Clinton administration's campaign against
Medicare ``waste, fraud, and abuse,'' part of a $137.5 million
federal initiative split between the departments of health and
human services and justice.
</P>
<P>
   Although fraud is the focus of the rallies, federal officials
say they don't know how much of Medicare's $210 billion in annual
expenditures is lost to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an estimated 7.1 percent or $12.6 billion of the
program's payouts were ``improper.'' That broad category covers
payment for services or products that were never delivered,
services deemed medically unnecessary, attempts to bill for more
expensive procedures than were actually done, and bills that were
not fully documented or simply erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.6 billion in improper payments this year represents ``a
dramatic decline'' from $23.2 billion in fiscal 1996, according to
an audit this month by the Inspector General of the Department of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, the department excluded more than 5,700 health
care providers from Medicare and other programs because of fraud
and abuse, double that of the previous two-year period. But
officials have decided that further progress will depend on
enlisting Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of 2,000 Americans conducted by AARP, along with
20 focus group interviews, found that most Medicare beneficiaries
said they currently scrutinize their bills for accuracy. The true
figure, Norrgard guessed, may be closer to 30 or 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a lot of folks are already examining their bills,''
he said. ``Most want to call their provider first because they want
to give them the benefit of the doubt, and they recognize that
billing errors are common.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will urge Medicare beneficiaries to use a
three-step process if they find a questionable bill: Check with
their provider to see if it's a billing error; call the Medicare
carrier if they don't get a satisfactory answer; and if they still
suspect fraud, call a toll-free hotline at 1-800-447-TIPS.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association calls the campaign
``lamentable,'' ``irresponsible,'' and ``a public relations
gimmick'' and one official predicted a ``flood'' of patient calls
to physicians' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The massive `phone-in' Medicare fraud campaign. . .sending our
patients out to fight Medicare fraud with little more than a
baseball cap, magnifying glass, and an 800 number, trivializes real
fraud and creates an adversarial tone in every physician-patient
encounter,'' complained AMA President Nancy W. Dickey.

 &HT;    On the eve of the biggest night of his career, Atlanta's Shawn
Mullins mulls newfound fame, marriage and the road that got him
there
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chart busting has its price. Just ask Shawn Mullins
and he'll scribble down the answer. The 30-year-old Atlanta
resident became one of last year's pop music Cinderella stories
after Atlanta modern-rock station 99X (WNNX-FM) began playing his
song ``Lullaby'' last summer. Columbia Records signed him to a
juicy six-figure contract. His tune went Top 10. MTV made him a
familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   But Mullins has been performing so much _ and doing so many
interviews _ that he's put his voice at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Grammy-nominated Mullins, contending for best male pop vocal
performance for ``Lullaby,'' was trying to keep his pipes in shape
for tonight's big event _ and his seemingly nightly schedule of
gigs. So rather than chat on the phone, we conducted this Q-and-A
session by e-mail and fax while Mullins was on the road in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, he's not scheduled to sing at the live ceremony in
Los Angeles _ but he may have to make an acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How bizarre does it feel to be going up against fellow
nominees Eric Clapton and Sting?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's pretty crazy _ those two cats I grew up listening to. I
feel totally honored.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you win, who will you thank first: God, your girlfriend,
Mom and Dad, 99X program director Leslie Fram or Roadie, your dog?
</P>
<P>
   A: My fiancee, Kelly _ probably _ but I don't expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you going to wear the traditional tuxedo or go more the
Pete Buck route? He wore his pajamas when R.E.M. won big a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have no clue what I'm wearing. Probably not a tux and
probably not pajamas (punctuates with a drawing of a smiley face).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any plans to stop by Ghengis Cohen (the peculiar Chinese
restaurant/deli/coffeehouse where Mullins was inspired to write
``Lullaby'') for a good luck cocktail before the show?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think I have time, but if I stop by, I'll have to
grab some Chinese food to go.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that you recently proposed marriage to your
girlfriend and business partner Kelly Hobbs while on a five-day
trip to Paris. You're a romantic son-of-a-gun. How did it feel and
what were your favorite spots?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yea, it was really sweet, quality time with Kel in Paris. I
gave her the ring at the top of the Eiffel Tower. I loved the
cemeteries and museums.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you gotten tired of make-up artists fussing with you
yet?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not really, they're all really funny people. They keep the
makeover crap pretty managable. I don't really wear a lot of
make-up so it usually doesn't take much time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any good anecdotes about the absurdity of sudden celebrity?
You know, that strange experience of having utter strangers stop
you on the street, famous people call you at home, and seeing your
face on TV screens. After 10 years playing places like Eddie's
Attic, that's got to be a trip.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yea, it is a trip _ it's cool, though. I feel a lot of
support from fans. But, yes, it's strange to be kind of shuffled
into this bizarre power dynamic we call fame.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How bad off is your voice right now and how do you care for
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's really not that bad right now _ I've just been singing
and talking a lot. I try not to eat dairy and I don't speak a lot
when I don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your thoughts on playing the sold-out Roxy in Atlanta in a
few weeks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Never woulda thunk it. I love the Roxy. I haven't played
there since 1990 with Amy Ray and Kristen Hall and a few others.
I'm totally psyched to be back again.

 &HT;    Turner South to showcase region on cable
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting today is expected to announce
plans for a new cable TV channel called Turner South, its first new
entertainment channel in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South will be launched this fall and feature 24 hours of
movies, sitcoms, regional news and sports geared toward a Southern
audience. Initially, most of the programming will come from the
vast film and TV library of Turner Broadcasting, now a unit of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   But the channel also plans to show original programming. It has,
for example, developed a one-hour show in partnership with the
magazine Southern Living.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South is the first new entertainment channel launched by
the Atlanta-based programming giant since its purchase by Time
Warner three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The channel is to be formally announced today at a 10 a.m. news
conference at the company's Techwood campus in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is launching its new channel at a difficult time. New
channels are scrapping to find distribution among cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Turner South will not be announced today with any
distribution deals. Today, most new channels begin life on direct
broadcast satellite services such as DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Turner Broadcasting is nothing if not tenacious. Its last
new entertainment channel, Turner Classic Movies, was launched five
years ago and has only recently began to reach a critical mass of
30 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South will feature games by the Atlanta Braves, Hawks and
the new hockey franchise, the Thrashers. All teams are owned by
Turner Broadcasting. Their games are now aired on Turner
Broadcasting cable channels TBS and TNT, as well as on other
channels such as ESPN and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the strategy behind Turner South is to recoup games,
especially for the Braves, that have been lost to other channels
over the years through changing contracts with the leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South would be the first regional entertainment channel,
although there are several regional sports channels. But what the
channel really represents is a new spin on an old idea at its
parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting began more than 25 years ago with the
satellite broadcast of Channel 17 as the TBS SuperStation. It
became one of the first cable TV channels and reached viewers
across the nation but especially in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Ted Turner conceived TBS as a way to bring baseball and
other shows to small towns in the South without a lot of choice in
TV programming.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years TBS has evolved into a channel with broad
appeal and more than 70 million subscribers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting executives began to feel that the regional
market was going unmet. Recent marketing studies by the company
confirmed that there was still a demand for a ``Southern'' channel.

 &HT;    Bush: Tobacco cash belongs to states, not Washington
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flanked by members of Texas' congressional
delegation, Gov. George W. Bush declared Tuesday that the federal
government should keep its hands off the state's $17.3 billion
tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's general consensus amongst Republican and Democrat and
independent governors as well as members of the Congress _
hopefully, both Republican and Democrat, but clearly Republican _
that this money ought to stay in the states,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government had a chance to join the lawsuit and
chose not to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas and other states sued tobacco companies to recover some of
the Medicaid money they paid out to cover tobacco-related health
problems. But the Clinton administration has argued that because
federal dollars make up a significant portion of state Medicaid
programs (more than 60 percent in Texas), Washington is entitled to
some of the money, or at least a say in how it is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the money belongs to the taxpayers and that the states
would spend the money more efficiently and in a way that more
closely reflects the public's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that if the federal government takes some of
the money, it should foot some of the legal bill for the private
lawyers the state hired in the case. Federal arbitrators have
ordered tobacco companies to pay the lawyers $3.3 billion, but the
lawyers have not yet signed off on their right to come after the
state for their paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been in Washington for a four-day conference of the
nation's governors. A dozen of the country's 31 Republican
governors have joined forces to urge Bush to run. Gov. Marc Racicot
of Montana, one of three governors engineering the show of support,
said the National Governor's Association endorsement will be
released ``in a few more days,'' once 15 or 16 colleagues are on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Though speculation about Bush's possible presidential bid
dominated his trip, his meeting Tuesday with the Texas
congressional delegation focused on the tobacco settlement and
other policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison said there is broad congressional
support for her bill to bar the federal government from taking any
of the tobacco money, and that the states should decide how it is
spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president yesterday came out and said he'd let our bill go
as long as the states would agree to spend the money in certain
areas,'' Hutchison said. ``I am absolutely against the federal
government telling the states how to spend the state tobacco
settlement money.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas state Sen. Bill Ratliff (R-Mount Pleasant), chairman of
the Senate's budget-writing committee, said the battle is far from
over. Just in case, he said, state budget writers are preparing
legislation that would cut all programs funded by the tobacco money
by a percentage equal to whatever the federal government takes.

KOSOVO TALKS END WITH NO AGREEMENT TO HALT FIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France - The Kosovo peace talks ended
inconclusively Tuesday when ethnic Kosovar Albanians and Serbs
refused to sign a settlement that would end the year-long fighting
that has left some 2,000 dead and another 300,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers pronounced the talks a failure because they did
not result in the agreement that the six-nation Contact Group on
the Balkans, including the United States, had tried to impose on
the two sides fighting over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the Contact Group - the US, Britain,
France, Germany, Italy and Russia - claimed that both sides had
agreed to one part of the two-part settlement, and vowed to bring
the two sides together again March 15 in France in a final attempt
to reach a settlement. They also claimed that the Kosovar Albanians
had agreed to the settlement in principle, but needed to consult
with supporters back home before signing it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the claims of a partial settlement, the western powers
admitted that neither side had signed anything, so that nothing
discussed here at this 14th-century castle 35 miles southwest of
Paris is binding.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile fighting continued in Kosovo. Five policemen and a
photographer were wounded in fighting in the snow-covered hills in
the northern part of the province Tuesday just hours before the
deadline in Paris passed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight day of clashes between guerrillas of
the KLA and Yugoslav security forces west of Vucitrn, an area from
which 4,000 civilians have fled in recent days, according to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At Rambouillet, the Kosovar Albanians balked at signing the
political part of the agreement because it does not specifically
call for a referendum on independence after three years, a
provision they hold dear. The Serbs, meanwhile, refuse to sign the
military part of the agreement because it calls for 30,000 NATO
troops to police the settlement in Kosovo, their southern province.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who spent the last three
days pleading with the Kosovar Albanians to sign the agreement
despite their misgivings about the absence of a referendum
guarantee, said the ethnic Albanian delegation had accepted the
settlement in principle but insisted they had to consult with
supporters in Kosovo before signing.
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said the talks had
produced ``a consensus on substantial autonomy for Kosovo,
including mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic
institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of
human rights and the rights of members of national communities, and
for the establishment of a fair judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vedrine acknowledged that he had nothing in writing, and
Albright insisted that the Serbs refuse even to discuss the
presence of NATO troops on sovereign Serbian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vedrine and British Foreign Minister Robin Cook, who
together hosted the talks here, said the conference set to
reconvene somewhere in France on March 15 would be used to
implement the agreements in principle that the Contact Group
received from the two sides at Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   But, under questioning by reporters, both men acknowledged that
neither side had formally agreed to anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done a lot here, even if we have not done enough,''
said Cook, stressing that in just four weeks the western powers had
intervened in a conflict that seemed intractable, halted much of
the bloodshed and brought the two combatants to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agreement from both sides for the self-governing of
Kosovo,'' said Cook. ``Today is not the end of that process, only
the end of the first phase. March 15 is the second phase. It's a
good deal for both sides. They'd be wise to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The KLA remains wary of the provision in the agreement calling
for it to disarm while some of its members in exchange would become
police officers in a newly autonomous Kosovo. Many in the KLA say
they are fighting for independence and anything short of that is
unacceptabale. But most would settle for a referendum on
independence, because the predominance of ethnic Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of the 2 million people in Kosovo, would all but
assure approval.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that she and other leaders of the Contact Group
will spend the next two weeks trying to convince the Kosovar
Albanians ``that it's a good deal.'' Some members of the delegation
could travel to the United States during that time, she said.
Albright is convinced that the only way to persuade the Serbs to
agree to a settlement is first to persuade the ethnic Albanians. If
this is achieved, the Serbs would then be vulnerable to NATO air
strikes should they continue to oppose the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the pattern at Rambouillet, the Europeans were more
conciliatory toward the Serbs than Albright. Cook stressed that
``both sides are to blame for that violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cook agreed with Albright that any peacekeeping force in
Kosovo must be ``NATO-led and NATO-commanded.'' The Serbs favor a
weaker force, including Russians and other peacekeepers from
countries traditionally sympathetic to Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If other countries wish to take part, we would welcome that,''
Cook said. ``But it would remain NATO-led.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hill, the US envoy to Kosovo who is the chief author
of the proposed settlement, was more candid that many of the
higher-ranking officials here. An exhausted Hill, who trudged back
and forth between the opposing camps during the negotiations, said,
``I don't want to downplay this too much. But we've still got a war
going on out there. It could always spin out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill added, ``A lot more has to be done. We aren't there yet.
Rambouillet was a big step.''

ASSOCIATES SAY BUCHANAN LOOKING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pat Buchanan, who stunned the political
establishment when his low-budget, insurgent campaign triumphed in
the New Hampshire Republican primary in 1996, is preparing a third
bid for the White House in 2000, according to several close
associates.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, CNN President Tom Johnson announced that Buchanan
had been granted a leave as co-host of the program, ``Crossfire,''
beginning Wednesday. ``We wish Pat well in his exploration of a
possible GOP candidacy,'' Johnson said. Some of Buchanan's
associates said he may announce his intentions as early as next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from his appearances as a commentator, he has laid low in
the last three years and not participated in many of the political
forums that are frequented by prospective candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But several associates, most of whom spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said Buchanan told them he has grown bored with his
television role and believes that the early Republican
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, was not as inevitable a
nominee as was Bob Dole, the former senator from Kansas, was four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Given Buchanan's passionate following among cultural
conservatives in states with early contests, his candidacy would
immediately complicate the race. Others who are already fiercely
competing for the support of social conservatives include former
Vice President Dan Quayle; Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate;
Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire; and Gary Bauer, who was head of
the Family Research Council. Like Bush, Elizabeth Dole, the former
American Red Cross president, is undeclared but considered
formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, 60, has long been underestimated as a politician. In
his first bid for public office, he humiliated President George
Bush by drawing more than 37 percent of the vote in the New
Hampshire primary in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary with 27
percent of the vote, a point ahead of Dole. And he came close to
defeating Dole in the crucial Iowa caucuses, drawing 23 percent,
compared with 26 percent for Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was also victorious in three other early caucuses,
Alaska, Louisiana and Missouri. He essentially ended the
well-financed campaign of Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas. But Buchanan's
campaign, overpowered and outspent by Dole, fizzled out after New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat is probably going to coalesce his old voters again and
he's going to be a formidable force,'' said Terry Jeffrey, the
editor of Human Events who was Buchanan's campaign manager in 1996.
Arguing that Buchanan's seething appeals to the disaffected and his
attacks on corporate interests had a receptive audience in New
Hampshire, he added, ``If the economy turns down he could be even
more formidable than he was last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican Party, said: ``A
considerable number of people in the party take him seriously,
particularly in the early going. Iowa and New Hampshire are retail
political places _ and he's very good at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation for Buchanan's apparent rethinking about
running in recent months may be that he recognizes there may be a
fresh opening for his populist economic message. Despite the potent
domestic economy, the global economic crisis in recent months has
led to a flood of low cost imports in industries like steel,
leaving both workers and companies feeling vulnerable to unfair
competition. That has been one of Buchanan's central themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's convinced that the global trade issues, particularly the
economic issues, work for him,'' said Bill Press, a Democrat who is
Buchanan's sparring partner on ``Crossfire.''
</P>
<P>
   But a crucial question for Buchanan is whether he can tap into
the reservoir of support he enjoyed last time. Already, most of his
top aides from 1996 have moved on. Jeffrey said he has no intention
of leaving Human Events. Greg Mueller, Buchanan's communications
chief in 1996, is planning to sign up with Forbes. Connie Mackey,
who was a top Buchanan strategist four years ago, is working for
Bauer. Buchanan's sister, Bay Buchanan, a driving force behind his
candidacies, has told associates that she expects to continue as a
commentator on MSNBC. And Peter Robbio, who ran Buchanan's
operation in New Hampshire four years ago, is expected to work for
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Forbes has recruited past Buchanan backers is that he
has readjusted his message with an appeal to many of the social
conservatives who backed Buchanan in 1996. Forbes has the personal
wealth to stay in the race and is therefore generally viewed as
more electable than Buchanan. Quayle also has far greater resources
than Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle McSlarrow, Quayle's campaign chairman, said because of the
crowded field he doubted Buchanan could again win New Hampshire.
``We're fast approaching a situation where we may have more
candidates than people in New Hampshire,'' he said. ``But I never
count Pat Buchanan out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, while Buchanan has been a divisive Republican figure _
he was attacked even in his own party for appearing harsh in
commenting about homosexuals and others at the Republican
convention in 1992 _ he has been a master at capturing press
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat doesn't need a big political machine,'' Mueller said.
``He'll energize his base of supporters who will line up behind his
Lincoln Navigator looking for rides to caucuses and polls.'' But,
he added, ``The endgame is the problem. That's where the niche
conservatives run into a virtually insurmountable firewall.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite early polls showing Buchanan is in the single digits in
Iowa and New Hampshire, Press said Buchanan told him he believes he
can win. ``He is convinced that if Elizabeth Dole stumbles, if G.W.
stumbles, in a field of pygmies, he's the giant,'' he said. ``This
is not just a need for adulation on his part.''

AUDITORS SAY PROBLEMS WERE IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts auditors say internal control problems
have been found in the Treasury every year since 1994, but the
findings were ignored by then-State Treasurer Joseph D. Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We noted numerous repeat issues and findings dealing with ...
weak internal controls,'' Deputy Auditor Robert Powilatis said
Tuesday. The treasurer's office under Malone, Powilatis added,
``had warnings and chose not to take corrective action.''
</P>
<P>
   State Auditor Joseph DeNucci is preparing a report for new
Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien that will specify the recurring
problems found in the department, Powilatis said.
</P>
<P>
   The report will include ``prior recommendations and prior
concerns with internal controls in the collection of cash in the
abandoned property fund,'' including the Unpaid Check Fund, ``back
to '94 and '95,'' Powilatis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't take corrective action, that was obvious,'' added
Powilatis, referring to the alleged attempt to bilk $6.5 million
from the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Powilatis' assertions contradict Malone's claim that the
Treasurer's office passed its audits. When asked to respond to
Malone's contentions, Powilatis said ``That's not true. I don't
know where he can show that.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone has reacted to the financial scandal by vigorously
defending his management of the office, blaming it on ``people, not
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference this week, Malone said, ``I can understand
where, at first blush, they would think, `Gee, there is something
terribly wrong here. How can $5 (million) or $6 million be
potentially walked away with?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when you have auditors _ both public and private ones _
coming in on an annual basis ... you usually end up with controls
and procedures that are appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before last May, the Unpaid Check Fund apparently had no formal
guidelines for approving disbursements, other than the requirement
that two officials authorize payment. Verifying claims was left to
the discretion of John Trischitta, a fund manager who has pleaded
not guilty in the alleged bribery and embezzlement scheme, and one
of Trischitta's supervisors, Treasury officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the informal arrangement for verifying claims was
changed after heir hunters, seeking commissions for putting
claimants together with their money, stepped up pressure through
Freedom of Information requests to gain access to the Unpaid Check
Fund. The Treasury agreed to distribute the list of people owed
money but tightened procedures and required that heir hunters to
present a notarized power of attorney on behalf of the claimant
before receiving money.
</P>
<P>
   Although Malone said this requirement was an effort to limit
access to the fund, O'Brien has countered that the change might
have had the opposite effect. Deputy Treasurer Michael Travaglini
said Tuesday that the written requirement for power of attorney
might have been construed to mean that no other verification was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did DeNucci's office know of past problems within the
Treasuer's operations, but the attorney general's office received
at least two complaints about the operations of Martin Robbins, the
heir finder charged in the current scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly's office confirmed Tuesday that
two individuals had sent letters to the Attorney general's consumer
protection division last summer complaining about apparent
high-pressure tactics used by Robbins' firm. Both individuals were
sent letters informing them that state law authorized heir finders
to represent individuals who may be due money from the Unpaid
Checks or Abandoned Property Funds.
</P>
<P>
   But they were also told that individuals had the right to seek
those funds on their own without paying a percentage of the funds
to heir finders.

MALONE REFORMS WERE GOOD POLICY, BAD CHOICE, SOME SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the swirl of a breaking scandal, former Treasurer
Joseph D. Malone's decision to rely on heir finders as one of the
primary means of returning unclaimed property to its owners has
been cast in dark hues.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, First Deputy Treasurer Michael Travaglini charged on
Monday, had ``decimated the investigatory staff'' in the office's
Abandoned Property Division.
</P>
<P>
   But actually, the difference between Malone's policy and a more
traditional approach is one of government philosophy, not a clear
choice between good policy or bad. In essence, Malone privatized
some of the job of returning abandoned property, turning to the
private-sector to perform a task the state had once paid public
employees to perform.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Malone's initiatives were hailed as market-driven
reforms on the cutting-edge of reinventing government.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican who came to office in 1991, at a time of severe
recession and deep red ink, Malone had pledged to make the office
run more efficiently after the long tenure of Democratic Treasurer
Robert Q. Crane.
</P>
<P>
   One way he did that was to lay off some of the large staff Crane
had accumulated at the Abandoned Property Division during his 26
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Malone decided, private heir finders, who earn a
percentage of what they recover, could use the unclaimed property
list the treasurer publishes in area newspapers each year. (State
law has required the prominent publication of that list at least
since the 1950s.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are heir finders fill a role that would have to be
filled by public employees,'' Malone said Monday. ``We would have
to hire dozens of public employees who would go out and find people
who have money coming to them. Here is a way that you can avoid
doing that hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and other measures, helped Malone cut staff and costs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during a time when the number of unclaimed dollars
more than doubled, to $105 million from $41 million, Malone reduced
the Abandoned Property Division to 29 workers, from 46. Even so,
his overall rate of returning unclaimed money was 23 percent to
Crane's 21 percent for a comparable eight-year period. During
Malone's last four years, he returned 28.7 percent to Crane's 16.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Neil Harrington, who now oversees the Abandoned
Property Division, said auditing costs actually increased under
Malone's privatization policies. But even using conservative
figures, Malone did well overall fiscally, inheriting a treasurer's
office budgeted at $13.9 million a year and reducing that amount to
almost half eight years later.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also pushed to limit the fees the private investigators
could collect. Before he came to office, the heir finders could
charge as much as 35 percent, the cap set by the Legislature in
1953.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Malone's initiative, that amount was capped at 10
percent for the Abandoned Property Division. (It's that stricture
that helped direct the heir finders to the more lucrative unpaid
check fund, which was not covered by the 19 pages of statute that
regulate other unclaimed property.)
</P>
<P>
   If O'Brien has cast the measure as one of inadequate controls,
Malone, understandably, sees it more as a matter of personnel
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try your best to find honest people to execute your
policies,'' Malone said. ``But once in a while, whether it is a bad
doctor at a hospital or an employee at a bank . . . you can have
people who end up doing something dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of Malone's earliest and best-publicized moves
may, in a roundabout way, have helped set the stage for this
scandal. When Malone took office, the treasury employed a dozen
tellers who operated a State House bank. All told, expenses topped
half a million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Malone replaced those tellers with an ATM machine. That allowed
significant cost-cutting. But it also meant the tellers had to find
other jobs. One of them was John Trischitta, a long-time treasury
employee who eventually ended up working in the treasury's Unpaid
Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   There, Trischitta allegedly played the inside man in a scheme to
defraud the state of $6.5 million from the Unpaid Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   So will O'Brien move back to a greater reliance on state
employees?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the new treasurer seemed unsure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to go in and look,'' O'Brien said. ``I certainly think
that heir finders could provide a legitimate function . . . But my
job is to make sure I do the best job to reunite the legitimate
owners of the property or the rightful owners of those checks.''

OLIVETTI SHARES FALL AS COMPANY PREPARES TO RESUBMIT OFFER FOR
TELECOM ITALIA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The shares of Olivetti SpA, the No. 2 Italian phone
company, weakened Tuesday for the second consecutive day,
reflecting increased concern among investors about Olivetti's $60
billion bid to acquire Italy's largest phone company, Telecom
Italia.
</P>
<P>
   The bid met a serious setback on Monday, when Italian stock
market regulators ruled it was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   After falling nearly 8 percent on that news on Monday, Olivetti
shares fell 2 percent Tuesday, to 2.906 euros, or $3.19, on the
Milan exchange. Olivetti said it considered the bid valid and would
resubmit the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Colaninno, Olivetti's chief executive, met Tuesday with
Italian officials and said Olivetti had been in contact with the
market regulator, CONSOB. CONSOB officials said Olivetti was free
to resubmit a revised offer.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling his determination, Colaninno convened a meeting on
Tuesday of the board of Bell SA, a Luxembourg-based holding company
that owns a controlling stake in Olivetti, and the board approved a
capital increase to help maintain it. That was necessary because
Olivetti's board is meeting on Wednesday and is expected to approve
a capital increase totaling 2.5 billion euros, or $2.75 billion, as
part of the financing for the takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   Time is not on Olivetti's side. Franco Bernabe, Telecom Italia's
chief executive, was sequestered most of Tuesday with advisers
designing plans he will present to Telecom's union leaders on
Wednesday aimed partly at immunizing Telecom against further
hostile takeover attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom's share price, which soared on Monday on speculation
that a sweeter takeover offer would emerge from Olivetti's bid,
fell back 3 percent Tuesday, to 9.565 euros.
</P>
<P>
   One step said to be under consideration by Telecom is to buy
shares it does not hold in its mobile phone provider, Telecom
Italia Mobile, in which it now has a 60 percent share. To do so
would lift Telecom's net worth and raise the price Olivetti would
have to bid for Telecom. Telecom Italia Mobile's shares rose almost
3 percent Tuesday for the second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures said to be under consideration, people close to
Telecom said, included converting nonvoting shares in Telecom, for
which Olivetti is not bidding, to ordinary shares with voting
rights. That too would raise the price for Olivetti. Both measures
together would increase Telecom's market value to roughly $116
billion, almost double the cost of Olivetti's initial offer. &QL;

JURY QUICKLY FINDS DEFENDANT GUILTY OF MURDER IN TEXAS DRAGGING
DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ With exceptional swiftness, a jury on Tuesday
declared John William King, a white man, guilty of capital murder
for dragging a black man to his death behind a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   The jury began deliberations after less than five days of
testimony and barely an hour of closing arguments, chose its only
black member as foreman and returned two and a half hours later
with the strongest possible verdict. Jurors then quickly began
hearing evidence on whether King should be sentenced to death for
murdering James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice has been served,'' said a tearful Mary Verrette, one
of Byrd's sisters, as she emerged from the 110-year-old Jasper
County Courthouse. ``It was not decided on emotion but on facts,
and that's all we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, slumped slightly as the verdict was read by Judge Joe
Bob Golden of State District Court but showed no other emotion.
Byrd's relatives and others in the packed courtroom burst into
applause as the jury rose to leave the courtroom after the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   King is one of three white men charged with killing Byrd, 49, in
the dark, early hours of June 7, 1998, dragging him on a chain
behind a pickup truck for three miles down rural roads in the pine
woods east of Jasper. Trial dates have yet to be set for the other
defendants, Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, who met King when the two
were in prison, and Shawn Berry, 23, who has known King since high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that King was plotting to form his own white
supremacist gang in Jasper _ the Texas Rebel Soldier Division of
the Confederate Knights of America _ and had hoped to use the
grisly death of a local black man to help recruit members and,
perhaps, to provide a blood initiation into the gang for Berry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any jury in the country would have decided it the same
way,'' said Guy James Gray, the Jasper County district attorney,
who led the prosecution. ``You can't put up with this sort of
stuff. You can't tolerate it. It could've happened anywhere in this
nation, but it fell on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray and others said they were not surprised that it took the
jury so little time to come to a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not surprised that they decided so fast, because the
evidence was overwhelming,'' said Ethel Parks, a black Jasper
resident who came to the courthouse to hear the verdict. ``For
once, they did something right in Jasper.''
</P>
<P>
   After a break of only a few minutes, court reconvened to begin
the punishment phase of the trial, in which both sides will argue
which of the two potential sentences, death by lethal injection or
life imprisonment, should be given to King. Prosecutors said they
expected the jury to begin deliberating on punishment as early as
Thursday, and certainly before the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which drew international attention and brought back
memories of Southern lynchings from decades past, began with the
discovery of Byrd's body, scattered in pieces along the country
road where he was dragged. He had last been seen alive in the back
of the pickup after hitchhiking home from a late-night party.
Byrd's head and right shoulder were sheared off when the truck sped
around a sharp corner and he slammed into a sharp-edged culvert.
His lower body was found a mile farther down the road, dumped
outside a cemetery and black church.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution called 43 witnesses, some of whom linked King to
the death scene (his cigarette lighter was found there, as was his
DNA on a cigarette butt) and some of whom exposed his racist
attitudes (his arms and torso are covered with Nazi and white
supremacist tattoos and his writings disclosed a deep hatred of
blacks and a yearning for fame).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling testimony came on Monday, when a
pathologist described how Byrd had been alive through much of his
ordeal, probably until his body was cut in two. Also on Monday,
prosecutors placed in evidence what they considered their coup de
grace, a letter that King had tried to smuggle out of his jail cell
to Brewer in which he asserted that ``regardless of the outcome of
this, we have made history and shall die proudly remembered if need
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense offered only three witnesses Monday in a case that
lasted less than an hour. One of them, a prison artist responsible
for some of King's tattoos, testified that King wore them to scare
off fellow prisoners who might try to harm him.
</P>
<P>
   The jury had three choices today: to find King not guilty, to
find him guilty of capital murder (which meant that he murdered
Byrd while in the process of committing another crime, in this case
kidnapping) or to find him guilty of a lesser murder charge. King's
lawyers focused much of their attention on refuting the kidnapping
charge, hoping to save their client from a capital murder
conviction and the subsequent possibility of execution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We know that a terrible, terrible, brutal, horrendous murder
was committed,'' said Brack Jones, a lawyer for King. ``No
question. The question is, Was Byrd kidnapped?''
</P>
<P>
   Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs, the chief defense lawyer, asked the
jurors not to let King's repellant views sway them into finding
more guilt than the evidence showed. He acknowledged that his
client was a racist. ``Not that I agree with that,'' he said. ``But
you have a right to be a racist.''
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Pat Hardy, one of the prosecutors,
asked, ``What makes a person hate so hard to do something like that
to a person they don't even know?'' The answer, he said, could only
be found in the racism that obsessed King.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy directed the jurors' attention to a Ku Klux Klan drawing
that was placed in evidence, showing a trio of horsemen galloping
from a fiery inferno. ``Robed riders coming straight out of hell,''
Hardy said. ``And that's exactly what they were that night. Instead
of a rope, they used a chain; instead of horses, there was a pickup
truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray argued that the community needed to rid itself of such
violent racism, almost as an issue of public health. ``It's
something that's a virus,'' he said. ``It's something that's
dangerous. It's something that spreads from one person to
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, on the sun-bright courthouse lawn, a palpable sense of
relief flowed through the small crowd that had gathered to hear the
verdict. While many feared that the trial would draw protests from
both extremes of the racial divide, life carried on much as usual
during the trial and there were no protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very relieved at the moment, but we still have some
healing to do,'' said Mayor R.C. Horn, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Matthews, a Jasper real estate broker whose office
overlooks the courthouse, came across the road to retrieve his dog,
Domino, who was scampering amid the television crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper is not a bad town,'' Matthews said. ``It's got some
good people in it. I think we're ready for you all to go home
now.''

$25 MILLION, OWNERS CAN'T BE MATCHED, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' Abandoned Property Division contains
millions of dollars for which the Treasury has no record of
ownership, present and former Treasury officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first sign that the growing financial scandal inside the
Treasury has spread to the Abandoned Property Division, officials
confirmed that as much as $25 million in unclaimed funds cannot now
be matched with their rightful owners because of missing records or
incomplete data.
</P>
<P>
   Tonia Duchano, Assistant Treasurer in charge of abandoned
property for three years before taking a private sector job last
month, said what once appeared to be a computer problem trying to
match unclaimed money with rightful owners could have a more
sinister root. Money from the state's Unpaid Check Fund, which is
supposed to be moved to the Abandoned Property Division after a
year, was transferred last year with no names attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the Unpaid Check Fund money, but never received any
names associated with it, as of today. It's millions,'' Duchano
said in a telephone interview. ``I truly believed at the time it
was a computer glitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Now? ``It just seems very odd,'' Duchano said.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation comes as John Trischitta, head of the Unpaid
Check Fund, is under investigation for bribery associated with the
theft of $6.5 million from the fund last November. Investigators
suspect Trischitta tipped off a so-called ``heir finder'' about the
names of people who were owed money by the state and then conspired
to transfer the sums to their own accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta, who has been placed on leave, was responsible for
moving money from the Unpaid Check Fund after one year into the
Abandoned Property Division. The Unpaid Check Fund holds money the
state owes to taxpayers, vendors and other agencies who have not
cashed the checks, often due to mail problems, company failures or
relocations.
</P>
<P>
   Although each check is supposed to be transferred after one year
to Abandoned Property, treasury employees say the normal practice
was to make large transfers every few months.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta made two large transfers, nearly $10 million in
September and $15.7 million last month, from Unpaid Checks to
Abandoned Property, where annual lists are printed to publicly
notify people that they have money to claim.
</P>
<P>
   But Duchano says the Treasury does not know who the rightful
owners are to as much as $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Robson, spokesman for new Treasurer Shannon O'Brien,
conceded the office is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was often some difficulty in terms of getting computers
to talk to one another and to translate this data,'' Robson said.
``What was once the EDIC became Ecdev. Who knows what Robert Smith
became.''
</P>
<P>
   Robson was referring to the Economic Development Industrial
Corp., an agency now controlled by the Boston Redvelopment
Authority. Martin Robbins, the New Hampshire man who allegedly
stole $6.5 million in EDIC checks, had them made out to ``Ecdev.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to touch off a three-alarm fire there, but there
is some concern about the quality of the data,'' Robson said.
</P>
<P>
   For the average citizen, the lack of documentation could mean,
for example, that some state tax refunds or vendor payments left
uncashed may never get to their rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   Duchano said she stayed in her job until former Treasurer Joseph
D. Malone left office in January and wrote an exit memo saying the
lack of identification problem was among a list of items that
needed to be addressed in the Abandoned Property Division.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only problem.
</P>
<P>
   Duchano says she had been butting heads for years with
Trischitta's boss, Robert Foley, ever since she replaced him as
manager of Abandoned Property, leaving Foley to oversee Cash
Management and the Unpaid Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Duchano says then-chief of staff, Beth Myers, called on her to
take over Abandoned Property because Malone felt there were not
enough controls in place.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Duchano took over Abandoned Property, Foley, who
could not be reached for comment, wrote out a check from the
Treasury's general account to ``John Doe'' for $1 million, using
Duchano's signature stamp.
</P>
<P>
   New Deputy Treasurer Michael Travaglini, confirmed that Foley
wrote the bogus check but said he did it to highlight how easy it
was to use another worker's rubber stamp signature to draw funds.
</P>
<P>
   The check was never cashed, according to Duchano, who was so
outraged over the incident she went to Malone with the problem. But
Foley was never fired. His last day, however, is Friday, because
O'Brien plans on replacing him with her own political appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Foley was saying he can't believe there were no controls.
What control is there when the deputy treasurer can write a
million-dollar check as a joke -- when he's in charge of the
controls?'' Duchano asked.

RULING SAID TO RAISE CENSUS COST BY $2 BILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has calculated that last month's Supreme Court
ruling restricting the use of statistical sampling will force it to
spend about $2 billion more than the $5 billion originally budgeted
for the next decennial headcount, according to a senior Census
Bureau official.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bureau says that, despite the extra money, the 2000
census may not be any more accurate than the 1990 one, which missed
an estimated 8.4 million people and double-counted an additional
4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The increased cost for the 2000 Census was described by an
official on condition that he not be identified. The Bureau plans a
news conference on Wednesday to discuss the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau, said that in the
agency's new design, ``we will be running harder to stay in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the characteristics that make the American population hard
to count _ increased mobility, households with two parents working,
people with limited English skills, suspicion of government, lack
of engagement with institutions _ are more present today than they
were in 1990,'' Prewitt said. ``We also believe the design for the
2000 Census is more robust, more innovative, more creative than
it's ever been. But even so, we don't expect to have any marked
improvement over what we had in 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for billions more in spending are a direct challenge to
House Republican leaders who opposed sampling, which many
politicians believe would give the Democrats a political advantage.
The House leaders have said they are willing to pay ``whatever it
takes'' to conduct a traditional census count.
</P>
<P>
   The rural and urban areas where the undercounts were most severe
tend to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled on Jan. 25 that federal law barred the
use of sampling to help estimate population counts used to
determine how many seats in the House of Representatives each state
will be allocated. But the Clinton administration has interpreted
the ruling as requiring the use of sampling to determine population
figures used in formulas for distributing federal aid to states and
local governments and for use in drawing boundaries for
congressional and state and local legislative districts. As a
result, the Census Bureau's new plans use some sampling, but on a
smaller scale than first conceived.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau had originally planned to count everyone, either by
receiving mail-back census forms or physically visiting their
homes, in 90 percent of the households in each of the country's
60,000 census tracts _ a neighborhood consisting of about roughly
1,700 dwellings. Census takers would then visit a small sample of
the remaining 10 percent and use information from that group to
estimate data about those who were missed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the original plan called for the census takers to
conduct interviews with a nationwide sample of 750,000 households.
The results of this survey would be used to adjust the population
counts of states, cities, neighborhoods, even city blocks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the high court's ruling, the bureau's new plans
call for an effort to count 100 percent of the households in each
census tract, visiting each dwelling several times and making
numerous telephone calls to try to get the required data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs just skyrocket as you go after those last
hard-to-count and don't-want-to-cooperate,'' said a senior bureau
official. ``That's what happens when you try to get that last 10
percent and that's what sampling was supposed to take care of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau will still conduct a large post-census survey and use
the results to determine where errors were made during the effort
to count all households and to adjust the population counts
accordingly. But officials said that the size of the sample in this
survey would be scaled back to 300,000 households from 750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Outside experts familiar with the bureau's plans said the agency
needed to reduce the size of its post census survey because it was
being squeezed by the calendar. Trying to count everyone by
traditional means will take much longer than trying to count 90
percent and using sampling to estimate the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they don't get into the field with the
post-enumeration survey until they close the field office for the
traditional enumeration, which is going to be much later if there's
not going to be sampling,'' said Stephen Fienberg, professor of
Statistic and Social Science at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's new plans will open another front in the continuing
battle between the administration and House Republicans over the
2000 census. House Republican leaders have insisted that the next
census have only one official number for the nation's population
and that number be derived without using sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's plan will produce, in essence two numbers: one
compiled without using sampling that will be used to apportion
House seats among the states and another that uses sampling that
can be used for everything else, including the politically
sensitive issue of drawing lines for congressional and other
legislative districts.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland _ The chief executive of a leading machinery
company says that in five years his company will adopt the euro. A
city council debates whether its citizens should be allowed to pay
taxes in euros. Local banks open a clearinghouse in Frankfurt,
Germany, for transfers and settlements in euros.
</P>
<P>
   France? Germany? Another country that has adopted Europe's new
single currency?
</P>
<P>
   No, Switzerland, which could not join the 11 nations that have
embraced the euro even if it wanted to because it is not a member
of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the euro is expected to stoke debate about
whether the Swiss, recently immersed in a pained discussion of
their financial role as a neutral nation during the Nazi conquest
of much of Europe, should forfeit their cherished separateness as
Europe unifies all around them.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the country to desert the venerable Swiss franc
any time soon. The people are divided, their political parties even
more so, and a land of glacial public debate _ where issues are
subjected again and again to referendums _ can hardly expect an
early or easy decision. Bankers are less concerned about which
currency to choose than about the bubble in world stock markets or
the financial crisis in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this has kept the Swiss, especially companies with
extensive outside ties, from approaching the euro with an affection
that eclipses that in some of their larger neighbors. ``For us, the
euro has become a reality, a new and convenient currency,'' said
Fritz Fahrni, chief executive of Sulzer AG, a $4 billion-a-year
industrial group that manufactures everything from weaving machines
to medical devices like pacemakers. Within five years, Fahrni
predicted, the euro could supplant the Swiss franc as the official
currency at Sulzer, which does more than half its business
elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the reality of the euro even in the 11 participating
nations remains a bookkeeping and securities-trading phenomenon
until 2002, when euro bills and coins will come into circulation,
changing hands across shop counters. In this country, acceptance of
the euro started for the most part with the banks, which risked
losing international business if they were not prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the banks we do business with, especially in France
and Germany, were not very well prepared,'' said Klaus Wellershoff,
chief economist for Switzerland at the Warburg Dillon Read unit of
the largest Swiss bank, UBS AG.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss franc, the pillar of this small country's financial
might, may be too crucial a strut of Swiss prosperity to be
jettisoned any time soon. Still, the reasons for the enthusiasm for
the euro seem clear. Switzerland, with just over 7 million people,
is surrounded by four euro nations _ Germany, France, Italy and
Austria _ and conducts about 70 percent of its trade with the 15
nations of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   So it is quickly becoming a two-currency nation. Manufacturers
are ready to do business in euros, hotels to take payment in euros.
Big retailers like Migros AG, a kind of Swiss Wal-Mart, are
programming cash registers for both currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, any significant participation will take longer _
perhaps much longer. Rudolf Baer, chief executive of Bank Julius
Baer, expects that East European countries lined up to join the
European Union in the next few years will take precedence.
Switzerland, whose voters rejected a move toward European Union
membership in a referendum in 1992, does not have a realistic
chance of joining the European Union, he said, before 2010.
</P>
<P>
   One big concern in the meantime is that the Swiss franc could
grow too strong. If, at any point, a weakening euro spurs a flight
of investment capital into Switzerland, the Swiss franc's value
would rise, making the country's exports more expensive and
undermining growth.
</P>
<P>
   Some large Swiss companies base their business on currencies
other than the franc. ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the giant
Swiss-Swedish industrial group, uses the dollar. ``We are seen as a
global company,'' Goran Lindahl, ABB's president and chief
executive, said in an interview. ``If we go to the euro, then we
are seen as a European company.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lindahl will not rule out, somewhere down the line,
having ABB quote its shares on European stock markets in euros as
well as in Swiss francs and Swedish kronor, as it does now. And ABB
is fully prepared to bill customers in euros if they wish, and to
pay suppliers in euros. Over time, ABB expects to use fewer
currencies, lowering transaction costs and perhaps simplifying
bookkeeping. It thinks this will reduce administrative costs,
though it cannot say by how much.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss machinery industry _ the biggest exporter, with $37
billion in outside revenue _ consists not only of giants like ABB
but also of midsized manufacturers like Sulzer, and they are fast
shifting to euros. Roughly two-thirds of total Swiss machinery
exports go to European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Fahrni pushed Sulzer's accountants and computer
specialists to begin preparations, so that by the beginning of last
month, when the 11 countries formally adopted the euro, ``almost
all internal procedures, like billing and receiving euros,'' were
in place. In recent negotiations with Sulzer's fuel oil suppliers
in London, Fahrni was told that long-term contracts for oil would
soon be in euros.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, he said, will eliminate the costs of hedging against
currency fluctuations, shaving 1 to 2 percent off transaction costs
for the sale of products like textile looms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are risks. If the euro weakens against the Swiss
franc, Sulzer bears the currency loss. From 1994 to 1995, the
dollar slipped nearly 25 percent against the Swiss franc, so while
Sulzer's business in the United States grew 10 percent in dollar
terms, it shrank 5 percent in francs. ``To a lot of outside people,
that was hard to understand,'' Fahrni said.

 &HT;    Texas lawmakers: Auto insurance deregulation would curb costs
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two lawmakers who want to free auto insurers
from some state regulation said Tuesday that their plan would bring
rates down.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Wentworth and Rep. Harold Dutton have filed bills to
deregulate the price of auto insurance. State officials still would
keep tabs on insurers' financial stability and would root out
illegal discrimination, but individual companies would set their
own rates.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer representatives say many companies now charge the
maximum allowed by state law.
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth (R-San Antonio) and Dutton (D-Houston) said companies
that set their rates too high would be run out of business or
forced to lower their prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood is that prices will go down,'' Dutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the Texas Department of Insurance each year
sets benchmark rates in 52 territories around the state. Insurers
subject to rate regulation can set their premiums from 30 percent
above to 30 percent below the benchmark rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Schneider, a policy analyst for Consumers Union, warned that
some rate-regulated companies already are testing the limits of the
current system. Several of the state's largest companies, including
Farmers, Allstate and Texas Farm Bureau, have rates about 30
percent above the average state benchmark rate, according to the
insurance department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give them an inch and they will take a mile,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth said information used to set the state rates can be as
much as two years old. He also said the current system forces good
drivers to pay too much and allows bad drivers to pay too little.
That's because drivers are lumped into broad categories, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a deregulated system, Wentworth said, insurers could more
accurately categorize drivers so that insurance for bad drivers
isn't subsidized by good drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most of us pay is determined under an outdated regulatory
system,'' Wentworth said. ``This measure will bring some
long-needed reform to this area and could result in savings up to
$500 million annually for Texas consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth based that figure on the experience of Progressive
County Mutual. The Austin-based company is one of 24 in the state
not subject to rate regulation under Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   County mutual companies were left out of regulation decades ago
because they once were owned by groups of farmers and ranchers who
shared profits among themselves. Though some remain independent,
many county mutuals are aligned with rate-regulated companies.
Jerry Johns, president of Southwestern Insurance Information
Service, an industry group, said deregulating the industry would
encourage companies to do more business in all areas of the state.
That would mean more competition and lower prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have to look at what competition has done to the price
of airline fares and gasoline prices to see how consumers benefit
from a system where market forces dictate costs,'' Johns said.
``The market will take care of any company that abuses this
privilege. They will be driven from the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Newly appointed Insurance Commissioner Jose Montemayor said his
chief concern is that the department retain the authority to reject
rates deemed excessive.

 &HT;    Marking income limit for Texas insurance program tangles
lawmakers
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When it comes to their children's health,
William and Robbie Voges face a stark choice: Should they pay for
food, clothing and housing _ or insure the kids against a medical
catastrophe that might never happen?
</P>
<P>
   William Voges, a heater and air conditioner technician, makes
$27,000 a year and gets full health benefits. But health insurance
for his three children would cost him an additional $280 a month _
money the family doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 200 some-odd dollars a month, and that throws us $200
short on paying our bills,'' Robbie Voges said.
</P>
<P>
   The Voges aren't alone: Many families can't afford private
health insurance for their children but make too much to qualify
for Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor. So they
forego insurance and hope for the best, skipping the checkups that
could keep their kids healthy and prevent financially disastrous
major illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' soon-to-be-launched Children's Health Insurance Program
would use federal and state money to cover hundreds of thousands of
the Texas children who are in that gap. But Gov. George W. Bush and
state lawmakers are still wrangling over whether the program will
cover people making up to twice the federal poverty level or only
150 percent of it. The federal poverty level for a family of four
is about $16,500.
</P>
<P>
   In public, officials frame the issue as budgetary: Can the state
afford to cover all uninsured families that make as much as $33,000
for a family of four? Privately, some lawmakers and policymakers
question whether the government should be helping to insure
children in families that make that much money.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents, hairdressers and bank tellers in Austin make an
average of close to $24,700, or 150 percent of the federal poverty
level for a family of four. The average salaries of legal
secretaries and mechanics are close to $28,000, or 175 percent of
the poverty level for a four-person family. Austin plumbers and
accountants make an average of about $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before the legislative session, an interim committee recommended
the 200 percent income threshold. But under federal rules, the
governor must sign off on the CHIP plan that is sent to Washington
for federal approval, and the Health and Human Services Commission
has drafted a proposal that would cover families making up to 150
percent of the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has delayed sending that plan to Washington, and
discussions between lawmakers and his staff are continuing. He said
Tuesday that a compromise of 185 percent of the poverty level is
being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   About 471,000 of the estimated 1.4 million uninsured Texas
children are in families that make more than the federal Medicaid
limit but less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
Overall, nearly a quarter of Texans weren't covered by health
insurance in 1997, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The state's
24.5 percent uninsured rate was tied with Arizona for worst among
the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the 150 percent threshold say it would be fiscally
irresponsible to go any higher because future federal CHIP
contributions are uncertain, and nobody knows how many people will
enroll in the program. Currently, the federal government puts in
about $3 for every $1 from the state. Privately, some also question
spending money to insure people making as much as twice the federal
poverty level. State Rep. Rob Junell, the House's leading budget
writer, said several lawmakers have expressed such concerns to him.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the 200 percent threshold say advocates of the
lower level are overestimating the number of people who will enroll
in the program. They also note that many other Republican governors
have chosen the higher threshold. Rep. Glen Maxey (D-Austin) has
portrayed the question as a test of Bush's professed
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the debate about income levels concerns the
approximately 598,000 uninsured Texas children who are eligible for
Medicaid but not enrolled. Many families who have left the rapidly
shrinking welfare rolls mistakenly believe that because they no
longer receive welfare benefits, their children aren't eligible for
Medicaid. Others are daunted by the Medicaid bureaucracy, or
dissuaded by the stigma of getting government help.
</P>
<P>
   Because the state will mount an aggressive outreach program as
part of CHIP, it is likely that many families will discover that
their children are eligible for Medicaid and enroll them.
Proponents of the 150 percent limit note that because no one is
sure how much Medicaid ``spillover'' there will be, the state
should concentrate on serving the poorest group.
</P>
<P>
   Junell (D-San Angelo) suggested that the Legislature look at the
results of the first five months of the program _ it would be
implemented in July 2000 _ and debate the income threshold next
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``This session is not the time to determine where we're
ultimately going to be on a CHIP program,'' Junell said.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the higher level worry that if the governor
submits a plan with the 150 percent threshold, it may be difficult
to change later on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing about the plan going to Washington is that it
needs to stay as flexible as possible and not have us locked into a
poverty level that we can't adjust as the enrollment rises or
falls,'' Maxey said. ``If the money's available and children up to
200 percent of the poverty level need health insurance, there's no
logical reason why we shouldn't cover them.''

 ZURICH, Switzerland: Fahrni said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thus, for many Swiss business leaders and economists,
``considerable concern'' exists for the stability of the Swiss
franc and euro exchange rate, said Georg Rich, chief economist at
the Swiss central bank. The flip side is that the reliable franc
helps bolster Switzerland's position as a prime banking nation.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, while Rich said no evidence existed that the Swiss
franc played a meaningful role as a global reserve currency like
the dollar or yen, the replacement by the euro of major European
currencies like the German mark could strengthen the Swiss franc by
increasing its attractiveness for private investors in search of
currency diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss financial companies are approaching the new currency with
gusto. The stock exchange here is ready to trade in both Swiss
francs and euros, said its spokesman, Ettore Candolfi. Last year,
the major Swiss banks opened a clearinghouse in Frankfurt, the
Swiss Euro Clearing Bank, to process euros within Switzerland. The
clearinghouse is 60 percent controlled by the nation's two largest
banks, UBS and Credit Suisse. An electronic bank-payments system,
which handles roughly 480,000 transactions a day worth more than
$140 billion, is thus shielded from competing European banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an outsider, the Swiss took on the euro much more
pro-actively,'' Wellershoff of UBS said. His bank believed that the
euro would have a ``strong impact on the architecture of finance''
by sparking a wave of mergers and acquisitions among both financial
institutions and their industrial clients. Indeed, UBS is the
result of the combination last year of the market leader, Union
Bank of Switzerland, and the No. 3 Swiss Bank Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For Switzerland's private bankers, who add to the nation's
wealth by managing rich people's money for a fee, the euro is most
welcome. ``If it's good for European economies,'' Baer of Bank
Julius Baer said, ``then by implication it's good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, asset managers have been reprogramming computers to
provide euro reporting to clients, if desired, and insure that
securities, whether government bonds or company shares, are
converted to euros. ``If you're an international custodian, you
have to deal with all of this,'' Baer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond markets once fragmented by national currencies are now
unifying, and analysts must learn to assess national risk among
European countries much the way they rank American states' bonds.
Among investment funds, where clients were once advised to
diversify into, say, French francs or German marks, there are now
euros. And where stock choices were once made along national lines,
``we're moving to a sectoral approach,'' Baer said, ``and it's
happening very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, financial expertise, not location, is increasingly what
will give Switzerland a competitive edge. Citing electronic brokers
like Charles Schwab, Baer said: ``In five or 10 years the client
will never know where a transaction is processed. And I'm not
really sure he cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellershoff said the recent discussion of the Swiss role in Nazi
times could lead to a greater willingness among younger Swiss to
become part of Europe. ``During the Cold War, the Swiss were glad
that they had not many enemies because they were neutral,'' he
said. ``But the whole public debate brought to people's attention
that Switzerland has not many friends in the world, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, say that conservative Swiss politicians opposed
to entry into the European Union and use of the euro will muster
their arguments convincingly, particularly by suggesting that
entering Europe would cost the Swiss dearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisive problem for the Swiss is, What would it cost?''
said Fredmund Malik, a management professor in St. Gallen, in
eastern Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Europe's wealthiest nations, Switzerland would be
assessed an immense contribution to the European Union budget, he
said. And if nothing changed, the Swiss, with scant inflation,
would be in the curious situation of having to lift interest rates
so they would be in line with those of the euro countries. Swiss
homeowners _ just one group that would feel the pain _ could expect
to see their mortgage interest rates double.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys, Malik acknowledged, showed a thin majority of
the Swiss now in favor of joining the European Union, which would
almost certainly mean adopting the euro. Yet, he acknowledges, ``it
won't become an urgent matter.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Swiss business, he added, ``those companies that want to
be in Europe are already there.''

NORTHWEST EXPORTERS WIN CONTRACTS UNDER RUSSIA AID PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 ((Story moving in both the ``a'' and ``f'' categories.)
 &HT;     By RON REDMOND  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Northwest exporters have won their first contracts
under an $885 million U.S.-Russia food aid deal, providing 850
metric tons of dried peas and lentils to help alleviate anticipated
shortages this year in the cash-strapped nation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they hope the two contracts awarded this week,
although relatively small, will be the first of several that will
benefit Northwest farmers, exporters and ports that have pioneered
links with the Russian Far East and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not millions, but it's a start,'' said Meg VanSchoorl, an
international trade specialist with the Washington State Department
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before the Russians had asked for food aid, some of our
exporters called me and ... said we were in a really good position
here to contribute because of the connections we have developed
with Russia over the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   VanSchoorl and Carol Vipperman, president of the Seattle-based
Foundation for Russian-American Economic Cooperation, said between
30 and 40 percent of the total 3.1 million-ton aid package could go
to the Russian Far East, a market largely pioneered by Northwest
interests.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of Northwest growers, exporters, port officials,
members of the Washington state congressional delegation and others
have for months been lobbying the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and the Clinton administration on the advantages offered by this
region as a food source as well as shipper.
</P>
<P>
   In a December letter to Vice President Al Gore, all nine members
of the Washington state congressional delegation urged the
administration to ensure that:
</P>
<P>
   _ State commodities and processed foods be included in the food
aid package.
</P>
<P>
   _ Northwest ports be used to ship food aid to the Russian Far
East.
</P>
<P>
   _ Northwest agencies and private voluntary organizations be used
in the delivery and monitoring of the aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic crisis in Russia is having a devastating effect
on the Washington state export community, including agricultural
producers, manufacturers, traders and brokers, warehouse operators,
freight forwarders and service and shipping companies,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacific Northwest ports from the grain and barge terminals on
the Columbia River to container shipping facilities in the Puget
Sound have been hurt by the virtual halt in trade with the Russian
Far East.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still too soon to tell whether those efforts will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   VanSchoorl said half of the wheat specified for the program is
Midwestern hard red rather than the soft white variety grown in the
Northwest. Many of the other commodities are not produced in the
Northwest either, although the state group is trying to convince
the Agriculture Department and the Russians to add Washington
apples, canned pears, dehydrated potatoes and fresh and processed
meats to the aid mix.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, U.S. law requires that at least 75 percent of the
aid be transported on American flag carriers, if available, and
it's uncertain whether any domestic shippers operating in Puget
Sound will submit bids.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture and Russian officials signed the $885 million
food-aid deal in Moscow in early November.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the huge aid
package _ one of the few bright spots for the U.S. farm sector this
winter _ could be expanded next month when Russian Deputy Prime
Minister Gennady Kulik visits Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume this subject may come up,'' Glickman said when asked
if his department was considering more food aid for Russia. ``If
the needs are there, the United States will try to meet them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current agreement, the United States will give Russia
1.5 million tons of American wheat and sell another 1.5 million
tons of assorted foodstuffs with the help of long-term,
low-interest loans. The United States also will send 100,000 tons
of food directly to needy Russian regions through voluntary
humanitarian organizations like the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic crisis, along with dwindling food imports and
the worst grain harvest in at least 40 years, has raised concerns
about possible food shortages this year across the vast nation.
</P>
<P>
   The aid deal also is expected to ease the plight of Northwest
growers, hit by low prices and growing surpluses, as well as ports
that saw tonnages to Russia plummet since the economic crisis began
there last August.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wilbur, president of Seattle-based Thomas International
Inc., said that one Puget Sound shipping line's cargo to the
Russian Far East plummeted from some 500 containers per voyage last
summer to only 17 shortly after the August devaluation of the
ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.S. aid package, about $260 million will go for
transportation and distribution costs.
</P>
<P>
   VanSchoorl said the contracts awarded this week were for the
100,000-ton humanitarian program and went to BNP Lentil Co. of
Farmington, Wash., and Maviga of Spokane. The two contracts are
worth a total of $246,000. The peas and lentils will be shipped via
a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico to St. Petersburg, in western
Russia, VanSchoorl said.
</P>
<P>
   More contracts could be awarded as early as Wednesday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest exporters are particularly anxious to get details of
the two larger USDA programs _ the 1.5 million-ton wheat donation
as well as the concessional sales that will include 500,000 tons of
corn, 300,000 tons of soybean meal, 200,000 tons of soybeans,
200,000 tons of wheat, 100,000 tons of rice, 120,000 tons of beef,
50,000 tons of pork and 30,000 tons of non-fat dry milk.
</P>
<P>
   Vipperman said the U.S. side can't proceed until the Russians
identify what and how much they want and where it should go,
including port of entry and final destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the wheat, the Russians have to identify which ports they
want to ship it to,'' Vipperman said. ``Some of that wheat is
already stored in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the concessional food loans, it depends on what the
Russians want and where they want it to go. Then tenders will be
put out for the products and well as for the transport.''

LAWMAKERS WEIGH OPTIONS TO INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth W. Starr may be remembered as the attack
dog who went after Bill Clinton and ended up killing the office of
the independent counsel instead.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the independent counsel law indeed appears to be
on the brink of extinction, lawyers and lawmakers have begun to
convey a far more complicated picture of the office _ and of how
members of both parties have come to believe, 21 years after its
creation, that the position designed to address the abuses of
Watergate has essentially failed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans seem more committed than Democrats to seeing the
statute vanish; many Democrats, despite their complaints about
Starr's investigation of President Clinton, say they are willing to
see the law modified rather than killed. Together, their sentiments
raise an enduring mystery of federal government: How can the
president and top government officials be kept in legal check?
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Senate hearings to examine the fate of the
independent counsel, everyone in the Capitol appeared eager to
voice a response. Four pieces of legislation on the independent
counsel are expected to be filed in the House of Representatives
this year; four senators Tuesday appeared at two bipartisan press
conferences, each to express his displeasure with the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone _ even a former independent counsel _ seemed convinced
the problems long predated Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one who's really been criticized is Starr....I would
say anyone who uses an instrument helps kill it in the end,'' said
Lawrence Walsh, the former independent counsel who spent five years
and more than $35 million investigating Ronald Reagan's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Fred Thompson, whose Governmental Affairs Committee is
holding the hearings, said Starr's tenure in the office should be
examined, ``but this is not the Ken Starr show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really defeated the purposes we were originally
concerned with,'' said Thompson, a Tennessee Republican and a
former counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee. ``I don't know
of anyone who is really locked into the statute exactly as it is
today....as an individual who is placed in a position where he has
all the power and authority of the attorney general without the
checks and balances.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat from Massachusetts, agreed,
saying the 21-year attempt to provide an outside check on the
executive branch was a ``laudable goal, but often unattainable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a widespread feeling in Congress that the abuses
outweigh the benefits, and I share that view,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics make even longtime supporters of the statute
reel. Since its creation in 1978, there have been 21 independent
counsels, at a cost of roughly $160 million, $40 million of which
is the result of Starr. Five independent counsel offices _
including Starr's _ are still up and running, according to Senate
aides familiar with the statute.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, however, the five-year statute is set to expire,
unless Congress votes to renew it. According to members of both
parties in both houses of Congress, that vote would fail if it were
taken today; serious modifications will be needed for it to gain
enough support to be renewed in any form, members of both parties
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said Tuesday that there are four possible outcomes:
letting the law expire; reauthorizing it in its current form;
amending it; and letting it expire but replacing it with a
scaled-down version later on.
</P>
<P>
   The 1978 law was created out of the concern that the Justice
Department could not objectively investigate the administration for
which it worked. Now, some are willing to take their chances on the
Justice Department, while some cynics think that since the
independent counsel has become politicized over the years, the
government might as well save money by returning control to the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Among critics' chief concerns are the scope of investigations
and the jurisdiction of the attorney general. Starr, who in 1994
began by investigating the Clintons' land deals in Arkansas, ended
up broadening his mission until he believed he had discovered
Clinton lied to a grand jury about his affair with White House
intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton himself who had pushed for the law's
reinstatement: in 1992, after an Iran-Contra investigation that
Republicans viewed as unnecessarily long and vindictive, Congress
allowed the statute to expire. The White House urged its renewal,
and succeeded in getting it passed again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Attorney General Janet Reno has appointed numerous
independent counsels _ too many, according to Democrats, and not
enough by Republican standards.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, whose efforts failed to get an independent counsel
appointed to investigate questionable campaign fund raising by the
Clinton White House, seems to be leaning toward letting the law
lapse, and ``if it dies, Senator Thompson thinks Janet Reno gets
the blame,'' one Republican aide said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet others believe the positions on both sides are still
being shaped by Watergate. Howard Baker, the former vice chairman
of the Senate Watergate Committee, is among those expected to
testify at Wednesday's hearing. And Senator Carl Levin, a chief
architects of the provision in 1978, said its original purpose
should not be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say at the moment its unlikely to survive in its current
form,'' said Levin, a Democrat of Michigan, ``but the purpose it
serves is an important one.''

<P>
   ROME _ An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on
Tuesday, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing,
in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow
disaster in years.
</P>
<P>
   Driving snow and deadly winds prevented emergency helicopters
from flying into the ski village of Galtuer, near the Swiss border,
where local rescue workers spent the night digging through walls of
snow and rubble for survivors. At least 30 people, some of them
critically injured, were dug out by evening, Austrian television
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercest snowstorms in 50 years set off massive avalanches
all across the Alps in recent weeks, killing dozens of residents
and ski vacationers in France, Switzerland, Italy and Austria. In
Switzerland, officials said the death toll over the weekend had
risen to seven. Houses, railroads and highways were buried by
avalanches. Tens of thousands of tourists were stranded in some of
northern Europe's most fashionable resorts.
</P>
<P>
   In Galtuer, a town of 700 year-round inhabitants and about 3,000
tourists in Tyrol Province's Paznaun Valley, the avalanche
thundered though the heart of town near the village church at 4:00
p.m. instantly crushing four houses.
</P>
<P>
   The village, which has no hospital, had been cut off from the
outside world by heavy snows and high winds for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were drinking hot mulled wine, when suddenly it started''
Franz Wenko, a hotel operator in Galtuer, told Austrian television.
``he lights went out. It was dark. There was only dust and snow. We
got out of there as fast as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Thomas Schoenherr of the Austrian army, told Austrian radio
on Tuesday evening that about 55 people were feared missing in
Galtuer. Other estimates varied. Some officials said 20 to 30
people were still missing. Another government spokesman said that
only ``a few'' were unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian army helicopters remained grounded in the town of
Landeck, about 20 miles from Galtuer, overnight. Schoenherr said,
``We will meet again at 6 a.m. to assess what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the village, witnesses said the residents were digging
for survivors. ``Some 300 people are looking for buried people in
the mass of snow,'' Lufwig Walter, a ski instructor, told the
Austrian Press Agency. Walter said that in some parts of the
village, snow was 17 feet high. ``There's no let-up,'' he said,
referring to the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor, who is believed to be the only one in the village,
told an APA reporter by telephone, ``We are working in very basic
conditions.'' Snow fell heavily overnight, and the news agency
reported that another 20 inches were expected by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   All over Europe, the avalanches took lives and destroyed homes.
A 35-year-old German woman was killed when a snowslide ploughed
into a chalet in Sportsgastein, near Salzburg, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In the ski village of Morgex, in northern Italy, a 52-year-old
woman was killed when her house collapsed under an avalanche before
daylight. Three others in the house survived, but she was killed
when a steel beam pierced her chest.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, teams of rescue workers searching for survivors
found five more bodies on Tuesday, after an avalanche that crushed
chalets near Evolene on Sunday. Four of the victims _ one a child _
were French tourists. The other was a 28-year-old local man. Three
people were still missing as of Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In France, blizzards hampered rescuers seeking French skiers and
hikers missing in the Alps and the Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   In western Austria alone, about 20,000 tourists have been unable
to leave their hotels since last Wednesday. So much snow had fallen
over the last week that the Austrian Motoring Association
complained that its density monitors had been buried, making it
impossible to measure the snow fall. Swiss television reported that
as many as 60,000 people were snowbound in the resorts of Davos and
Klosters.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of Europe, driving snow caused trains to be
canceled. Highways were blocked or traffic was backed up for hours.
</P>
<P>
   The recent avalanches, labeled by some newspapers as ``the white
death,'' were described as the largest and most terrifying in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   `'I've seen many avalanches, but not the type that come into
your house and blow it away,'' said Nathan Wallace, 28, from
Mammoth Lakes, Calif., whose chalet near Chamonix was destroyed by
an avalanche on Feb. 9. `'It was more like a California
earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and his girlfriend, Alicia Boice, 21, were rescued two
hours after the roof of their chalet collapsed.

BLUE-CHIP ISSUES STRUGGLE AS DOW RETREATS 8.26 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed Tuesday as traders paused
after Monday's big advance and digested comments by Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve chairman, on the economy, inflation and
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks, which surged on Monday, struggled Tuesday. The
Dow Jones industrial average fell 8.26 points, or almost one-tenth
of a percent, to 9,544.42. During the day, the Dow climbed as much
as 58 points and fell as much as 79.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also edged down, falling
0.96 point, or nearly one-tenth of a percent, to 1,271.18.
</P>
<P>
   However, positive comments by Mary Meeker, a technology and
Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, as well as by
Greenspan, helped to push prices of stocks like Microsoft and
Amazon.com higher.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 34.34 points,
or 1.5 percent, to 2,376.35. And TheStreet.com's Internet index
gained 23.55 points, or 4.8 percent, to 514.53.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the role of technology had not only helped to
dampen inflation but had also served as an anti-protectionist
influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technological breakthroughs have progressively broken down
barriers to cross-border trade,'' Greenspan said during his
semiannual testimony to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, Greenspan's comments about labor markets and
inflationary pressures did not sit well with the bond market, and
Treasury prices fell.
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders seemed to pay little notice Tuesday, but some
analysts suggested that a rate increase would not be good news for
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If bonds stabilize and rally, we will probably see inflows
into the market,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at
Cantor Fitzgerald. ``But if bond yields go through the
psychologically important level of 5.5 percent, it will be
difficult to get the market to go higher.'' The yield on the
30-year issue rose to 5.43 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette, suggested that several seasonal factors were preying on
bonds, including big income tax refunds, which are helping to
bolster consumer spending, and the end of Japan's fiscal year on
March 31, which has encouraged Japanese companies to bring back
gains realized in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a short-term phenomenon,'' Galvin said. ``The
stock market is in something of a consolidation phase, and we are
entering into an information void that will last for another few
weeks, when companies will start issuing advisory statements on
first-quarter earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's three best performers Tuesday were financial
companies. American Express gained 3 1/8, to 111 5/8. Citigroup
rose 2 3/4, to 58 3/16. And J.P. Morgan was up 2 5/16, to 115 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   However, those gains were not enough to offset losses by
companies like General Motors, which fell 1 15/16, to 85 9/16;
Procter &AMP; Gamble, which dropped 2 1/4, to 90 3/4; or Coca-Cola,
which lost 1 11/16, to 62 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Among technology shares, Microsoft jumped 6 5/8, to 155 7/16.
Oracle gained 3 15/16, to 58 1/2. EMC closed at 108 5/16, up 4 1/8.
And Amazon.com rose 8 11/16, to 115 3/16.

CAMPAIGN BLAMING STARR RAISES MILLIONS FOR PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE
FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  ( nk ) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's legal defense fund has raised
$4.6 million in the last year, buoyed by a direct-mail campaign
that blamed Kenneth Starr and the congressional impeachment process
for saddling the first family with ``a staggering personal debt''
of nearly $9 million, several supporters said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, the Clinton Legal Expense Trust, has raised $2.4
million since August from 35,000 donors, eclipsing the most
optimistic projections of the president's supporters and the $2.2
million raised in the trust's first six months of operation last
year, according to the supporters who were briefed on the progress.
</P>
<P>
   Small donations _ $10 here, $20 there _ have poured in, the
supporters said, but there have also been $10,000 checks from
corporate executives and Hollywood friends.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president's continued strong showing in public opinion
polls, the trust's windfall is a measure of Clinton's enduring
popularity despite being the first elected president to be
impeached. Several supporters said the trust's success also
reflected the opinion among Clinton's supporters that the inquiry
by Starr, the independent counsel, and the impeachment proceedings
had been inherently unfair and deeply partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direct mail has been off the chart,'' said one supporter
who helped raise the money and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``The president has never been more popular. And there is a lot of
sympathy for him. We didn't have to ask most people twice for
help.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than half of the Clintons' debts erased in a single
year, supporters said Tuesday that there is a strong chance that
the entire legal bill could be paid by the time the president
leaves office in 23 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``No president, especially a president who has worked as hard
for the American people, should be burdened with this kind of debt
when he leaves office,'' said Terence McAuliffe, one of Clinton's
closest friends, who raised much of the money for the trust.
McAuliffe declined to discuss how much money the trust had raised.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers of the president have said that Clinton's total
legal bills in his two terms could exceed $10 million by 2001.
Erasing those bills is a major concern of the first lady, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who has told her advisers that the debt is a factor
as she decides whether to seek New York state's Senate seat in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first president to accept donations while in
office to help pay his lawyers' fees. Former President Richard
Nixon accepted donations to help defray legal bills after he
resigned from office, but he paid most of his legal bills himself.
</P>
<P>
   The trust's $4.6 million total far outpaces the $1.3 million
that was raised over a three-and-a-half-year period by the
president's original legal defense fund, which was disbanded in
December 1997 after campaign finance controversies and a strict
$1,000 annual limit had severely limited the flow of donations.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers and trustees of the new trust, which is headed by
former Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., plan to release the fund's total
contributions, and a complete list of donors, at a news conference
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters said that many of the 55,000 contributors wrote
checks for modest amounts, like $10 and $20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trust is not being funded by fat cats,'' McAuliffe said.
``These people are committed in insuring that this president, who
has worked so hard on their behalf, does not leave office
bankrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   But the supporters also said that they had received $10,000
checks from scores of corporate executives who are contributors to
the Democratic National Committee, including S. Daniel Abraham,
chairman of the Slim-Fast Foods Co. of West Palm Beach, Fla.;
Ronald Burkle, the California supermarket mogul; Alan J. Patricof,
the New York venture capitalist; and Dirk Ziff, co-chairman of Ziff
Brothers Investments of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the trust has received a windfall from the
president's Hollywood friends, including $10,000 checks from
filmmaker Steven Spielberg, actor Tom Hanks, performer Barbra
Streisand and film executive Harvey Weinstein.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Defending the president at the House impeachment hearings and at
trial in the Senate added at least $2 million to the Clintons'
legal bills, their supporters estimated Tuesday. The Clintons still
owe roughly $3 million to their lawyers, the supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also used the trust's proceeds to pay Robert S.
Bennett, who led his defense in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit. The suit was settled in November for $850,000, but that
sum was paid personally by the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the president's battery of lawyers have worked on
defending the Clintons in inquiries related to their Whitewater
real estate transactions and Democratic fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Several supporters said in interviews Tuesday that the fund's
success is owing mostly to the anger and frustration with the
House's impeachment of the president in December.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, the fund's executive director, Anthony F. Essaye,
asked potential contributors to write a check to the trust if they
were ``disturbed by the way politics is conducted today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's political climate, public service can exact a
disturbing price,'' Essaye wrote. ``There is, perhaps, no better
example than the situation facing president and Mrs. Clinton. The
effort to impeach President Clinton is only the latest in a series
of legal actions that have left the first family with a staggering
personal debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Essaye declined to comment Tuesday.

 Warning labels alone can make your head spin  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had a bit of a fright the other day, reading the warnings the
druggist included in the package with a doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time _ longer ago than some may remember _ when the
man in the pharmacy department typed a label, counted out the
pills, you carried them home and swallowed them as instructed.
</P>
<P>
   But now that we all wake up every morning trying to think of
somebody to sue, companies that make and sell drugs have to protect
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So when you pick up a prescription these days, it is apt to come
with literature describing bad experiences some people have had
with the medication. Never mind that their reactions could not be
absolutely verified and may have had some other wholly unrelated
cause.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings can scare you half silly. They go something like
this:
</P>
<P>
   /{CAUTION/}, (in large letters). /{Side effects may include one
or more of the following: dizziness, blinding headaches, confusion,
blurred vision, heart palpitation, seizures, incontinence, hair
loss, abnormal appetite, sensitivity to sunlight, deafness, skin
eruptions, short-term memory loss, difficulty sleeping, feelings of
general worthlessness and ungovernable rage./}
</P>
<P>
   These reactions, it is noted, have been reported only by a
statistically inconsequential number of patients using the
medication. The manifestations are for the most part transient, and
when use of the drug is discontinued they likely will pass.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they might not.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid driving a car, working around heavy machinery or making
important personal or financial decisions while taking this
medicine, the paper says. If the effects persist, see your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that by then it could be too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of shakes you up to read that,'' I told my wife. ``A
fellow would almost be afraid to use the stuff if he didn't have a
lot of those problems already.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have palpitations, and you govern your rage. Most of
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try, anyway.'' I tipped a couple of tablets out of the
bottle into my hand. They were white, and kind of dusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I take these, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be a powerful prescription,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid for it,'' I said. ``I'm not going to let it go to
waste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay out of the sun,'' she said. ``And try not to get
violent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   I ran a glass of water from the tap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put the cats and dogs in the basement, out of harm's way,'' I
told her. ``Lock yourself in the bedroom. And get the lawyer on the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him to stay by the phone, because I'm starting a new
prescription, and you may need to litigate.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a scandalous account of it in tomorrow's paper,
you'll know I was one of those poor devils _ unlucky, but
statistically inconsequential _ for whom things didn't turn out so
well.

LAWMAKERS SEEK CHANGES TO INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW AS EXPIRATION
NEARS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Long criticized by Republicans and lately lambasted
by Democrats, the law spawning Kenneth Starr's investigation of
President Clinton faces radical changes or certain death in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced (the independent counsel law) has not
outlived its uselessness,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, whose
Governmental Affairs Committee begins hearings Wednesday on the
statute that grew out of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel statute expires June 30 unless it is
re-enacted by Congress. If it dies, Starr and four other
independent counsels will continue their investigations of the
president, two Cabinet secretaries and two former members of his
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was enacted in 1978, the law has led to 21 executive
branch investigations at a cost of $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The special prosecutors have secured more than 50 criminal
convictions. Thirteen of those resulted from Starr's investigation
of Clinton's business dealings, which subsequently was expanded to
include travel office firings and alleged misuse of FBI files at
the White House, and the death of presidential aide Vincent Foster.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law has been criticized for years, first
by Republicans during the Reagan and Bush administrations, then
during the past year by Democrats. Drawing the Democrats' ire is
Starr's investigation of Clinton, which led to his impeachment,
then acquittal after the first Senate trial of a president in 131
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the law was renewed, ironically at Clinton's behest,
just months after he was targeted for investigation. Two years ago
and three years into Starr's investigation, Clinton complained that
the law's costs had outweighed the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a bipartisan consensus that the independent
counsel statute, as written, needs a very serious look and some
reforms if it's to be reauthorized,'' said White House press
secretary Joe Lockhart. ``We agree with that consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing is the first of four scheduled by Thompson's
committee. A House subcommittee is to conduct its first hearing
into the independent counsel law March 2.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the witnesses scheduled to testify Wednesday have
favored either scrapping the law altogether or narrowing its scope.
Former attorney general Griffin B. Bell and former Senate
Republican leader Howard H. Baker Jr. are scheduled to tell why
they found the statute ``seriously flawed'' in a recent joint
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute as it exists today should not be reauthorized,''
Thompson told reporters, holding out the possibility of radically
revising the law. ``The burden is on those who want to keep it
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the law's problems, the Tennessee Republican said, are the
tendency of prosecutors to deliver a ``rougher justice'' to some
officials and to get ``more involved in the impeachment process''
than is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on whether he was referring to Starr's investigation of
Clinton specifically, Thompson said, ``I would not say the
president was mistreated by Kenneth Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the ranking Democrat on the
Governmental Affairs Committee, argued for revising the independent
counsel law, which was originally passed to restore public trust in
government in the wake of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe abandoning the law would automatically return
civility to our political discourse or raise the public's trust,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the law was passed to avoid incidents like the
Saturday Night Massacre in 1974, when President Nixon ordered the
firing of Watergate special counsel Archibald Cox, which led to the
resignation of Attorney General Elliot Richardson who refused to
obey Nixon's order, and the firing of Deputy Attorney General
William Ruckleshaus, also for refusing to dismiss Cox.
</P>
<P>
   As written, the law calls for a three-judge panel to appoint an
independent counsel whenever the attorney general finds ``credible
evidence'' of wrongdoing by the president, vice president or by a
Cabinet member or other high administrative official. To give
investigations more credibility, the investigator is independent of
any oversight except when prosecutorial abuse can be proved.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Deputy U.S. Attorney Eric Holder told reporters that
the Justice Department wants Congress to ``tinker'' with the law.
Attorney General Janet Reno has complained about the lack of budget
restraints on the special prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's five-year investigation of Clinton has cost more than
$40 million and is expected to top $50 million this year. The tab
for Lawrence Walsh's six-year Iran-Contra probe of the Reagan and
Bush administrations ran $48.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ways being discussed to revise the law include
requiring independent counsels to have prosecutorial experience,
reducing the number of officials subject to investigation to the
president and a handful of other top officials, and transferring
some of the powers of present independent counsels to a public
integrity chief, confirmed by the Senate, within the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of the uphill struggle the law faces was a joint news
conference called early Tuesday by Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., to oppose any extension of the
independent counsel statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years and $150 million the independent counsel law
has brought down very few high-level officials,'' complained
McConnell, who chairs the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.
``Congress has established an elaborate system where we spend a
whole lot of money, build a great big fire, and fry a few small
fish. It's time to let that fire die.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has twice voted
against the law and an aide said he has not change his mind.
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., vowed Tuesday to ``do whatever
I can to terminate it.''

KURD LEADER CHARGED WITH TREASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The Kurdish guerrilla leader, Abdullah
Ocalan, who was captured in Kenya last week, was formally charged
on Tuesday with treason, a crime that can carry the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, but popular
sentiment in Turkey appears to favor capital punishment for Ocalan.
For years, he has been portrayed in the press and official
statements as a horrifically evil figure, and the authorities hold
him responsible for the estimated 30,000 deaths that his
14-year-old rebellion has cost.
</P>
<P>
   Under Turkish law, all death sentences are subject to
confirmation by a vote of Parliament. In the present climate, there
seems little doubt that Parliament would vote overwhelmingly to
confirm a death sentence for Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   The court session at which he was charged with treason on
Tuesday was before a single magistrate at the prison island of
Imrali in the Sea of Marmara, southwest of Istanbul. Ocalan has
been held there in isolation since he was returned a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The session was closed to the press and the public, and there
were no reports about what, if anything, Ocalan said in response to
the charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the European Union appealed for permission to send
observers to the trial. But Turkey reiterated on Tuesday its
earlier refusal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The EU's idea of sending observers to the trial means to
oppose and encourage interference in the independent judiciary,''
the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ``This attitude, which is
against the principle of a state of law, is not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said that observers not connected to organizations
might be admitted and that the presiding judges would decide on
individual cases.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign lawyers for Ocalan have been prevented from entering the
country. Several Turkish lawyers active in human rights groups have
accepted requests from his relatives to form a defense team.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes between army units and Ocalan's guerrillas have
continued since his arrest. A military statement on Tuesday said
that 14 guerrillas had been killed since Sunday. As is customary,
military casualties were not mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish newspapers reported that Ocalan had agreed to tape an
appeal to his followers to lay down their weapons, but no such tape
has appeared. Military officers have said that they are planning to
drop thousands of copies of a photo of Ocalan in handcuffs in front
of a Turkish flag over areas where guerrillas are active.
</P>
<P>
   In a report whose release this week was planned before Ocalan's
arrest, investigators from the Council of Europe said that Turkey
had progressed in its treatment of prisoners, but was still far
from meeting ideal standards.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by the council's Committee for the Prevention
of Torture and Inhumane or Degrading Treatment of Prisoners, said
investigators had found interrogation rooms ``of a highly
intimidating nature'' in some police stations, adding that such
rooms had ``no place in a modern police service.''

BOND PRICES TUMBLE IN RESPONSE TO GREENSPAN'S REMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also FED-GREENSPAN) 
(mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices fell sharply Tuesday as traders and
investors found a hint of higher interest rates later this year in
remarks by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, as he
presented the central bank's outlook for the economy to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Given the surprisingly strong 5.6 percent pace of economic
growth at the end of last year and no signs that the economy is
slowing significantly, investors were expecting some kind of
warning from the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was easy for them to see a threat of higher rates, for
instance, when Greenspan indicated to the Senate Budget Committee
that the three interest rate cuts last year, made to try to ward
off any harm from the global financial crisis, may have gone too
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve must continue to evaluate, among other
issues, whether the full extent of the policy easings undertaken
last fall to address the seizing-up of financial markets remains
appropriate as those disturbances abate,'' the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 4/32, to 97
12/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, jumped to 5.43 percent from 5.35 percent on Monday. This is
the second time in less than two weeks that the yield on the
30-year bond has jumped to levels not previously seen since August.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of concern about an interest rate increase later
this year, the yield on the October federal funds futures contract
rose to 5.00 percent from 4.90 percent. The contract is a signal of
sentiment about where some investors think the central bank will
have its interest rate target by fall. The federal funds target
rate is now 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert DiClemente, chief U.S. economist at Salomon Smith Barney,
said the lack of any immediate negative fallout from the currency
devaluation in Brazil and signs that the economy was still strong
have forced the market to reprice the outlook for interest rates
over the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, he thinks Greenspan is ``still unconvinced there
is any clear direction for policy.'' Although the Fed is discussing
whether it should take back some of the interest rate reduction
from last year, DiClemente said, ``it is premature to speculate
about who is going to win this tug-of-war.''
</P>
<P>
   One reflection of the Fed's indecision about the course of
policy was the balance in Greenspan's description of the economic
outlook. He cited factors that could make the economy grow too fast
or make it slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the implied warning about higher interest rates, he
said there was no sign yet of a resurgence of inflation. He added
that the ``recent experience does seem to suggest that the economy
has become less inflation prone than in the past, so that the
chances of an inflationary breakout arguably are, at least for now,
less than they would have been under similar conditions in earlier
cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   This uncertainty about the outlook is probably why he told the
senators that ``in light of all these risks, monetary policy must
be ready to move quickly in either direction.''

INDEPENDENT-COUNSEL LAW IS LIKELY TO BE KILLED OR HEAVILY REVISED 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of Senate hearings into the statute
authorizing independent counsels, the Watergate-era law looks well
on its way to becoming a casualty of the impeachment battle, with
senators of both parties predicting on Tuesday that it would be
heavily revised or killed off entirely.
</P>
<P>
   With sentiment against independent counsels growing in both
parties, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., the chairman of the
Governmental Affairs Committee, said his committee would explore in
hearings beginning on Wednesday whether there were ways to revise
the Independent Counsel Act. But, he warned, ``The burden is on
those who want to keep it alive in its current form.''
</P>
<P>
   Also signaling the widespread dissatisfaction with the law under
which Kenneth W. Starr conducted his investigation of President
Clinton, Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, said, ``I
intend to do what I can to see that it's terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   And an unlikely pair of senators _ Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the
chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a former general chairman of the
Democratic National Committee _ said they would fight together to
see the legislation expire when it comes up for renewal this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1978, with the noblest of intentions, both Republicans and
Democrats embarked on a path of mutually ensured destruction by
passing what could be called the ultimate law of unintended
consequences,'' McConnell said. ``In a perverse sort of way the
independent counsel law has actually diminished the importance of
ethics in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an independent counsel lurking behind every tree, the
public is no longer alarmed when a public official is
investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, who had supported the statute in the past, said on Tuesday
that it had ``criminalized the political process to such a degree
that it's no longer enough to defeat your opponents. If you can't
indict them and also incarcerate them, then the campaign battle's
not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the majority whip, said that the law
is ``in trouble.'' He added, ``It has to be reformed significantly
or it won't be reauthorized, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many proposed revisions are limits on who would be
covered so that only the most senior government officials, like the
president and vice president, could be investigated. Another
possibility would be limiting investigations to actions that have
taken place while an official was in office or seeking office.
Other lawmakers would impose time limits and cost limits.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such changes could stop the shift in sentiment against
the law is not clear. McConnell said flatly on Tuesday that the law
is ``not salvageable'' and hinted he and Dodd were prepared to lead
a filibuster, if need be, to stop its reauthorization.
</P>
<P>
   The law allowing the appointments of independent counsels was
enacted in 1978 as a way to insulate investigations of wrongdoing
by high government officials from political interference. It was
spurred by the Watergate scandal when Richard Nixon ordered the
dismissal of Archibald Cox, a special prosecutor who lacked any
statutory protection.
</P>
<P>
   The statute requires the attorney general to seek the
appointment of an independent counsel when there is substantial and
credible evidence of a crime by the president or a number of other
senior government officials ranging from the vice president to
cabinet members to senior White House staff members. A panel of
three federal judges selects the counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the law's opponents say that it created a prosecutor
free from any checks and balances, with Democrats pointing to
Starr's five-year investigation of Clinton, which began with an
Arkansas land deal but culminated in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel has an unlimited budget and can go
beyond the original mandate if the attorney general and the
three-judge panel approve. The attorney general can remove the
special counsel for cause, but Griffin Bell, a former attorney
general under President Jimmy Carter, has written that ``in the
practical world, no special counsel will ever be removed by an
attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been 20 independent counsels, and, according to a
Congressional Research Service report issued last November, 13 of
the investigations at that point had returned no indictments and
the total cost of all 20 independent counsel investigations was
approximately $148.5 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For years, Republicans were the sharpest critics of the law,
particularly in the aftermath of Lawrence Walsh's seven-year
investigation into whether the Reagan administration illegally
diverted funds from weapons sales to Iran to support the contra
rebels in Nicaragua. McConnell, who defended Starr for doing a
``good job with a bad law,'' reminded reporters on Tuesday that
Walsh had indicted Caspar Weinberger, the former defense secretary,
on the eve of the 1992 election. The indictment was seen by
Republicans as blatantly political.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy prompted Congress to let the law lapse for 18
months during the early 1990's. Clinton won its renewal in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also become disenchanted with Ms. Reno's
refusal to seek an independent counsel to investigate the campaign
finance practices of the 1996 Clinton re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are concerned that it's too readily used,'' said
Thompson, who was a former counsel on the Senate Watergate
Committee. ``Others are concerned it's not used in the most
appropriate cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Starr's investigation of Clinton and the
impeachment trial, Democrats too are now coming out in opposition
to the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent counsel law is going to die,'' predicted Sen.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``There's a history of a good many years of
independent counsels who have been unaccountable both for time and
expenditures. I regret I voted for authorizing it previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the ranking Democrat on the
governmental Affairs Committee, was left pleading on Tuesday that
the debate not turn into a referendum on Starr. ``These hearings
begin at a time of acute public cynicism toward government,'' he
said, ``and a real concern about a growing coarseness in our public
life. I for one don't think that anything will be gained, at this
time in particular, in abandoning this law.'' But he added,
``Surgery to the statute is probably in order.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee will hold at least four hearings in the next few
weeks and the House is to begin its own hearings next Tuesday. The
first witnesses on Wednesday are to be Bell and Howard Baker, a
former Senate majority leader. The pair, leaders of a bipartisan
commission on the Independent Counsel Act, reported in December
that it was time to let the legislation expire.

IN REVERSAL, CUBAN EXILES WILL BE TRIED IN PUERTO RICO  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ A federal judge here in the trial of
seven Cuban exiles accused of plotting to kill Fidel Castro has
reversed a ruling he made in January to move the trial to Miami and
instead has ordered the proceedings to continue in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the defendants, six of whom own homes in the Miami
area, said on Tuesday that they regarded the ruling, made on Monday
by U.S. district court Judge Hector M. Laffitte, a setback. Miami
is the bastion of the Cuban exile community, where convictions of
anti-Castro exiles are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities implicated the men in a failed plot to kill Castro
during a Latin American summit meeting in Venezuela. Most of the
defendants are said to have links to the Cuban-American National
Foundation, the powerful Miami-based lobby that opposes normal
relations with Cuba but says it supports only peaceful measures to
oust Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised by his turn-around, and I think he is
making a mistake,'' said Ricardo Pesquera, an Orlando, Fla.,
attorney for Angel Alfonso-Aleman, one of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Pesquera played down concerns that a jury in Puerto Rico would
be more likely to find the men guilty. ``The government may believe
it's easier to get a conviction in Puerto Rico, because they really
scrambled when the case was transferred to Miami,'' he said. ``That
just shows they don't think they have a good case.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge warned that the case could be moved to Miami if
prosecutors fail to establish Puerto Rico as the proper venue
during the trial itself. He said that the overriding motive for
keeping the case in Puerto Rico for now is that the docket for
criminal cases in Miami is backlogged.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the Coast Guard arrested four
defendants off Puerto Rico in October 1997 after two assault
rifles, nightscopes, military fatigues and a satellite telephone
were found aboard their cabin cruiser. The boat was searched by the
Coast Guard after it reported being in trouble at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The four _ Alfonso-Aleman, Angel Hernandez Rojo, Juan Bautista
Marquez and Francisco Secundino-Cordova _ told the Coast Guard they
were fishing.
</P>
<P>
   They were brought before a U.S. magistrate in San Juan and have
pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy, making false
statements and weapons violations. If convicted, they and the other
three defendants _ Jose Antonio Llama, Jose Rodriguez and Alfredo
Domingo Otero _ face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent defendant is Llama, a member of the
foundation's board and the president of Nautical Sports Inc., a
corporate defendant. The boat involved is registered to the
company, and one of the rifles was traced to Llama, according to
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Marquez and his 26-year-old son, Juan Alberto
Marquez, were arrested on drug-trafficking charges involving almost
4,500 pounds of cocaine. The arrests sparked concern that the elder
Marquez could be turned against his alleged co-conspirators in
exchange for lenient treatment for his son.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a motion filed last month by the U.S. Attorney's
Office here, Laffitte said that ``upon further reflection,'' the
issue of venue for the most serious criminal charge _ conspiring to
assassinate a foreign head of state _ turns on whether the four
defendants arrested at sea deliberately lied ``to conceal a
conspiracy gone awry or to further an ongoing conspiracy.'' If the
conspiracy was ongoing, as prosecutors argue, then the conspiracy
charge could rightly be heard in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense attorney, Howard Srebnick, said that the judge
had ``opened up a door'' that could lead to instant acquittal if
the prosecution is unable to establish that Puerto Rico is the
proper venue.
</P>
<P>
   Laffitte said in his previous ruling that denials by the
defendants that any firearms were aboard the vessel were ``at best
feeble attempts to cover up a conspiracy, not in furtherance of
one'' and that the alleged conspiracy was ``hatched, nurtured and
fledged'' in Florida.

STATE DEPT. CRITICIZES BOOK BY FORMER U.N. WEAPONS INSPECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department said on Tuesday that a new
book by Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector who has
contended that the CIA helped plan arms inspections in Iraq, was
inaccurate, misleading and could ``only serve Saddam Hussein's
propaganda machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The department said statements by Ritter, whose book lends
support to longstanding Iraqi accusations that U.N. inspection
teams were riddled with American spies, were ``consistent only in
their inconsistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter and his book were also denounced by Rolf Ekeus, former
head of the United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which
conducted the inspections. He said Ritter was engaged in
``destructive fantasizing'' in suggesting such close ties between
the CIA and the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus also disputed Ritter's speculation of a tie between a U.N.
inspection team that was sent into Iraq in 1996 that according to
the book included CIA officials and what may have been a coup
attempt inspired by the agency. The State Department and Ekeus were
responding to a report on Tuesday about Ritter's book in The New
York Times, which obtained galley proofs of the book, ``Endgame.''
It is to be published in early April by Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Ritter says he worked closely with a senior agency
official to plan ``the largest and most complex inspections''
beginning in 1992. He also says that ``CIA covert paramilitary
operators'' were placed on teams that searched for evidence of
Iraqi chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman, James Foley, did not deny a
central element of Ritter's book _ that the CIA placed employees on
the teams and that they helped plan the inspections. But Foley
suggested that there was nothing surprising or new in the
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made no bones about the fact that we have helped
UNSCOM in its efforts to uncover Iraqi programs of weapons of mass
destruction,'' he said, without noting specifically that the CIA
was among the government agencies that provided assistance. ``The
inspectors we provided to UNSCOM were provided at UNSCOM's
request.''
</P>
<P>
   That point was also made by Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman for the
commission in New York. Although he would not discuss whether
officers from the agency were on the teams, Buchanan said the
commission routinely asked the United States and other governments
to provide them with arms inspectors who had specific technical
skills, some of whom may have come from intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what agency they are from that's important to us,''
Buchanan said. ``It's the skills they bring.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department appeared to speaking for the intelligence
agency, which declined to make a separate comment about Ritter and
his book. The Defense Department, which demanded as recently as
last week that Ritter turn over a copy of the book for a
prepublication security review, also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus, who left the special commission in 1997 and is now the
Swedish ambassador to Washington, said the intelligence agency was
never closely involved in the details of planning inspections.
``UNSCOM plans were never discussed with any of the foreigners,''
he said. ``By that I mean non-UNSCOM people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus, too, suggested that there was no surprise over the
presence of CIA employees, because they provided needed expertise.
``We got assistance from many countries and we did not investigate
the people whom the governments provided,'' he said. ``We asked for
the best experts governments could provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contacts with the U.S. government and requests for help
were completely innocent. The people sent were more nerds than a
lot of musclemen, and they had no weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   He discounted Ritter's speculation that the agency may have
coordinated the timing of the coup attempt in 1996 and the presence
of an inspection team that included nine CIA employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been sheer coincidence,'' he said. ``It would
have been odd if there hadn't been a coup attempt at one time or
another _ since there were many of them, apparently _ when UNSCOM
people were in the field inspecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Ritter's motive in making such an allegation, Ekeus said,
``Maybe it's to sell a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter has said he will refuse to provide the Pentagon with a
copy of ``Endgame,'' raising at least the possibility that the
Defense Department could go to court to block further distribution
of the book.
</P>
<P>
   A former Marine intelligence officer, Ritter was under contract
to the Pentagon while he worked for UNSCOM, and the Defense
Department has argued that under his contract, Ritter is required
to submit to the review. He resigned from the United Nations last
year, contending that the United States had tried to hinder the
inspectors' work out of fear of a confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Matthew L. Lifflander, said in an interview that the
State Department attack was a continuation of the Clinton
administration ``policy of denigrating Scott Ritter because they
are embarrassed by his truthful allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifflander said that nothing in the book compromised American
security and Ritter was not required to submit his book to the
Pentagon, because his Defense Department contract expired last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in there about sources and methods of
intelligence that isn't already in the public domain,'' the lawyer
said. ``Anything he says in there, Saddam Hussein already knows.''

47 PERCENT IN POLL VIEW LEGAL SYSTEM AS UNFAIR TO POOR AND
MINORITIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite having only a minimal knowledge of the
legal system, nearly half of the public thinks it treats minorities
and the poor unfairly, a survey conducted for the American Bar
Association indicates.
</P>
<P>
   In the months before William H. Rehnquist raised his public
profile by presiding over the Senate impeachment trial, only 17
percent could identify him as chief justice of the United States.
More than one-third of those responding held the mistaken belief
that in a criminal trial, it is up to the defendant to prove his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   But a surprising 96 percent knew that a criminal defendant who
is found not guilty can still be sued in a civil trial. The survey
report, made public by the bar association Tuesday, speculated that
widespread knowledge of this ``relatively obscure concept'' might
be attributed to the intense coverage of O.J. Simpson's consecutive
criminal and civil trials.
</P>
<P>
   While most people believe that ``the justice system needs a
complete overhaul'' and that ``we would be better off with fewer
lawyers,'' the public still agrees by a strong majority, eight out
of 10, that ``in spite of its problems, the American justice system
is still the best in the world,'' according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   But of the 1,000 adults polled by telephone in August, 47
percent said they believed that the courts did not ``treat all
ethnic and racial groups the same.'' Thirty-nine percent said there
was equitable treatment of minorities and 14 percent had no
opinion. Also, 90 percent of respondents said affluent people and
corporations had an unfair advantage in court.
</P>
<P>
   The bar group's president, Philip S. Anderson, said in a
statement that while he was cheered by the results showing public
confidence in the system, he was disturbed by the indication that
substantial numbers of people discerned racial unfairness in the
behavior of courts and law-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that the current perception of bias will
eventually erode confidence in our system of justice,'' Anderson
said in remarks prepared for delivery on Wednesday at the National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the nationwide telephone survey are to be
presented and discussed at a bar association symposium here later
this week on ``public understanding and perceptions of the American
justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   An independent research firm in Chicago, M/A/R/C Research,
conducted the survey, which had a margin of sampling error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The news media fared badly in public confidence, in fact worse
than any other institution. Eight percent of the people had strong
confidence in news organizations, while 60 percent expressed slight
or no confidence. The Supreme Court, by contrast, was at the top of
the list, with 50 percent of the people expressing strong
confidence in it. Compared with a similar survey conducted in 1978,
public confidence in all levels of the judicial system has
increased, while confidence in doctors, organized religion, public
schools and Congress, as well as the news media, has declined. A
majority rejected the statement that ``the courts are just puppets
of the political system.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson urged the Supreme Court to enhance public understanding
of the law by allowing television cameras into its argument
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One television camera in the Supreme court will educate more
people more effectively in one morning than the traditional methods
can reach in one year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the survey's results appeared certain to warm the hearts
of the American Bar Association's 400,000 members. Of people who
had used a lawyer within the past five years, three-quarters were
very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the quality of service,
with 53 percent in the ``very satisfied'' category.
</P>
<P>
   Most people agreed that ``it would be easy to get a lawyer if I
needed one,'' while at the same time expressing the view that ``it
costs too much to go to court'' and ``it takes courts too long'' to
do their job.

GREENSPAN SAYS THE FED IN HOLDING PATTERN BUT READY TO ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
described the risks to the nation's long run of prosperity Tuesday
as balanced between the possibility of too much growth causing
inflation and the threat of a stock market drop or further global
shocks derailing the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks to Congress, which were just what investors and
economists had expected, suggested that the Federal Reserve would
wait for a clearer sense of where the economy was heading before
raising or lowering interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of steady growth, Greenspan said, ``the
economy appears stretched in a number of dimensions, implying
considerable upside and downside risks to the economic outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, interest rate policy ``must be ready to
move quickly in either direction should we perceive imbalances and
distortions developing that could undermine economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite another expression of concern from Greenspan about the
level of stock prices, investors largely shrugged off his comments,
with the Dow Jones industrial average bouncing around during
Tuesday before closing down 8.26 points at 9,544.42. Bond prices
fell and the dollar weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee suggested
that while the central bank wants to keep its options open, it is
somewhat more inclined to raise rates than to lower them, given
that the economy grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter of last year and has shown signs of considerable momentum
in the first two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   He told senators that after cutting rates three times last fall,
leaving the federal funds target rate on overnight loans between
banks at 4.75 percent, the Federal Reserve now needed to reassess
whether current economic conditions justify keeping rates where
they are.
</P>
<P>
   During the time the Fed was cutting rates, the global crisis was
threatening to create a credit squeeze in the United States, a
threat that has since lessened. Some economists have criticized the
Fed's third rate cut last fall as unnecessary given the resilience
of the economy and the financial markets, and have speculated that
Greenspan would like to undo it, a surmise that Greenspan gave some
credence Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve must continue to evaluate, among other
issues, whether the full extent of the policy easings undertaken
last fall to address the seizing-up of financial markets remains
appropriate as those disturbances abate,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed next meets to review monetary policy on March 30, but
analysts said that unless the economy veered markedly in one
direction or the other there was little chance of any policy change
before late spring or early summer.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said that after three consecutive years of 4 percent
annual growth, the Federal Reserve expects the economy to slow to a
more modest growth rate this year, and that as the economy slows
any incipient inflationary pressures will remain contained. But the
Fed has been forecasting a slowdown for two years, and it has not
materialized. On the other hand, as Greenspan pointed out, neither
has inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greenspan did Tuesday what central bankers are paid to
do: worry about what could go wrong, and provide some assurance
that if the economy does go awry he has a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he remained concerned about the level of stock
prices, which he said were ``high enough to raise questions about
whether shares are overvalued,'' especially if companies fail to
post the robust earnings investors have come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   But he passed up an opportunity to say investors were suffering
from ``irrational exuberance,'' answering a question on the topic
by saying it is all but impossible to identify a stock market
bubble before it has burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has questioned at all that the dramatic acceleration
that we have seen in some technologies, and the marked increase in
productivity and profitability of American businesses, has
undoubtedly had a significant impact on underlying prices of all
capital assets, including equities,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not it's gripped by irrational exuberance is an
issue that you won't really know for sure except after the fact,''
he said, adding, though, that stock prices were high enough to give
him ``concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan identified the rapidly growing trade deficit, and its
contribution to a large and rising current account deficit, as one
of the most notable long-term threats to the nation's economic
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the sustainability of the buildup in our foreign
indebtedness come into question, the exchange value of the dollar
may well decline, imparting pressures on prices in the United
States,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added that the trade deficit so far has been a
symptom of forces that have proved beneficial, with weak demand
from abroad helping to offset the strains on the economy from
extremely strong domestic demand even as the strong dollar holds
down import prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman said the United States remained ``vulnerable to
rapidly changing conditions overseas, which, as we saw last summer,
can be transmitted to U.S. markets quickly and traumatically.''

</P>
<P>
   The outlook in Russia remains ``troubling,'' he said, while
Brazil's outlook is uncertain. Contradicting Japanese officials who
say their country's beleaguered economy has hit bottom and is ready
to rebound, Greenspan said Japan was still weakening.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan used much of his prepared testimony to explain the
temporary factors that have contributed to the remarkable
confluence of strong growth, low unemployment and dormant
inflation, and the more fundamental forces reshaping the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the temporary factors, he said, are the steep decline in
oil prices and commodity prices generally. But even if those prices
begin rising, the economy may prove less susceptible to inflation
than it has been in the past, largely because companies are
investing heavily in technology and cost-saving equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to raise prices, and unwilling to pay higher wages,
companies have had to cope by improving their productivity, or
output per worker, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several factions within the Fed have been debating for the last
several years whether the United States is seeing a resurgence in
productivity growth after nearly three decades of stagnation, and
in his comments Tuesday Greenspan again weighed in on the side of
those who think the improvement in productivity is part of a basic
improvement in the country's economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to rough estimates, labor and capital productivity
has risen significantly in the past five years,'' Greenspan said.
``It seems likely that the synergies of advances in laser, fiber
optic, satellite and computer technologies with older technologies
have enlarged the pool of opportunities to achieve a rate of return
above the cost of capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology, he said, allows companies to be more nimble,
ordering parts or raw materials only as needed, restraining costs
and increasing production capacity faster than actual output has
risen. The process of holding down costs and prices has become
self-reinforcing, he said, with workers no longer expecting big
wage increases to make up for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But lest he be seen as taking his eye off the potential for
inflation, Greenspan added that improved productivity would not
keep the country from running short of workers if the economy
continued to race along.
</P>
<P>
   ``This worker depletion constitutes a critical upside risk to
the inflation outlook because it presumably cannot continue for
very much longer without putting increasing pressure on labor
markets and on costs,'' Greenspan said.

NORTHWEST EXPORTERS WIN CONTRACTS UNDER RUSSIA AID PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 ((Story moving in both the ``a'' and ``f'' categories.)
 &HT;     By RON REDMOND  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Northwest exporters have won their first contracts
under an $885 million U.S.-Russia food aid deal, providing 850
metric tons of dried peas and lentils to help alleviate anticipated
shortages this year in the cash-strapped nation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they hope the two contracts awarded this week,
although relatively small, will be the first of several that will
benefit Northwest farmers, exporters and ports that have pioneered
links with the Russian Far East and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not millions, but it's a start,'' said Meg VanSchoorl, an
international trade specialist with the Washington State Department
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before the Russians had asked for food aid, some of our
exporters called me and ... said we were in a really good position
here to contribute because of the connections we have developed
with Russia over the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   VanSchoorl and Carol Vipperman, president of the Seattle-based
Foundation for Russian-American Economic Cooperation, said between
30 and 40 percent of the total 3.1 million-ton aid package could go
to the Russian Far East, a market largely pioneered by Northwest
interests.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of Northwest growers, exporters, port officials,
members of the Washington state congressional delegation and others
have for months been lobbying the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and the Clinton administration on the advantages offered by this
region as a food source as well as shipper.
</P>
<P>
   In a December letter to Vice President Al Gore, all nine members
of the Washington state congressional delegation urged the
administration to ensure that:
</P>
<P>
   _ State commodities and processed foods be included in the food
aid package.
</P>
<P>
   _ Northwest ports be used to ship food aid to the Russian Far
East.
</P>
<P>
   _ Northwest agencies and private voluntary organizations be used
in the delivery and monitoring of the aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic crisis in Russia is having a devastating effect
on the Washington state export community, including agricultural
producers, manufacturers, traders and brokers, warehouse operators,
freight forwarders and service and shipping companies,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacific Northwest ports from the grain and barge terminals on
the Columbia River to container shipping facilities in the Puget
Sound have been hurt by the virtual halt in trade with the Russian
Far East.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still too soon to tell whether those efforts will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   VanSchoorl said half of the wheat specified for the program is
Midwestern hard red rather than the soft white variety grown in the
Northwest. Many of the other commodities are not produced in the
Northwest either, although the state group is trying to convince
the Agriculture Department and the Russians to add Washington
apples, canned pears, dehydrated potatoes and fresh and processed
meats to the aid mix.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, U.S. law requires that at least 75 percent of the
aid be transported on American flag carriers, if available, and
it's uncertain whether any domestic shippers operating in Puget
Sound will submit bids.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture and Russian officials signed the $885 million
food-aid deal in Moscow in early November.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the huge aid
package _ one of the few bright spots for the U.S. farm sector this
winter _ could be expanded next month when Russian Deputy Prime
Minister Gennady Kulik visits Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume this subject may come up,'' Glickman said when asked
if his department was considering more food aid for Russia. ``If
the needs are there, the United States will try to meet them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current agreement, the United States will give Russia
1.5 million tons of American wheat and sell another 1.5 million
tons of assorted foodstuffs with the help of long-term,
low-interest loans. The United States also will send 100,000 tons
of food directly to needy Russian regions through voluntary
humanitarian organizations like the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic crisis, along with dwindling food imports and
the worst grain harvest in at least 40 years, has raised concerns
about possible food shortages this year across the vast nation.
</P>
<P>
   The aid deal also is expected to ease the plight of Northwest
growers, hit by low prices and growing surpluses, as well as ports
that saw tonnages to Russia plummet since the economic crisis began
there last August.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wilbur, president of Seattle-based Thomas International
Inc., said that one Puget Sound shipping line's cargo to the
Russian Far East plummeted from some 500 containers per voyage last
summer to only 17 shortly after the August devaluation of the
ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.S. aid package, about $260 million will go for
transportation and distribution costs.
</P>
<P>
   VanSchoorl said the contracts awarded this week were for the
100,000-ton humanitarian program and went to BNP Lentil Co. of
Farmington, Wash., and Maviga of Spokane. The two contracts are
worth a total of $246,000. The peas and lentils will be shipped via
a U.S. port on the Gulf of Mexico to St. Petersburg, in western
Russia, VanSchoorl said.
</P>
<P>
   More contracts could be awarded as early as Wednesday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest exporters are particularly anxious to get details of
the two larger USDA programs _ the 1.5 million-ton wheat donation
as well as the concessional sales that will include 500,000 tons of
corn, 300,000 tons of soybean meal, 200,000 tons of soybeans,
200,000 tons of wheat, 100,000 tons of rice, 120,000 tons of beef,
50,000 tons of pork and 30,000 tons of non-fat dry milk.
</P>
<P>
   Vipperman said the U.S. side can't proceed until the Russians
identify what and how much they want and where it should go,
including port of entry and final destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the wheat, the Russians have to identify which ports they
want to ship it to,'' Vipperman said. ``Some of that wheat is
already stored in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the concessional food loans, it depends on what the
Russians want and where they want it to go. Then tenders will be
put out for the products and well as for the transport.''

U.N. BOARD WANTS IMPARTIAL RESEARCH ON MEDICINAL EFFECTS OF
MARIJUANA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The board that oversees international drug
control treaties for the United Nations has recommended that
governments sponsor impartial research into the medicinal benefits
of marijuana, which some users say alleviates the pain and nausea
associated with AIDS, cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But the International Narcotics Control Board stressed that such
research must not become a pretext for legalizing cannabis, as
marijuana is called in many parts of the world. If the drug is
determined to have medicinal value, the board said, its use should
be subjected to the same stringent controls applied to cocaine and
morphine, the opiate from which heroin is derived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any decision on the medical use of cannabis should be based on
clear scientific evidence,'' the board said in its latest annual
report, which was made public on Tuesday through the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political initiatives and public votes can easily be misused
by groups promoting the legalization of all use of cannabis and/or
the prescription or cannabis for recreational use under the guise
of medical dispensation,'' the board said.
</P>
<P>
   Its report appeared in advance of an American study of medicinal
properties of marijuana that the National Institute of Medicine, an
arm of the National Academy of Sciences, is expected to release
next month. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy
commissioned that study, prompting groups that favor marijuana to
complain that it would be biased.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the international board, Dr. Hamid Ghodse,
alluded in a statement to the debate in the United States, where
voters in eight states have approved referendums expressing varying
degrees of support for medicinal uses of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increasingly politicized battle over cannabis must end,
since it has had a negative effect on attitudes toward drug abuse,
particularly from young people,'' said Ghodse, an Iranian-born
psychiatrist working in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the medical usefulness of cannabis be established, it
will be a drug no different from most narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances. Cannabis, prescribed for medical purposes,
would also be subject to licensing and other control measures under
the international drug control treaties.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Narcotics Control Board reported that
marijuana abuse had become widespread in virtually all countries
and that it was the most commonly abused drug in North America. The
agency noted a trend toward higher potency in marijuana cultivated
in greenhouses in Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While reserving its opinion on the benefits, the board, whose
mandate includes ensuring an adequate world supply of drugs for
medical purposes, said many poor countries had a severe shortage of
morphine-based painkillers needed by patients suffering from
terminal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with terrible physical pain, and the situation
in the poorest countries is a tragic situation that continues to go
unnoticed,'' said Herbert S. Okun, the sole American on the
13-member board.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Its report simultaneously described a mounting dependence on
prescription stimulants by Americans and on tranquilizers by
Europeans. The study said the United States consumed 85 percent of
the methylphenidate, a stimulant marketed under the trade name of
Ritalin. It is prescribed for children, adolescents and adults who
have been given diagnoses of attention deficit and hyperactivity
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The board further expressed concern about the computer-assisted
engineering of more powerful designer drugs and about drug recipes
that circulate on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The treaties supervised by the board include the Single
Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, ratified by 166 countries;
the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, ratified by 158
countries; and the Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988, ratified by 148
countries.

<P>
   BUKOS, Yugoslavia _ Serbian army and police forces traded
missile fire with separatist guerrillas in this northern Kosovo
village for the second day in a row Tuesday, as the residents
cowered in their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the deadline for the Paris peace talks, the warring
parties resorted to deadly firepower to try to gain control of the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped in the middle, a Serbian family mourned their dead son,
who the Serbs said was killed by separatist Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas in front of his house on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The clash showed how peace hangs in the balance and how quickly
an exchange of gunfire can turn into a battle. When the talks
adjourned Tuesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright gave stern
warnings to the two sides to show restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats and mediators at the talks had expressed
concern that Yugoslavia was increasing its troop strength in Kosovo
and might be planning a new offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings were prompted by reports from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has 1,300 monitors in
Kosovo to try to maintain a cease-fire agreement reached in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serb movements are not pretty,'' said a Western diplomat
with access to the European group's reports, who insisted on
anonymity. ``They seem to be getting ready to do something. We are
watching this very closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian concerns are rising, the diplomat added, as
refugees have once more had to flee fighting in several villages.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Bukos, heavily armed police officers who are guarding
the road indicated that they gave little weight to the talks in
France, saying they would achieve nothing. Police had moved into
the village to flush out rebels after the youngster, Mirko
Milosevic, was killed and his brother and a neighbor wounded on
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, Bukos was a mixed village where Serbs had lived
alongside ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
population of Kosovo. By Tuesday, the ethnic Albanians had fled,
and police troops, backed by the army, had established a presence
in the village.
</P>
<P>
   The army trained a long anti-aircraft barrel from one end of the
village and set up mortars on a hillside. As a tank maneuvered its
way along the main street, the guerrillas, on the far edge of the
village, opened fire. The army hit back immediately, raining shells
on rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides are provoking the situation,'' Maj. Gen. John
Drewienkiewicz, the British head of operations of the European
verification mission, said after having watched the fighting. And,
he said, neither is ``prepared to back down and stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side seemed to be trying to dislodge the other and to expel
opposition villagers, Drewienkiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither was a clear winner. On the edge of the village, a
brother of the dead man stood waiting, hoping for a lull long
enough to take the body for burial. Another brother was fighting
for his life in a hospital, the man said. The dead man had left
behind two children, 7 and 3, the man added.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian villagers stayed in their houses, protected for the
moment by the army and police. They were wary and reluctant to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in fear,'' said one woman, standing behind small
children clustered around the open house door. ``I have nothing to
say, just that we are living in fear.''
</P>
<P>
   A Serbian shopkeeper, Dragan Dukovic, was open for business,
although his only customers were a few Serbian soldiers. ``They
killed this boy, and everything is ruined,'' Dukovic said,
producing a bottle from behind the counter and serving shots of
local cognac. ``I am a shopkeeper. I have to serve everybody, and I
had a good relationship with everyone. I say it is shameful what
happened, but we are not at fault.''

STARBUCKS CEO SAYS GLOBAL JUGGERNAUT ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While maps looking like they came from a Pentagon
situation room flashed on a huge screen behind him, Starbucks Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz stood before a happy house
of shareholders Tuesday and touted the progress in bringing the
company's brand of coffeehouse culture to the rest of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building a truly enduring global brand,'' said Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks' global juggernaut is on track with plans this year to
open 500 stores around the world, Schultz said to an annual meeting
filled with people rejoicing over Monday's announcement of a
2-for-1 split of its shares of common stock.
</P>
<P>
   The split will be in the form of a stock dividend payable on
March 19 for shareholders of record on March 5. Starbucks closed
yesterday at $52.375, up $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has 100 stores in Pacific Rim countries such
as Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and New Zealand, with plans to have 500
stores in the Pacific Rim by 2003. And a beachhead has been
established in Europe with the acquisition last May of the Seattle
Coffee Co. in the United Kingdom. The company's expansion program
continues in the United States as well. At year end, the company
owned 1,688 stores in 32 states, the District of Columbia, four
Canadian provinces and the U.K. It is projected to have 2,336
stores by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive expansion program is fueling the company's steady
growth in revenues and earnings with about 84 percent of net
revenues coming from the retail stores. Net revenues rose from
$975.4 million in fiscal 1997 to $1.3 billion in fiscal 1998, ``due
primarily to the company's store expansion program and comparable
store sales increases,'' according to the annual report. The report
goes on to note that the company ``has experienced a certain level
of cannibalization of existing stores by new stores as the store
concentration has increased.''
</P>
<P>
   But operating margins have grown or maintained a steady pace
since 1994 with the exception of 1996 when a South America freeze
cause coffee prices to spike. The margin for 1998 was unchanged
from 1997 at 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz took a shot at those who might think that Starbucks
can't sustain such growth over the long term. ``The cynics will say
that Starbucks has 2,000 stores and we're nearing saturation,''
said Schultz. ``We are not.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rogers, an analyst for D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co. in Portland,
agreed. ``There are probably selected markets where you have an
abundance of coffee vendors,'' he said. ``But overall, for most of
the country, you are a probably quite a ways from saturation. The
evidence of that is the continued growth in same store sales (open
at least a year). Stores that have been there for a long time are
still putting up very good numbers, they are still growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz noted that the company enjoys the highest degree of
frequency of any retail store in America with the average customer
coming in 18 times a month.
</P>
<P>
   The company has big plans to continue leveraging that loyalty to
its brand built so carefully at the retail coffee shops.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks has tapped the Pepsi-Cola Co.'s ``ubiquitous
distribution power'' to sell its Frappuccino blended coffee
beverage which leads the ready-to-drink coffee category, said
Schultz. The CEO's prediction for revenues from Frappuccino: ``We
believe Frappuccino will be bigger than Starbucks is today.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of the fourth quarter, Starbucks joined Kraft
Foods, Inc. in a licensing agreement to distribute, market and sell
its beans at supermarkets around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have less than 5 percent of the overall coffee market in
America,'' said Schultz. ``We are going to have much, much more
than a 5 percent share of the coffee market in America, I promise
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz, in paying tribute to Howard Behar, who has been
overseeing the company's expansion overseas and plans to retire
this year, said Behar has been at the heart of Starbucks corporate
culture. It is a culture, said Schultz, that puts a premium on
nurturing relationships with both employees and the communities in
which it operates.
</P>
<P>
   Of the overseas expansion, Behar said: ``Starbucks set out to be
a bridge among peoples and among cultures, not to sell more
coffee.''

MEXICAN GANG FREES SOCCER STAR'S FATHER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Kidnappers on Tuesday released Alvaro Campos
Gonzalez, the father of Mexico's most popular soccer star, after
six days, and he returned to his home in Acapulco, authorities and
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican attorney general's office said in a statement that
Campos Gonzalez, 66, appeared at 8:20 a.m. at a police checkpoint
on a coastal highway 11 miles northwest of Acapulco in Guerrero
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father is here with us, safe and sound,'' his son, Jorge
Campos Navarrete, the goalkeeper for Mexico's national team, told
reporters hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Campos Navarrete said he ``did not believe'' his family had paid
a ransom, according to radio reports. But Mexican television and
radio reporters who cited police sources said that a ransom of an
undisclosed size had in fact been paid.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the men carrying AK-47 rifles who seized Campos
Gonzalez on Wednesday remained a mystery. No group has assumed
responsibility for the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   But Campos Gonzalez, who made statements on behalf of Mexico's
governing party before disputed Guerrero elections on Feb. 7, told
the police that he was held in a village in an area of the Guerrero
mountains in which leftist guerrillas have been active.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jenkins, an independent Los Angeles-based kidnapping
expert, said that most abductions of prominent people carried out
by professional criminals seeking ransom last longer than six days
because setting up negotiations take time.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ To call Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island the
dean of the dodos is not to disparage him.
</P>
<P>
   It is, rather, to highlight a fact that he easily admits
himself: The brand of moderate congressional Republican he
represents _ that small faction that suddenly loomed large when it
changed the shape of this month's impeachment vote _ sometimes
seems an endangered species, teetering on the edge of what some
have called dodo-like extinction as the party has become more
conservative across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, that is, except in New England.
</P>
<P>
   For Chafee and his handful of maverick lunch-buddies are very
much a crop of this rocky northeastern soil, and a hardy one at
that: Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe are from Maine, Sen.
James Jeffords from Vermont, and Chafee, 76, and finishing his
fourth term. They accounted for four of the five Republican votes
in the Senate against both articles of impeachment, the fifth from
Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   That New England tilt among Republican moderates in Congress,
say political analysts and players, is no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   But before they talk about the long tradition of patrician
Republicans here, the party's Northern origins as a liberal
anti-slavery movement, and the reverence for past Republican
paragons of statesmanship like Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, the
first woman to become a U.S. senator, they tend to zero in on a
very simple fact.
</P>
<P>
   In this, the most liberal region in the country, a Republican
who is not moderate will simply not get elected _ always excepting
New Hampshire, of course, with its anomalous streak of
Western-style, off-my-back conservatism. Look at it this way, said
Joan Quick, chairwoman of the state Republican party. ``We are
currently an electorate that is eight percent registered
Republican. That's it in a nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is a similar Democratic stronghold, while Maine,
Connecticut and Vermont are more evenly divided, but one thing
unites the non-New Hampshire states: For a Republican to win, the
candidate must be the kind of fiscally conservative but socially
liberal type that Chafee and the ``mod squad,'' as some call them,
exemplify.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not surprising, on a recent day as Chafee traveled
through his home turf of Providence, Pawtucket and Warwick, to not
hear a single voice of complaint about his vote _ indeed, barely a
mention of it. After an awards ceremony at Textron, a major
manufacturing company based in Providence, one employee came up to
Chafee and said, ``I want to thank you for your courage and
leadership in bringing that thing to an end down there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he responded, ``Thank God it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was over, with no visible ill effects for the re-election
bid that aides hint Chafee is expected to announce in the next few
weeks, in fact quite the opposite. Similarly, the other two New
England moderate Republicans up for re-election next year, Jeffords
of Vermont and Snowe of Maine, need fear little voter reprisal by
most estimates, though there is talk that Jeffords may face a more
conservative challenger in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Christian Potholm, a professor of government at
Bowdoin College who has conducted polls for Republicans, Democrats
and independents, though Snowe surely voted her conscience, ``she
also made herself invulnerable in the year 2000 in the Senate race,
because you cannot beat her unless you get the moderate-Democrat
suburban voters who love what she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe and her moderate comrades, he said, are carrying on a
regional Republican tradition. ``You can be strong on national
defense, you can be strong on capital punishment, you can be
conservative on balancing the budget, but you're liberal
socially,'' Potholm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of live-and-let-live Republicanism; it's a
Rockefeller Republicanism, and we forget that that was the
Republican Party. The epicenter has switched to the South and West,
and what we now call conservative Republicans are really out of
step with the main history of the Republican Party in the
Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for recent efforts to move the national party toward
the center has come in good part from the Northeast: Snowe's
husband, former Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. of Maine, helped found
the Main Street Partnership in 1997 to promote Republican centrist
views. And former Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts has often
pounded the pulpit calling for the party's moderate wing to get its
act together.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, said Darrell West, a political science professor
at Brown University, the effort ``to recast the national Republican
Party has been a complete failure.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So in Congress, at least, the moderate Republican New Englanders
have seemed an ever-lonelier bunch in recent years, as they have
lost former allies like Mark Hatfield of Oregon; Nancy Kassebaum
Baker of Kansas; John Danforth of Missouri; David Durenburger of
Minnesota and Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut. (``Lonely? I
don't quite find it that way. Obviously there's a rapport,'' Chafee
said. ``We have lunch every Wednesday.'')
</P>
<P>
   Weld and others point out that in fact, Chafee-style moderation
is much more the norm among the country's 31 Republican governors
than among Republican members of Congress. Some also note that even
in Congress, the moderates' numbers may be small, but they are in a
powerful swing position that gives them added weight when they
break ranks on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even national Republicans who don't particularly appreciate
some of the votes of the New England moderates need then to
maintain the majority,'' observed Patrick J. Garahan, chairman of
the Vermont Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, it seems, the mod squad is likely to stay
squad-sized and localized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wonderful moderate Republican tradition will be a sort of
anomaly,'' said Garrison Nelson, a visiting professor at Brandeis
University and long an observer of New England politics. ``It will
survive because of the personal stature of these individuals, and
when the parties split and the Senate is close, and the margin is
six votes, these individuals can have an important moderating
impact on the conservatives who need their votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The line of moderate Republican leaders in New England, like
former Massachusetts Governors John Volpe and Francis Sargent,
Chafee said, are ``pragmatists, they're not ideologues. For someone
to say, `Oh, that's socialized medicine' _ they think that's
nonsense. They say, `Let's see if it's a good program.'''
</P>
<P>
   In southern New England particularly, Republicans have also
tended to be associated in many minds with old money that gives
them a can't-be-bought aura setting them apart from the
machine-style politics often associated with Democrats here. A
graduate of Yale and Harvard Law School, and a member of the ``five
families'' considered to be Rhode Island's home-grown aristocracy,
Chafee fits that mold, even though he dismisses the idea of the
five families as nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee said that he joined the Republican Party in his youth
because ``the state was in a shambles'' under a ``rock-hard
Democratic leadership, with every giveaway program known to man,
leading the country in unemployment and with labor completely
dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is still heavily union, Democratic and Catholic, but
Chafee has won elections with the help of voters like Steve Barlow,
a manufacturer who attended the Textron lunch for the senator and
said he was a registered independent who supported either liberal
Republicans or conservative Democrats. ``He fits right in with
me,'' he said. ``Lots of times you like your senator but don't love
him. I think Chafee is loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Though such Republican moderates often run against the grain of
the national party, they still receive backing from the national
party, state chairmen say. Chafee said he had not heard any rebuke
from party leaders about his impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   And West offered a simple explanation about why the endangered
species of New England moderate Republicans will continue to get
strong support from their national leaders: ``There are stronger
species waiting to eat them,'' he said. ``They're called
Democrats.'' &QL;

JAIL HOUSE WRITINGS HELP LEAD TO WHITE SUPREMACIST'S CONVICTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See JASPER-TRIAL, which will be filed shortly.) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ John William ``Bill'' King just might have
written himself on to death row.
</P>
<P>
   When jurors found the 24-year-old ex-con and avowed white
supremacist guilty Tuesday of capital murder in the brutal dragging
death of a disabled black man, it was his own writings that helped
earn that conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It killed us,'' said court-appointed attorney C. Haden
``Sonny'' Cribbs of his client's jail house writings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to cost us and I asked him not to do it,''
Cribbs said, slowly shaking his head as he waited for the jury to
come back with its verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The same jury will decide, probably Thursday, if King will be
sent to death row to await execution or if he will be sentenced to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In prison letters to girlfriends, notes to a co-defendant and
written statements to reporters, King handed prosecutors leads to
evidence they didn't even know about.
</P>
<P>
   In November, King sent a letter to The Dallas Morning News,
claiming that he was with two buddies when one of them picked up
James Byrd Jr. King wrote that one of his friends, co-defendant
Shawn Berry, drove him and Lawrence Russell Brewer to their Jasper
apartment before Berry killed Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter did much more harm than good, Cribbs said.
``Before that letter there was nothing putting him (King) in that
car,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors found King's cigarette lighter at the scene of the
murder, as well as cigarettes with King's DNA on them. ``I could
have tried to do something with those,'' Cribbs said, adding that
he might have been able to convince a jury that those items were in
the truck that dragged Byrd, even though King might not have been
there.
</P>
<P>
   But in the letter King admitted that he was in the truck when he
and his friends picked up Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   The jury was also treated to King's prison manifesto _ a
collection of writings, including letters, applications and even
bylaws of an organization he called ``Texas Rebel Soldiers.'' The
idea for the group, an offshoot of a Ku Klux Klan group, was
conceived while King was in the Beto I prison unit between 1995-97
in Tennessee Colony.
</P>
<P>
   In those writings, which he took with him when he was paroled,
he refers to Aryan pride and makes repeated racist remarks. He even
outlined plans to kidnap a black person, take him to the woods and
kill him. Several times King alluded to something big that would
take place within the organization on July 4, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   By that date, however, he was already in jail, charged with
Byrd's murder.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also saw letters King wrote from prison to a Jasper
teen-age girl he called, ``my Aryan princess.'' The letters
explained that he was a ``peckerwood,'' a white guy in prison, and
again outlined his plans for life on the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   While King sat mainly motionless during the week of testimony,
his biggest reaction came Monday when a letter he wrote in Jasper
County Jail and passed to co-defendant Brewer _ a ``kite'' in
jailhouse lingo _ was read into testimony.
</P>
<P>
   King shifted in his chair and scowled.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many such notes between King and Brewer, who were
held in separate cells. Their messenger was an inmate who worked as
a jail trusty, and who, unknown to King, passed the notes to
sheriff's jailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting these so fast at one point that we didn't even
have time to read them,'' said Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles
of King's jailhouse ``kites.''
</P>
<P>
   In the message King wrote to Brewer he talked of blood on their
clothes. ``I don't think any blood was on my pants or sweatshirt,
but I think my sandals may have had some dark brown substance on
the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they didn't know about the sandals until they
read the jailhouse note. They later found the shoes in a clothes
hamper.
</P>
<P>
   If King had any regret about Byrd's murder, it wasn't evident in
his letter to Brewer. He didn't sound like a man wrongly accused of
capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously though, bro,'' he wrote, ``reguardless (sic) of the
outcome of this, we have made history and shall die proudly
remembered if need be.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Brack Jones said King has long held the idea
that the trial outcome is inevitable. ``He thinks it's a conspiracy
against him,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half hour before announcing the guilty verdict, the
jury asked to see just one piece of evidence: King's ``kite'' to
Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   His signature with his jailhouse nickname of ``Possum'' _ with
the s's drawn as Nazi storm trooper symbols _ couldn't have helped.
Neither could a symbol of three K's joined to form a triangle,
symbolizing the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   And if that wasn't enough, there was a simple, ``Seig Heil (Hail
Victory).''
</P>
<P>
   But for King, it was hardly victory.
</P>

CLIPS OF UPCOMING FILMS WOW DISNEY SHAREHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ More than 1,000 shareholders and other guests of the
Walt Disney Co. packed Seattle's ornate 5th Avenue Theater Tuesday
to listen to dissident sharholder proposals and see Michael Eisner
preview Disney's new Internet service, www.go.com.
</P>
<P>
   What really wowed them were clips of Disney's upcoming animated
features, ``Tarzan,'' ``Toy Story 2,'' ``Dinosaur'' and ``Fantasia
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Disney's original ``Fantasia,'' produced in 1940,
remember a scene of dinosaurs fleeing a blocky, square-jawed
Tyrannosaurus rex. The movie ``Dinosaur,'' to be released on May
31, 2000, has a similar attack. But this T. rex. is a glistening,
lifelike lizard whose realism chews a hole in the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the new ``Fantasia 2000,'' to be introduced at the
turn of the millennium, has a segment reminiscent of the original:
a volcano monster set to Stravinsky's ``Firebird.'' Other segments
include a flamingo with a yo-yo, dancing to Saint-Saens' ``Carnival
of the Animals,'' and the classic tale, ``The Steadfast Tin
Soldier'' interpreted to Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2.
``Fantasia 2000'' has six new segments and three restored ones,
including ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also showed scenes from ``Toy Story 2'' and ``Tarzan,''
both coming to screens this year.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced that ``A Bug's Life'' has grossed more than
$200 million overseas, and that ``Mulan,'' the animated feature
based on the Chinese legend, opened yesterday in China. ``That
nation only allows the release of 10 non-Chinese films a year,'' he
said. That they chose ``Mulan,'' he said, ``portends well for our
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also clicked the audience through screens of www.go.com,
the new Internet service developed with Infoseek, a company 40
percent owned by Disney, and with Seattle-based Starwave. ``We are
putting the full power of our company behind Go,'' Eisner said. Go
(which looks a lot like Microsoft's www.msn.com) has a button
called Go Guardian, which filters out material deemed objectionable
to kids.
</P>
<P>
   Disney owns a galaxy of other things, from Disneylands and other
theme parks to the Disney Channel, a Disney cruise line, Club
Disney, the Disney Stores, as well as Touchstone studios (which
produced ``Armageddon,'' last year's No. 1 grossing film) and
Capital Cities/ABC, which includes ESPN. All these things brought
in $23 billion in revenues in the year ended Sept. 30, and produced
a profit of $1.85 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were hardly changed from a year earlier, which the
company said reflected the rising costs of producing films and the
economic downturn in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A company so large often has controversy. Disney had its share
in three shareholder resolutions, all of them opposed by
management.
</P>
<P>
   The one that came closest to passing was a resolution that the
board not adopt a poison pill without a vote of shareholders. A
poison pill is a measure to dilute a raider's interest and thereby
thwart his bid. Poison pills have been criticized as being
pro-management but not pro-shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which fended off a raid in 1984, long ago adopted a
poison pill that expires June 30. Last year, a shareholder measure
against it got 43 percent of the vote. This year, the company said
it will will let the poison pill expire. But directors wanted to
keep the power to create a new one without consulting shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-poison pill measure failed again, 38 percent yes, 60
percent no. But the spokesman for the measure, James Joyce of the
Communications Workers of America, attracted more applause than the
spokesman for the company, Senior Executive Vice President Sanford
Litvack.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure opposed by management was that wages, working
conditions and union rights at 18,000 foreign factories supplying
Disney be monitored by independent religious and human-rights
groups. Several speakers praised Disney's code of conduct for its
suppliers, but said the montoring needed to be done by people who
were local and independent.
</P>
<P>
   Their resolution said that The Gap, Liz Claiborne, Mattel and
Nike had accepted the principle of independent monitoring, and said
Disney should accept it too.
</P>
<P>
   Global Exchange, a San Francisco advocacy group, said it found
workers at four factories in China earning between 13.5 and 36
cents per hour producing Disney products. Basic survival, the group
said, required a wage of 87 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Litvack said the company has ``no quarrel'' with the
campaigners' goals. He said management is working with independent
groups in certain places. But the company does not want to delegate
the task to them, system-wide.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also objected to the ``living wage'' proposal. The
company's rule is that suppliers pay either the official minimum
wage or the local market rate, whichever is higher. But Litvack
said it is not appropriate ``to attempt to set wage rates at 18,000
sites around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which won 9 percent of the vote in 1997 and 8
percent in 1998, won 8 percent again. It was opposed by 85 percent
of votes cast, the rest abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders also rejected, 6 percent to 92 percent, a proposal
for a special report on the company's efforts to solve the Year
2000 computer problem. Litvack said Disney has 400 employees and
400 consultants working on the problem, and that it expects to
invest $140 million in capital and spend another $120 million to
deal with it. Sending a separate report to shareholders would cost
$1.5 million, he said, which ``would be better spent on the problem
itself.''

   The obituary of John D. Ehrlichman sent by the New York Times
News Service on Feb. 15, referred incorrectly to the prosecution of
Robert C. Mardian, a former Assistant Attorney General, in
connection with the Watergate scandal. On Jan. 1, 1975, Mr. Mardian
was convicted on a single count of conspiring to obstruct justice
and sentenced to 10 months to three years in prison, but his
conviction was overturned on appeal. He was never charged with
perjury or obstruction of justice.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The crash of TWA Flight 800, already the subject of
the nation's biggest air crash investigation and the world's
largest aircraft reconstruction, has now led to a looming question
as the National Transportation Safety Board tries to wrap up its
inquiry: what to do with the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said when we built it, these things never go away,'' said
Peter Goelz, the board's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board is seeking a permanent home for the wreckage,
where investigators could go to recheck their conclusions and where
future air safety investigators could be trained in areas ranging
from metallurgy to reconstruction techniques.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the board will issue a request for proposals to build
a hangar to store the reconstruction, which is somewhat less than
half of the Boeing 747's fuselage. Since the crash in July 1996,
the pieces salvaged from the ocean floor have been stored at a
former Grumman hangar at Calverton, N.Y., which has been closely
guarded. But the town of Riverhead, which owns the hangar, would
like to lure some industry there instead. And the board is feeling
the weight of $4.5 million in annual rent and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Already, three parties are interested.
</P>
<P>
   The airport in Hagerstown, Md.; the College of Aeronautics, near
La Guardia International Airport in Queens, N.Y., and the Virginia
campus of George Washington University are all competing to adopt
the wreckage. Each would build a structure large enough for the
reconstruction, which is about 114 feet long including the
scaffolding, 48 feet wide and 30 feet high, and lease it back to
the board.
</P>
<P>
   The College of Aeronautics trains aviation mechanics and
engineers, and George Washington's school of engineering has an
automobile crash test program and would expand into airplane crash
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would save the taxpayers money and would provide a very
important educational tool,'' said James E. Hall, chairman of the
safety board. The board, which intends to issue a final report on
the crash this year and to move the wreckage immediately afterward,
would not give up control over the wreckage nor allow it to be open
for display to the public, but would make it much more widely
available to aviation safety experts and students.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which was on a flight from Kennedy International
Airport to Paris, exploded off Long Island a few minutes after
takeoff. The safety board believes the reason was a flaw of some
kind in the center fuel tank and has been conducting tests to
determine where in the tank it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever gets the wreckage would also keep it available for use
by the parties in lawsuits. For example, Mitch Baumeister, a
Manhattan lawyer who represents the families of 21 passengers in
suits against TWA, said on Tuesday that he was looking forward to
having juries tour the reconstruction, to prove no missile was
involved in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the families who lost passengers on the plane say they
like the idea of preserving the wreckage, said Aurelie Becker,
president of the Families of TWA Flight 800 Association. Her
19-year-old daughter, Michelle, was on board. She said the families
had previously discussed whether the Smithsonian Institution might
take the wreckage at an annex it is planning near Dulles
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   (FOLLOWING GRAPHS OPTIONAL)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotional experience to see this wreckage and know
that there were people inside of it, when you see the devastation
that was caused,'' Ms. Becker, a nurse, said. ``It makes one think
of your humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's grounding, sort of,'' she said in a telephone interview
from her workplace, a nursing home in St. Petersburg, Fla. ``A lot
of people in our day and age need that emotional grounding.'' And,
she said, if more people saw the wreckage, there would be more
public sentiment for better air safety.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hurd, vice president of the organization, said in an
interview, ``They should get some decent use out of it.'' And, he
said, when his grandchildren are old enough, he would like to take
them to see the plane on which their uncle, his son Jamie, died.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Carven, whose sister and nephew died on the plane, said
the wreckage had a magnetic quality for him. Visiting the
reconstruction in the hangar on Long Island, he said, ``You felt
like the people who were on the plane were somehow just present.''
</P>
<P>
   Carven said that his brother and sister-in-law had a baby two
weeks ago. ``I'm sure when he gets to be old enough, my brother
would want to take him and show him what happened to his aunt,''
Carven said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAPHS)
</P>
<P>
   The schools are emphasizing the educational aspects, including
the possibility of a related deal with the safety board, to provide
courses in aircraft technology for safety board investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in just housing this reconstruction,''
said John C. Fitzpatrick, president of the School of Aeronautics,
who said he had been approached by the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were just that, I would not have encouraged them to come
back to talk to us,'' he said. ``The fact is that this was a
tragedy, that they believe they can partner with an educational
institution such as ourselves and develop an aviation safety
accident prevention program, and that interests the college a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The school would build a new building on its six-and-a-half-acre
campus, across the Grand Central Parkway from La Guardia Airport,
if a deal could be struck, he said; it would include classrooms and
possibly laboratories, in addition to the wreckage. He added that
for traveling investigators, the campus was convenient to La
Guardia and within walking distance of hotels.
</P>
<P>
   At George Washington University, Irwin Price, the executive dean
of the university's campus in Ashburn, Va., said, ``We view it as a
research thing rather than as a museum piece.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have a fairly large program in transportation safety and
automobile safety,'' he said. ``We do some stuff in aviation safety
already, and we would add to work we're already doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The engineering department makes computer models of cars to
predict their crash performance, he said, and would like to do the
same for 747s.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction was designed to separate into three pieces
and would probably move by barge.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckage from major crashes is usually kept for years by an
airline's insurance company; as with a car, when the insurance
company pays the claim, it owns the wreck. But in this crash, TWA
and its insurance company declined to pay for the cost of salvage,
so the federal government did; now the government owns the debris.

 &HT;    Hitting, switch to first not troubling Klesko
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Ryan Klesko came into the Braves'
clubhouse to start his spring workouts Tuesday the same as always _
smiling, patting teammates on the back and spouting tales of big
fish and five-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   He showed no visible signs that he should feel especially
burdened with his recent assignment _ taking over first base for
Andres Galarraga _ or relieved that his name no longer is coupled
with the word trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sid (Bream) was here and I was back up in Richmond, it
was `trade,''' said Klesko, who is in the second year of a
four-year contract worth $20.5 million. ``And then when Fred
(McGriff) was here, it was `trade.' I don't worry about it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I used to think I'd hate to leave. I
worried: `Who am I going to get traded to?' If it happens, it
happens. I've been blessed enough to be in this organization for 10
seasons. If it all ends today, what a great time I've had with the
Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   While the attitude was great, the body was sore. For the past
four days, since Galarraga was diagnosed with lymphoma, Klesko has
been fielding ground balls in North Palm Beach, where he worked out
with some players at the spring training complex of the Expos and
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Soreness is the only problem, Klesko said, because the move from
left field, where he's been most of his major-league career, to
first base, where he played in high school and the minor leagues,
is totally natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The angle of throws is different,'' Klesko said. ``I'm used to
throwing straight over the top. But that's about it. ... I've
always felt comfortable with (first base). I'll be fine. I'll do my
best; that's all I can really do.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Braves have scouted Cincinnati first baseman Hal
Morris and are rumored to be interested in Kansas City first
baseman Jeff King, all moves appear to be on hold. General manager
John Schuerholz wants to see how Klesko does at first before making
any decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Cox liked what he saw Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the first two ground balls Klesko took
Tuesday morning _ one was out of his reach in the hole, and one
bounced up and hit his shin _ Klesko fielded everything cleanly and
got some encouraging cheers from his infield teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll do anything we want him to,'' Cox said. ``He's got a
great attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the Braves want to see a change is in Klesko's offense.
Last year was a disappointment; he started on pace to hit 26 home
runs with 94 RBIs, but finished with 18 home runs and 70 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time he had hit fewer than 20 home runs as a
regular in left field. The RBI total represented the second season
in a row Klesko's numbers have declined, after getting 93 in 1996
and 84 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's 1998 season took a bad turn when he missed nine games
after having surgery to remove his appendix on June 29. He had only
five home runs and 23 RBIs after the surgery. Klesko was hitting
.382 for the month of June when he had the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start finding my swing again until the last month of
the season,'' Klesko said. ``I probably pushed myself too hard to
come back. I definitely wanted to get my swing back for the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   His finished with a respectable .274 average, cut his strikeouts
by more than half and hit a career-high 29 doubles. But against
left-handers, Klesko hit .213 with no home runs and drove in four
runs. With runners in scoring position, he hit .217 with three home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves hope new hitting coach Don Baylor will improve those
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he won't think too much,'' Cox said. ``Ryan's always
been a natural hitter. I think sometimes you do start thinking too
much. You over-analyze sometimes. Maybe this will be a positive for
his hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko said it's just a matter of good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can stay healthy, get my at-bats, I can get hits,''
Klesko said. ``No doubt in my mind. ... I'll go out and give it my
best. That's all I've ever done for this organization.''

 &HT;    Atwater meeting unlikely
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons have virtually exited the market for free
agent safety Steve Atwater before really getting into it.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater, who was drafted in 1989 by current Atlanta coach Dan
Reeves when he was in Denver, met with the Chiefs Tuesday and will
meet with the Jets today and the Eagles Thursday. The Jets are
especially interested in Atwater, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons officials say they are not likely to meet with the
eight-time Pro Bowl selection, but they are interested in a couple
of Reeves' former players with the Giants. Free agent offensive
guard Greg Bishop is expected to work out for the team today.
Recently released New York receiver Chris Calloway might visit by
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway met Tuesday with Redskins officials. Peter Schaffer
represents Calloway and Atlanta free agent cornerback Ronnie
Bradford, who is on a vacation cruise. ``I haven't talked to
(Falcons general manager) Harold (Richardson) about (Atwater),''
Schaffer said. ``We're talking mostly about Calloway.''
</P>
<P>
   STRONG CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons hired a new assistant strength and conditioning
coach in Rocky Colburn, who for the past four years has been head
football coach at Bibb County High School in Centreville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Colburn, 35, was Academic All-SEC as a defensive back at Alabama
at the same time that current Falcons strength and conditioning
coach Al Miller was there.
</P>
<P>
   Colburn coached one year at Samford before serving as assistant
strength and conditioning coach at Alabama for five years, then
coaching in high school for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Former assistant strength and conditioning coach Tim Jorgensen
left the Falcons to take the head strength and conditioning job
with the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Schad Freeman, cut by the Falcons last summer as
an undrafted rookie out of Valdosta State, has been allocated to
the World League and will play for Berlin. Freeman, added to the
80-man roster recently, is the only Falcon going to Europe, though
the team might send a couple of future signees there. ... Assistant
public-relations director Frank Kleha is serving as interim
director after Charlie Taylor resigned Monday. The organization
will interview candidates to replace Taylor.

 &HT;    Woods on top of the world
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Since he stood eye level to a ballwasher,
Tiger Woods' timing for high drama always has been impressive. But
not since his stunning Masters victory in 1997 has he performed so
appropriately for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared as though everyone from Johnny Miller to
Zell Miller figured that No. 2 David Duval had a rightful claim to
Woods' No. 1 spot in the World Golf Rankings, Woods provided golf's
equivalent of an ``in-your-face'' at the recent Buick Invitational
in San Diego, then followed it a week later with serious contention
at the Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   With his first victory since Atlanta's BellSouth Classic last
May and a tie for second in Los Angeles, Woodsbuffed up his
credentials in the No. 1 discussion.
</P>
<P>
   His two-week performance fuels a Duval-Woods rivalry leading to
the Masters and sets the storyline for the $5 million inaugural
World Match Play Golf Championships, which begins today at the La
Costa resort. Tiger Woods is expected to ignite his game in
individual match play, his specialty, on a familiar course. Woods,
who grew up in Los Angeles, has had many memorable rounds at La
Costa, located north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Excited by a course-record 62 in the third round at San Diego _
after scrambling to make the Friday cut _ Woods went from ``what
have you done lately?'' to back in control, largely through a
revived putter that has improved his confidence. Had he made a few
more putts in the Nissan at Riviera, Woods would be entering the
Match Play with two victories.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had heard the talk about Duval being the best player in
the world since the fall of 1997, and many golf people think his
game's revival was more than pure coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think Woods didn't notice all the people saying he
didn't deserve to be No. 1 in the World Rankings,'' CBS-TV analyst
Peter Kostis observed in his weekly column for GolfWeb. ``He heard
it, and he didn't like it. But his win (at San Diego), even with
David Duval skiing in Idaho, will only increase the intensity of
their rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, arguably golf's greatest draw, has not been this excited
about the game in a while. Because he plays with such high
standards, his accomplishments often are taken for granted. He tied
for fifth at the Mercedes Championship and tied for third at
Phoenix. He was a stroke from tying Mark O'Meara in the British
Open last July, and he got a victory in the BellSouth in Atlanta,
two seconds and two thirds. It's newsworthy when he is not in
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately for me, I haven't been winning as much as David
has,'' Woods said. ``I haven't been playing as well, either. ...
Hopefully, my game's peaking toward the World Golf. My short game
has improved where I don't mind missing the green as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while match play is where Woods carved his
competitive reputation _ three USGA junior titles followed by three
U.S. Amateurs _ the format is not one of Duval's favorites. But,
then again, maybe that's to be expected from a guy who shot 59 last
month. Such a score could be wasted in match play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the biggest fan of it, no,'' Duval said.``You never
get what you deserve in match play. You don't. You could have
conceivably the No. 1 player in the world shoot 6-under par and get
beat that day, and the No. 2 player in the world might shoot 3-over
and win, and that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval considers it ``highly likely'' that this week's winner
won't be the player who plays the best golf. One bad day, he said,
``and you're gone _ you're out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as any rivalry with Woods, neither player speaks of one
unless asked, and both admit to playing the field, not a particular
foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great for him and me,'' Woods said, ``but I don't
see that happening, because there are just too many good players
out here. It's not just a handful of guys who can win. ... You
can't just eliminate all of the good ones that have been there so
long and just say Tiger and David are going to carry the torch.
There's probably 50 guys who can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval said, ``I think it's flattering toward me as a player to
try to be anointed the one who is going to try to challenge Tiger
in the future years. However, although I haven't played out here a
long time, I've played out here long enough to realize that there
are many players out here who are just as able as I am or Tiger
Woods is to play and win golf tournaments. So I don't focus on
one-on-one rivalries too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Duval's incredible run might have helped Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, with the way David has performed in the last two
years, some of the expectations are now placed on David, so I think
that takes a little of the burden off Tiger,'' said Mark O'Meara,
Woods' good friend and 1998 player of the year. ``But deep down
inside, I think Tiger likes being No. 1, wants to be No. 1 and
wants to win a lot of golf tournaments. That's my sense of Tiger
Woods. I don't see him backing off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw, the Ryder Cup captain, called Duval immediately
after his 59 at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, asking that he be
careful during a ski trip that followed the record round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't do anything but help golf,'' Crenshaw said about the
Woods-Duval race. ``They're both incredible players, and I think
they're going to push each other to be even better.''

</P>
<P>
   Perfect match: Tiger Woods is well suited for the World Match
Play Golf Championships at La Costa Resort. Woods won three USGA
junior titles and three U.S. Amateurs in match play and grew up
near La Costa.

 &HT;    No sure bets on first day
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Tiger Woods vs. Nick Faldo is the most
intriguing match of the Andersen Consulting Match Play's first
round, but probably won't evolve as the most exciting. If logic
prevails, No. 1 Woods should win easily today against the No. 64
player in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, logic and match play are not always companions.
Woods will assume nothing against the three-time Masters champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still is dangerous, no matter what,'' Woods said Tuesday.
``Even if he's not up to his usual form, he's still a dangerous
opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Victimized by Faldo when he collapsed in the 1996 Masters, Greg
Norman said, ``Knowing Nick's mentality and how strong his head is,
he has found ways to win golf tournaments. I wouldn't be at all
surprised if he can find a way to win this ... I wouldn't say
categorically that Tiger is a shoe-in winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, said Nick Price, the gantlet of seven rounds
in five days to make the final will be a challenge: ``Anyone who
wins this week is going to have five great scalps on his belt ...
It's going to be hard to pick up your clubs and play the next week
after this.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other featured first-round matches:
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 7 Ernie Els vs. No. 58 Paul Azinger: Els has three World
Match Play titles in England and is coming off a win at Los Angeles
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 6 Colin Montgomerie vs. No. 59 Craig Stadler: Could be an
upset special.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 17 Payne Stewart vs. No. 48 Stewart Cink: If Cink wins, he
could face Woods in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   NO DORAL FOR DUVAL
</P>
<P>
   David Duval has withdrawn from next week's Doral-Ryder Open,
needing down time from being on the road since Jan. 4. Woods also
is skipping the Doral.

 &HT;    Jordan absent from Braves spring training
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Spring training began in earnest on
Tuesday as the rest of the Braves position players _ with the
exception of a few _ arrived to begin the first full-squad
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable absentee was right fielder Brian Jordan, an
offseason free-agent acquisition from St. Louis, who was informed
on Monday night that his mother was sick. Jordan, who had been
working out with the Braves for several days in Orlando, flew to
Baltimore and might not return for several days. Manager Bobby Cox
spoke to him on Tuesday and wasn't sure when he could return.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Gerald Williams did not report to camp, because of
personal problems, Cox said. It's not certain when he will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Adrian Manzano, a nonroster invitee to camp, is late
arriving from Mexico because of visa problems but is expected to
arrive today. Catcher Eddie Perez was at home Tuesday, still
recovering from surgery as a result of a foul ball in the groin.
</P>
<P>
   HUNTER RETURN
</P>
<P>
   If spring is a time for rebirth and fresh starts, then how
fitting an arrival is this for Brian Hunter?
</P>
<P>
   After Andres Galarraga's cancer news, Hunter signed a
minor-league contract and was invited to Braves camp. He's got an
opportunity to make the team as a backup to Ryan Klesko at first
base.
</P>
<P>
   After going through four teams in the last four years before
getting released by the Cardinals last August, Hunter has returned
to the Braves 20 pounds lighter, five years older and wiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so young when I was here the first time,'' said Hunter,
31. ``I got sort of complacent. I thought it was easy. It ended up
blowing up in my face a little bit. I know what I've done; I
corrected it, and I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter played on the Braves World Series teams of 1991 and 1992
before leaving after the 1993 season. Since then he's had only one
season, 1994, where he contributed regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been to the bottom yet, but I know where the bottom
is,'' Hunter said. ``I wasn't at the top (in Atlanta), but I was
one of the players who contributed to helping this team win. That's
what I want to be again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter had to have all four of his wisdom teeth removed on
Friday or he said he would have arrived on Sunday. He's fully
recovered except he has to watch what he eats this week. He can't
chew gum, sunflower seeds or spit _ trouble for any baseball
player.
</P>
<P>
   LOCKHART TESTS SHOULDER
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart took his first swings off the pitching machine
Tuesday, another step in his rehabilitation from surgery on his
nonthrowing shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt fine,'' Lockhart said. ``But it's not going to be sore
until tomorrow anyway. . . It was nice to do something different.''
</P>
<P>
   GUILLEN-GALARRAGA CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Ozzie Guillen spent the last two days before reporting
to spring training at Andres Galarraga's house in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   As for his friend's spirits, Guillen said, ``Great.
Unbelievable. I walked in, and I was worried about the way he was
going to act, but he was acting normal. He knows what he has to
face. He's ready for it. He knows he's going to beat it. He knows
he's going to be OK. And that's the most important thing. . . .
Maybe inside it was a big deal, but he didn't show it to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen said Galarraga is en route to Chicago and Baltimore to
search out the best possible treatment and will begin the
chemotherapy not long after.
</P>
<P>
   A. JONES VS. CHICKEN POX
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones had a bout with chicken pox last month, after a
trip to Miami for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even walk the first two weeks,'' Jones said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he has fully recovered and worked himself back into shape by
working out at Turner Field for several weeks, hitting and running.

GOP LEADER WARNS CANDIDATES ON ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also REPUBS-TAXES, REPUBS-MODERATES) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a stern lecture to prospective presidential
candidates in 2000, Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican
Party, warned on Tuesday that he would publicly rebuke any
contender who personally attacked another Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not let it become personal or nasty or mean in spirit,''
Nicholson said in a speech in Des Moines, Iowa, the state that
traditionally holds the first presidential caucuses. ``Even in the
heat of the struggle, make sure you don't confuse people about who
the real adversary is. Because if you sow division within
Republican ranks, because if you forget who and what all
Republicans are fighting for and fighting against, you will pay a
price _ I promise you.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a highly unusual statement at a time when most
candidates have not formally declared their intentions, people
close to Nicholson said he was trying to tamp down the sniping at
Gov. George Bush of Texas. Bush has not stated his intentions, but
he is running far ahead in most early polls. Several of his
prospective rivals have already sought to knock him down by
questioning his credentials and his ``compassionate conservative''
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican advisers said Nicholson timed the warning to
precede the appearance of several presidential prospects _ but not
Bush _ at a gathering of the California Republican Party this
weekend in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, though, Nicholson said such planning
gave him ``too much credit.'' He said some mailings from Republican
candidates were ``tougher than I would have liked,'' but he would
not identify those that bothered him. And he insisted that he did
not believe that any of the criticism of Bush or of other
candidates was thus far out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Several people close to Nicholson said they thought Haley
Barbour, the former party chairman, erred in the 1996 campaign by
not publicly intervening to halt Steve Forbes' multimillion-dollar
advertising attacks on Bob Dole and other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to avoid a bloodbath,'' Nicholson said in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to Nicholson, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
was even more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a concern that's beginning to curdle into unrestrained
terror,'' the adviser said, ``that we're going to have a replay of
'96: Gore raises his $30 million in 90 days, banks it until he goes
on TV _ and blasts our guy. And the Republican nominee emerges
bloody and broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Several campaigns have been frustrated by the outpouring of
support for Bush. At least 13 of the 31 Republican governors, who
are meeting here for a convention of the National Governors'
Association, have said privately or publicly that they intend to
back Bush.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, who has helped rally
support for Bush, said Racicot would in the next several days
announce that more than half the Republican governors were backing
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Such early support from so many governors _ especially for a
politician who is untested nationally _ is a testament to how many
of the chief executives think Bush would be a winning candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted that he did not coordinate the outpouring. ``I
didn't come here and say, `Well, gosh, let's round up a bunch of
governors,''' he told reporters.

BESSIE COHEN, SURVIVOR OF 1911 SHIRTWAIST FIRE, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bessie Cohen, who as a 19-year-old seamstress escaped the
Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in
1911, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. She was 107 and one of the
last two known survivors of the Manhattan fire, according to the
Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Jack Kosslyn, an acting teacher and casting director,
said she died at the Jewish Home for the Aging in Los Angeles,
where she had lived for the last 14 years. Until six weeks ago, he
said, she had retained much of her vitality and memory.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, she had graphically recalled for her family, as
well as for historians and documentary filmmakers, what she
experienced and witnessed on March 25, 1911, when the worst factory
fire in New York history raged through the top three floors of the
10-story Asch Building on the northwest corner of Washington Place
and Greene Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, about 500 women, mostly Jewish and Italian immigrants,
worked behind locked doors making shirtwaists, blouses of
lightweight fabric, depicted as the uniform of modern womanhood in
the illustrations of Charles Dana Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Saturday afternoon, and Mrs. Cohen, then Bessie
Gabrilowich, was on the ninth floor. She had come alone from Russia
to New York two years earlier and had worked in several shops as a
stitcher, saving money to bring her sisters to America. The workers
were near the end of their 6-day, 52-hour workweek, and since one
of the women on the ninth floor had just become engaged, someone
had brought a cake, and slices were being passed around.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of her life, Bessie Cohen would remember that
earlier in the day, she had urged her friend, Dora Abramowitz, who
was 15, to ask the foreman to give her a 50-cent raise to bring her
salary up to the $3 a week that Bessie was earning. At the moment
that someone screamed fire, Bessie was teaching a dance step to a
fellow worker. The flames were coming up from the cutting room on
the floor below.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next 15 minutes, nearly 30 percent of all the
Triangle Shirtwaist workers were killed. Mrs. Cohen would later
tell her children that after the warning, she went to look for the
cheap straw hat she had bought the day before, when she heard a
foreman shout to her in Yiddish, ``Bessie, save yourself.'' She
looked across the room and could see her friend Dora, looking
frightened. But when she looked again, Dora was gone. She was one
of those who jumped from the windows and died.
</P>
<P>
   The fire trucks' ladders could reach only to the seventh floor.
Firefighters held nets below, but so many women were jumping at the
same time that the nets tore and did not hold them. Some rushed to
the elevator shaft, hoping to escape by sliding down the cables,
only to lose their grip. Most of those who lost their lives had
worked on the ninth floor.
</P>
<P>
   Later inquiries found that doors leading from the shop areas had
been locked, presumably to keep the women at their sewing machines.
The owners, who were tried for manslaughter, were acquitted when
the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors
locked or had even known they were locked. But in 1914, civil suits
brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to
each of the families.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the fire, Mrs. Cohen would recall, she somehow
found her way to a staircase and covered her face with her purse as
she ran to the street.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, she returned to the street outside the building,
where the bodies were arrayed so that friends and relatives might
identify them. A newspaper photographer took a picture of her as
she collapsed at the sight; Kosslyn said his mother kept that
newspaper picture throughout her life.
</P>
<P>
   She took other jobs, he said, and became active in the
International Ladies Garment Workers Union, whose organizing
efforts gained momentum after the fire. Two years before the blaze,
a three-month strike of about 20,000 shirtwaist workers in New York
City and Philadelphia had helped to entrench the union and had
focused public attention on conditions in sweatshops. The
needletrades union is a successor to the International Ladies
Garment Workers.
</P>
<P>
   At least one survivor of the fire is still living, according to
The Associated Press. Rose Freedman, 105, of Beverly Hills, Calif.,
escaped by fleeing to the roof, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   The Triangle Shirtwaist fire has become the most vivid symbol of
the struggle for workplace safety. As outrage mounted after the
fire, the union intensified its demands for safer working
conditions. A huge crowd of sympathizers, Mrs. Cohen among them,
paraded in mourning to the arch in Washington Square Park. Hearings
were held, and by the end of 1911, the city of New York had
established a Bureau of Fire Investigation, headed by the future
senator, Robert F. Wagner, who was later the father of the Wagner
Labor Act. The bureau had the power to impose and enforce safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Asch Building, its interior long since gutted and rebuilt,
became a part of New York University and still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen is survived by her son, Jack, of Los Angeles, and a
daughter, Sylvia Scott of Calistoga, Calif. A grandson, Jan Tangen,
died last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1915, Bessie married and moved with her husband, Lewis Cohen,
to New London, Conn., where her son and daughter were born. For
many years after the fire, her son said, she would react fearfully
to thunder and lightning, burying her head in her arms and sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to Passaic, N.J., and then to New York. In
1940, after her marriage ended, she moved to Los Angeles, where her
son was living. Mrs. Cohen, an independent woman, lived on her own
until she was 93 in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, staying on
after most of the Jewish residents had left.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 89, she was mugged and had her jaw fractured by two
men who took her purse, which contained a bus pass and 60 cents.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, she returned to her home and neighbors, sipping
liquids through her wired jaw for months. When she finally did
leave for the nursing home, about 200 of her neighbors, almost all
of them Hispanic, saluted her with a festive street party.

REPUBLICANS PUZZLING OUT TAX-CUT PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (See also REPUBS-MODERATES, REPUBS-NICHOLSON) 
(nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans appeared uncertain Tuesday over what
kind of tax-cut policy they would offer the public as House leaders
backed off their earlier support for a 10 percent across-the-board
cut and the Senate began mulling a budget blueprint that could cut
tax rates by as much as 15 percent phased in over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The result was confusion over an important election issue that
demonstrated how difficult it could be for Republican leaders,
particularly in the House, to pass any legislation because they
have a slim majority of just a half-dozen votes.
</P>
<P>
   They had been so eager to pass the eye-catching 10 percent tax
cut that they designated it earlier this year as one of their top
three legislative priorities, along with saving Social Security and
improving education. But a revolt by a dozen moderates, who prefer
smaller tax cuts, and several conservatives, who prefer to spend
any surplus on eliminating the so-called marriage penalty, has
forced leaders to rethink the entire matter.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said in a brief interview
Tuesday: ``There's a lot of ways we need to look at tax cuts. That
may be one of them. But it may be a combination of things as well.
We have the marriage penalty we're talking about, we have the
earnings limit for seniors on Social Security, we have capital
gains, we have a lot of different tax cuts that are out there. I'm
not saying one is absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   Even spokesmen for the Republican who originally proposed the 10
percent cut _ Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, the chairman of the Budget
Committee who is also planning to run for president _ suggested
that it would not fly. ``We're acknowledging reality while at the
same time not giving up our position,'' said Terry Holt, a
spokesman for Kasich.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and
Means Committee, insisted that the party was united in wanting to
cut taxes. He said it was important to return money to taxpayers
because otherwise Washington would spend it. ``If you leave it up
here,'' Archer said, ``it's going to end up being spent on foreign
aid.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
who is chairman of the Budget Committee, discussed his tentative
budget blueprint privately with his colleagues. He suggested tax
cuts could range between $787 billion and $900 billion over the
next decade but not begin until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Domenici predicted there would be enough money to include
both an across-the-board tax cut and some of the smaller, targeted
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said that
cutting tax rates, not just targeting cuts to certain groups, was
important to expanding the economy. But he put the best face on the
party's puzzle, saying: ``Any time we can have a discussion about
which tax cuts we should put in place, I'm happy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After eight years of growth, the U.S. economy is
showing signs of becoming ``stretched,'' with a potentially
``overvalued'' stock market and a labor market tight enough to
spark inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence for a return of inflation has yet surfaced,
Greenspan said. But by voicing his concerns, the nation's central
banker hinted at a possible interest rate hike down the road,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, in his semiannual report to Congress on the state of
the nation's economy, told the Senate Banking Committee,
``Americans can justifiably feel proud of their recent economic
achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   The inflation rate fell to its lowest level in decades last
year. Unemployment dropped to the lowest rate since 1970. And the
economy grew at a robust 4 percent, topping off the year with a 5
1/2 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan predicted continued healthy growth this year, ``though
likely with a slower pace of economic expansion and a slightly
higher rate of overall inflation than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy-makers are looking for growth of about 2.5 to 3
percent this year, with a modest inflation rate of 2 to 2.5
percent, up from 1.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has become less inflation prone than in the past,
so that the chances of an inflationary breakout arguably are, at
least for now, less than they would have been under similar
conditions in earlier cycles,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman, however, reiterated concerns about the
astronomical levels of some stock prices, although he carefully
dodged an opportunity to repeat his now-infamous December 1996 line
about investor's ``irrational exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   And he noted that inflation remained tame last year, in large
part, because of a plunge in oil prices. While devastating to
Houston's energy-dependent economy, the collapse of crude prices
was a boon to many industries struggling to export to a world
largely mired in recession.
</P>
<P>
   That drop in oil prices, Greenspan warned, was a one-time event
unlikely to repeat itself anytime soon: ``These prices are not
likely to fall further, and they could begin to rise as some Asian
economies revive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan obviously remains worried about the tight job market,
calling it a ``critical upside risk to the inflation outlook.'' He
and other economists have been scratching their heads for months
trying to figure out why the dearth of unemployed workers looking
for jobs has not translated into greater pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said Greenspan seemed to suggest the Fed may have
overdone it last fall, when it cut interest rates three times in an
effort to shield the U.S. economy from the effects of economic
crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers were particularly concerned last year about the
economic fallout from financial problems in Brazil _ Latin
America's largest economy _ but the feared economic contagion has
been quite limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve must continue to evaluate ... whether the
full extent of the policy easings undertaken last fall ... remains
appropriate as those disturbances abate,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   That comment ``was kind of a shot across the bow,'' said Paul
Kasriel, chief U.S. economist for Northern Trust in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan wanted to disabuse investors of the notion the Fed is
considering cutting interest rates again anytime soon, and instead,
and get them thinking about a possible increase, Kasriel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's sort of softening the beachhead a little bit, but
it's still very tentative,'' Kasriel said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Greenspan comments, at first blush, might suggest the Fed
could move either way on interest rates: ``Monetary policy must be
ready to move quickly in either direction should we perceive
imbalances and distortions developing that could undermine the
economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kasriel noted: ``He didn't mention any reasons to move down
... and warned of certain reasons to move up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasriel does not expect Fed policy-makers to raise interest
rates when they meet again March 30, but he is looking for a
possible move later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The markets seemed unsure exactly how to respond to Greenspan's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year treasury bond fell about 1 4/32 point, or $11.25 per
$1,000 in face value.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged after his comments were
released, then rebounded, wobbled for a time and eventually ended
the day down a mere 8.26 points.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, thumbed its
nose at Greenspan's concerns about stock prices, rising 34.34.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities in New York,
said there was such a mixed message in Greenspan's testimony ``it
could have been Julia Child on a cooking show.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also Tuesday reiterated his support for legislation to
modernize the laws governing the banking, insurance and securities
industries, calling the current laws ``outdated, competitively
stifling restrictions.''

MARKET PLACE: PAN-EUROPEAN TV MERGER CALLED DOUBTFUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Great Britain)  (Eds.: Budgeted earlier as BSKYB-CANALPLUS) 
(mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Canal Plus SA of France acknowledged
Tuesday that it had held ``conversations'' with Rupert Murdoch's
media group, but industry analysts were overwhelmingly skeptical
that the two companies would merge their pay-television operations.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of both Canal Plus and British Sky Broadcasting
jumped Tuesday morning on word that Murdoch was pushing for a
pan-European merger. Murdoch's News Corp. owns 40 percent of B Sky
B, Britain's biggest pay-television company.
</P>
<P>
   But after some initial excitement, Canal Plus stock actually
declined slightly amid doubts that European regulators would ever
approve such a merger. The talks were reported Tuesday by The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   B Sky B shares ended with a gain of 18.25 pence, or 3.5 percent,
to 5.37 pounds, or about $8.66, in London. On the Paris bourse,
Canal Plus shares fell 1.2 euros to 293.8 euros, or $323.20, after
rising as much as 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in the market seriously expects a full merger,'' said
Mark Beilby, a media analyst at Deutsche Bank in London. ``But
there could be some kind of joint-venturing, particularly in the
area of acquiring key rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Canal Plus is Europe's biggest pay-television company, with more
than 11 million subscribers in France and nine other countries from
Italy to Scandinavia. B Sky B has 7 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch controls a sprawling array of television, movie and
publishing companies in the United States and Britain, and he has
made several unsuccessful attempts to expand into continental
Europe's pay-television market.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Murdoch abandoned plans to acquire a
controlling stake in Telecom Italia SpA's pay-television unit,
Stream Italia. The deal apparently collapsed after the Italian
government passed legislation that prohibits pay-television
companies from acquiring the rights to broadcast more than 60
percent of national soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch nearly invested two years ago in a German digital
pay-television venture controlled by the Kirch Group, but got cold
feet and pulled out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Neither News Corp. nor B Sky B would comment on the question of
Canal Plus. Soline Delos, a spokeswoman at Canal Plus in Paris,
said her company had talks with Murdoch's group but said they were
nothing unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had conversations with the Murdoch group, as we have
with all major audiovisual groups,'' Ms. Delos said. ``Discussions
of this type are part of Canal Plus' normal relations with partners
and competitors, and they do not call for any special comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry executives said a merger between B Sky B
and Canal Plus would face a high chance of opposition from European
antitrust regulators, who have the authority to stop such deals.
</P>
<P>
   Karel van Miert, head of the European Commission's competition
ministry, blocked the Kirch Group's plans last year to meld its
German digital-television service with the popular satellite
service called Premier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he felt strongly enough to block that plan, he would
certainly have trouble with plans to merge two big international
companies with operations across Europe,'' said one executive, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, analysts said it would be extremely difficult to
decide who would control a merged company. Both Canal Plus and B
Sky B have strong managements, and Canal Plus has a particularly
complicated structure as a result of its diverse international
holdings. Among other things, Canal Plus owns 90 percent of
Telepiu, the Italian pay-tv network; 25 percent of Canal Plus
Espana; 50 percent of Canal Digital in Scandinavia, and 33 percent
of Canal Plus Polska in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Beilby of Deutsche Bank said the two companies might well reach
more limited agreements, such as to avoid attacking each other's
markets or to team up in acquiring rights to entertainment and
sports programming.

   STOCKS END MIXED AS NASDAQ RISES
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices were mixed as traders paused after Monday's big
advance and digested comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, on the economy, inflation and financial markets.
The Dow industrials fell 8.26 points, or almost one-tenth of a
percent, to 9,544.42. The S.&AMP;P. 500-stock index also edged down,
falling 0.96 point, to 1,271.18. The Nasdaq composite index rose
34.34 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,376.35.

ANALYSIS: COURT TESTS AHEAD FOR DWI FORFEITURE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ordering the police to seize the cars of motorists
arrested for drunken driving, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has invoked an
ancient principle of American and British law that, while hotly
contested by civil libertarians and anguished defendants, has
generally been upheld by the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   British royalty confiscated property from subjects who had
failed to pay taxes or customs duties, and American authorities
seized the cars and equipment of bootleggers during Prohibition. In
the 1980s, forfeiture _ a taking by government of property used in
the commission of a crime _ became a favorite tool of prosecutors
who opened a double-barreled legal attack against drug smugglers:
charging them with criminal violations while also seizing their
assets in civil actions.
</P>
<P>
   That is the model chosen by Giuliani, a former federal
prosecutor, in his aggressive new campaign against drunken driving
in New York City. While state laws in New York and more than 20
other states permit the police to confiscate the cars of repeat
offenders, Giuliani has upped the ante. He ordered officers to
seize the cars of first-time offenders, and then said that even if
a driver is ultimately acquitted of the criminal charge, the city
might still pursue permanent confiscation of the car in civil
court.
</P>
<P>
   In raising that possibility, Giuliani was distinguishing between
a criminal drunken driving case and a civil forfeiture case, which
technically would be made against the car itself. Even if a person
accused of drunken driving is acquitted in criminal court, where
``proof beyond a reasonable doubt'' is required, a prosecutor could
still establish in civil court, where a less stringent
``preponderance of the evidence'' is required, that a car was used
to commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the broad
principle of forfeiture during the last two decades, legal
questions still surround Giuliani's new program, which went into
effect last weekend. Can the city rely solely on its own
Administrative Code to justify seizing the car of someone who had
never before been accused of driving while intoxicated? Might the
punishment _ seizing, say, a $50,000 car _ be deemed out of
proportion with the offense? How would confiscation of a car affect
plea bargaining in drunken driving cases?
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of going at people through their property has a long
history,'' said Daniel C. Richman, a professor at Fordham Law
School. ``The theories are quite old. The prevalence of the
practice is comparatively recent. I think seizing cars on
DWI-related theories is state-of-the-art forfeiture law. It's the
logical outgrowth of a long process.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman and many other legal experts said that while most
constitutional issues connected to forfeiture have been settled,
there are several legal questions that the courts are likely to
confront as drivers challenge the mayor's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, the U.S. Supreme Court, for the first time,
struck down an aspect of the federal government's use of
forfeiture. The court ruled that a seizure of property is
unconstitutional if the amount seized is ``grossly
disproportional'' to the gravity of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-to-4 ruling, the court said that the government had been
wrong to seize $357,144 in cash that a Los Angeles family had had
in its luggage on a flight to Cyprus, intending to settle a debt.
While the money was not the result of a crime, the family had
broken a federal law that requires reporting all currency in excess
of $10,000 being taken out of the country, making the money an
instrument of a crime. But the majority determined that seizing
such a large sum for such a relatively small violation was
excessive and thus unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a driver seeking to recover a car confiscated under
New York's new initiative might argue that the punishment for the
same crime, driving while intoxicated, could vary greatly,
depending on the value of a car. Is it fair that one driver loses a
car worth $45,000 and another loses one worth $700?
</P>
<P>
   ``The punishment can be very disparate, based upon the
arbitrariness of what the vehicle is,'' said James B. Jacobs, a
professor at the New York University School of Law, who said he
generally favors tough sanctions against drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The city's effort undoubtedly will be challenged on statutory
grounds as well. State law permits the seizing of property used in
the commission of felonies. A repeat drunken-driving offense is
considered a felony in New York state, but a first-time offense is
usually charged as a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said he planned to challenge whether the city has
the power to seize the cars of anyone accused of drunken driving
for the first time. ``There is a serious question whether the
Giuliani administration has the authority to impose a new form of
punishment that is not authorized by state law,'' Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said he had agreed Tuesday to help represent a driver
whose car was confiscated on Sunday, Pavel Grinberg of Staten
Island, who was accused of drunken driving for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor and city lawyers are convinced that the
forfeitures would be upheld. Under a provision of the city's
Administrative Code enacted in 1943, the police are empowered to
seek the forfeiture of property used in the commission of a crime.
The city's provision predates the state law on forfeiture by 41
years, said Daniel S. Connolly, special counsel to Michael D. Hess,
the city's corporation counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city at this point is completely satisfied in acting under
the Administrative Code provision, both for first- and second-time
offenders,'' Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Giuliani's threat to pursue forfeiture in civil court
even after a driver has been acquitted of criminal charges, several
law professors said federal prosecutors often do that against
narcotics traffickers. The standard of proof in criminal cases _
beyond a reasonable doubt _ is much higher than the standard in
civil actions, which is a preponderance of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hard equity question, but it's not a very hard legal
question,'' Richman said. ``Legally, the administration is quite
right on that point. Does it offend people's notion of fairness?
Perhaps.''

SUPREME COURT HANDS NCAA VICTORY IN CIVIL RIGHTS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., also filed in `w' category) 
(rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court handed a victory on Tuesday to
the NCAA in a closely watched civil rights suit, ruling unanimously
that the organization is not automatically covered by the
anti-discrimination laws which apply to its member schools.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Philadelphia had ruled last year that
the NCAA was covered by the federal laws by virtue of its receipt
of dues from its 1,200 member colleges and universities, which are
themselves covered.
</P>
<P>
   Two federal laws prohibit discrimination by educational
institutions that receive federal funds, as essentially all schools
and colleges do: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 bars
discrimination on the basis of sex, while Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 prohibits race discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the justices, in a sex discrimination suit by a
woman who was refused a waiver by the NCAA to play intercollegiate
volleyball as a graduate student, was whether these prohibitions
extend to the NCAA itself.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that the NCAA engaged in sex discrimination
by granting waivers more often to men than to women.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court on Tuesday, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
said that ``dues payments from recipients of federal funds, we
hold, do not suffice to render the dues recipient subject to Title
IX.'' At most, the NCAA ``indirectly benefits from the federal
assistance afforded its members,'' Ginsburg said, adding that
``this showing, without more, is insufficient to trigger Title IX
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Although race discrimination was not an issue in this case, NCAA
vs. Smith, the court's analysis would also apply to lawsuits
brought under Title VI, which has a similar structure.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling does not spell the end of the three-year-old lawsuit
filed by the graduate student, Renee M. Smith. The court did not
address two other possible grounds for NCAA liability, which Smith,
who graduated from law school last year, is now free to pursue in
the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   She is arguing that the NCAA itself is a recipient of federal
funds through its separately incorporated National Youth Sports
Program, which receives some $15 million a year from the Department
of Health and Human Services to run sports programs for inner-city
youth. And she is also arguing that the NCAA should be deemed to
share its members' legal obligations because they have effectively
ceded to the NCAA control over their intercollegiate sports
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The organization disputes those alternative theories and will
continue to fight the case in court, its president, Cedric W.
Dempsey, said on Tuesday. ``We have consistently said that the NCAA
should be in compliance with Title IX on a voluntary basis and have
worked to achieve compliance,'' Dempsey said in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff's lawyer, Carter G. Phillips, said in an interview
that his client would pursue her case. ``The court went out of its
way to make its ruling extremely narrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith played varsity volleyball at St. Bonaventure University
and graduated in only two and a half years, with two years of
athletic eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But when she sought permission to play while in graduate school
at Hofstra University and law school at the University of
Pittsburgh, she ran up against the NCAA's ``post-baccalaureate
bylaw,'' which limits postgraduate eligibility to the same school
that a student-athlete attended as an undergraduate. Both Hofstra
and Pittsburgh sought waivers for Smith, but the NCAA denied the
requests.

<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ With exceptional swiftness, a jury on Tuesday
declared John William King, a white man, guilty of capital murder
for dragging a black man to his death behind a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   The jury began deliberations after less than five days of
testimony and barely an hour of closing arguments, chose its only
black member as foreman and returned two and a half hours later
with the strongest possible verdict. Jurors then quickly began
hearing evidence on whether King should be sentenced to death for
murdering James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice has been served,'' said a tearful Mary Verrette, one
of Byrd's sisters, as she emerged from the 110-year-old Jasper
County Courthouse. ``It was not decided on emotion but on facts,
and that's all we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, slumped slightly as the verdict was read by Judge Joe
Bob Golden of State District Court but showed no other emotion.
Byrd's relatives and others in the packed courtroom burst into
applause as the jury rose to leave the courtroom after the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   King is one of three white men charged with killing Byrd, 49, in
the dark, early hours of June 7, 1998, dragging him on a chain
behind a pickup truck for three miles down rural roads in the pine
woods east of Jasper. Trial dates have yet to be set for the other
defendants, Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, who met King when the two
were in prison, and Shawn Berry, 23, who has known King since high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that King was plotting to form his own white
supremacist gang in Jasper _ the Texas Rebel Soldier Division of
the Confederate Knights of America _ and had hoped to use the
grisly death of a local black man to help recruit members and,
perhaps, to provide a blood initiation into the gang for Berry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any jury in the country would have decided it the same
way,'' said Guy James Gray, the Jasper County district attorney,
who led the prosecution. ``You can't put up with this sort of
stuff. You can't tolerate it. It could've happened anywhere in this
nation, but it fell on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray and others said they were not surprised that it took the
jury so little time to come to a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not surprised that they decided so fast, because the
evidence was overwhelming,'' said Ethel Parks, a black Jasper
resident who came to the courthouse to hear the verdict. ``For
once, they did something right in Jasper.''
</P>
<P>
   After a break of only a few minutes, court reconvened to begin
the punishment phase of the trial, in which both sides will argue
which of the two potential sentences, death by lethal injection or
life imprisonment, should be given to King. Prosecutors said they
expected the jury, whose decision will be final, to begin
deliberating on punishment as early as Thursday, and certainly
before the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which drew international attention and brought back
memories of Southern lynchings from decades past, began with the
discovery of Byrd's body, scattered in pieces along the country
road where he was dragged. He had last been seen alive in the back
of the pickup after hitchhiking home from a late-night party.
Byrd's head and right shoulder were sheared off when the truck sped
around a sharp corner and he slammed into a sharp-edged culvert.
His lower body was found a mile farther down the road, dumped
outside a cemetery and black church.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution called 43 witnesses, some of whom linked King to
the death scene (his cigarette lighter was found there, as was his
DNA on a cigarette butt) and some of whom exposed his racist
attitudes (his arms and torso are covered with Nazi and white
supremacist tattoos and his writings disclosed a deep hatred of
blacks and a yearning for fame).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling testimony came on Monday, when a
pathologist described how Byrd had been alive through much of his
ordeal, probably until his body was cut in two. Prosecutors also
showed a videotape of the road the pickup traveled, illustrating
the length of the trip and showing every inch of what Byrd was
dragged across.
 &UR;  &LR; Also on Monday, prosecutors placed in evidence what they
considered their coup de grace, a letter that King had tried to
smuggle out of his jail cell to Brewer in which he asserted that
``regardless of the outcome of this, we have made history and shall
die proudly remembered if need be.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense offered only three witnesses Monday in a case that
lasted less than an hour. One of them, a prison artist responsible
for some of King's tattoos, testified that King wore them to scare
off fellow prisoners who might try to harm him.
</P>
<P>
   The jury had three choices on Tuesday: to find King not guilty,
to find him guilty of capital murder (which meant that he murdered
Byrd while in the process of committing another crime, in this case
kidnapping) or to find him guilty of a lesser murder charge. King's
lawyers focused much of their attention on refuting the kidnapping
charge, hoping to save their client from a capital murder
conviction and the subsequent possibility of execution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We know that a terrible, terrible, brutal, horrendous murder
was committed,'' said Brack Jones, a lawyer for King. ``No
question. The question is, Was Byrd kidnapped?''
</P>
<P>
   Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs, the chief defense lawyer, asked the
jurors not to let King's repellant views sway them into finding
more guilt than the evidence showed. He acknowledged that his
client was a racist. ``Not that I agree with that,'' he said. ``But
you have a right to be a racist.''
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Pat Hardy, one of the prosecutors,
asked, ``What makes a person hate so hard to do something like that
to a person they don't even know?'' The answer, he said, could only
be found in the racism that obsessed King.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy directed the jurors' attention to a Ku Klux Klan drawing
that was found in King's apartment and placed in evidence, showing
a trio of horsemen galloping from a fire. ``Robed riders coming
straight out of hell,'' Hardy said. ``And that's exactly what they
were that night. Instead of a rope, they used a chain; instead of
horses, there was a pickup truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray argued that the community needed to rid itself of such
violent racism, almost as an issue of public health. ``It's
something that's a virus,'' he said. ``It's something that's
dangerous. It's something that spreads from one person to
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, on the sun-bright courthouse lawn, a palpable sense of
relief flowed through the small crowd that had gathered to hear the
verdict. While many feared that the trial would draw protests from
both extremes of the racial divide, life carried on much as usual
during the trial and there were no protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very relieved at the moment, but we still have some
healing to do,'' said Mayor R.C. Horn, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict drew responses from leaders across the nation,
including President Clinton, who said that expressions of outrage
over Byrd's death ``demonstrate that an act of evil like this is
not what our country is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   John H. Matthews, a Jasper real estate broker whose office
overlooks the courthouse, came across the road to retrieve his dog,
Domino, who was scampering amid the television crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper is not a bad town,'' Matthews said. ``It's got some
good people in it. I think we're ready for you all to go home
now.''

SUPREME COURT HANDS NCAA VICTORY IN CIVIL RIGHTS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., also filed in `w' category) 
(rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court handed a victory on Tuesday to
the NCAA in a closely watched civil rights suit, ruling unanimously
that the organization is not automatically covered by the
anti-discrimination laws which apply to its member schools.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Philadelphia had ruled last year that
the NCAA was covered by the federal laws by virtue of its receipt
of dues from its 1,200 member colleges and universities, which are
themselves covered.
</P>
<P>
   Two federal laws prohibit discrimination by educational
institutions that receive federal funds, as essentially all schools
and colleges do: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 bars
discrimination on the basis of sex, while Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 prohibits race discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the justices, in a sex discrimination suit by a
woman who was refused a waiver by the NCAA to play intercollegiate
volleyball as a graduate student, was whether these prohibitions
extend to the NCAA itself.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that the NCAA engaged in sex discrimination
by granting waivers more often to men than to women.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court on Tuesday, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
said that ``dues payments from recipients of federal funds, we
hold, do not suffice to render the dues recipient subject to Title
IX.'' At most, the NCAA ``indirectly benefits from the federal
assistance afforded its members,'' Ginsburg said, adding that
``this showing, without more, is insufficient to trigger Title IX
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Although race discrimination was not an issue in this case, NCAA
vs. Smith, the court's analysis would also apply to lawsuits
brought under Title VI, which has a similar structure.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling does not spell the end of the three-year-old lawsuit
filed by the graduate student, Renee M. Smith. The court did not
address two other possible grounds for NCAA liability, which Smith,
who graduated from law school last year, is now free to pursue in
the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   She is arguing that the NCAA itself is a recipient of federal
funds through its separately incorporated National Youth Sports
Program, which receives some $15 million a year from the Department
of Health and Human Services to run sports programs for inner-city
youth. And she is also arguing that the NCAA should be deemed to
share its members' legal obligations because they have effectively
ceded to the NCAA control over their intercollegiate sports
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The organization disputes those alternative theories and will
continue to fight the case in court, its president, Cedric W.
Dempsey, said on Tuesday. ``We have consistently said that the NCAA
should be in compliance with Title IX on a voluntary basis and have
worked to achieve compliance,'' Dempsey said in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff's lawyer, Carter G. Phillips, said in an interview
that his client would pursue her case. ``The court went out of its
way to make its ruling extremely narrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith played varsity volleyball at St. Bonaventure University
and graduated in only two and a half years, with two years of
athletic eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But when she sought permission to play while in graduate school
at Hofstra University and law school at the University of
Pittsburgh, she ran up against the NCAA's ``post-baccalaureate
bylaw,'' which limits postgraduate eligibility to the same school
that a student-athlete attended as an undergraduate. Both Hofstra
and Pittsburgh sought waivers for Smith, but the NCAA denied the
requests.

 &HT;    Jury declares main suspect in Jasper killing guilty
 &HT;    By Zach Maxwell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ John William King, pegged as a life-long
criminal and white supremacist, was found guilty Tuesday of capital
murder for the June 7, 1998, slaying of James Byrd Jr., whom he
dragged behind his buddy's truck down three miles of a country
road.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict from the 12-member jury _ who selected the lone
black man as their foreman _ came about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday, two
hours after deliberations began. The trial now moves to the
sentencing phase, with prosecutors expecting the jury to decide
whether King, 24, will live out his years in prison or die for the
murder that shook the soul of this community and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the death penalty is what the government provides for
crimes of this sort, then by all means that's what we want to
happen,'' Byrd's sister Clara Taylor said after the verdict was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's parents also attended Tuesday's emotional proceedings at
the Jasper County Courthouse. ``I saw her smile for the first time
in a long time,'' Taylor said of her mother when State District
Judge Joe Bob Golden read the guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
   King watched the jury, but looked away when his fate was
announced. His father, Ronald King, left the courthouse after
applause broke out. The elder King, who suffers from a number of
ailments, reportedly sought medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Family friend David Luther read a statement from Ronald King,
who did not grant interviews to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might expect, Mr. King is deeply saddened by the
verdict handed down today,'' Luther said. ``Mr. King is just as
saddened for the James Byrd Jr. family as they have shouldered an
even greater burden these last several months. He prays that no
family should ever experience prejudice of any sort ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   Security was the tightest yet for the trial's outcome, but only
a familiar handful of local residents joined the throngs of media
members on the courthouse lawn. As the courthouse bell tolled the 4
p.m. hour, King was whisked away to jail while a few hecklers
called to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should get the death penalty. Definitely,'' said
Kevin Higginbotham of Houston, who made his first ever trip to
Jasper to witness the day's events. ``Lethal injection is too good
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From day one he's done nothing but smile,'' local resident
Tracey Parks said. ``Now he doesn't have anything to smile about.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys began the day with their closing arguments. Assistant
District Attorney Pat Hardy painted King and two co-defendants as
``three robed riders coming straight out of hell,'' holding up a
drawing of three Klansmen on horseback that was found in King's
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of using a rope, they used a chain,'' he said. ``They
dumped the body in front of a black cemetery to show their defiance
of God, of Christianity and everything most people in this county
stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys failed to convince the jury that kidnapping
was not part of Byrd's horrific murder. Without kidnapping, King
would have faced a lesser charge of murder.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray said he was ``relieved'' about
the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough way to make a living,'' he said. ``This was a
bombshell in our community. It could have happened anywhere in the
country and it fell in our laps.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the mounds of racist writings found in King's
apartment and from jail correspondence as among the most damaging
evidence. King apparently planned to begin a racist hate group
called the Texas Rebel Soldiers in Jasper, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man has done an awful lot of writing,'' he said. ``He's
kind of written himself into this hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs said he was
disappointed but not surprised at the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of your duty as an attorney is to get the client prepared
for the worst,'' he said. ``I don't t

 &HT;    Guilty verdict in Jasper dragging death trial
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER _ A white supremacist who sought infamy for his gang was
convicted Tuesday in the dragging death of a black man whose
torturous killing became a wake-up call about racism in America.
</P>
<P>
   The family of murder victim James Byrd Jr. embraced and wiped
tears when the verdict against John William ``Bill'' King was
announced. Spontaneous applause broke out from some spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles, who was guarding King, blew
the Byrd family a kiss. King, 24, showed no reaction, but his
ailing father began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors took just under 2 1/2 hours to decide King was guilty of
kidnapping and dragging Byrd behind a pickup for nearly three miles
until he was decapitated on June 7. The jury, which selected the
only black person on the panel as foreman, now must decide if King
should die for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors heard from probation and police officers who discussed
King's criminal history and his refusal to follow rules while on
probation for burglary. Testimony continues today.
</P>
<P>
   If he receives the death penalty, King would become the first
white person in Texas to be sentenced to lethal injection for
killing a black person since the state resumed capital punishment
in the mid-1970s, state prison records show. Two of King's white
friends also are charged in Byrd's murder and face the death
penalty in upcoming trials. Prosecutors said they won't offer any
plea bargains to Shawn Berry and Lawrence Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and community leaders in Jasper, who have worked
overtime to defend the reputation of this Deep East Texas logging
town in the aftermath of Byrd's murder, were relieved by the guilty
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bombshell in our community,'' said Jasper County
District Attorney Guy James Gray. ``It's something we're unhappy
with. The crime is horrible. The reason is horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It could have happened anyplace in this country and
it fell in our laps. And I don't think we wanted anybody to feel
like we would run from it. We didn't shift it off. It's Jasper's
responsibility and we handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   James Byrd Sr., who has attended the trial each day since
testimony began Feb. 16, thanked the Jasper community for pulling
together in support of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't have to do it, but you did and we appreciate it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence in the trial was stacked so heavily against King that
his defense lawyers all but conceded his guilt in the killing. They
have concentrated on trying to win a life sentence for the
ex-convict whose numerous anti-black and Nazi-like tattoos
transformed him into a walking billboard for white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed defense lawyer C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr.
said defending King is ``like climbing Mt. Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   King's conviction came after one-hour of closing arguments,
during which a prosecutor dramatically held up a KKK illustration
from King's collection for the jury. He said King and his two
co-defendants were no different than the ``three robed riders
coming straight out of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a rope, they used a chain. Instead of horses, they
were using a pickup truck,'' said Pat Hardy, assistant Jasper
County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they dragged this poor man and tore his body to pieces,
they dropped him right in front of a church and a cemetery to show
their defiance of God, to show their defiance of Christianity and
to show their defiance of everything that most people in this
county stand for and in this state and in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that connected King to Byrd's murder included his
KKK-inscribed cigarette lighter found at the spot where Byrd was
chained to the pickup, a spot of Byrd's blood on the bottom of one
of King's sandals and DNA testing that indicated King had smoked
one of the cigarettes found on the logging road where the dragging
of Byrd began.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most damning evidence came from King himself,
even though he declined to testify. Scores of his racist writings
were introduced, including a jailhouse note to one of his
co-defendants in which he boasted of having ``made history'' after
Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of written himself into this hole,'' said Gray, the
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that was very damaging and something we
couldn't overcome,'' Cribbs said.
</P>
<P>
   King's hand-written documents show he was trying to form a new
white supremacy group in Jasper called the Texas Rebel Soldiers, an
offshoot of a white state prison gang King joined while serving
time for burglary.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers argued that King's prison experience transformed him
into a racist. He joined a white gang and got anti-black tattoos as
a means of protecting himself from black inmates who outnumbered
white inmates and tried to beat or sexually assault small white men
like King, they argued.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, Cribbs suggested that King suffered from
post-traumatic stress syndrome after getting out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question this boy had something
happen to him in the penitentiary,'' he said. ``He became a racist.
He became a hater.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, King's father and Byrd's family have kept
a respectful distance. They have exchanged pleasantries, but have
not visited at length.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict was returned and court recessed for 30
minutes, one of Byrd's sisters tried to approach Ronald King to
offer a hug, but the retired lumber worker was surrounded by
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't blame him,'' said Mylinda Washington. ``It was hard
for him as a parent to go through this. We're all losers here.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one of Byrd's sisters, Stella Brumley, said, ``We don't
hold a grudge, and we wanted to let Mr. King know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King, who has emphysema and uses a wheelchair, left the
courtroom to visit a doctor. A family friend, David Luther, later
issued a statement on behalf of the elder King.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might expect, Mr. King is deeply saddened by the
verdict handed down today,'' the statement said. ``Mr. King is just
as saddened for the James Byrd Jr. family as they have shouldered
an even greater burden these last several months.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. King loves his son as hopefully any father should. He
prays that no family should ever experience prejudice of any sort
ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside on the courthouse lawn, the newly convicted King was
heckled by a few black Jasper residents as he was led in a
bullet-proof vest into a sheriff's pickup for the ride back to
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper served justice,'' said Tracey Parks, a friend of the
murdered man, as she watched King being taken away.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a cry for help from Brooklyn, a silent cry,
but one with piercing echoes. It was written outside the Jackie
Robinson Intermediate School 320 on McKeever Street in Crown
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   It was written on a deflated basketball that rested between two
crosses in the school garden. Someone had scrawled a plea on the
ball. ``MJ,'' it read, ``Please Explain Love of the Game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a cry for help, for understanding, for trying to bring
perspective where tragedy had struck. The ``MJ,'' unmistakably, was
Michael Jordan. It seemed not so much, in reality, an appeal to
that supreme deity of basketball, as it was a cry in the night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a result of the senseless murder on Jan. 27 across from
the school. After a basketball game between teams of teen-agers in
the Jackie Robinson Center for Physical Culture after-school
program, played at the school, a 14-year-old named Michael Bennett,
the high scorer on the winning team, was chased, beaten and stabbed
to death across from the school.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five teen-agers charged in connection with the slaying,
three were members of the losing team.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ward read of the killing, and, though unaware of the
message on the deflated basketball in the school garden, responded,
as most who read of it did, with his heart.
</P>
<P>
   The point guard for the Knicks, who plays home games in Madison
Square Garden, some six miles and a world apart from the Jackie
Robinson school, spoke with Terry Williams, a business associate of
his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie said to me, `I'd like to do something _ I'm not sure
what,''' recalled Williams. ``He is interested in community
affairs. He doesn't make a lot of noise about it. He just does
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams called the school and Ward was invited to speak to
students. Two weeks ago, he did. There was no publicity attendant
to the visit. In fact, I learned about it at the end of a story in
The New York Times' Metropolitan section about the aftermath of the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Ward told the kids that basketball was ``not life and death, but
simply a game.'' He said, ``God didn't give anyone the right to
take someone else's life.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about living with hope _ knowing that some of them,
even at so young an age, were losing hope of a better life beyond
the streets, or had lost the hope. He spoke about everyone having a
talent, and gave an example of a biblical parable about developing
talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at me,'' he said, ``and you are looking at a finished
product. But you don't see all the years of work I had to put in to
get where I have. And you think about the big money basketball
players make. But I'm 28 years old now, and for 20 years I never
made a red cent. I did try to develop my skills. And nothing came
easy. In college, I earned a degree while playing two sports.''
It's no secret, of course, that Ward was quarterback on the Florida
State football team and won the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about trying to reach the masses,'' Ward said,
recalling his visit. ``If I can influence just one person, or two,
to go on to better themselves, that's all I can ask for. Then maybe
those one or two can influence someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ward presents himself as a deeply religious man. People
who know him well say he is genuine. He explains the accusations
that he is a less than clean-acting basketball player by saying
that small players _ he is 6 feet 1 inch _ have to be wily to
counteract their larger foes. But that is beside the point in the
larger issue beyond the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   As a citizen _ as a ``brother'' in the black community, as he
referred to himself _ Charlie Ward believes he must try to be part
of the solution. ``Just because I've attained a certain position
doesn't mean I can't look back, and lend a hand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward grew up in Thomasville, Ga. His father was a high school
coach and social science teacher, his mother a librarian. ``I was
fortunate to have a good foundation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of kids grow up in broken homes, but that's no
excuse for not trying to make something of yourself. A lot of
people from broken homes have done well. You have to have faith,
but you have to work hard. You don't realize your dreams if you
have one and not the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's remarks to the students were not earth-shaking. It was
just common-sense talk coming from someone who had achieved, who
had heard a cry, who responded.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the case involving charges against five boys in the
killing will be acted upon by a grand jury. And outside the school,
there remains a small shrine for Michael Bennett. Balloons are tied
to a wrought-iron fence.
</P>
<P>
   There is a picture of him, a boy with a sweet smile, and
underneath is his name and birth date. He would have been 15 years
old on Monday.

WHITE SUPREMACIST FOUND GUILTY IN EAST TEXAS DRAGGING DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A 24-year-old white supremacist was found guilty
of capital murder on Tuesday in the dragging death of a black man,
a hate crime that a prosecutor said was reminiscent of 19th century
lynchings by mounted Klansmen.
</P>
<P>
   John William King, 24, sat hunched slightly forward but did not
stir when the jury announced its verdict after deliberating about
85 minutes. The punishment phase of the trial began immediately to
determine if King will be sentenced to death, or to life in prison.
It will continue on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   King is the first of three white men to stand trial in the June
7, 1998, death of James Byrd Jr., 49, who was chained to a pickup
bumper and dragged for three miles along a rural road. The gruesome
nature of the slaying and its apparent racial motivation focused
unwanted international attention on the East Texas community of
8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Several courtroom spectators applauded yesterday's verdict,
drawing a sharp warning from District Judge Joe Bob Golden. Outside
the courtroom, members of Byrd's family said they were ``elated,
relieved,'' and expressed gratitude to the sheriff and district
attorney for mounting a successful case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all should drag him from the truck!'' Tracey Parks, 25, a
neighbor of the victim, shouted as King was escorted to a white
pickup that would shuttle him back to the Jasper County Jail.
``They need to do him like he did to Byrd,'' she said. ``Lethal
injection is too easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the community had been eager to see the case finished
and Jasper's good name restored. No dates have been set for the
trials of the other defendants, Lawrence Russell Brewer and Shawn
Berry.
</P>
<P>
   A family friend read a note on behalf of Ronald King, the
defendant's father, saying he was deeply saddened by the verdict
and just as saddened for the Byrd family ``as they have shouldered
an even greater burden these last several months.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King also urged Jasper ``to continue to show the world by
its example, that during these difficult times, good will overcome
all evil...''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement saying that when Byrd was
killed, ``it was my hope that people would join together across
racial lines to demonstrate that an act of evil like this is not
what our country is all about. That hope was fulfilled over the
past eight months, as citizens across the country expressed their
outrage and grief over this tragedy, and their determination to
ensure that justice be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the verdict rendered today by twelve citizens in
Jasper, Texas, will bring some sense of closure to the family and
friends of Mr. Byrd,'' Clinton said. ``The First Lady and I offer
our prayers for them, and our hope that their memories of Mr.
Byrd's life will sustain them in the difficult time ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, defense and prosecution attorneys said that King's
own writing provided some of the most damaging evidence against
him.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote out by-laws and a constitution for a planned hate group
and sent a newspaper his account of the crime, which the
prosecution used against him.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly harmful to his case was an intercepted jailhouse
note to Brewer. In it, King acknowledged finding a ``brown
substance'' on his sandals that FBI experts determined was Byrd's
blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the outcome of this, we have made history and
shall die proudly .... SEIG HEIL (HAIL VICTORY),'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs said part of his job
was to prepare King for the worst. ``I am sure he is feeling mixed
emotions,'' Cribbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Cribbs said King's jailhouse note to co-defendant Brewer was
``very damning and something you couldn't keep out'' as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray listed King's writing and DNA
evidence as keys to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of written himself into this hole,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, King's attorneys did not contend that he
was not a participant in a ``brutal, brutal'' killing. But they
insisted that chaining Byrd to a pickup did not amount to
kidnapping and, therefore, King should not be convicted of capital
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tying of the feet and dragging, as we see the case, is the
intentionally killing and not the kidnapping,'' defense attorney
Brack Jones argued.
</P>
<P>
   Cribbs, the lead defense attorney, suggested that King might
have post-traumatic shock syndrome from his two years in a Texas
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In their closing argument, prosecutors summed up the case
against King, linking him to crime by his inscribed cigarette
lighter and his DNA on a cigarette butt found at the scene, and by
a fleck of Byrd's blood found on his sandals at home.
</P>
<P>
   Among racist papers seized at his apartment was an inverted
pentagram behind mounted klansmen with a coil of rope, Assistant
District Attorney Pat Hardy reminded jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was exactly what it was that night,'' said Hardy.
``Instead of a rope, they used a chain. Instead of horses, they
were using a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, ladies and gentlemen, the satanic part of that comes in
after they dragged that poor man and tore his body to pieces,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dropped him right in front of a church and a cemetery to
show their defiance of God, to show their defiance of Christianity
and to show their defiance of everything that most people in this
county stand for, and in this state and in this country.''

ON PRO FOOTBALL: COLLINS HAS SOME OLD HITCHES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kerry Collins arrived in Mobile, Ala., for the 1995 Senior Bowl
fresh from leading Penn State to a 12-0 record and a Rose Bowl
victory over Oregon. He had reached the roses by beating Illinois,
35-31, for the Big Ten title in a struggle in which Penn State
erased a 21-point deficit. Collins directed the winning drive,
connecting on all seven of his passes into a whipping wind. The
drive covered 96 yards. It finished with 57 seconds remaining.
Nebraska would win the mythical national title that year, but
everyone at Penn State was certain that Collins and the Nittany
Lions were better. And they told him so.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the tingling theater of his college career,
Collins was showered with more attention and glory at the Senior
Bowl. Everyone wanted to shake his hand and hear him speak. He
seemed shy, but moved rather easily through the crowds. Shook
hands. Spoke softly. Said the right things to a mosaic of pro
football scouts. But then the news of that Senior Bowl broke. Oh my
gosh! Kerry Collins has a hitch!
</P>
<P>
   It ran like wildfire. Kerry Collins throws with this little
hitch in his passing delivery, a la Randall Cunningham. He sort of
cocks his arm and then throws the football. See? He had been doing
it this way all of his life, but now everyone was noticing and
making this thing big. How will that work in the pro game?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, shockingly, for Kerry Collins, the petals began to
fall off the rose.
</P>
<P>
   Collins immediately started catching them. He tried putting them
back in place. He said he could probably change the hitch. He said
it was not an issue. He could play and excel, all right, throwing
his way, hitch and all.
</P>
<P>
   So, then and certainly now, Kerry Collins comes with a hitch. He
is the Giants' quarterback now and who doubts he has been selected
as their quarterback for the future and most likely even for the
present? Kent Graham hears footsteps. He sees the Giants investing
$16.9 million over four years in Collins and awarding him $5
million up front in a signing bonus. He must know that Collins is
the man to beat at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Today. Tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Collins provides an even bigger hitch _ unless he blows
it.
</P>
<P>
   History says he can.
</P>
<P>
   He blew away the doubt at the Senior Bowl and became the fifth
player selected in the 1995 draft. He became a Carolina Panther and
in his second season took them to the National Football Conference
championship game. The last two seasons, however, Carolina
struggled. So did Collins. Some of his old Panthers coaches and
teammates say he quit on them last year. One of them accused
Collins of racist-like talk. Others said he had a drinking problem.
Collins says it was all a misunderstanding. He was released and
then signed by New Orleans on Oct. 14. On Nov. 2, he was arrested
for driving under the influence of alcohol. Mike Ditka, the Saints'
head coach, had said of Collins and the baggage he might bring when
he signed him: ``I'm not clairvoyant, but I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Giants say now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have intensely researched his play and his background and
we believe in Dr. Joel Goldberg _ he gave us the green light and I
trust him without reservation,'' Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general
manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi trusts Goldberg, the Giants' director of career
counseling, without reservation, not Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are always concerned and you are taking a risk in any
football decision you make about a new player, whether it be for
failure on or off the field,'' Accorsi said. ``If we had traded
four draft picks to move up to take one of the young quarterbacks
in the draft, that would have been a risk, too. We felt we made the
best move.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins can take you into the end zone, for sure. He can also
steer you into the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   He was 2-5 as the New Orleans starter and threw 10
interceptions, fumbled eight times and lost four of them in fewer
than 24 quarters. Ditka let Collins go.
</P>
<P>
   How can a quarterback that the downtrodden Saints discarded be
the apple of the Giants' eye?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the Steelers didn't think Johnny Unitas could play,
either,'' Accorsi snapped. ``We trust our own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Collins in four games with a Saints offense that is
horrible is not a true measuring stick of his current talent. But
what is? His Penn State days? His dream season in '96 with
Carolina? His banishing in Carolina and New Orleans? The character
thing? His brush with the law? That's the hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The word is out and the heat is on Kerry Collins. He requires
broad shoulders to stand tall in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants and Collins? They're hitched. The contract says for
four years. History hints maybe not that long.

MARTINEZ OFFERED DEAL

<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ It's now up to Ramon Martinez if he wants to
remain with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone said Tuesday the club offered the
right-handed pitcher, who's rehabilitating after surgery to repair
a rotator cuff tear, an incentive-laden guaranteed contract to
remain with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep him. He's a Dodger,'' Malone said. ``Once he's
finished rehabilitating and is healthy, we think he can help us get
to where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he didn't give Martinez a deadline for accepting the
offer. Martinez, who's been with the organization since 1984, is
working out at the Dodgers complex in the Dominican Republic.
Martinez's agents, however, are angling for a bigger contract and
he's not expected to sign with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a low guarantee because I'm not going to pay a guy that
can't perform,'' Malone said. ``We'll pay you to rehabilitate you.
We'll take some of the risks, but we want to share the risk, as far
as financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that Ramon recognizes his past history with the
medical staff here and the training staff, and he'll recognize how
important it is to continue to be in a relationship with these
people because they can help you. Hopefully, he'll make his
decision off that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Camp in full bloom: The big names _ Eric Karros, Gary
Sheffield, Raul Mondesi and Mark Grudzielanek _ showed up in
Tuesday in anticipation of today's first full workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always exciting coming in that first day, a bunch of
hugs, and how-you-doings,'' Sheffield said. ``Any time you have a
team that has a chance to win, you can't wait to get into spring
training.''
</P>
<P>
   And get a chance to experience Camp Davey.
</P>
<P>
   __ Starters' starts set: Kevin Brown will make his first
appearance of the spring when the Dodgers host the Mets on March 7
in the team's third spring game, Johnson said. Brown and Chan Ho
Park are each scheduled to throw two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said right-hander Ismael Valdes
will start the Grapefruit League opener March 6 against St. Louis.
Dave Mlicki is also expected to pitch in that game. Carlos Perez,
the lone lefty in the rotation, and Darren Dreifort will work March
6 against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said starters will pitch two innings, rest for three
days, pitch again, and then have four days off. He expects them to
work their way up to 90 pitches by their last spring-training
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   __ Slim and trim: Malone and Johnson said players reported in
good shape _ and that includes Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi weighed in at 235 pounds, 15 pounds more than his usual
playing weight, and looking much more fit than recent reports
portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll lose like five, six more pounds,'' Mondesi said. ``I'm
going to be bigger this year but stronger. Not fat. I'm ready to
go. I feel fine, rested.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Galvez surgery: Right-handed minor-league pitcher Randy
Galvez will undergo surgery on a date to be determined after an MRI
revealed a tear in his ulnar collateral ligament. The 20-year-old
was 13-4 with a 3.60 ERA while on loan to the Mexico City Red
Devils of the Mexican League last season.

U.S. AND CHINA TRYING FOR TRADE BREAKTHROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The United States and China have resumed intense
negotiations over Beijing's desire to join the World Trade
Organization, hoping against the odds to be able to announce a
breakthrough when Prime Minister Zhu Rongji visits Washington in
April, American officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after repeatedly fruitless talks, American trade
officials seemed to have given up on China's entering the
organization, which sets global trading rules, any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   In sharply critical terms, the Americans said China was too
consumed by domestic economic ills to make required concessions
like reducing tariffs and opening more areas of its economy to
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles remain enormous, but the two governments are
making a crash effort to resolve issues that have defied agreement
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has a great interest in China acceding to
the WTO on commercially viable terms,'' said Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, speaking to reporters here on Tuesday
evening after meeting with Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   He said Zhu had reaffirmed China's strong desire to reach an
accommodation. ``We both agreed that this was a crucial window of
opportunity,'' Summers said, his hopeful tone in striking contrast
to that of American officials in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, who is briefly visiting Beijing on a trip through Asia,
did not engage in negotiations. But a senior official of the U.S.
trade representative's office is taking part in detailed talks
here.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, right after a visit by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who will discuss a range of issues with the Chinese, the
chief trade negotiator, Charlene Barshefsky, will arrive for two
days of talks. After Ms. Barshefsky's visit, officials said, it
will be easier to judge whether the new push has any chance of
success.
</P>
<P>
   China wants the international prestige that comes from joining
the trade organization, and also would get a measure of protection
against trade barriers to its exports. Washington wants an
agreement that will lower China's tariffs and commit it to a
legally enforceable schedule for opening its markets.
</P>
<P>
   While Chinese membership requires broad agreement within the
trade organization, it is widely assumed that once the United
States is satisfied, other major countries will go along.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear how wide differences can be bridged over such
complex issues as access to the Chinese market for agricultural and
industrial goods and for high-end services like insurance and
finance.
</P>
<P>
   While committed to the gradual opening of its economy, China is
more worried than ever about rising unemployment and is struggling
to revamp state industries that could be killed by quickly lowered
trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Clinton administration would come under strong
attack from business and political opponents if it appeared to
grant too many concessions to China, which by American estimates
last year ran a $57 billion trade surplus with the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials have hinted that a compromise may involve stretching
out the time in which China would have to make major policy
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's by no means clear that a mutually satisfactory agreement
can be reached,'' Summers said. ``But there is a feeling on both
sides that we shouldn't miss an agreement because of a failure of
communications or a lack of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the new sense of urgency, he said, is the
realization that if agreement cannot be reached in the next few
months, China's entry to the trade group is likely to face long
delays. Later this year, the organization will begin to rewrite its
rules. The changes are likely to stiffen the conditions for entry
and complicate a new application by a giant like China.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton's advisers say they have doubts
about Zhu's ability to offer the kind of market-opening concessions
that are required for a deal, and they question whether Congress,
which could try to block an agreement, would go along. ``The
atmosphere right now _ with the satellite controversy, the human
rights issues, the military questions _ would make passage very
difficult,'' one Clinton aide said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as the American presidential races heat up next year, it
may be impossible to muster domestic support for any complex
agreement with China, officials fear.
</P>
<P>
   Both governments are searching for ways to bolster their
relationship, which has badly frayed since the euphoria of
Clinton's visit last spring, as Beijing cracked down harshly on
political dissidents and the American trade deficit with China
widened.
</P>
<P>
   American and Chinese officials hope relations will be
strengthened by the visit to Washington and other American cities
by Zhu, who cuts an appealing figure abroad. But apart from
possible trade organization membership, there do not appear to be
other opportunities for major agreements to announce.
</P>
<P>
   While a finished deal by April on trade appears impossible,
``the goal is to get the big issues in place by the time of Prime
Minister Zhu's visit,'' said Kenneth Lieberthal, the senior White
House adviser on Asia, who accompanied Summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. business community has to see any agreement as
commercially viable,'' Lieberthal added. ``Without that support it
will never work.''

Choucroute garnie, a rustic dish with city ways, at Les Halles.
Choucroute is just French for sauerkraut, or fermented cabbage, but
what makes it so irresistible is the garnish: a variety of
unabashedly heavy meats - some smoked or salted, some not, all
usually pork. The seasonings are often little more than juniper
berries and onion with a little goose or duck fat or lard. (David

ERITREAN-RESTAURANT-2, 2-23 -- Ficre Ghebreyesus, the chef at Cafe
Adulis in New Haven, reinterprets the cuisine of Eritrea. The
restaurant is the creation of three refugee brothers named
Ghebreyesus - Ficre, 36, Gideon, 38, and Sahle, 28 - who escaped
from the chaos in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, and came to New
Haven at the suggestion of their sister, who was in New York.

EXCERPTS FROM FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN'S TESTIMONY TO PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
 (With FED-GREENSPAN) 
(rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from testimony on Tuesday by Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, before the Senate
Budget Committee, and an exchange between Greenspan and Sen. Jim
Bunning, R-Ky., who is a committee member, in a question-and-answer
session after the testimony:
</P>
<P>
   In many respects the fundamental underpinnings of the recent
U.S. economic performance are strong. Flexible markets and the
shift to surplus on the books of the Federal Government are
facilitating the buildup in cutting-edge capital stock. That
buildup in turn is spawning rapid advances in productivity that are
helping to keep inflation well behaved. The new technologies and
the optimism of consumers and investors are supporting asset prices
and sustaining spending.
</P>
<P>
   But, after eight years of economic expansion, the economy
appears stretched in a number of dimensions, implying considerable
upside and downside risks to the economic outlook. The robust
increase of production has been using up our nation's spare labor
resources, suggesting that recent strong growth in spending cannot
continue without a pickup in inflation unless labor productivity
growth increases significantly further. Equity prices are high
enough to raise questions about whether shares are overvalued. The
debt of the household and business sectors has mounted, as has the
external debt of the country as a whole, reflecting the deepening
current account deficit. We remain vulnerable to rapidly changing
conditions overseas, which, as we saw last summer, can be
transmitted to U.S. markets quickly and traumatically. ...  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In light of all these risks, monetary policy must be ready to
move quickly in either direction should we perceive imbalances and
distortions developing that could undermine the economic expansion.
...
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee conducted monetary policy last
year with the aim of sustaining the remarkable combination of
economic expansion and low inflation. ...
</P>
<P>
   To cushion the domestic economy from the impact of the
increasing weakness in foreign economies and the less accommodative
conditions in U.S. financial markets, the F.O.M.C., beginning in
late September, undertook three policy easings. By mid-November,
the F.O.M.C. had reduced the Federal funds rate from 5{ percent to
4} percent. These actions were taken to rebalance the risks to the
outlook, and, in the event, the markets have recovered appreciably.
...
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve must continue to evaluate, among other
issues, whether the full extent of the policy easings undertaken
last fall to address the seizing-up of financial markets remains
appropriate as those disturbances abate. ...
</P>
<P>
   Most governors and Reserve Bank presidents foresee that economic
growth this year will slow to a 2{ to 3 percent rate. Such growth
would keep the unemployment rate about unchanged. The central
tendency of the governors' and presidents' predictions of C.P.I.
inflation is 2 to 2{ percent. This level represents a pickup from
last year, when energy prices were falling, but it is in the
vicinity of core C.P.I. inflation over the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   This outlook involves several risks. The continuing downside
risk posed by possible economic and financial instability around
the world was highlighted earlier this year by the events in
Brazil. ...
</P>
<P>
   Another downside risk is that growth in capital spending,
especially among manufacturers, could weaken appreciably if
pressures on domestic profit margins mount and capacity utilization
drops further. And it remains to be seen whether corporate earnings
will disappoint investors, even if the slowing of economic growth
is only moderate. ...

 UNDATED: only moderate.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A downward correction to stock prices, and an associated
increase in the cost of equity capital, could compound a slowdown
in the growth of capital spending. In addition, a stock market
decline would tend to restrain consumption spending through its
effect on household net worth.
</P>
<P>
   But on the upside, our economy has proven surprisingly robust in
recent years. More rapid increases in capital spending,
productivity, real wages and asset prices have combined to boost
economic growth far more and far longer than many of us would have
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   This ``virtuous cycle'' has been able to persist because the
behavior of inflation also has been surprisingly favorable,
remaining well contained at levels of utilization of labor that in
the past would have produced accelerating prices. That it has not
done so in recent years has been the result of a combination of
special one-time factors holding down prices and more lasting
changes in the processes determining inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the temporary factors, the sizable declines in the prices
of oil, other internationally traded commodities, and other imports
contributed directly to holding down inflation last year, and also
indirectly by reducing inflation expectations. But these prices are
not likely to fall further, and they could begin to rise as some
Asian economies revive and the effects of the net depreciation of
the dollar since midsummer are felt more strongly.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, recent experience does seem to
suggest that the economy has become less inflation prone than in
the past, so that the chances of an inflationary breakout arguably
are, at least for now, less than they would have been under similar
conditions in earlier cycles. ...
</P>
<P>
   MR. BUNNING: In December 1996 with the Dow average at 6,437 you
were worried about what you called ``the irrational exuberance of
the markets.'' With the Dow closing at 9,552, do you still have
those same fears?
</P>
<P>
   MR. GREENSPAN: If you go back to the text of that 1996 speech
... what I was trying to raise was that I was concerned that the
discussions with respect to the various elements of how one should
do monetary policy, whether we should begin to start to look at the
issue of not only the price of goods and services but also the
price of assets ... And the question I was asking abstractly was
how will we know when markets are gripped by ``irrational
exuberance.'' And I didn't have an answer at that particular point.
I think I have an answer now, in that it's very difficult to judge,
except in retrospect.
</P>
<P>
   If any stock market ... falls by 30 or 40 percent in a matter of
weeks or a very few months I will grant that there was a bubble
back there. The issue of trying to identify a bubble in advance
means you have to be confident enough to predict a decline of that
order of magnitude, and I don't know anyone who knows how to do
that. ...
</P>
<P>
   Clearly no one has questioned at all that the dramatic
acceleration we've seen in some technologies, and the marked
increase in productivity and profitability of American business,
has undoubtedly had a significant impact on underlying prices of
all capital assets, including equities. Whether or not it's gripped
by irrational exuberance is an issue that you won't really know for
sure, except after the fact. But as I indicate in my prepared
remarks, that I suspect that these markets are highly valued,
leaves me without terribly much doubt at this point. &QL;

 CPA Tips On Filing Tax Returns  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  As the date to file tax returns rapidly approaches, what
tips are CPAs offering their clients this year?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  The California Society of Certified Public Accountants
and CPAs Sharon Kreider of Sunnyvale, Craig Malmgren of the Oakland
firm Lautze &AMP; Lautze and Sandy Murray of San Francisco's Burr
Pilger &AMP; Mayer pinpoint important changes in the tax code and
issues to consider:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Schedule C Under Scrutiny: &LR;  Suspicious that many home-based
business owners are merely hobbyists who submit a Schedule C to
deduct hobby-related expenses, the Internal Revenue Service is
becoming more scrupulous and sophisticated in examining these
home-based business filings.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is looking for signs of abuse. For example, a
business that reports losses of less than $10,000 three years in a
row raises a red flag. CPAs caution home-based business owners to
keep careful records, such as maintaining separate bank accounts,
to prove that their expenses are legitimate and relate to a serious
profit-seeking venture.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Home Office Deductions:  &LR; Many more people will qualify for
home-office deductions. For your 1998 tax returns, you generally
can deduct expenses related to a home office if it is used
exclusively on a regular basis as your principal place of business
or the place you meet patients, clients or customers. In 1999, the
definition will be eased to include a place of business used by the
taxpayer for the administrative or management activities of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   But consider this: If you claim a home office deduction and
subsequently decide to sell your home, you run the risk of reducing
your $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion by the pro-rata portion
of your home dedicated to your home office. If you expect a big
profit from the sale of your house and plan to sell soon, you might
run through the numbers before electing to take a home office
deduction.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Health Insurance Benefit: &LR;  Self-employed individuals can deduct
45 percent of their health insurance premiums for 1998 (compared to
25 percent a year ago), even if they don't claim an itemized
deduction for medical expenses. &UR;  &LR; This deduction, on Page 1 of of
the self-employed taxpayer's Form 1040, will rise to 60 percent of
health insurance premiums in 1999. and by 2003 it will gradually
increase to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deduction is limited to earned income derived by the
business. You can also deduct one-half of your self-employment tax.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Business Expense Deductions:  &LR; Equipment purchased for use in
your business is generally depreciated over its useful life.
However, for 1998, $18,500 of new equipment can be expensed
immediately, instead of being depreciated over a number of years.
This accelerated depreciation will gradually rise to $25,000 by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GROW24 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But take note: The 1998 limit for California state tax returns is
only $16,000. For 1999 taxes, the California limit will rise to
$19,000, the same level for deductions on federal tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Business meals and entertainment are still deductible up to 50
percent but complete documentation is required to withstand IRS
scrutiny. That means recording not only time, date and place but
also the business purpose and the specific business that was
discussed over the meal. Club dues are no longer tax deductible,
but dues paid to professional and public service organizations
generally are deductible.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dialing for Deductions:  &LR; Cellular phones are considered
personal property. Therefore, cell phone calls are assumed to be
personal, unless you can prove otherwise. Your monthly billing
records are the key.
</P>
<P>
   However, you might have a problem getting an itemized list of
calls if your cellular service contract includes hundreds of free
minutes of usage each month. That makes it nearly impossible to
track _ and, if necessary, to prove _ that your calls were
business-related.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Road Wage: &LR;  The standard mileage rate deduction is changing and
for once is going down, not up. The rate will go from 32.5 cents
per mile in 1998 to 31 cents per mile in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, it gets worse! The rate change doesn't go into effect
until April 1. That's going to create record-keeping headaches for
small-business owners (and tax preparers), who next year will have
to calculate the mileage deduction based on miles accrued before
and after April 1. However, there is good news for those who lease
their cars. Starting in 1998, miles driven in a leased car are
deductible.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gifts to Clients:  &LR; Gifts to clients (but not their spouses or
kids) are deductible as a business expense but there's a catch.
Your deduction is limited to $25 per client per year. If you sent
expensive flowers or gift baskets, remember less costly gifts may
be more appropriate. At least from a tax standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Taxing Day Traders:  &LR; The growth of online trading has given
rise to the ``day-trading'' phenomenon, where individual investors
buy and rapidly sell the same stock, usually within 24 hours. Day
traders say they are in it for short-term profit rather than
appreciation. In other words, they consider themselves traders as
opposed to investors.
</P>
<P>
   But they may have a hard time convincing the IRS this activity
is a business pursuit. The IRS would prefer to treat day trading as
an investment activity, which puts considerably greater
restrictions on what you can deduct.
</P>
<P>
   A business can deduct interest and other expenses like research
and computer services and supplies. By contrast, an investor can
only offset interest expenses against interest income. And other
expenses must be itemized and cannot be deducted unless they are in
excess of 2 percent of the individual's adjusted gross income.

 Citigroup Shuffle May Weaken Antitrust Case Against Visa  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Citigroup's apparent move to jilt Visa in favor of MasterCard may
have pulled the rug out from under the federal government's
far-reaching credit card antitrust case, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, in a case that could reshape the credit card
industry, the Justice Department's antitrust division filed a
lawsuit challenging what it characterizes as a sweetheart
relationship between Visa and MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   The two credit card networks are run by the same group of big
banks, the lawsuit claims. Visa and MasterCard don't really compete
with each other, but split up the market between themselves and
keep out rivals such as American Express, the Justice Department
maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Now Citigroup's apparent decision to shift most of its business
from Visa to MasterCard highlights a competitive rivalry between
the two networks, antitrust specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It runs counter to the idea that the two associations move in
lockstep,'' said William Kovacic, a visiting law professor at
George Washington University in Washington. ``It tends to undercut
the government's concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the No.2 issuer of Visa cards, had been locked in a
dispute with Visa over the association's heavy promotion of the
Visa brand name. Visa's marketing took attention away from
Citigroup's efforts to build its own identity, the bank maintained.
</P>
<P>
   According to Visa officials, the association offered to put the
Visa name on the back of credit cards, leaving the front
exclusively for Citigroup. But, association officials have said,
the bank wanted Visa to sharply cut back its brand-building
activities, such as its well-known ``Everywhere you want to be'' TV
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, two Citigroup directors quit Visa's board
following the breakdown of talks on the branding issue. Visa
officials said they believed that Citigroup had cut a deal with
MasterCard, in which the association would avoid promoting its own
name and focus instead on processing transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reinforces what we have said all along, that this is an
intensely competitive'' marketplace, Visa spokesman Kelly Presta
said.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup and MasterCard both declined comment on their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   If Citigroup has indeed abandoned Visa for MasterCard, that
would address one of the most important issues raised by the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, filed in a New York federal court, the Justice
Department sought an order barring banks that sit on the board of
one association from also governing the other association. By
apparently casting its lot with MasterCard, Citigroup may have done
exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of alignment is what we've been looking for, but
this is just one bank,'' said Justice spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is whether other big issuers will follow
Citigroup's example, leading to a wholesale shifting of alliances.
Other major credit card issuers, such as BankAmerica and Chase
Manhattan, worry about brand competition from Visa, though there is
no evidence that they also will shift to MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a handful of others that are thinking about these
issues, but I don't know if any of them are as aggressive'' as
Citigroup, said Anita Boomstein, a New York attorney specializing
in credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Unless other major credit card issuers also break with Visa,
``it's not likely to cause the government to go away,'' said Joe
Sims, an antitrust attorney with the Washington firm Jones, Day,
Reavis &AMP; Pogue.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VISA24 (x1139 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The Citigroup-Visa quarrel has no direct bearing on the other
issue raised by Justice _ the associations' rules prohibiting
members from issuing cards other than Visa and MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, even if Justice loses in court, it might have won
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's move to MasterCard highlights how market forces are
making the two networks more distinct. That undermines Justice's
strategy of casting them as Tweedledum and Tweedledee but reshapes
the credit industry along the lines the department wants.
</P>
<P>
   Visa's marketing juggernaut has overwhelmed MasterCard, which
has about one-quarter of the credit card market compared with
Visa's share of more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, MasterCard may be willing to agree to
Citigroup's demand to give up a strong brand strategy, positioning
itself instead as an efficient transaction processor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds a lot like network competition to me,'' Sims said.
``The government shouldn't care too much how they get to their
objective.''

 Record Settlement in Farmworkers' Suit  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Salinas lettuce grower has agreed to pay former employees more
than $1.85 million in the biggest settlement of a sexual harassment
case filed on behalf of farmworkers by the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Tanimura &AMP; Antle, the nation's largest lettuce grower, said
yesterday the payment will go to former employee Blanca Alfaro and
other workers who say they faced sexual harassment or retaliation
for complaining about harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The payment is part of a settlement between Tanimura and the
EEOC, which was representing the workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers in the agricultural industry must realize that
sexual harassment and retaliation will not be tolerated,'' said
Susan McDuffie, district director of the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   Tanimura _ which employs &UR;  &LR; more than 2,200 people each year in
fields and packing plants in Salinas, Oxnard and Arizona _ did not
admit any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But it agreed not to rehire two of the former managers named in
Alfaro's claim and said a third manager had been reprimanded and
sent to sexual harassment counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the $1.8 million payment, the company agreed to
provide sexual harassment training in Spanish and English to all
its workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were never able to substantiate the allegations made
by the EEOC, we feel it is in the best interest of our current and
former employees to resolve this matter by establishing a claim
fund for individuals who may have suffered from sexual harassment
under our employ,'' said Tanimura President Rick Antle.
</P>
<P>
   Farmworker advocates have long complained about sexual
exploitation of women workers by foremen, who have broad power to
hire and fire individual laborers each season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get or keep jobs, it's not uncommon to hear stories of
women having to `put out,''' said Marc Grossman, a spokesman for
the United Farm Workers, which was not involved in the Tanimura
settlement. ``The problem is the corrupt system where workers have
to go hat-in-hand to the foreman for work every season, with no job
security and no seniority.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Tanimura case, Alfaro said the plant manager demanded
sexual favors from her as a condition of employment. She said a
foreman also made verbal advances toward her. When Alfaro
complained, the company retaliated by suspending and then firing
her, according to the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of EEOC24 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Elias Aragon, a male Tanimura employee who complained about
Alfaro's treatment, also was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Alfaro and Aragon were the only employees named in the EEOC
complaint. But agency officials said they expect ``a handful'' of
others to come forward during the next few months and share in the
award.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to identify a handful of other women who were
subjected to harassment by the same men we identified in Alfaro's
case,'' said Sanya Hill, a senior trial attorney with the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   EEOC officials said the Tanimura case is part of a recent
campaign to address the problem of sexual harassment in
agriculture. Last fall, the agency filed a harassment suit against
a Monterey County broccoli grower called Fresh West Harvesting _ a
case that has not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tanimura case, the grower reached a voluntary settlement
with the EEOC before a formal lawsuit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said the high price tag of the settlement would
serve as a warning to other growers throughout California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call to agricultural employers who are not
already doing things to prevent sexual harassment,'' said Larry
Shapiro, editor of the California Employer Advisor newsletter in
Tiburon.
</P>
<P>
   Before yesterday's settlement, Tanimura had provided sexual
harassment training to its managers. Now, it will provide annual
training to rank-and-file workers, too, at all three of its
locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really puts the agricultural community on notice that
they need to go beyond having a harassment policy and must really
talk to their employees and show them how to use the complaint
process,'' said Carmen Ponce, human resources director at Tanimura.
</P>
<P>
   Tanimura's main crop is lettuce, but it also grows broccoli,
cauliflower and celery.

 BofA Will Close Retail Broker Site in Oakland  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
BankAmerica will close its Oakland retail brokerage call center
later this year, eliminating about 100 jobs, a bank spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown will come as BankAmerica of North Carolina merges
the operations of the old BofA of San Francisco and the former
NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   In a phaseout expected to be completed by September, the bank
will transfer the work of the Oakland call center to facilities in
Seattle and Charlotte, N.C. Staff at the center, located at 180
Grand Ave. near Lake Merritt, handle investors' questions about the
bank's brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take some time for this to be implemented,'' said BofA
spokeswoman Ann Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The latest cutback is separate from the bank's announcement in
December that it would eliminate 300 back-office jobs nationwide at
the brokerage unit. Before NationsBank bought BofA, the brokerage
units of the two banks together employed more than 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The bank will offer some Oakland employees jobs in Seattle and
Charlotte, Anderson said. Those who don't want to move will get an
inside track for other bank-job openings or be eligible for
severance packages that include three weeks pay for every year at
BofA.
</P>
<P>
   BofA plans to move other employees into the office space vacated
by the call center, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   BofA has said it expects to shed about 23,000 jobs over the next
few years, more than 10 percent of its workforce. Some of the
cutbacks will come from combining BofA and NationsBank operations,
while others will reflect the bank's drive to become leaner and
more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   While the bank said most job cuts will occur through normal
turnover, it still expects to lay off 5,000 to 8,000 employees as a
result of last year's takeover.
</P>
<P>
   In one Northern California example, BofA has cut almost 200
management jobs in its retail branches since the NationsBank
takeover. Those cuts weren't related to the takeover, but reflected
the bank's move to a ``revised staffing model,'' a spokesman said.

 How to Know When Someone You Love Is a Tech-Stock Junkie  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Do you crave Yahoo shares every time the search-engine concern
splits its stock?
</P>
<P>
   Or do you own shares in companies that display hip billboards
off Highway 101, but you have no earthly idea what they make or do?
</P>
<P>
   Then perhaps you have a problem. You might be a tech-stock
junkie. That's what concerns financial adviser William Urban of
Bingham, Osborn &AMP; Scarborough. Urban says too many investors in the
Bay Area have felt the exhilarating high of soaring technology
shares, prompting them to develop a dependency that could be
detrimental to their financial health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that we've seen a number of our clients,
particularly in Silicon Valley, who have a lot of overconfidence in
their expectations of technology stocks,'' says Urban, who heads
the San Francisco firm's Menlo Park office.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock market rises 1.5
percent while both the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&AMP;P 500
tumbles, like they did yesterday, it is easy to understand why
technology stocks are so compelling. The Nasdaq is up 7.8 percent
for the year, compared with 4.2 percent for the Dow and 3.8 percent
for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when individual investors, who essentially are saving for
retirement, have as much as 20 to 25 percent of their total assets
invested in technology stocks, ``the alarms start to go off for
us,'' Urban says.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, investors own way too many shares of their own
employer's stock or too many shares of a tech company of which they
are familiar but don't fundamentally understand.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Urban says, that the volatility of technology
stocks can wreak havoc on a personal portfolio, causing overall
long-term investment performance to suffer. Hot tech stocks, such
as Internet concerns or newly minted software IPOs, can become huge
winners. But they just as often can be horrible clunkers that
investors tend to block out of their minds.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET24 (99185 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Part of the problem is selective memory,'' Urban notes.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Urban's firm preaches a textbook approach to
managing personal portfolios, asking its clients to allocate their
investments over a broad range of stocks, bonds and cash. Thus, too
much of anything _ whether General Motors shares or municipal bonds
_ isn't considered wise either, Urban says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's OK to invest in technology equities once the rest
of your portfolio is in balance. The tech sector often seems to
rise and fall regardless of how the broader market performs. Thus,
the right dose of technology investments is an important
diversification tool, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Urban recommends that investors allocate 5 to 10 percent of
their stock holdings (not total assets!) in technology funds with
historically low expense ratios. Or if investors insist on owning
individual stocks instead of funds, then it's important that those
holdings still remain within the allotment allowed for tech stocks,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for most tech junkies, they own too many shares
in too few companies, and that's where they get burned, Urban says.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list of telltale signs. You know that you, or somebody
you love, have a tech-stock dependency problem when the investor:
</P>
<P>
   _is positive that he knows what will be the next big tech-stock
``winner'' (i.e. the next Micrsoft, Intel etc.).
</P>
<P>
   _is confident that he can beat the average investor who plays
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   _is using college funds and retirement savings to buy techs.
</P>
<P>
   _has invested more than a quarter of his portfolio in tech
stocks or funds.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you happen to know anyone who fits the above profile,
direct them to a boring index fund as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RIGHT! &LR; : Hedge fund manager James Cramer could be in for one of the
biggest trades of his career. Yesterday, Cramer's TheStreet.com
filed to go public with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
filing says that the financial Web site hopes to raise as much as
$75 million by selling 7.5 million shares in an offering
lead-managed by Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   You knew it was bound to happen sooner or later, especially
after the monumental success of the MarketWatch.com public offering
last month. And if that IPO is any indicator, TheStreet.com (which
of course employs the previous occupant of this space, Herb
Greenberg), is poised to perform handsomely. If TheStreet.com's
shares happen to fetch a post-IPO price price similar to that of
MarketWatch's current $65 a share, Cramer's 2.7 million shares
could be worth a cool $175.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELECTRIC SWITCH: &LR;  It's often noteworthy when a large
corporation dumps its accounting firm for another auditor. So

COMMENTARY: STREETCAR NAMED BETRAYAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Linda Tripp and Christopher Hitchens may be the most
famous canaries of the Starr war, but Elia Kazan was the most
famous canary of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   High in the Hollywood Hills, Bernard Gordon, a writer who was
blacklisted, is working to make sure that on Oscar night Kazan does
not escape his past. Gordon, now 79, is naming names. The name he
gives the dazzling director _ who will be awarded an honorary Oscar
by the Motion Picture Academy _ is ``Rat Fink.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon formed the Committee Against Silence and will picket the
Chandler Pavilion on Oscar night, wearing a tuxedo that he had made
for himself in Spain, where he had a successful career in movies
after his exile from Hollywood. Blacklist black tie.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the audience to fight silence with silence, and refuse
to acknowledge Kazan's award. ``It would be too much to boo or walk
out,'' he says. ``I got the idea of not applauding when I watched
President Clinton's State of the Union and the Republicans sat on
their hands. I think the same thing of Bob Barr and Elia Kazan. One
is not a good director and one is a good director. But they're the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon does not want to debate whether artists who commit
egregious acts in their personal lives can still be considered
great artists. He knows they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are giving Kazan a lifetime achievement award,'' he
says, ``and the major achievement of his lifetime was to contribute
to one of the worst civil liberties violations in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon says he does not particularly like President Clinton, who
also gets lavished with high job-approval ratings despite egregious
personal acts. But he thinks the Republicans and Kenneth Starr have
engaged in sexual McCarthyism and flirted with a police state.
</P>
<P>
   With many of his blacklist colleagues aging or gone, he has
attracted more media attention than liberal outrage. Kirk Douglas,
who bravely fought the blacklist by insisting on a writer's credit
for Dalton Trumbo on ``Spartacus,'' told Variety's Army Archerd,
``There is no doubt that one of the most shameful eras of this
millennium was the McCarthy blacklist.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Hollywood giants have stayed quiet and even privately
mused that Kazan's award is an appropriate bookend to the lifetime
achievement Oscar that Charlie Chaplin was given in 1972 _ an award
that was vigorously protested by Hollywood conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The political prism has shifted in the time since Elia Kazan
testified. The idealism that once enveloped the Old Left began
dissipating decades ago. History has a way of getting at the truth,
and it has brought out the terrible stench of Stalinism.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's hard to find serious people who will argue the
innocence of Alger Hiss or the Rosenbergs. Many find Kazan
offensive now not for his dim view of Communists, but for the
scuzzy way he expressed it.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton impeachment fiasco also began and ended in betrayal.
It started with Linda Tripp's treacherous taping and culminated
with Christopher Snitchens. But these impeachment betrayals lack
the grandeur of the Kazan betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp is no Whittaker Chambers, and Sidney Blumenthal is
no Alger Hiss. And the turpitude represented by President Clinton
is not exactly world-historical. It's nice to live in secure times,
when one doesn't have to awake in the morning to questions of life
and death.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it isn't easy to be satisfied with the smallness of our
experience. We have developed a bad case of magnitude envy. In a
culture obsessed with entertainment, celebrity, buzz, spin, market
share, synergy, gestures, decaf skim lattes and cigar bars, we feel
diminished and puny. We have developed a craving for real nobility,
large principles, passions with scale and profound commitments.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, audiences are still kindling to the 50-year-old
``Death of a Salesman,'' drawn to its outsize emotions. In movies,
Omaha Beach and grand Elizabethan epics rule. On television, the
'60s mini-series became a nostalgia ratings bonanza by recalling
struggles over civil rights and the Vietnam War, fights that seem a
lot more compelling than an impeachment imbroglio that turned on
who touched whom where.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else, treachery ain't what it used to be.

TEXAS LAWMAKERS RENEW CALL FOR PASSAGE OF HATE CRIMES BILL 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Moments after a white supremacist was convicted
Tuesday for the violent murder of a black man, state lawmakers said
they hoped the verdict would bolster their efforts to pass a new
hate crimes bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, who wrote the current hate
crimes bill, said the verdict does little to change her opinion
that such a law is needed in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   John William ``Bill'' King was convicted in less than 2 1/2
hours for the murder of James Byrd Jr., 49.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, was the first of three white men to be tried for
Byrd's dragging death last summer in Jasper, a death the hate crime
bill's sponsors say was racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill is needed to deter other persons from taking
advantage of others because of hatred they feel,'' Thompson said.
``In Texas, hate crimes are just taken too lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, filed as Senate Bill 275 by Sen. Rodney Ellis,
D-Houston, and House Bill 148 by Thompson, is called the James Byrd
Jr. Act. Previous efforts to clarify the current hate crimes law,
in response to criticism that it's too vague to enforce, failed in
the 1995 and 1997 legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the bill will be heard by the Judicial
Affairs Committee March 11. The Senate version has been referred to
the Criminal Justice Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Royce West, a Dallas Democrat who co-authored the Senate
version, said he is elated by the guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this lets us all know that we need to do something to
make sure this doesn't happen again, to do whatever we can to make
sure people who commit these types of crimes will receive severe
ramifications,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' current law, passed in 1993 and also written by Ellis,
increased penalties by one level of offense if a crime was proven
to be ``motivated by bias or prejudice.'' For example, a murder
would be prosecuted as a capital murder. But Ellis said it has been
used by few prosecutors because there is concern about a
constitutional challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill would change the definition of a hate crime so that
offenses motivated by race, color, disability, religion, national
origin, ancestry or sexual orientation could be prosecuted as hate
crimes. Ellis said the proposed wording has been upheld by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Forty states and the District of Columbia have enacted hate
crimes laws.
</P>
<P>
   Besides clarifying the definition of a hate crime, the bill
would provide aid to small counties prosecuting murders considered
to be hate crimes.

U.S. PRESSES ATTACK ON MICROSOFT'S CREDIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's lead lawyer accused a Microsoft
executive of making up evidence at the antitrust trial on Tuesday,
and, after presenting the witness with his own e-mail contradicting
his statements, forced him to correct his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom incident focused on a matter of timing: when the
executive, Daniel Rosen, had known that a software rival was making
an Internet browser to run on the Microsoft Windows 95 operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   On its own, it is not a central element in the government's case
against Microsoft Corp. But the episode is part of the government's
persistent effort to undermine the credibility of Microsoft
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, the credibility issue has become enough of a
problem that U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson joked that
Microsoft's lawyer was embarking on a ``heroic endeavor'' when he
began questioning Rosen on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second day that David Boies, the Justice Department's
lead trial lawyer, and Rosen had clashed concerning the software
giant's intentions and actions at a key meeting with a competitor
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The session is a key chapter in the government case against
Microsoft, and the court's determination of exactly what happened
at the meeting could affect the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that the session with executives of Netscape
Communications Corp. was a routine business meeting intended to
find ``common ground'' on which the two companies could cooperate
concerning Internet software. Rosen was the executive who led the
Microsoft team at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft threatened Netscape at
the meeting and made an illegal offer to divide up the Internet
browser market _ a deal that Netscape says it refused.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have made their arguments in court this week with
piles of e-mail and harsh words. When Rosen was dismissed by the
court at midday, it was clear that executives of Netscape and
Microsoft left the 1995 meeting with very different views of what
had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The real fireworks Tuesday came after Rosen said he did not
regard Netscape as a rival in June 1995 and that one of his goals
was to ``encourage them to write a good browser for Windows 95'' _
the Microsoft operating system introduced in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Far from encouraging Netscape, however, the government contends
that Microsoft tried to persuade Netscape to cede the Windows 95
browser market to Microsoft, even though Netscape had long planned
to produce a Windows 95 browser.
</P>
<P>
   Boies asked Rosen when he had first obtained an advance copy of
Netscape's browser for Windows 95. Rosen replied that it was not
until after the June 21 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Boies then presented an e-mail dated May 11, 1995, that Rosen
wrote to another Microsoft executive. It included the notation
``Can i borrow/copy the Netscape Win 95 new client they gave us?''
The ``client'' refers to the new Netscape browser.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosen replied that he never got the test version, which he
said did not work properly.
</P>
<P>
   Boies responded: ``You don't remember that, do you? You're just
making that up right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said, ``No, I remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sure it was May and not April?'' Boies asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen answered, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Boies introduced an e-mail from Rosen to another
Microsoft executive on April 27 that said: ``Do you remember who
took the Netscape win 95 browser they gave us during our last
meeting? I'd like to get a copy.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with his own e-mail, Rosen paused, then said, ``I
stand corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, on the courthouse steps, Boies said the testimony
raised questions about Rosen's credibility and memory. ``He was
saying that he was trying to encourage Netscape to produce a
browser at the June meeting,'' Boies said. ``In fact, Netscape had
already done it and he had it.''
</P>
<P>
   The government presented notes taken by Marc Andreessen, a
founder of Netscape, at the June 21 meeting, in which he wrote that
Microsoft's proposals added up to a ``threat that Microsoft will
own the Windows 95 client market and that Netscape should stay
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also introduced as evidence an e-mail written on
June 22, 1995, by David Kaiser, an executive at America Online, to
another executive of the online service, recounting a conversation
he had with Andreessen.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser wrote that Andreessen told him that at the meeting the
previous day, Microsoft offered Netscape a deal: Microsoft would
invest in Netscape, take a seat on the board, and Netscape would
agree not to compete with Microsoft head-on.
</P>
<P>
   If Netscape accepted, Kaiser wrote Andreessen had told him, it
would become ``Microsoft's special partner.'' If Netscape rejected
the deal, Kaiser said in the e-mail, ``Microsoft would crush
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft also introduced documents that supported its
version of the June 21 meeting. An e-mail written on June 22 by
Richard Wolf, a Microsoft executive who attended the meeting, said
he did ``not think that they have the intention of competing with
us in defining a platform,'' for underlying Internet software that
Microsoft planned to include in Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wolf added, that ``does not mean they will drop a
broad-based client,'' meaning a browser.
</P>
<P>
   After the testimony, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice
president for law and corporate affairs, said: ``The record is
quite clear. There was no effort by Microsoft to dissuade Netscape
from creating a browser for Windows 95. It did and its browser was
quite popular.''

CAMPAIGN BLAMING STARR RAISES MILLIONS FOR PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE
FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 10th graf, The trust's ..., with 2 grafs to add
background on why original defense fund was disbanded, Trie

By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's legal defense fund has raised
$4.6 million in the last year, buoyed by a direct-mail campaign
that blamed Kenneth Starr and the congressional impeachment process
for saddling the first family with ``a staggering personal debt''
of nearly $9 million, several supporters said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, the Clinton Legal Expense Trust, has raised $2.4
million since August from 35,000 donors, eclipsing the most
optimistic projections of the president's supporters and the $2.2
million raised in the trust's first six months of operation last
year, according to the supporters who were briefed on the progress.
</P>
<P>
   Small donations _ $10 here, $20 there _ have poured in, the
supporters said, but there have also been $10,000 checks from
corporate executives and Hollywood friends.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president's continued strong showing in public opinion
polls, the trust's windfall is a measure of Clinton's enduring
popularity despite being the first elected president to be
impeached. Several supporters said the trust's success also
reflected the opinion among Clinton's supporters that the inquiry
by Starr, the independent counsel, and the impeachment proceedings
had been inherently unfair and deeply partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direct mail has been off the chart,'' said one supporter
who helped raise the money and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``The president has never been more popular. And there is a lot of
sympathy for him. We didn't have to ask most people twice for
help.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than half of the Clintons' debts erased in a single
year, supporters said Tuesday that there is a strong chance that
the entire legal bill could be paid by the time the president
leaves office in 23 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``No president, especially a president who has worked as hard
for the American people, should be burdened with this kind of debt
when he leaves office,'' said Terence McAuliffe, one of Clinton's
closest friends, who raised much of the money for the trust.
McAuliffe declined to discuss how much money the trust had raised.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers of the president have said that Clinton's total
legal bills in his two terms could exceed $10 million by 2001.
Erasing those bills is a major concern of the first lady, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who has told her advisers that the debt is a factor
as she decides whether to seek New York state's Senate seat in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first president to accept donations while in
office to help pay his lawyers' fees. Former President Richard
Nixon accepted donations to help defray legal bills after he
resigned from office, but he paid most of his legal bills himself.
</P>
<P>
   The trust's $4.6 million total far outpaces the $1.3 million
that was raised over a three-and-a-half-year period by the
president's original legal defense fund, which was disbanded in
December 1997, tainted by the campaign finance inquiry and hobbled
by a strict $1,000-a-year limit for individual donors. It had
received $639,000, later returned, in questionable donations by Yah
Lin Trie, who is awaiting trial on charges that he made unlawful
contributions. Trie, a longtime Clinton friend who is known as
Charlie, has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The current fund has a limit of $10,000 a year. &UR;  &LR;  Organizers and
trustees of the new trust, which is headed by former Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., plan to release the fund's total contributions, and
a complete list of donors, at a news conference here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters said that many of the 55,000 contributors wrote
checks for modest amounts, like $10 and $20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trust is not being funded by fat cats,'' McAuliffe said.
``These people are committed in insuring that this president, who
has worked so hard on their behalf, does not leave office
bankrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   But the supporters also said that they had received $10,000
checks from scores of corporate executives who are contributors to
the Democratic National Committee, including S. Daniel Abraham,
chairman of the Slim-Fast Foods Co. of West Palm Beach, Fla.;
Ronald Burkle, the California supermarket mogul; Alan J. Patricof,
the New York venture capitalist; and Dirk Ziff, co-chairman of Ziff
Brothers Investments of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the trust has received a windfall from the
president's Hollywood friends, including $10,000 checks from Steven
Spielberg, actor Tom Hanks, Barbra Streisand and Harvey Weinstein,
a film executive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Defending the president at the House impeachment hearings and at
trial in the Senate added at least $2 million to the Clintons'
legal bills, their supporters estimated Tuesday. The Clintons still
owe roughly $3 million to their lawyers, the supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also used the trust's proceeds to pay Robert S.
Bennett, who led his defense in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit. The suit was settled in November for $850,000, but that
sum was paid personally by the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the president's battery of lawyers have worked on
defending the Clintons in inquiries related to their Whitewater
real estate transactions and Democratic fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Several supporters said in interviews Tuesday that the fund's
success is owing mostly to the anger and frustration with the
House's impeachment of the president in December.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, the fund's executive director, Anthony F. Essaye,
asked potential contributors to write a check to the trust if they
were ``disturbed by the way politics is conducted today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's political climate, public service can exact a
disturbing price,'' Essaye wrote. ``There is, perhaps, no better
example than the situation facing president and Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Essaye declined to comment Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ In a last-minute turnaround, the ethnic
Albanian delegation at the Kosovo talks agreed in principle on
Tuesday to a peace settlement, turning what appeared to be an
almost certain collapse for the Clinton administration's peace
efforts into a limited success.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the deadline of 3 p.m. for the end of the talks
here, the ethnic Albanians presented Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and five other foreign ministers a declaration that
promised to sign the peace settlement after two weeks of
consultation with the population at home.
</P>
<P>
   The three-paragraph declaration was dragged out of the
delegation after the chief American negotiator, Ambassador
Christopher R. Hill, entreated the members to look into their
hearts. Their statement saved the two-and-a-half-week talks that
attempted to resolve the conflict in Kosovo with a proposal that
calls for NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials acknowledged that the
result was far from what they needed to pressure Slobodan Miloevic,
the Yugoslav president, who remains opposed to NATO peacekeepers in
Kosovo. The U.S. strategy was to get full agreement from the ethnic
Albanians so negotiators would have more leverage to squeeze
Milosevic, whose troops have viciously suppressed separatist rebels
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Without a final answer from the Albanians, it will be hard to
carry out the threat of NATO bombing, meant to force Milosevic's
hand. Now the process essentially goes on hold for two weeks, and
diplomats fear Milosevic will try to exploit this delay by making
inroads against the Kosovo Liberation Army on the ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The conference organizers said they would reconvene almost three
weeks from now, on March 15, in an unspecified place in France. By
then the ethnic Albanians will have completed their consultations
at home. The aim then will be conclude a quick settlement that
would give autonomy, but not independence, to Kosovo, guaranteed by
a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albright, who appeared relieved that her investment of three
days of coaxing and admonishing the ethnic Albanians had partially
paid off, emphasized that the ethnic Albanians ``have a
responsibility to make their `yes' an unequivocal `yes.''' She and
the foreign ministers of Britain, Russia, Germany, France and Italy
organized the conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-member Albanian delegation said that it would take the
proposed peace agreement back to Kosovo and explain its elements to
the roughly 1.8 million ethnic Albanians. Both the delegation and
the foreign negotiators said they believed that such discussions,
in political circles and among citizens, would result in a final
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   They said it would be a popular document because it gives
considerable autonomy to the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the population of Kosovo, a province within the Yugoslav
republic of Serbia. It would also enable them to get rid of almost
all the Serbian police and Yugoslav soldiers in Kosovo and would
bring in 28,000 NATO-led soldiers, including 4,000 Americans, to
keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian delegation, which the Americans had expected
to be the easier side to convince during the negotiations, balked
at the peace agreement until the last moment _ in large part
because of the objections of five members from the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the rebel group that has been fighting against the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   One delegate for the guerrillas, Hashim Thaci, was the last
objector. But he was finally brought around when Hill and then
another member of the delegation, Vetan Surroi, isolated him in
discussions on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block that Thaci had persistently raised _ the
separatist rebels' insistence on holding a referendum at the end of
a three-year interim period _ was addressed with a face-saving
reference to a referendum at the end of the declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration says that the delegation understands that at the
end of the interim period Kosovo ``will hold a referendum to
ascertain the will of the people.'' While exactly what this
referendum means was left unclear, negotiators said that it would
not be legally binding and that a vote for independence would not
force the Serbs to grant independence. But the reference to a
referendum appeared to be enough to satisfy the demands of Thaci
and others who see a vote as a crucial first step toward eventual
independence. The agreement right now offers Kosovo autonomy but
would keep it as a province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that in the next two weeks, when the ethnic
Albanians were back home selling the agreement, the threat of NATO
airstrikes against Milosevic would be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   But once a new round of negotiations convenes on March 15, they
said, the threat of airstrikes would renew the pressure on
Milosevic to agree to the use of NATO-led ground troops as
peacekeepers that he has so far vigorously resisted.
</P>
<P>
   The British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said at the joint
news conference of foreign ministers, that the secretary-general of
NATO, Javier Solana, was still empowered to order airstrikes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albright said the Serbian delegation, headed in the last days by
Milosevic's close ally, Milan Milutinovic, had given a qualified
yes to the political aspects of the peace agreement, including
autonomy for Kosovo. But, she said, they remained ``unengaged'' on
the administration's insistence that the peacekeeping force in
Kosovo be led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs said in a written declaration to the foreign ministers
that they would discuss the possibility of an ``international
presence'' in Kosovo. This proposal was an effort to accept less
than a NATO force, and Albright said she found it unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ethnic Albanian acceptance was only conditional and
the Serbs had barely come to the table, Clinton administration
officials said that the next two weeks in Kosovo could be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic could use his forces in Kosovo to try to create havoc
for the Kosovo Liberation Army on the ground, making the guerrillas
perhaps less eager to settle than their representatives in
Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said there had been a substantial buildup of
Serbian police forces and Yugoslav army troops inside Kosovo and on
the borders between Serbia and Kosovo in the last several weeks.
This could indicate that Milosevic was preparing for renewed
fighting, they said.
</P>
<P>
   To get the conditional acceptance, Albright offered some
incentives to the ethnic Albanian delegation, which were intended
to show that the United States is a friend of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Washington will open a visa office in Pristina, theKosovo
capital, she promised, so that ethnic Albanians will not have to
travel to Belgrade, the Serbian capital, to get consular services.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials of the Kosovo Liberation Army will be
brought to the United States for training in how they can transform
themselves from a guerrilla group into a police force or a
political entity, much like the African National Congress in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end it appears to have been Hill's 11th-hour appeal
combined with the leadership of Surroi, the publisher of the
biggest circulation newspaper in Kosovo, that turned the tables.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said that he tried to prepare the delegation on Monday
night for the consequences of failing to stop a war that has
squandered civilian lives in the last year and could get worse. He
said he asked the delegates to think about how they would think of
themselves as individuals a week from now if they rejected the
opportunity for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, as the foreign ministers were waiting for
the ethnic Albanians' final decision, Hill said he went into the
delegation room and sensed it was clear that a majority wanted to
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, he pointed to a delegate and asked, ``Do you want
to sign?'' The answer came back: ``Po,'' the Albanian word for yes.
Hill said he got a succession of ``Po's'' until he got to Surroi,
who stood up and started speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vetan said, `OK, we can get this worked out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Surroi proposed a text of what became the declaration. Hill
suggested that a translator sit at a computer in the room and type
the words on the screen. There were no objections in the room, and
with that, Hill said, the foreign ministers had what they needed.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi has worked during the talks as a bridge in the delegation
and had tried to bring the five guerrillas around.
</P>
<P>
   He said late on Tuesday afternoon: ``This was done by consensus.
We have everyone on board. What we have achieved here is Albanians
working together. The biggest argument we saw was that this is an
opportunity for peace.''

WIN OR GO HOME: GOLF'S ELITE 64 ARE READY FOR A SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Tiger Woods, David Duval and Mark O'Meara
spent Tuesday practicing together, preparing for a tournament that
all three would love to win.
</P>
<P>
   The highly anticipated Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship begins on Wednesday, bringing the world's best golfers
together in a single-elimination format that will be both
entertaining and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   There will be pressure from the opening tee shot. Half of the 64
players at La Costa Resort and Spa will be eliminated by Wednesday
night. Meanwhile, the road to Saturday's final four, followed by a
36-hole championship match on Sunday, will force the champion to
win six matches in five days against some of the world's best
players.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who takes the $1 million first-place check, the first
event in the new World Golf Championships series has already
accomplished one of its main objectives _ to bring the world's best
players together. Looking at the practice tee at La Costa on
Tuesday was like looking at the practice tee during a major, with
Woods, Duval, O'Meara, Davis Love III, Lee Westwood, Colin
Montgomerie, Ernie Els and Vijay Singh among the stars preparing
for the challenge. The atmosphere, and the names, confirmed that
something special was about to happen. And the fact that nobody
knew exactly what to expect only enhanced the anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about playing match play again, something I always
look forward to,'' said Woods, the No. 1-seeded player, who will
face Nick Faldo, the six-time major winner but seeded No. 64, in
perhaps the most anticipated opening-round pairing. ``I love the
thrill of playing one-on-one. It's a chance to put your skills up
against one person, head-to-head. Most sports, that's the way it
works. We don't get that chance very often.''
</P>
<P>
   But in match play, one bad day can mean the end of your
tournament. While Faldo has been struggling for more than a year,
he enters Wednesday's match as the underdog with little to lose. If
Woods jumps to an early lead, the match could be a rout. But if
Faldo stays close until the final few holes, almost anything might
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be some upsets,'' said O'Meara, who will
face Michael Bradley on Wednesday. ``But I don't know how you can
really call it an upset, because the guys in the top 64 are all
good players. Nick has been struggling, but Nick is a tremendous
competitor, and he has a tremendous record. I would think Tiger has
the advantage. But I would never count out Nick Faldo.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other compelling first-round matches include Tom
Watson versus Bob Tway, Els versus Paul Azinger, Steve Elkington
versus Steve Jones and Montgomerie versus Craig Stadler. In
addition, Greg Norman, who missed seven months following shoulder
surgery last year, will be making his first start of the year in
the United States when he faces John Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoulder is great; I practice every day,'' said Norman,
who has long been a proponent of having a world tour. ``I feel good
about this event, because I can see a lot of the ideas that I had
starting to take place. I think it's good for the game of golf.
There are enough great players now on a global basis that we need
to see them playing against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   While the year's two other world championship events _ the NEC
Invitational (Aug. 26-29) and the American Express Invitational
(Nov. 4-7) _ will also have world-class fields, they will be stroke
play events, not match play, making this week even more special. &QL;

AIR FORCE LAUNCHES 1ST TV RECRUITING CAMPAIGN TO MEET GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BARRETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ If Robert Kitto was selling Cadillacs, he'd be a rich
man.
</P>
<P>
   But Kitto is selling a four- to six-year commitment _ and he's
not making commission.
</P>
<P>
   The technical sergeant is one of the Phoenix area's top Air
Force recruiters. But, he said, ``I'm only one voice and I can only
talk so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kitto is exceeding his recruitment goals, many of the
1,000 Air Force recruiters nationwide are not. For the first time
in two decades, the Air Force is falling short of the number of
enlistees needed to fill its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Air Force has prided itself on needing little
advertisement to attract recruits. But faced with unprecedented job
growth in the private sector, that's about to change.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is launching its first television campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the first spot alone, which will air Feb. 27 during an NCAA
conference championship game, it is paying $17 million _ more than
double the Air Force marketing budget of just a few years ago.
Hoping to capitalize on the thousands of young basketball fans who
will tune in to the tourney, the Air Force has also signed up as a
sponsor for the NCAA Road to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to purchase more air time in major cities through
the summer, and beyond. Between future ads and the usual print and
radio ads and promotional brochures, the Air Force marketing blitz
could top $76 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, young men and women look toward television
now,'' said Major Derek Kaufman, U.S. Air Force recruiting
spokesman. ``This isn't going to turn around recruiting overnight
but we're hoping to reach out and show we are a viable option to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the hot economy or the end of the Cold War, budget
cuts or base closures. Whatever the reason, recruiters say more
young people than ever are opting for sizable salaries over
service.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with some of the worst recruiting shortages in two
decades, the U.S. Army has added an extra 1,000 recruiters, boosted
its ad budget to nearly $100 million and offered a few thousand
dollars in additional sign-up bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as of last fall, it is 2,300 short of recruiting
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy fell nearly 7,000 short of its recruiting goals last
year, said spokesman Lt. Blaine McLaughlin. It caught up this year,
after adding more recruiters and more sign-up stations and
increasing its ad budget by $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marine Corps is the only branch that has not only met,
but exceeded, its recruiting goals. It signed up 40,366 enlistees
last year, said Gunnery Sgt. Cynthia Atwood, public affairs chief
for the Marine Corps Recruiting Command. It spends a fraction of
what other branches do on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines advertising budget for fiscal year 1998 is about
$9.5 million, most on television spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is the only branch that has never paid for
television advertising, relying instead on public service ads,
films like ``Top Gun,'' and a reputation for highly regarded
technical training.
</P>
<P>
   This year it needs to recruit 33,800 to meet projections, but
since October the Air Force has fallen behind by more than 6
percent. ``We are seriously struggling,'' Kaufman added.
</P>
<P>
   Even with unprecedented signing bonuses of up to $9,000,
proposed pay raises, and an increase of more than $24,000 in
scholarship money available to those who join in college, the Air
Force has had trouble attracting recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an overheating economy and young people today have
options,'' said Chief Master Sgt. Benken, the highest-ranking
enlisted man in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   It's been tough for ROTC recruiters as well, even at
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University where many of the 1,500
students are there to learn to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Tri B. Trinh was hoping to recruit a class of 130 ROTC
students this year, but has barely reached half that goal. The Air
Force recently upped the commitment from eight to 10 years which
scared some potential recruits off.
</P>
<P>
   But Trinh said the Air Force last month announced it would
increase scholarship amounts from $9,000 to $15,000 per year plus
provide additional money for books and living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities are just tremendous right now but we're
competing against a booming economy,'' Trinh said. ``You're not
going to get rich in the military. People that join do so because
they want to serve their country.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough of a reason, the Air Force has introduced
unprecedented enlistment bonuses from $1,000 to $9,000 in more than
two-thirds of its specialties, from pararescuers to pharmacists.
Those who sign up for six instead of four years can earn even more.
</P>
<P>
   The incentives have helped increase the number of six-year
enlistees by 30 percent, but the overall number of recruits has
remained below projections. Enlistees dropped by about 20,000
between 1997 and last year. Air Force officer ranks have slimmed as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One problem may be that the Air Force has only 1,200 recruiter
positions, and some are unfilled. Kaufman said filling them has
only recently become a priority.
</P>
<P>
   When recruiter Tech. Sgt. Kitto came to the Phoenix area in late
1997, he was the first full-time recruiter at the
northwest-Phoenix-area office in more than a year. Area school
administrators told him no one from the Air Force had stepped foot
on their campuses for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Kitto has recruited more than 65 Air Force enlistees. But his
recruiting goals for this month have actually increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what recruiting was like before, but now you work
harder than ever, and longer hours, for what you get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kitto has recruited the boy bagging his groceries at the
check-out stand, and another man he met while waiting in line to
pay for dinner at a local Denny's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have your business cards on you,'' he said. ``We're
not afraid to recruit anywhere.'' &QL;

SULLIVAN NAMED FIRST WOMAN DEAN AT STANFORD LAW SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BILL STAGGS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kathleen M. Sullivan, a constitutional lawyer
nationally known for her scholarly sound bites as a frequent guest
on television public affairs and news programs, has been named the
first woman dean of the Stanford University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan _ one of the ``50 Most Influential Women Lawyers in
America,'' according to the National Law Journal last year _
assumes her new job in September. Her predecessor, Paul Brest, is
returning to teaching at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Casper, the university's president, announced the
appointment on Monday after a five-month search. The law school has
580 students and 40 faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as Paul Brest pushed the law school in new directions,''
Casper said, ``Kathleen will bring fresh perspective to legal
education, at Stanford and nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan, 43, began teaching law at age 29 at Harvard, where
she had earned her law degree in 1981. In 1993, she was appointed
the first Stanley Morrison Professor of Law at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   An active appellate litigator who has argued numerous First
Amendment cases in federal and state courts, and two in the Supreme
Court, Ms. Sullivan has often been mentioned by national legal and
news magazines as a potential Supreme Court nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt destined for a role in public service, and I
do have an interest in public service some day,'' said Ms. Sullivan
about her future.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sullivan, a Democrat, filed a friend-of-the-court brief in
the Paula Jones case, arguing that it would be unconstitutional to
sue President Clinton while in office. She filed the brief at the
invitation of professors who were addressing the constitutional
issues on behalf of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She has discussed the complexities of constitutional law on
programs ranging from ``Crossfire'' to ``Nightline'' to ``Lehrer
Newshour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think constitutional law, and public law generally, is
enjoying a surge of new and fresh interest,'' said Ms. Sullivan,
who is co-author of the most recent edition of ``Constitutional
Law,'' a legal textbook, and ``First Amendment Law,'' both written
with Gerhard Gunther, a professor emeritus of Stanford. She also
wrote ``New Federalist Papers: Essays in Defense of the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a silver lining in what some people have called
our recent constitutional crisis,'' she said, ``it's that it has
gotten students' attention about the importance of law.''

HELP STILL WANTED AT POINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a break in the schedule, USC coach Henry
Bibby spent the weekend in Louisiana, watching high school point
guard Derrick Zimmerman as the Trojans continue their search for a
quality point guard.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2 Zimmerman, who plays for Monroe Wossman High, is
also being recruited by Mississippi State, Clemson, Alabama and
Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a rather hot commodity right now,'' recruiting analyst
Bob Gibbons said. ``He's the type of kid that has played better
this season than last summer. He's a academic qualifier and can
really shoot the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every school wanting a point guard is looking at him. He's one
of the top ones still available.''
</P>
<P>
   USC has one scholarship left and would like to sign a point
guard. It continues to be interested in Compton College's James
Jones, who is also being recruited by Washington State and Oregon
State. USC is officially being considered by Long Beach City
College guard Schea Cotton, although Cotton has spurned the Trojans
twice before.
</P>
<P>
   __ Granville questionable: Point guard Brandon Granville
(bruised back) missed practice Monday, although he is expected to
play against Washington on Thursday. Bibby said Granville is
questionable for the game. The freshman injured his back after he
fell hard to the floor while driving to the basket against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure if he's going to play on Thursday,'' Bibby
said. ``If we had any games (last weekend), he wouldn't have
played.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No arena pitch yet: Although USC's board of trustees and
president Steven Sample have officially agreed to support the
construction of an on-campus arena, Bibby said it is too early to
use the proposed building as a recruiting incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't used that,'' Bibby said. ``I think in another year
you're able to use that. That's a starting point for everything and
this is a big plus for the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the arena project has some support from the
administration, the biggest obstacle will be obtaining financing.
USC is hoping to sell the naming rights to the arena, meaning it
will eventually have a company's name for its title a la the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   __ Winning season?: USC (12-11, 4-10) needs to sweep its home
games against the Washington schools to ensure a winning record,
but Bibby said the Trojans' record doesn't necessarily reflect what
he already considers a successful season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say we've had a winning season?'' Bibby said. ``I say
we've had a winning season. The kids have not quit. I'm pleased.
Success is not always wins and losses. The guys have done a good
job.''

AMWEST STOCK PLUNGES; EVENTUAL SALE NOT RULED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America West Airlines' stock sank Tuesday as investors hoping
for a big-dollar takeover bailed out after the company said it's
going to fly solo.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempe company's shares fell $3.25, to $18.13, a 15 percent
drop. It was one of the biggest losers on the New York Stock
Exchange, where more than 1 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   The decline puts the stock back in the range it was in before
takeover speculation began a month ago. It started after America
West announced that it had been approached by a number of airlines
interested in buying the company or creating a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Several major airlines were mentioned as possible suitors, but
United is the only one that confirmed its interest and, reportedly,
made a cash offer.
</P>
<P>
   America West Chairman William A. Franke said Monday that the
company has ended talks with other airlines because there were too
many conditions attached to the proposed deals and because there
were regulatory and employee issues to consider.
</P>
<P>
   In a message to employees late Monday, he said America West
hired an investment banking firm, three law firms and other
advisors to help it evaluate the merger proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied that the result that was reached is exactly the
right one for the airline under the circumstances we find ourselves
in,'' he said, calling the talks a ``difficult, time-consuming
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline has to entertain any future offers, of course, but
Franke said the plan is to remain independent and grow
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts and other industry observers say the bidding for
America West might not be over.
</P>
<P>
   The same factors that made it attractive to United and other
suitors _ such as strength in the West and a relatively young fleet
_ remain, as do industry forces such as a slowdown in traffic that
will stunt airlines' growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that a deal will eventually be struck; the
incentives for consolidation are higher and growing,'' Egan-Jones
Ratings Co., a debt rating service, said in a report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Schwieterman, a DePaul University economist and former
United Airlines analyst, also thinks America West will be an
eventual target.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the airline's small size _ $2 billion in annual sales
vs. $17 billion for industry leader United _ and the key markets it
serves, which attract vacationers rather than high-fare business
travelers.

<P>
   ``America West has a precarious market position and can't afford
to turn a blind eye toward a good offer that comes their way,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Hegeman, who runs the Internet site PlaneBusiness.com and
broke the story about the United and America West talks, was more
cynical about America West's announcement. She suggested that it
might be a ploy to get a better deal from United or another
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do not think that Bill Franke went out tonight and put
the `Do Not Disturb' sign on the door of AWA headquarters,'' she
wrote Monday in her daily column.
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of talks was announced, an America West
shareholder filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chauncery Court challenging
Continental Airlines' right of first refusal on any offer for the
controlling stake in America West held by a Texas investment group.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder Odette Muskin, whose holdings weren't disclosed,
argued that the stipulation favors Continental and the investment
group, TPG Partners, at the expense of ordinary shareholders in any
merger transaction. The defendants are America West, its senior
executives and board members and TPG. &QL;

 &HT;    Isakson to replace Gingrich in Georgia
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Johnny Isakson surged out of a six-candidate pack
Tuesday to win the race to replace Newt Gingrich in Washington
without a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly two-thirds of the vote counted, the longtime
Marietta legislator and real estate company president had taken 62
percent of the vote to claim the 6th District seat, vacated by
Gingrich last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are overwhelmed with the support Johnny has gotten
throughout the district. ... I think it will set a record in a
special election,'' said Isakson campaign manager Heath Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with nearly $1 million in campaign donations, a fund that
dwarfed his competitors, Isakson surfed on a small but steady
stream of voters in four north metro Atlanta counties.
</P>
<P>
   His nearest competitor, Christina Jeffrey, a 51-year-old
Kennesaw State University professor, was next with 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson could be sworn in by House Speaker Dennis Hastert as
early as Thursday. Chances are, he would move into the same offices
in the Rayburn Building in Washington that Gingrich held before he
was elected House speaker by his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing far behind Isakson and Jeffrey were: Barry Doublestein,
44, a GOP activist from Snellville; Gary Pelphrey, 63, a Marietta
attorney; Leigh Baier, 57, a Vinings attorney; and Marco Longo, a
27-year-old salesman from Duluth. Kelly Brown of Alpharetta was a
write-in candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half a million voters in four counties were eligible to
vote in the special, nonpartisan election to replace Gingrich, and
election officials said they were on target to reach a predicted 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Voting appeared heaviest in Cobb County, which contains nearly
half of the 6th District's registered voters _ and where Isakson
has appeared on the ballot at least 10 times before.
</P>
<P>
   This was Isakson's third try at high political office. He y
candidate who was able to mount a concerted television campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pocketbook issues were the focus of the campaign, which took
place in the 23rd-richest congressional district out of 435 in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson promised to vote for a 10 percent tax cut in Congress, a
position favored by the national GOP, while Jeffrey tried to use
Isakson's long legislative record against him.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson lost his last statewide election, a Republican primary
race for the U.S. Senate, to Guy Millner. Abortion was a defining
issue in that campaign _ Isakson is against a ban on all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But that issue was secondary in Tuesday's election, even though
some voters still stayed away from him because of his stand.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Long, a pre-kindergarten teacher, said she voted for
Jeffrey because of her strong position against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that she represented the conservative viewpoint like
Newt had done,'' said J.D. Grant, 33, a full-time student at
Kennesaw University who has taken classes under Jeffrey. ``Isakson
is a Democrat in Republican clothing.

ROBINSON SENDS QUIET MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Kings coach Larry Robinson kept the pucks in storage
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After a dismal 5-1 defeat in St. Louis on Monday, Robinson was
hoping to send a message with the puck-free practice, 40 minutes of
silent skating periodically punctuated by Robinson's shrill
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad when it comes to that at this point in the season,''
said Robinson, whose team plays the Detroit Red Wings, the two-time
defending Stanley Cup champs, tonight. ``You've got your regular
workers and then you've got your guys that push just hard enough
that they look like they're working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Insisting he wasn't referring specifically to any of his players
but to the NHL in general, he added, ``We have guys who got a
contract, were happy they got a contract and forgot what working
and playing hard is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   After praising the efforts of players such as winger Russ
Courtnall and defenseman Mattias Norstrom, Robinson said, ``You can
go on right down the line, and then you're going to get to the guys
that can make the difference, and you can pick them. I'm not going
to name names, but you can name the names, and you ask me, `Do they
come to play every night? Do they go hard every shift? Do they
practice hard every day?' I don't know if you can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson tried a puck-free practice previously, on Jan. 12
following a 4-0 loss in San Jose the night before. In the next
game, the Kings responded with a 3-0 victory over Calgary, but two
nights after that, they lost 5-1 to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's practice was interesting to watch, if not to
participate in, especially early, when Luc Robitaille ordered Rob
Blake off the ice. Robitaille said Blake has been playing for
several weeks with a sore groin and he was afraid the Kings' most
important player would aggravate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want is for him to get hurt,'' Robitaille
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said, ``I guess I should give my (coach's) sweatshirt
to Luc then. If it was bothering (Blake), he should have come over
and told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Pronger (stomach ailment) and Ray Ferraro (bruised toe)
also sat out the practice, as did both goalies.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said Robinson's approach was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know what to do,'' Blake said. ``What can he do?
He's done everything right. It's up to the players. That's why
today was exactly right. You have to skate us.''

THESTREET.COM PLANS TO RAISE UP TO $75 MILLION IN OFFERING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ TheStreet.com, the online financial news service,
said Tuesday that it would seek to raise as much as $75 million in
an initial public offering of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed offering is intended to capitalize on investors'
vast appetite for stock in Internet-related companies.
TheStreet.com also has the added draw of its co-founder, James J.
Cramer, a hedge-fund manager and financial commentator who appears
on television, in print and in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   If TheStreet.com raises the full proposed amount, it will
outstrip some other recent Internet offerings in size at least. At
$75 million, the offering will almost double the recent offering of
Marketwatch.com, the financial news service that is partly owned by
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Marketwatch.com sold 23 percent of its stock to the
public for $47 million, issuing 2.75 million shares for $17 each.
Those shares vaulted as high as $130 on their first day of trading,
and Tuesday closed at $65.50. TheStreet.com did not disclose in its
filing what part it planned to sell to the public.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, Marketwatch.com had $7 million in total revenue
last year; TheStreet.com had $4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com has grown to about 37,000 subscribers on Feb. 17
from 32,000 at the end of last year. But, like most Internet
start-up companies, it has lost money since its founding in 1996.
Last year, the losses totaled $16.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising accounted for about $2.5 million, or 55 percent of
total revenue last year. By the end of January, TheStreet.com had
already signed contracts for $3.1 million of advertising this year.
</P>
<P>
   One advertiser, which was not identified, accounted for 40
percent of last year's ad revenues, or 22 percent of the total
revenues. About 36 percent of total revenue came from subscription
sales, with the remainder from syndication fees and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing on Tuesday with securities regulators, the company
did not disclose how many shares would be sold or at what price.
But earlier this month TheStreet.com sold shares to The New York
Times Co. for about $11 each and to another, undisclosed investor
for $12 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co. said on Monday that it had invested $15 million in
cash and services in exchange for an equity stake in TheStreet.com
equivalent to about 8 percent of the company. Tuesday's filing
showed that the Times Co. received 1.32 million shares of common
stock and 37,728 shares of preferred shares.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of December, before the Times Co.'s investment and
excluding outstanding options on 1.5 million shares, TheStreet.com
had 13.7 million shares outstanding. The Times Co. becomes its
third-largest shareholder, behind the company's co-founders, Cramer
and Martin Peretz, editor in chief and chairman of The New Republic
magazine. Cramer owns about 2.7 million common shares and Peretz
owns about 2.6 million.

<P>
   The nation's hotels will not be filled exclusively with
corporate partygoers to welcome in the year 2000, but many hotel
owners would like that to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   The 627-room Millennium Broadway in Times Square is thought to
have started the ball rolling by offering its hotel and staff from
Dec. 31, 1999, through Jan. 2, 2000, for $3 million. Then the
155-room Fitzpatrick Grand Central Hotel made itself and its staff
available those same dates for $1.5 million, followed by the
92-room Fitzpatrick Manhattan, which is available for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the 100-room Woodmark Hotel in Kirkland, Wash., a suburb of
Seattle, joined the hotel sweepstakes with an asking price of
$199,900. And now the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group in San
Francisco, which operates hotels and restaurants mostly in the
West, is accepting bids for its three hotels in Seattle and their
adjoining restaurants. The asking price for all six properties is
$400,000, or between $120,000 and $200,000 for a combined hotel
(depending on the size) and restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was to offer the hotels only to corporations,
but now the public is also invited to bid. Why the change of heart?
Because, said Charlotte Morgan Wayte, a Kimpton hotel spokeswoman,
``We wondered if people are really going to want to celebrate the
millennium with people they work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Room With a View
</P>
<P>
   Many hotel Web sites enable guests to view the rooms,
restaurants and even the landscaping at individual properties. But
Starwood Hotels and Resorts plans to announce Wednesday a Web site
designed by IBM that not only allows frequent guests to make
reservations online but also to customize the Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Most hotel marketing programs are based on profiles developed
from guests' past preferences _ whether they stayed in a
traditional room or suite, smoking or nonsmoking, even whether they
preferred a room facing north, south, east or west. But Starwood
Preferred Guest members can now update that information whenever
their preferences change, and they can redeem their ``Starpoints''
online as well as obtain access to current promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Check In, Checkup
</P>
<P>
   Guests of the Peabody Hotel in Orlando, Fla., can get both a
good night's sleep and a physical checkup that includes cholesterol
screening, cardiac stress test, massage therapy, relaxation and
Yoga. The arrangement is possible because of Peabody's recent
partnership with the Institute for Corporate Wellness, part of a
seven-hospital system in central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Checkups normally cost $1,000 but are available to Peabody
guests for $850. The hotel said it did not receive any money for
the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the health front, guests of the Jalousie Hilton Resort
and Spa in St. Lucia, the West Indies, can now make appointments to
see the island's resident bush doctor, Daniel Cherubin, who
dispenses hands-on healing and concocts natural herbal medicine
from his garden or the island's rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Airline Update
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, Continental Airlines will begin daily nonstop
service between Newark, N.J., and Amsterdam, Netherlands, subject
to approval by the Netherlands. And effective now, Continental and
Chase Manhattan Bank will offer the first co-branded debit card.
Users of the card, which has a $30 annual fee, will earn one
frequent-flier mile on Continental for every $2 spent on purchases,
compared with one mile earned for $1 spent with the existing
Continental-Chase credit card.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, US Airways will add one daily nonstop flight between
Philadelphia and each of 10 cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago,
Cleveland, Denver, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Minneapolis,
Pittsburgh and Seattle.

JURY CONVICTS WHITE SUPREMACIST IN DRAGGING DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: With JASPER-KING and JASPER-HATE-TEXAS) 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Trial _ A young white supremacist who dreamed of
launching his own hate group was convicted of capital murder
Tuesday for chaining a disabled black man to a pickup and dragging
him to his death through the East Texas woods last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated 2 1/2 hours before returning a unanimous
guilty verdict against John William ``Bill'' King, 24, an ex-con
accused of masterminding James Byrd Jr.'s gruesome killing last
June 7. Two other white men, friends of King's, will stand trial
later.
</P>
<P>
   The jury foreman, the sole African-American in the group of
seven men and five women, delivered the verdict to state District
Judge Joe Bob Golden. The judge read it before a packed courtroom,
quickly silencing a brief outburst of applause.
</P>
<P>
   King showed no emotion as the verdict was read. His father,
Ronald, seated in a wheelchair in the front row of the courtroom,
cried openly. He later released a typewritten statement through a
friend, saying he loved his son as any father should, and was
``deeply saddened'' by the verdict. He asked for prayers for the
Byrd family ``as they have shouldered an even greater burden these
last several months.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's relatives, who had sat through 4 1/2 days of often
horrific testimony, also wept as the verdict was read. The victim's
sister, Mary Verrett, said she was relieved by the decision, one
that in her view was based on fact, not emotion. ``And that's what
we wanted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that her brother, a singer and piano player, had
always told her that one day he would be famous and that ``the
world would know that James Byrd Jr. had walked on this earth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think he wanted to be remembered for this,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors took a short break Tuesday afternoon and then returned to
hear additional testimony in the punishment phase of the trial.
That testimony is expected to wrap up Wednesday. On Thursday, the
lawyers will make closing arguments before the jury decides whether
King will get a life prison sentence or death by injection.
</P>
<P>
   If he goes to death row, King would become the first white
person in Texas sentenced to lethal injection for killing a black
person since the state resumed the death penalty more than 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors began calling witnesses in the punishment phase,
Byrd's 28-year-old daughter, Renee Mullins, and his son, Ross, 20,
stood outside the courthouse with their arms around each other.
Mullins, who burst into tears when the verdict was read, said it
was ``a breath of fresh air'' that would help bring an end to a
nightmare she has lived since her father's brutal death.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one down and two to go,'' added Ross Byrd, who said he
wants King to get the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was later echoed by his aunt, Clara Taylor of
Houston. ``If the death penalty is what the government provides for
a crime of this sort, then by all means, that's what we want,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, black leaders and anti-racist groups
applauded the ``swift and true justice'' from the Jasper jury.
President Clinton said he was heartened by the public's reaction of
outrage to Byrd's murder, which demonstrated ``an act of evil like
this is not what our country is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the media, Ronald King, the father of the
defendant, said he ``prays that no family should ever experience
prejudice of any sort ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder King, who may be called to testify during the
punishment phase of his son's trial, also asked a friend, a priest
who had accompanied him every day of the trial, to express his
sorrow to the Byrd family. The priest approached each member of the
family to deliver the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't blame him,'' Byrd's sister, Mylinda Washington, said
of the killer's father. ``It was hard for him as a parent to go
through that. We're all losers here.''
</P>
<P>
   King's attorneys later said that Ronald King, who is ailing from
emphysema and stress, was taken to the doctor Tuesday afternoon for
a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments earlier in the day, prosecutor Pat Hardy
compared King to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and urged the jury to
ignore the defense's contention that King's numerous tattoos could
be something other than racist or satanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aryan Pride,'' he said, referring to a large tattoo on King's
side. ``Ladies and gentleman, that's Adolf Hitler. These symbols
have always had a meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy ended his 20-minute argument by showing the jury a drawing
found in King's apartment of the satanic baphomet symbol with three
hooded figures riding horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you all can see this,'' Hardy said, ``because it shows
exactly what was in the mind of John King and his cohorts that
night. This amounts to three robed riders coming straight out of
hell, and that's exactly what there was that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a rope they used a chain. Instead of horses, they
were using a pickup truck,'' he said. ``And after they dragged that
poor man and tore his body to pieces, they dropped him right in
front of a church and a cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy said that with that last act, King and Byrd's other
killers showed their ``defiance of everything that most people in
this county stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And in this state, and in this country,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy also quoted a jail house note, or ``kite'' that King sent
to co-defendant Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31, shortly after
their arrests last summer. In the note, which jailers intercepted
and photocopied, King bragged about the crime, saying that
regardless of the outcome, they had ``made history.'' He signed the
note, ``Much Aryan Love, Respect and Honor ... Seig Heil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor?'' Hardy said. ``These were strong men in their 20s and
it took three of them to bring down a 49-year-old,
half-intoxicated, disabled man. Where is the honor in that?''
</P>
<P>
   During their deliberations, jurors sent out one note, asking to
see the kite. They reached their verdict 15 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing, defense lawyer Brack Jones Jr. focused on the
kidnapping charge, saying that chaining Byrd's ankles to the pickup
was the method of death rather than the second crime of kidnapping,
which was needed for the capital murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible, terrible, brutal, horrendous and painful
death,'' Jones acknowledged. ``The question is, was Mr. Byrd
kidnapped?''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. also reminded the
jury that King's white supremacist beliefs did not prove his guilt.
``You have a right to be a racist,'' he said. ``You have a right to
be a satanist. Right or wrong, that is his right.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged jurors to look again at the physical evidence in the
case, a cigarette with King's DNA and a lighter found at the crime
scene, and less than a drop of Byrd's blood on King's sandal strap.
None of those things placed his client definitively at the scene,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the prosecution's theory that the cigarette butt
was King's and that another person's DNA on the butt could have
been Byrd's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the man is such a severe racist, he's not going to share a
cigarette with a black man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, he said, was a scenario in which King smoked the
cigarette earlier in the day and put it in the ashtray of
co-defendant Shawn Berry's truck, where Byrd later found it.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a well-known local figure who walked everywhere he went,
was headed down Martin Luther King Boulevard on his way home from a
party early June 7 when he accepted a ride with three white men in
a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence in the case indicated that King, a member of the
Confederate Knights of America prison gang, and his buddies Berry
and Brewer, took Byrd to a clearing in the woods east of Jasper,
beat him, pulled his jeans to his ankles and chained him to the
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was then dragged more than 2 miles. Along the way, he
fought to keep his head off the pavement, grinding his elbows,
knees, heels and buttocks to the bone before his head slammed into
a concrete culvert, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Byrd's battered, beheaded body was found in
the middle of Huff Creek Road. His head, shoulder and right arm lay
in a ditch a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Cribbs described defending King as ``climbing
Mount Everest,'' saying it was nearly impossible to overcome the
damning evidence in King's own writings.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every day of the trial, prosecutors produced
incriminating letters and other documents, many handwritten and
signed with King's distinctive signature, ``Possum,'' with Nazi
lightning bolts for the SS, and a triangular symbol with three
interlocking K's.
</P>
<P>
   King even scratched the words ``White Pride'' into his cell
door, and wrote ``Shawn Berry is a snitch-ass traitor'' in his
cell.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who also is charged in the case, pointed the finger at
King and Brewer following his arrest, and led police to a 24 1/2
foot logging chain used to drag Byrd. He and Brewer will be tried
separately later.
</P>
<P>
   When court recessed for the day, Byrd's father, James Byrd Sr.,
thanked prosecutors for ``a fine job'' on the case and thanked the
community for its support of his family.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother, Stella Byrd, has been absent from the
courtroom during the trial, but her daughters said she was relieved
by the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw her smile for the first time in a long time,'' Taylor
said.

THIS SEASON IS ALREADY 20% FINISHED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was only 13 months ago _ when time ran at a slower
pace _ that the Nets trooped into the big city for the rivalry that
is not all that much of a rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, there was room for perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose, we've got 50 left,'' said John Calipari, then and
now the coach of the Team Across the River. ``That's the way I'm
approaching it.''
</P>
<P>
   What lovely, leisurely days they were, days when a marginal team
could put on a stretch run in March and challenge for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In this air ball of a season, there is no time for dawdling.
When the rich tall guys started huffing and puffing down the court,
there were only 50 games left.
</P>
<P>
   For the Knicks and the Nets, there are now only 40 games left.
Time is already a problem for the New Jersey franchise, which was
supposed to be on the rise. But instead, the Nets were 2-8 after
Tuesday night's 82-74 loss to the Knicks, who improved to 7-3. The
Nets have almost no margin for prolonged failure in this short,
strange season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no reason to worry about making the playoffs,'' Jeff
Van Gundy, the coach of the Knicks, said before the game. ``They
have too much talent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he really say that?'' asked Jayson Williams of the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Assured that Van Gundy had indeed said it, Williams laughed and
said, ``Aw, he's just doing that Michael Jordan thing: `Come on out
and I'll buy you a steak.'''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy does not blow smoke, and seemed quite sincere about
praising the Nets. He admits that in this short, strange season
that every game is worth more than a normal game _ something like
1.6 of a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it works both ways,'' Van Gundy said. ``If you win, or if
you lose, a game is worth more.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. In these post-Jordanian times, somebody is going to
take a championship, and it might as well be a sprinter as a
marathoner. Horses for courses, as they say at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Just as some frisky little colts have run off with the
short-short Preakness, couldn't somebody make a burst from the
starting gate, get up some momentum and gallop right toward the
Fourth of July or whenever this mutation of a season will finally
end?
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins this season is going to wear a gigantic asterisk
for eternity, not that the team will mind. The Nets badly needed a
victory over the Knicks in the rivalry that exists only in the most
fevered imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   For the Nets, Madison Square Garden is a bright place across the
river where they play sometimes. For the Knicks, the preoccupation
has been with the Chicago Bulls and the Indiana Pacers, although
Van Gundy said, ``As long as I've been here, they've always played
us tough.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Knicks are 26-15 against the Nets since Van Gundy
joined the organization in 1989, but even beyond the record, there
is just not that much acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   This town is dying for a good rivalry. The best rivalry this
town ever had reached its peak in early September 1951, when the
resurgent New York Giants lounged insolently behind the batting
cage, telling their chums, the Brooklyn Dodgers, that they were
back in the pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, baseball was willing to toss aside its history
of separate leagues to put the Mets and the Yankees in the same
test tube for three games a year. In theory, it's a gimmick but the
town does rock for three days.
</P>
<P>
   The first Jets-Giants exhibition, in New Haven in 1969, when the
Jets annihilated the Giants, now that was a rivalry. The
billingsgate chants from hockey fans in the Garden are just a vague
reminder of what the Islanders-Rangers games felt like a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we're still waiting for the Knicks and the Nets to
generate some heat between them. At the moment, the obsession is
not about some rival across the river, but about time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at my back I always hear
</P>
<P>
   Time's winged chariot hurrying near ...''
</P>
<P>
   (Andrew Marvell never imagined he would wind up in a sports
column.)
</P>
<P>
   The worst part of this truncated season is the atrocities
committed upon the good name of hoops. The turnovers. The clangers.
The mental errors. The other night I saw Kendall Gill dribble the
ball off his foot and out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   These folks were not playing solid basketball last year. Since
this lockout they are mostly playing as if they trained on laughing
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty games used to leave time for regrouping. Fifty games is a
season, now one-fifth over, and moving very fast for the Nets.

ECONOMIST'S AIRPORT CRYSTAL BALL FORECASTS HOUSING PRICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Craig M. Silvers, real estate research director at
Los Angeles-based Sutro &AMP; Co., takes a simple approach to
forecasting whether area home prices will go up or down: He counts
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of the tens of millions of people who pass through Los
Angeles International Airport terminals each year go into Silvers'
equations. Then Silvers crunches the numbers, applies a little
forward spin and has come up with a surprisingly accurate
prediction of home price movement.
</P>
<P>
   Silvers, also a senior vice president at the well-respected
investment bank, christened the airport crystal ball method his
``LAXometer.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the size and type of his database, it's safe to say the
method has some legs under it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen the passenger traffic statistics come out and
sensed a strong correlation of different factors with each other.
Some of them had an unusually high coincidence correlation. There's
a regression formula that worked very well,'' the economist said.
</P>
<P>
   Translated into layman's terms: A sort of random statistic
popped up, he applied it to home prices and found that they were a
shirttail cousin to the annual change in the number of folks coming
and going through LAX.
</P>
<P>
   Shoot, it almost sounds like the title to a new country song:
``My home price would rise if I could get my wife to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the basics. Silvers looked at the percent change in
passenger traffic on an annual basis and found that home prices in
the six-county Southern California region moved in the same general
direction two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it's a leading indicator.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1995 passenger traffic increased 5.6 percent and
in 1997 the median home price, the point at which half sold for
more and half for less, increased 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Silvers said that his LAXometer predicted both the decline and
rise of home prices during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first time he brought it into play and
forecast a 9.9 rise in home prices after passenger traffic
increased 7.5 percent in 1996. Turned out that prices during 1998
actually rose 9.8 percent, according to Silvers' calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Some other real estate market analysts said that predictions
like Silver's aren't just flights of fancy.
</P>
<P>
   John Karevoll at Acxiom Corp.'s DataQuick Products Division said
that with today's computing power all sorts of quirky relationships
can be uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of trends that seem to dance to the same
tune and it's not normally apparent why they do that,'' he said.
``There are always some number patterns that seem to behave
similarly.''
</P>
<P>
   In Silvers' case, he said the airport traffic patterns belie
four hard economic facts.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger traffic increases when people are confident about the
economy. Those living in the region either fly out on vacations or
businesspeople fly into town for the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In times of economic distress, just the reverse is true.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the recession in the early part of the
1990s, both passenger traffic and housing prices were depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger the swing in passenger traffic the bigger the swing
in housing prices,'' Silvers said.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt last year was a banner year for homeowners who finally
scored some appreciation. So what about this year?
</P>
<P>
   Based on 1997's 5.6percent increase in passenger traffic Silvers
predicts home prices this year will see a modest gain of
3.5percent.

STRAWBERRY FIGHTS THROUGH CHEMOTHERAPY, WORKS FOR SPOT ON YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Darryl Strawberry recovered his breath as he
plopped heavily into his clubhouse chair Tuesday. The rest of his
teammates were outside going through a series of sprints, but
Strawberry was tired and skipped that part of the workout.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry lifted weights, pumped an Exercycle and that was
enough, far more than can be expected from someone recovering from
colon cancer and taking weekly chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good, coming back on such a long road,'' he said. ``Not
an easy road.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, spoke before Tuesday's workout,
the first full-squad gathering of the spring. He presented the team
rules _ punctuality was a primary theme _ and told the Yankees to
concentrate on contending with the rest of the American League, and
not on the records they set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Torre then watched the pitchers throw and the hitters take
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, limping on his bum left knee, gingerly shagged some
fly balls and took a round of batting practice. His upper body is
strong, carved into thick muscle.
</P>
<P>
   And with Trey Hillman, a Class AAA manager, throwing batting
practice, Strawberry drove several balls beyond the outfield wall,
including a shot over the center field fence that generated a roar
from the small crowd watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, Darryl!'' somebody screamed, and Bernie Williams
raised both arms, as if to signal touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who turns 37 next month, also hit several balls into
the netting at the top of the cage and grimaced in response. His
legs are thinned, undeveloped; the colon surgery and the
chemotherapy that will continue until May have prevented him from
exercising his legs as he did before spring training last year.
</P>
<P>
   He has a long way to go, Torre agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be his own doctor,'' Torre said. ``Everybody is
concerned about his well-being related to the cancer, and he's
building his strength with his daily regimen. But the knee that
causes problems for him, that's like starting over again, because
he hasn't been able to do anything all winter. It's not that he
wouldn't; he couldn't. And that's an area that could cause us some
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a Hollywood script, Strawberry would take batting
practice immediately after chemotherapy _ and actually, that is not
far removed from what is happening _ and quickly play his way into
shape to become the Yankees' left fielder once more. He would hit a
home run at the Yankees' home opener April 9. The New York fans,
who have booed and cheered him for 17 years, would salute him once
more as he rounded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood is not real life.
</P>
<P>
   Real life is Strawberry overcome by nausea after chemotherapy.
In simple terms, chemotherapy acts as a poison to fight the cancer,
but the body's instinct is to fight the poison, and the fight
inevitably wears down the body.
</P>
<P>
   Real life is Strawberry limping on a knee that he believes is
arthritic, and losing his breath after taking two dozen swings in
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Real life is the fact that the Yankees have three left fielders
who are younger than Strawberry, more mobile, and none of them is
fighting cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Real life is that Chili Davis is in better shape than he was
last spring and under contract for $4.5 million a season. He will
be given the chance to become the Yankees' everyday designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood never accounts for something like the luxury tax,
which may help trap Strawberry into a long rehabilitation. At a
time George Steinbrenner exercised Strawberry's $2.5 million option
for 1999 season _ a gesture of good will, for it is unlikely any
other team would have guaranteed Strawberry that kind of money _ he
asked that the Yankees be granted an exemption of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   So long as Strawberry is not on the 40-man roster, his salary
will not be subject to the 33 percent luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
   If Strawberry were to open the season, the Yankees would have to
pay an additional $833,333 in tax at a time when Steinbrenner wants
General Manager Brian Cashman to cut the payroll, after arbitration
losses to Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is deeply religious, a faith developed as he fought
through alcoholism, substance abuse and other personal trouble. He
believes God tested him in the past and that all those troubles
have prepared him for this.
</P>
<P>
   God, Strawberry believes, has asked him to accept the burden of
cancer, because as a public figure, Strawberry is in a position to
educate others about the disease and its pain. Strawberry is
honored that God has chosen him, and when he is tired, he says, he
gleans strength from the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible taught me to accept everything with joy,''
Strawberry said, smiling. ``I have peace within about this.''

INTEL DEMONSTRATES PENTIUM III MICROPROCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp. demonstrated Tuesday a version of
its new Pentium III microprocessor that computes more than a
billion operations a second, the so-called one-gigahertz mark.
</P>
<P>
   The chip maker, however, was careful to state that it had
specially cooled the chip to reach the mark and that it did not
expect to begin selling commercial versions of the Pentium III
running at that speed until the end of 2000 or early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a technology demonstration,'' said Albert Yu, the
Intel executive in charge of microprocessor business. ``It is not
what I would recommend for people to do in their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Other chip makers have designed experimental microprocessors
that have attained the one-gigahertz mark, but Yu said this was the
first time that a chip designed for general-purpose personal
computers had reached the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it was
demonstrating the new microprocessor using its 0.25-micron
manufacturing process, but that manufacture of the commercial
gigahertz processors would use an even more advanced process of
either 0.18 or 0.13 micron. The submicron measurement generally
refers to the width of the ultrathin wires that make up chip
components like transistors. By contrast, a human hair is about 75
to 100 microns wide.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has tried to position the Pentium III as a ``next
generation'' microprocessor, but industry analysts have generally
viewed the chip as merely an incremental advance over the company's
450-megahertz Pentium II chips. The first Pentium III chips to be
offered will operate at the speed of 500 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are just running the same old software it doesn't do
much for you,'' said Linley Gwennap, an editor at Microprocessor
Report, an industry publication. ``It's a little faster than the
Pentium II 450.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwennap said the Pentium III had additional instructions that
offered faster processing of three-dimensional graphics for games,
speech recognition processing and video compression.

LEGISLATION LIMITING YEAR 2000 LIABILITY IS INTRODUCED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Mich.)  (nk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan group of House members introduced
business-backed legislation Tuesday that would limit litigation,
lawyers' fees and damages from breakdowns related to the Year 2000
computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill is being prepared in the Senate, and sponsors of
both bills said they hoped to win quick passage of the liability
limitations. Trial lawyers, however, are expected to lobby strongly
against the measure, and the White House has called it unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, the White House adviser on the Year 2000 problem,
said Tuesday that the administration was taking a position of
``studied neutrality'' on the legislation, which was sponsored by
Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., and five other House members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not view this as a Year 2000 readiness issue,'' said
Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion. ``It's related to the Year 2000 in terms of who pays
for whatever the problems are, but it is not an issue that is going
to positively effect a solution.'' He said the bill was less about
the computer problem than about a long-running congressional battle
over liability limits and tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, however, say the legislation will provide an
incentive for companies to fix the problem by protecting businesses
and individuals who make reasonable efforts to prevent failures
resulting from the programming glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress approved legislation intended to protect
businesses from being sued for statements about Year 2000
preparedness that had been made in good faith, even if they turned
out to be false. But efforts to include liability limits in that
legislation failed.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from the way some computers,
software and electronic devices store dates as two digits, like 99
for 1999. As a result, they may malfunction when confronted with
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The House proposal would bar most Year 2000 claims from federal
courts, unless plaintiffs provided notice to sue within 30 days of
a breakdown and gave defendants 90 days to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits for personal injuries would not be affected, but
punitive damages could be sought only if there was clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant specifically intended to
cause injury, and the damages would be capped at $250,000. Lawyers'
fees would be limited to $1,000 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the bill attempts to protect large companies from
responsibility for the actions of less wealthy co-defendants by
limiting each defendant's liability to a direct proportion of its
responsibility for breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The measure encourages mediation and arbitration over lawsuits
and establishes a federal loan program for small businesses that
need help fixing their computer systems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Groups pushing for the legislation include the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National
Retail Federation and the National Federation of Independent
Businesses, the main small business trade group. Trade associations
for the information technology, software and insurance industries
also back the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The House sponsors promoted the new proposal as necessary for
insuring that companies focus their resources and efforts on
getting computer systems ready for the year 2000, not on preparing
or defending themselves from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much time, talent and money is being spent on efforts to
avoid litigation'' said Rep. James P. Moran, D-Va. ``These
resources should be directed toward fixing the Y2K problem and
trying to avoid computer disruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen said he disagreed that the threat of litigation was
hampering efforts to fix the problem. ``The lawyers who are
preparing either side of this issue are not the people who are
fixing systems,'' he said. ``And at this juncture I don't know of
any major company that says, `If I didn't have my lawyers working
here I'd get more systems fixed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 50 Year 2000 lawsuits have been reported so far in
the United States, most of which are pending. One resulted in a
$250,000 settlement last fall from Tec America Inc. for a Michigan
grocer whose checkout equipment could not handle Year 2000 dates.
And a class-action lawsuit on behalf of medical groups stuck with
faulty software resulted in a settlement with the Medical Manager
Corp. providing for free repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, judges have served notice that many of the
lawsuits will be an uphill battle for plaintiffs. In most cases,
vendors of business software have been cleared of any
responsibility for Year 2000 fixes that were not spelled out in
their contracts. And class-action suits over faulty financial
software from Intuit Inc. were dismissed after judges pointed out
that Intuit was providing free repairs and that no damage had been
done.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups, however, are worried by predictions from some
legal experts that Year 2000 disruptions will eventually unleash an
unprecedented tidal wave of lawsuits covering an almost
unimaginable variety of claims. Lloyds of London, the insurance
exchange, has projected that the worldwide legal costs might reach
$1 trillion.

VICTORY INSPIRES HOPE IN FROGS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Referee David Hall's whistle dangled between
his lips.
</P>
<P>
   He glared at TCU coach Billy Tubbs, daring him to spew another
stream of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go?'' Hall asked, a second technical waiting if
Tubbs answered wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs and his Horned Frogs were chin deep in a back-and-forth
game with host Nevada-Las Vegas, needing a victory to keep alive
their hope of an NCAA Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   He figured he had little to lose. A loss in Las Vegas would
basically seal TCU's postseason bid to the National Invitation
Tournament, anyway. So he simply shrugged his shoulders, smirked
and began barking again.
</P>
<P>
   His smirk remained long after time had expired on TCU's 76-72
victory over UNLV that ended about 1 a.m. yesterdayCST.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was very emotional for all of us,'' Horned Frogs
guard Vladimir Jaksic said. ``For us, the actual \RWestern Athletic
Conference\S tournament started this game. We don't have a right to
lose anymore if we want to make the \RNCAA\S Tournament and do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   By defeating Mountain Division-leading UNLV, TCU played itself
back into consideration for an at-large NCAA Tournament berth and
back into the running for a possible Mountain Division
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' Tubbs said. ``But I know we're in
better shape now than we were \RMonday\S afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours before the victory, TCU had been sweating
getting a berth in next week's WAC tournament, much less an NCAA
berth.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to hapless Air Force on Saturday had plunged TCU into
sixth in the Mountain Division. Only the top six teams in each
division make the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we lost to Air Force, we had lot to prove,'' said
Marquise Gainous, who sealed TCU's victory by hitting a free throw
with 2.7 seconds remaining. ``We needed this win because it's going
to be tough. We have somebody, Wyoming, trailing behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   With two regular-season games remaining, against third-place
Rice on Thursday and second-place Tulsa on Saturday, TCU has
procured a little distance between itself and other contenders for
the final Mountain Division berth.
</P>
<P>
   TCU (18-8, 6-6 WAC) jumped to fifth, tied with Colorado State
(16-8, 6-6), in the Mountain Division standings by defeating UNLV.
The Frogs hold the tiebreaker over the Rams by virtue of sweeping
their regular-season series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to come in here and win because this was a big
game to win if we wanted to be considered an NCAA Tournament
team,'' said Lee Nailon.
</P>
<P>
   A long inspection list awaits teams like TCU, sweating whether
an NCAA at-large slot will be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors play roles, including a team's Ratings
Percentage Index ranking and performance in the final 10 games. RPI
is a computer-generated rankings system that factors in Division I
winning percentage, schedule strength and opponents' schedule
strength.
</P>
<P>
   If the Frogs finish with back-to-back victories and reach the
semifinals of the conference tournament, they will finish with a
22-9 mark, 7-3 over the final 10 games. That, when coupled with
their RPI, is likely to get them in the NCAA Tournament. TCU has a
solid RPI of 28, according to rankings yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   TCU is also likely to be helped because its four-game losing
streak came with Nailon missing all or part of three games. He
didn't play against UNLV or at Tulsa because of an NCAA-mandated
suspension for fighting, and he missed a good chunk of TCU's loss
to SMU with an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes \Rbeating UNLV\S even stronger,'' Jaksic
said. ``We had been struggling since UNLV beat us in \RFort
Worth\S. Then we lost some games we shouldn't. That doesn't mean
we're not a good team. We had to win this game tonight and we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Only afterward were players and coaches willing to admit that it
was a must-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence was in the expressions and the emotion of the
players and coaches. The usually nonchalant Frogs were replaced by
players who capped slam dunks with a pump of the fists, who were
banging on the floor to call for a defensive stand, who celebrated
the victory with high-fives instead of the usual shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shannon Long told me: `I guarantee we're going to win this
game,' '' Tubbs said. ``It's one thing for a coach to say that, but
I think when it comes from a player it comes from the heart.''
</P>

BIGGIO, BAGWELL WON'T LET ASTROS FADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Ken Caminiti arrived at the Houston Astros
training camp yesterday riding a Harley-Davidson, gray and black
with lavender trim.
</P>
<P>
   Two autographed baseballs adorned the fenders. Craig Biggio,
riding his own black and silver Harley, escorted him in style. A
large chorus whooped and hollered when they sauntered into the
clubhouse together.
</P>
<P>
   The moment was big for both Caminiti and the Astros, an All-Star
third baseman, former MVP and kindred spirit of Biggio and Jeff
Bagwell, officially rejoining his old team after a four-year exile
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``His presence alone here is huge,'' Biggio said. ``Cammy comes
to play. When he's out there, he expects everybody around him to
play the game hard, play it right and leave everything on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's arrival yesterday helped lift the spirits of a team
that got an emotional two-by-four whack across the face Monday when
they heard All-Star outfielder Moises Alou will miss most _ if not
all _ of the season with a severe knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge blow,'' Bagwell said. ``You lose a guy like Moises, you
can't replace him. We've got to find a way to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou's loss is the latest in a series of emotional blows that
have buffeted the Astros since they finished the 1998 regular
season with a team-record 102 victories. They were upset by the San
Diego Padres in the playoffs, they failed to re-sign pitcher Randy
Johnson, and they couldn't swing a trade for Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is Alou, and his injury was brought up immediately by
general manager Gerry Hunsicker during a team meeting before the
Astros' first full-squad workout yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't cover up the fact that it was a huge blow to the
ballclub to lose Moises,'' Hunsicker said. ``On the other hand, we
just have to dig a little deeper and work harder to make up for the
loss. I wanted to make sure this team isn't sitting around feeling
sorry for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to recognize we still have a talented ballclub. Not
only are we capable of winning the division, I expect it to win the
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker and manager Larry Dierker also know that a team with
Bagwell and Biggio sitting in the clubhouse isn't going to sit
around feeling sorry about anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Hunsicker said. ``One of the reasons we've been
successful with less resources than some of our competitors is the
character of our ballclub. I've always felt a championship ballclub
starts with the caliber of leadership and we have that with Bagwell
and Biggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell and Biggio make it easy on Dierker, an easygoing manager
with a fondness for cigars, flowered shirts and Jimmy Buffet.
Dierker has very few rules other than be on time and don't
embarrass him. The tacit understanding in the Astros' clubhouse is
if you mess up or cause problems, you answer not to the manager or
coaches, but to Bagwell and Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to command respect,'' Caminiti said. ``They
get it, just by the way they play and act.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, despite the off-season setbacks, still have
front-line talent. They probably would have won the division last
year even without trading for Johnson, and they have enough
outfield depth to cover for Alou. Carl Everett hit .296 for the
Astros last year, and Richard Hidalgo hit .303 in a half-season.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens or Johnson would have given them a staff ace, but they
still have Shane Reynolds (19-8), Mike Hampton (11-7), Jose Lima
(16-8) and Scott Elarton, the prized young right-hander they
refused to include in any package for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a well-run franchise that has enjoyed six
consecutive winning seasons, success matched or exceeded only by
the Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees. It's hard to imagine, even
with the loss of Johnson and Alou's injury that this team will fall
off dramatically.

FOR BETTER OR WORSE, NEW ERA TEES OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bold, new era begins today for the PGA Tour. Call it the
Divided We Thrive Period.
</P>
<P>
   At one venue, the top 64 players in the world rankings will be
competing for a $5 million purse in the kickoff to the World Golf
Championships series, the Match Play Championship.
</P>
<P>
   At another site, one that has hosted a PGA Tour stop for the
past 54 years, organizers of the Tucson Open are selling tickets so
customers can watch Brent Schwarzrock, Rory Sabbatini, Kaname Yokoo
and Tim Loustalot try to earn full-time playing privileges for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   The match-play event in Carlsbad, Calif., has David Duval and
Tiger Woods. The Tucson Open, which Duval won last season, has no
defending champion and no network television exposure. The two
highest-ranked players in its field are David Toms and Per-Ulrick
Johansson.
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour officials, who added $250,000 to the Tucson purse last
week to stimulate the quality of the field, insist there is enough
golf interest to make both events float in the same week. Common
sense says otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials at the Tucson Open proudly point to a 5
percent increase in advance sales for the 1999 tournament despite a
drop in star quality among competitors, you have to question if
this is a long-term trend or a one-year explosion of civic pride.
Turning a tournament into a permanent Tiger-free zone is no way to
assure its continued financial health and well being.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. I love the idea of the WGC's match-play event.
It's a huge plus for golf and should be a ratings bonanza. But
having it perpetually bump heads with Tucson's dates, as long-range
schedules suggest it will do for three of the next four years, will
make the Tucson Open an interesting test case for how WGC events
will affect traditional tour stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of Tucson is you take every challenge as it comes
and rise to the occasion,'' said tournament spokesman Jennifer
English. ``People here have done that. I can't tell you every other
encumbered event would be this well received in another city.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper concern about the WGC events is that their emergence
will affect the quality of fields throughout the PGA Tour. With
three additional $5 million purses available in 1999, elite players
figure to cut back on their appearances at nonmajors. Most already
were playing abbreviated schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only going to hurt, from that standpoint,'' said Tom
Watson, the defending champ at the MasterCard Colonial. ``It's
going to hurt all the tours in the numbers of events that players
play.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Watson said fields at the Colonial and the GTE
Byron Nelson Classic should not feel an impact because they are
positioned far away from any WGC conflicts on the tour calendar.
But a fourth WGC event will be added next year, with the date to be
announced. Long-range plans call for adding more WGC events, if
they prove popular with fans, TV executives and players.
</P>
<P>
   And they will.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, who knows? Phil Thomas, Colonial tournament
chairman, sees the potential for murky waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the proper placement of the \RWGC\S events, I don't think
it will affect us today. But I'm not saying it won't in the
future,'' Thomas said. ``The jury's out on that. It'll take a year
or two to see how things shake out.''
</P>
<P>
   So sit back and enjoy this week's debut of the Divided We Thrive
Period in PGA Tour history, as provided by the WGC series. It's an
enhancement to the tour, but it comes at a cost to events like the
Tucson Open.
</P>
<P>
   And be aware that, as the WGC events gain popularity, the cost
eventually could hit closer to home.
Spotlight on ...
MIRA VISTA CONNECTION WINS BIG AT NISSAN OPEN
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els hoisted the champion's trophy at the Nissan Open in
Los Angeles. But one of the biggest winners Sunday was Mira Vista
Country Club, where three golfers with ties to the course all made
quantum leaps on the PGA Tour season money list.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Fort Worth residents Mark Brooks, Alan Bratton and
Clark Dennis combined to collect $119,350 in prize money. They also
created a buzz in the locker room during weekend rounds, said Mira
Vista club pro Lindy Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, whose house is adjacent to the course, closed with a 66
and picked up his first top-10 finish at a PGA Tour event since
March 1997. Brooks' ninth-place effort was worth $72,800, boosting
him from 152nd to 68th on the money list ($81,566).
</P>
<P>
   Bratton, who represents Mira Vista on the PGA Tour, began
Saturday one stroke off the lead before finishing 15th. By doing
so, he earned the largest payday of his rookie season ($40,670) to
improve from 103rd to 77th in earnings with $67,476.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, likewise, is a Mira Vista representative. By cashing a
$5,880 check, he improved 11 places on the money list, to No. 150
($12,750).
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday, everyone was talking about Alan being in the
hunt. And Sunday, everyone was gathered around the TV,'' Miller
said. ``It was a really neat deal for Mira Vista. They all played
good, and people here have an extra interest in all three guys.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the three players root for each other. After shooting a
first-round 67 on Riviera Country Club's par-71 layout, Bratton
said his excitement grew after learning that Brooks and Dennis
threw down 68s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the course thinking, `All right. Mira Vista shot
10-under today,' '' Bratton said. ``It was a really good week. The
Fort Worth guys did OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Well enough, in fact, for all three to make double-digit
improvement on the season earnings list.
SHORT PUTTS
SEEKING NEW HORIZONS
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned by organizers of the LPGA Skins Game when sponsorship
dollars dried up during the off-season, Stonebriar Country Club in
Frisco is without a professional golf event for the first time in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean the course, which has hosted a Senior
Tour event (1989-93) and the Skins Game (1990-98), is out of the
professional golf business for good. Monty Becton, club general
manager, said he has begun making inquiries about bringing an LPGA
or Senior Tour event to Stonebriar's new course. Currently under
construction, along with an adjacent resort hotel, the new layout
is scheduled to open next year.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, said Becton, he'd like to have some
professional event in place for the 2001 or 2002 season.
NO SURRENDER
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard Colonial officials have not given up on landing Tiger
Woods, the world's top-ranked golfer, as a participant in their
1999 event. But they concede the chances are slim in light of a
confirmation by Woods' agent that his client will play in the SAP
Open in Germany during the same week as Colonial (May 20-23).
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods has not officially told us he won't be here. As
far as I'm concerned, we've still got a shot at it,'' said Phil
Thomas, Colonial tournament chairman. ``We certainly want him. But
we understand that you can't expect the top guys to come every
year. They've got other things they need and want to do. In a way,
it gives us something to look forward to next year if he doesn't
play this year. I don't think he can overlook Colonial on a regular
basis, year after year.''
WATSON DISLIKES RULING
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, the defending Colonial champ, is among those who
disagree with a recent ruling that allowed fans to help Tiger Woods
remove a boulder from his shot path during the final round of the
Phoenix Open (Jan. 31). Citing the rules of golf, which allow
players assistance in removing loose impediments, PGA Tour
officials deemed the boulder a loose impediment and decreed that it
could be removed if done so in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was dead wrong,'' Watson said during last week's Colonial
kickoff dinner. ``That's not the intent of the rule ... to allow
someone to be able to move a boulder. I think you'll see the USGA
change that rule to read, `If you can't move it yourself or with
the help of a caddie, you can't move it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Watson and Woods may soon have a chance to discuss the matter
personally. If both players win their opening matches in today's
World Golf Championships Match Play Championship, they will meet
tomorrow in the second round.
INSIDE THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   Under new guidelines adopted this month by the LPGA, criteria
for enshrinement in the LPGA Hall of Fame has shifted from a
win-based formula to a points-based formula (one point per
tournament win, two points per major championship, one point for
Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average, one point for
player-of-the-year award). As a result, Beth Daniel and Amy Alcott
became immediate qualifiers and will be enshrined March 22. Below
is a look at how selected players stand under the new guidelines,
with 27 points needed for enshrinement: Player Points Beth Daniel
39 Amy Alcott 35 Annika Sorenstam 24 Hollis Stacy 22 Laura Davies
22 Juli Inkster 20 Jan Stephenson 19 Sally Little 17 Dottie Pepper

TCU WASTES CHANCES IN LOSS TO OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ At the conclusion of a 14-12 loss to
Oklahoma at the TCU Diamond yesterday, Horned Frogs coach Lance
Brown said he felt remarkably refreshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did about 5.1 miles,'' he said, referring to his
stint on an exercise bike beyond the fence down the right-field
line _ his vantage point from the second inning on after being
ejected by plate umpire Kelly Nutt.
</P>
<P>
   Nutt's quick thumb seemed to set the tone for a bizarre
afternoon in which the Sooners (8-4) won despite walking 16 TCU
batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs (6-7) more or less returned the favor by stranding 13
runners and had five more thrown out on the bases _ including two
cut down at the plate in one inning.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma prevailed with a 19-hit attack that included four home
runs and a school-record-tying four triples. TCU, which trailed
10-1 after three innings, fought back by scoring eight runs in the
last three innings _ including four in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Sooners All-America candidate Casey Bookout hit a home run over
the wall in dead center, along with a 400-foot double that bounced
off the top of the wall in the right-center corner, the deepest
part of the park.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's David Wallace tied a school record with four walks. He
also had a single and hit a two-run homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played pretty good defense \Rdespite three errors\S, and we
hit the ball really well,'' Oklahoma coach Larry Cochell said. ``We
didn't pitch very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he was not surprised at being tossed by Nutt, who
ejected TCU assistant Donnie Watson from a game here last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much the same thing every time certain people show
up,'' Brown said. ``I just mentioned something to him about a
swinging strike call on one of our players who never moved his bat
on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I figured, what the heck, I might as well get some
exercise. So I rode the bike.''
</P>
<P>
   The game went 3 hours and 13 minutes, and the Sooners spent the
first hour of it roughing up TCU starter Cade Harris. By the end of
the day, the Frogs were pitching their designated hitter and the
Sooners had their left fielder on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   With 14th-ranked Hawaii arriving this weekend for the opening
series in Western Athletic Conference play, Brown saved his
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put ourselves in a hole today,'' he said. ``The thing I
liked was that instead of quitting, we fought back.''

SPEAKING OF DYNASTIES, IT'S CAROLINA BLUE OVER 'HUSKERS RED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dynasties typically deal with championships. But a dynasty can
be defined as success over time. And if you want to start a heated
dynasty debate, try this one: North Carolina basketball vs.
Nebraska football.
</P>
<P>
   Last week North Carolina recorded victory No. 20, giving the Tar
Heels 28 consecutive seasons with at least 20 victories. Twenty
times, North Carolina has won at least 25 games. The football
equivalent is winning 10 games, something Nebraska has accomplished
17 times.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three decades, the Tar Heels have won two national
championships while the Cornhuskers have won five. Nebraska's
football winning percentage the past 30 seasons is .839; North
Carolina's basketball winning percentage is .797.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's the argument: North Carolina or Nebraska, which has
the most impressive dynasty? Admittedly, this is a pumpkin
(basketball) vs. watermelon (football) debate.
</P>
<P>
   And this is an argument about excellence. There's little doubt
that when it comes to consistent success _ the most elusive variety
_ North Carolina basketball and Nebraska football are Nos. 1 and
1A.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has competed in bowl games for 31 consecutive seasons,
an NCAA record. North Carolina has participated in 24 consecutive
NCAA Tournaments. The last time the Tar Heels failed to win at
least one game in the NCAA tourney was 1980; they've won at least
one game in the past 18 NCAA tourneys.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Nebraska have been on interesting parallel
tracks of late.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of about two months in 1997, both schools' legendary
coaches _ the Tar Heels' Dean Smith and the Cornhuskers' Tom
Osborne _ announced their retirement. Both were replaced by
longtime assistant coaches _ Bill Guthridge at North Carolina and
Frank Solich at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season, Guthridge guided the Tar Heels to the Final
Four. In Solich's first season, the 'Huskers lost three Big 12
games and lost to Arizona in the Holiday Bowl. The success of these
Legend Substitutes will determine the future of this argument.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to choose between which has the better dynasty, the proof
is in conference play and strength of that conference.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina has finished no lower than third in Atlantic
Coast Conference play for 34 consecutive years. Nebraska has
finished no lower than third in the Big Eight and Big 12
conferences for 21 consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that North Carolina, year in, year out has
faced tougher competition in the ACC than Nebraska has faced in its
conference.
</P>
<P>
   In the ACC, the Tar Heels have had to contend with a national
championship contender in Duke for more than a decade. And the
North Carolina States, Georgia Techs, Marylands, Wake Forests and
Virginias have spent time contending for first place.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past three decades, Nebraska's conference season
came down to one game _ Oklahoma. In their last 27 seasons in the
Big Eight Conference, the Huskers lost 24 conference games _ 14
against the Sooners. It was truly the Big Two and the Little Six.
</P>
<P>
   This is corn vs. tobacco; the flat plains of Nebraska vs. the
tall pines of North Carolina; Midwestern sensibility vs. Southern
hospitality; North vs. South.
</P>
<P>
   The easy way out would be to declare North Carolina the
basketball dynasty and Nebraska the football dynasty. But given the
more competitive nature of ACC basketball, this vote comes down in
favor of the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   Barely.

RUNNER DEFEATS DISAPPOINTMENT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   If the women competitors in last year's Cowtown Marathon had a
hard time keeping up with winner Lori Stich, how will they ever
stay with her this year?
</P>
<P>
   She has barely touched earth since qualifying for the Olympic
Trials two months ago and expects to still be on a high when she
attempts to win her third Cowtown title Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now I get excited just thinking about qualifying, or when
my friends talk about it. It's still hard to believe,'' said Stich,
a 28-year-old lawyer from Stanwood, Mich., who also won Cowtown in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   She qualified at the California International in Sacramento,
Calif., with a personal-best time of 2 hours, 48 minutes, 41
seconds, despite a bout with the flu. What made it sweeter was that
it wiped out a huge disappointment in June. Stich thought she had
qualified then with a 2:50:30 at Grandma's Marathon in Duluth,
Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I just needed to run a 2:50. I was celebrating and
everything, and then someone told me I needed to beat 2:50,'' she
said. ``I crashed. It's not the end of the world to not qualify for
the trials, but when you don't make it because of stupidity, well
...''
</P>
<P>
   She believed she could beat 2:50, and pegged the California
International as her next try. But that became such an ordeal, she
almost didn't go.
</P>
<P>
   The week before, she made the 12-hour drive from Michigan to
Minnesota to be with family and friends for the Thanksgiving
holidays, flew from there to San Antonio to play piano at a
relative's wedding, then flew back to Minnesota. Then she drove
back to Michigan. In midweek, she came down with flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt rotten, and was wondering what the point was of going
out there,'' she said. Then she reasoned that if she didn't run,
she would go sightseeing. ``I had never been to Sacramento,'' said
Stich, who's an avid traveler.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures in the 40s, race day was perfect for Stich,
who likes to run in the cold. She decided to run, and by the 11th
mile, she liked her decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling great. I know that's still early in the race,
but I was already on pace to break 2:50. When I got to 18, I knew I
could even slow down and make it. It felt fantastic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Stich ran a 3:03:47 to win Cowtown, but a year of
more consistent running has put her in a faster lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join five people from the building next door at work, and we
run five miles every day at noon,'' said Stich, who ran nine
marathons and two 50-kilometer ultras last year. ``We have runners
of every ability, so it makes it easy to train. I had run 3:03 and
3:02 marathons without training consistently, and I was wondering
what I could do if I did train.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she knows.

WORLD BUYERS IN TOWN TO PICK FILMS FOR EXPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ The year's biggest event for Tinseltown's
major players comes March 21 when Academy Awards are presented; for
everyone else, it's Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of Hollywood producers, distributors and buyers,
the nine-day American Film Market is where the rubber truly meets
the road. Headquartered at Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, AFM is
the key event to find buyers for movies that deliver American-style
entertainment _ recognizable actors, explosions, starlets and car
chases _ to places like Bolivia, Bulgaria, Singapore and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect there will be about $400 million in deals that get
signed,'' said Jonathan Wolf, managing director of the event.
``It's not a trade show in the traditional sense but a place where
business gets done. People show up with contracts and attorneys and
if they don't sign at the event, they sign a couple of days
later.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19th annual American Film Market, billed as the industry's
biggest single trade event, opens Thursday as the key source for
buyers of movies produced outside the seven major studios. The
other major film-buying markets take place in May at the Cannes
Film Festival in France and in October at MIFED in Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   So Santa Monica will be overrun with pager-laden executives
scrambling to close deals with 7,000 attendees expected from 71
countries, including China for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   What's for sale? More than 1,000 titles fit into the
``debuting'' category, including 330 dramas, 180 comedies, 165
action-adventures, 140 thrillers, 79 romances, 55 adult/erotic
projects, 52 family films and 35 in the horror/sci-fi category.
Several hundred other ``returning'' titles are also up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popular image of an industry awash in cash due to
growth of new sources of revenue such as multiplexes and cable and
satellite systems, AFM participants face daunting obstacles,
including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Asian and Brazilian markets that have slumped and not yet
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   _ A product glut generated by the proliferation of independent
producers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The increasing ability of majors to tap into foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ A tougher market for action product at domestic video stores
and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ A decreased emphasis on ``pre-sales'' of projects, meaning
distributors often require producers to have a completed film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world market is still very weak,'' asserted George
Shamieh, president of PM Entertainment. ``We have to scramble. The
market's still bad but at least it seems to have stabilized.''
</P>
<P>
   Accredited buyers are charged $495 to attend; everyone else pays
$775. And for the first time, AFM is opening about 70 of its
screenings to the public at the AMC Santa Monica, offering a $95
nine-day pass ($45 for students and trade members).
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to find ``Driving Miss Daisy'' or ``Shakespeare in
Love''; instead, the approach will be breathtakingly direct. Take,
for example, ``Y2K,'' a high-tech thriller with Lou Gossett Jr. and
James Woolvet about a renegade general launching the Apocalypse
from a military base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K,'' produced by PM Entertainment, has a simple tagline _
``Man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of
life'' _ because AFM films need to be easily understood by foreign
audiences. Mostly, that means action and adventure, although
comedies, horror films and dramas have a shot, according to
Shamieh.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to do comedy, you have to deliver one that
translates worldwide,'' he said. ``You can't have American slang in
it.''

FROM PBS, AN EVENHANDED BIOGRAPHY OF ROBESON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Paul Robeson centennial was last year, when the singer,
actor and political activist would have been 100. Now here comes
PBS, chugging across the finish line after the race has ended.
</P>
<P>
   Still, good show.
</P>
<P>
   The ``American Masters'' documentary ``Paul Robeson: Here I
Stand,'' airing Wednesday on PBS, is an eye-opener for anyone who
knows the three presumably essential facts about Robeson and
nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Fact No. 1 is that Robeson was a black American. No. 2 _ and odd
that Wednesday's program airs opposite the Grammys _ is that he had
a big voice and sang ``Old Man River.'' Tote that barge, lift that
bale.
</P>
<P>
   Essential fact No. 3 is that Robeson was a Communist. That one's
in doubt. Robeson, who died in 1976, resented the assumption. His
son, a big presence in Wednesday's program, says Robeson was never
a Communist.
</P>
<P>
   But he was an admirer of the Soviet Union, a fashionable
friendship during the World War II years and pure poison afterward.
Like a locomotive, the entire documentary pushes toward that key
part of Robeson's makeup and its powerful effect on his career.
</P>
<P>
   For most of a decade, beginning in 1949, Robeson was virtually
buried alive in the United States. His passport was lifted. His
music vanished from the radio. Concert stages were off-limits to
him. Old friends joined his enemies in denouncing him.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference in Paris, Robeson had declared that black people
couldn't join in good conscience in a war against the Soviet Union.
He then revisited Russia, apparently turning a blind eye to Josef
Stalin's murderous purges.
</P>
<P>
   The ``American Masters'' production team lets you decide for
yourself what you think about that. Yes, Robeson was victimized by
McCarthy-era hysteria. But one of Robeson's political foes, Herbert
Hill, a former National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People official, is still on hand to insist that Robeson shouldn't
now be lionized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been given a sanitized myth of Paul Robeson,'' Hill
says. ``What we get is the marvelous singer, the great actor, the
man who stood up to the McCarthyites. But what we don't get is the
40-year history of defense and support for a movement based upon
terror and mass murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion in the program is that Robeson clung to his own
priority list of world villains, led by the American right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Without evidence, the documentary also raises the possibility _
Paul Robeson Jr. thinks it may be true _ that the CIA drugged
Robeson and contributed to the physical and mental decline of his
later years.
</P>
<P>
   Robeson was invigorated by his political struggles _ racial
justice, trade unionism, anti-fascism _ but you can't help but
wonder how his life might have been different if he'd been born
several decades later.
</P>
<P>
   He was a Phi Beta Kappa scholar, a linguist, a Columbia Law
School graduate, a grand athlete, a powerful singer and actor, and
a charismatic figure. And yet, in the 1930s, he labored through a
series of disillusioning films that demeaned, exploited and
radicalized him.
</P>
<P>
   What if the young Robeson had sprung upon us today? If you watch
this documentary, you might find it conceivable that he'd be taking
an oath of office somewhere, rather than declining a loyalty oath.

CHAIRMAN OF BANK OF MONTREAL ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The failed mergers between Canada's largest banks
appear to have claimed another high-profile victim.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew W. Barrett, the chairman and chief executive officer of
the Bank of Montreal, Canada's third largest national bank,
announced his immediate resignation as chief executive Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the start of the bank's annual shareholder meeting
in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Barrett, 54, also said he would also
retire as chairman in November, the end of the bank's fiscal year.
He was replaced as chief executive officer by F. Anthony Comper,
53, the bank's president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who had led the bank for more than a decade, had been
under pressure from institutional investors and shareholders since
December, when Canada's finance ministry rejected a proposed merger
between his bank and the Royal Bank of Canada, two of Canada's six
national banks.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett had argued that the banks needed to pool resources to
remain internationally competitive following big consolidations in
the United States and in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Montreal owns the Harris Bank of Chicago and is a
major shareholder in Grupo Financiero Bancomer SA in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger with Royal Bank was rejected Dec. 15, the
same day officials rejected a merger between the Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce and The Toronto-Dominion Bank. A.L. Flood, the
chairman and chief executive officer of the Imperial Bank, has
since announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   After the government shut the door on both mergers, bank stocks
were hit hard, and the Bank of Montreal was hurt more than any
other.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with reporters Tuesday, Barrett tried to distance his
decision to resign from the failure of the merger proposal. ``It is
not related to the merger,'' Barrett said. But he later
acknowledged that the failure of the merger was a personal
disappointment, and that ``had the merger gone through, I actually
would have stayed around longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said the Bank of Montreal had prepared a contingency
plan in case the mergers were not completed. That plan, a sweeping
reorganization outlined Tuesday, will take five to seven years to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said that he believed it was better to have one
executive direct the bank's transformation rather than to begin the
process under one chairman and then have to switch to another in a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Montreal reported net income Tuesday of $362 million
(Canadian) for the first quarter of 1999, which ended Jan. 31.

   The company also said it was starting a new children's site,
``Project Nozzle.''
</P>
<P>
   The music site is being developed separately from Viacom's MTV
and VH-1 Web sites. To assure that its image is not limited to the
more youth-oriented MTV or the more adult-oriented VH-1, the new
enterprise is now using the working title ``The Buggles Project.''
(A video of the song ``Video Killed the Radio Star'' by the musical
group The Buggles was the first video ever shown on MTV.)
</P>
<P>
   The plan also relies on the company's acquisition of Imagine
Radio, an Internet radio service created by Rotem Perelmuter and
Mike Briseno. That radio service has existing channels and offers
listeners the ability to create their own channels with their
favorite performers.
</P>
<P>
   The existing Web sites for MTV and Nickelodeon are primarily
promotional tools for the company's cable programming. But several
industry experts said Tuesday that Viacom recognized that it had to
create more of an online music presence. Julie Gordon, who runs The
Velvet Rope, a music industry insiders' Web site, said she saw the
moves as a positive way for Viacom to capitalize on the MTV and
Nickelodeon brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom said it would dedicate $250 million in advertising time
on its own cable services to promote the new music and children's
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it might spin off 20 percent of the new
venture. The strategy was welcome news on Wall Street. Viacom's
share price rose $1.375 Tuesday to close at $87, a 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom wants to protect its music franchise as rivals like
Wenner Media's Rolling Stone magazine create popular Web sites that
offer similar services. Though Viacom and Rolling Stone's core
businesses are in other technologies, they are now competing side
by side on the Internet. Another competitor is Sonic Net, a
business that offers home pages for every musical group, as well as
bulletin boards to communicate music news. Tele-Communications
Inc., the nation's second-largest cable operator, is a major
investor in Sonic Net.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon already operates a Web site, but Project Nozzle will
be an expanded destination for children with additional content and
features like chat rooms and e-mail. ``We are building a registered
community, that requires registered kids to be in it so that it is
a safer environment,'' a Viacom spokeswoman said. Viacom has
acquired Red Rocket, which sells educational toys online, and will
integrate that company with the existing services. Project Nozzle
has all the features of other general use Internet portals, but its
focus will be on children, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Freston, the head of MTV, said Tuesday that the new music
service was expected to generate revenue from advertising and some
electronic commerce. Though the existing MTV site does direct
consumers to CD Now, an online retailer, the new site may
collaborate more closely with merchandisers and seek deals with
partners such as Ticketmaster to sell tickets.

DEAL IN THE WORKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The air conditioning went kaput in the team's
administrative offices Tuesday, and the trade winds didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   A rumor has been circulating that accuses the Los Angeles
Clippers and Golden State of working on a trade involving veteran
point guard Pooh Richardson. According to reports, the Clippers
would send Richardson, the former UCLA star, to the Warriors in
exchange for veteran point guard Bimbo Coles and small forward
Duane Ferrell.
</P>
<P>
   But a team source said such a deal would make sense to
Richardson and his agent, Arn Tellem, but not to the teams
allegedly involved.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who is under contract for two more seasons after
this one is history, is making $3 million this season (before
pro-rated lockout deduction), which is close enough to the combined
salaries of Coles and Ferrell to make a deal possible.
</P>
<P>
   Also mentioned were proposed deals with Seattle and Vancouver.
It really is some coincidence that the players the Clippers would
receive from either of those teams in these phantom deals also
happen to be represented to Tellem.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I don't know,'' Richardson said of being dealt.
``And I'm not really thinking about it. The way it is in the league
now, it's difficult to trade people.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's been difficult for the 33-year-old playmaker to adjust
to his role as the third point guard in Coach Chris Ford's
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need for me getting' upset at not playin',''
Richardson said. ``When you bring negativity, it creates a stink.
Let's just get a win first.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Point clicking: &UR; !off! &LR;  With other point guards and rumors of
other point guards in the air, it would seem natural for the
climate to bother current starter Darrick Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about things I can't control,'' Martin said. ``I
just go out there and play, hoping we can get a win. I think we're
getting' there, but we've got to do it for 48 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sense of Closs: &UR; !off! &LR;  In searching for the positives from an
0-8 team, we introduce backup center Keith Closs. The 7-foot-3
southpaw has been cleaning up during garbage time.
</P>
<P>
   Translating his 10-minute totals into an average of 30 minutes
per game, Closs would be averaging 24 points, 12 rebounds and 12
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Clippers also would have to find a way to force
the opposition to play its second unit for 30 minutes.

GRAMMY SHOW, A THROWBACK, CAN STILL DRAW A BIG AUDIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Mo., Texas)  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Grammy Awards are music to Madison Avenue's ears
_ and not because there's a category honoring the best jingle of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other reasons why advertisers and agencies
have become ardent fans of the awards ceremony. The presentation of
the 41st annual Grammys, administered by the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, is scheduled for broadcast Wednesday
night from 8 to 11 p.m. by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers are paying an average of $450,000 to $500,000 for each
30 seconds of commercial time during the show. Among the sponsors
are blue-chip brands like Bayer, Chevrolet, Compaq, Fidelity,
Intel, Kellogg, Mastercard, Sony and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for the Grammys' appeal is that the show is
one of the few remaining television programs that can still draw
large audiences _ and high ratings _ in an era of increased viewer
fragmentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for big, prime-time events such as the Grammys and the
Academy Awards,'' Bill Ludwig, vice chairman and chief creative
officer at Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell-Ewald, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is
the longtime agency for the Chevrolet division of the General
Motors Corp. Chevrolet, a principal Grammys sponsor since 1990, has
bought seven 30-second commercial slots during the broadcast to
promote models like the Cavalier and Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a 60-second brand image commercial that
revives, in a contemporary manner, the famous jingle ``See the
U.S.A. in your Chevrolet,'' associated with singer Dinah Shore. The
upbeat tune, originally written for the metropolitan New York Chevy
dealers, gained national exposure on her popular weekly variety
show from 1951 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The new commercial offers a Chevrolet version of 20th-century
American history, from Betty Boop and the Hula-Hoop to Woodstock
and the World Wide Web. As images of celebrities like Charlie
Chaplin, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Muhammad Ali appear on
screen, viewers will hear Shawn Colvin _ who won two of the biggest
Grammys last year, for song and record, with ``Sunny Came Home'' _
sing a slower, more soulful version of the ``See the U.S.A.''
jingle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It taps into a musical equity, if you will, from Chevrolet's
past,'' said Jim Jandacek, director for advertising and sales
promotion for Chevrolet passenger cars at the Chevrolet division in
Detroit. ``That makes it even more appropriate to debut this spot
on the Grammys.''
</P>
<P>
   That remark brings up another reason for advertising during the
Grammys: to be associated with music and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is a big part of the culture of our target audience,''
said Larry Flanagan, vice president for U.S. advertising at
Mastercard International in Purchase, N.Y. ``And we like to use
`big programming' like the Grammys and the Super Bowl to showcase
new creative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mastercard commercial features a song called ``E.V.A.'' by
the producer of electronic dance music known as Fatboy Slim. The
spot is part of a campaign carrying the theme ``Priceless'' by
McCann-Erickson New York, part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide
Advertising unit of McCann-Erickson World Group, which is owned by
Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   Another commercial, for the Advantage brand of flea control
products sold by the Bayer Corp., features a fanciful musical
motif. The spot, by Bernstein-Rein Advertising in Kansas City, Mo.,
uses special effects to make it seem as if pet cats and dogs are
recording a version of the pop tune ``Rockin' Robin''; the lyrics
are rewritten to praise Advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial will start a promotion for Advantage centered on
a search for the ``best singing pet'' in North America.
</P>
<P>
   One big advertiser, the Kellogg Co., is joining forces with
another imaginary musician, this time a human. Christopher Guest,
who played the hapless rocker Nigel Tufnel in the comic cult film
``This is Spinal Tap,'' is the director of new commercials for
Kellogg's Frosted Flakes created by the Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago.
Two of the spots, centered on a obsessive supermarket stock boy,
are to run during the show.
</P>
<P>
   Guest ``has brought a quirky sense of humor to the ads, which we
think will appeal to the hip, younger Grammy audience,'' said Karen
Kafer, communications director for the Kellogg USA unit of Kellogg
in Battle Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Those characteristics of the audience appealed to a first-time
Grammys advertiser, the Compaq Computer Corp., which will introduce
the initial commercial in a television brand campaign created by
the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group in New York. The
commercial includes such unconventional images as people with
tattoos and an AIDS patient asking ``How are we going to beat this
disease?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The psyche of the Grammy audience seems like an appropriate
fit for our brand personality and essence,'' said Andrew Salzman,
vice president for worldwide advertising and brand strategy at
Compaq in Houston, who characterized Compaq as being ``a younger
company, a company of the Internet age.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers are not the only ones associated with the Grammy
Awards who are pleased with its youthful demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one project we have that's very young and we love
it,'' said Joseph Abruzzese, president for network sales at CBS, a
unit of the CBS Corp. in New York. ``It's one of the highlights of
our season.''
</P>
<P>
   Next on the calendar of television's biggest events: the Academy
Awards on March 21. ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Co., has sold
out commercial time at a record price for the Oscars, averaging $1
million for each 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, though, there will be a one-time big event: ABC's
broadcast of the Barbara Walters interview with Monica Lewinsky.
That program, planned for next Wednesday, is being scheduled as a
special two-hour presentation of the news magazine ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC has been selling a 30-second spot during the regular
hourlong ``20/20'' on Wednesday nights for an average price of
$160,000. The price being charged for the Walters-Lewinsky show:
$800,000.

RUTGERS' COMEBACK FALLS SHORT AGAINST GEORGETOWN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Geoff Billet and Rob Hodgson were able to
avoid the tears during a farewell ceremony before they took the
floor at the Rutgers Athletic Center for the last time. The two
seniors may have had a tougher time as the final buzzer sounded
Tuesday night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They had spearheaded a revitalization of the Scarlet Knights'
basketball program, guiding Rutgers to its first winning season in
seven years. They also guided Rutgers to the verge of the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But the dream slipped a little bit further from their reach
Tuesday night as the two were unable to cap the night with the sort
of heroics that would propel them into the tournament as Georgetown
scored a 57-53 victory over Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   After staging a furious comeback, Rutgers had an opportunity to
tie the game and put it in the hands of the two seniors who had
brought them this far. Billet hit a 12-footer at the buzzer against
Georgetown on March 5 last year in the opening round of the Big
East tournament, giving the Scarlet Knights a 61-60 victory and a
place in the national spotlight as his shot was replayed endlessly
on highlight shows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it was Hodgson who got the opportunity this time. Earl
Johnson dribbled down the clock with the two seniors frantically
trying to find an opening on each side. Johnson delivered the ball
to Hodgson, who got a good look from the left corner, but his shot
went in and then spun out with 3 seconds to play. Nat Burton of
Georgetown added a free throw to put the game out of reach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers entered the game having beaten Georgetown three straight
times since Kevin Bannon took over as coach. But this time, they
were facing not only the Hoyas' pressure defense but also the
self-imposed pressure that had reduced their NCAA hopes to a
make-or-break 40 minutes .
</P>
<P>
   A disappointing loss to Seton Hall on Sunday put the Scarlet
Knights into a must-win situation Tuesday night, with the only
remaining regular season game after this coming at Miami on
Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers remained stranded at 17 victories, its record dropping
to 17-10 overall and 9-8 in the Big East with its third straight
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 80 teams in Big East history with at least 18 victories,
74 have made the NCAA tournament. From the Big East, there are
three definites in Connecticut, Miami, and St. John's. Syracuse has
probably wrapped up a spot already, while Rutgers, Villanova and
Providence are still holding out hope. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Against the pressure of the Georgetown defense, the Scarlet
Knights struggled for every basket, or even to get the ball
inbounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by five points with 3 minutes 5 seconds to play,
Rutgers got back into the game with a 3-point field goal by
Johnson. On the play there was a foul inside, sending Rashod Kent,
a 47 percent free-throw shooter, to the line. He missed both, and
the Knights were unable to tie.
</P>
<P>
   But they got another chance when the Hoyas committed a 35-second
violation and Georgetown head coach Craig Esherick was called for a
technical foul, sending Billet, an 84 percent free-throw shooter,
to the line for two. He missed the first before hitting the second,
and the score was 51-50 with 2:29 remaining. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje gave the Hoyas a three-point lead on
a follow in the lane, freshman Dahntay Jones finally pulled Rutgers
even with a 3-point field goal with 1:15 to play. Burton hit a pair
from the line after being fouled on a drive to the basket, giving
Georgetown a two-point lead with 54.5 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After another Rutgers turnover with 29 seconds left, Anthony
Perry hit one of two from the line, and the lead was 56-53. Rutgers
called timeout and set up for one final opportunity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Hodgson couldn't hit the shot Rutgers needed.

   TAMPA, Fla. _ He took care of the same church, high school and
elementary school for 36 years, fixing the electrical wiring,
repairing faulty pipes and vacuuming the rugs around the altar. He
was a blue-collar worker, never taking a day off. He rarely sneaked
away to see Derek Jeter, his grandson, play for the Yankees in
person. Not when he had to wake up at 4:30 a.m. the next day.
</P>
<P>
   His name was William Connors, though everyone knew him as Sonny,
and he was as much of a fixture at Queen of Peace Church in North
Arlington, N.J., as the pews. If priests needed light bulbs for the
sacristy, they called Sonny. If nuns needed someone to paint their
living room, they called Sonny. He worked diligently as the head of
maintenance, a routine that his grandson observed as a boy and
emulated as a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never missed work, if he was sick or he had a bad day,''
Jeter said. ``He always seemed to go and work every day. I think
that's something I learned from him.''
</P>
<P>
   In answering questions about his dream life as the shortstop who
will make $5 million this season for a team that has snatched two
World Series championships in the last three years, Jeter admitted
that he has distressing days, too. One of them occurred on New
Year's Day when Sonny Connors died of a heart attack at 68. Many
lose elderly relatives, but Jeter's memories vividly showed that
even someone with a charmed existence has awful days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He touched a lot of people's lives,'' Jeter said. ``He wasn't
making millions of dollars, but he had just as much of an effect on
someone's life as any one of us in here.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 people attended Connors' funeral, and the high
school and elementary school were both closed as a tribute to him.
The people who flocked to the funeral were the same people who had
relied on Sonny to give their car a jump start, who sat near him at
Mass after he opened the church at 6:30 a.m., who knew him from St.
Michael's Church in Jersey City, N.J., where he also handled
maintenance for more than 14 years, and who saved articles for him
about his famous grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to joke that Derek was going to make more money in one
year than he made in a lifetime,'' said Msgr. Thomas Madden, the
pastor at Queen of Peace. ``He said he should have spent more time
playing ball as a kid. But he was so proud of Derek. The only thing
he used to pray for was that Derek wouldn't get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who was a pallbearer at the funeral, gazed at the
hundreds of mourners and realized that his special grandfather was
special to a legion of admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say you know who your friends were at your funeral,''
Jeter said. ``Have you ever heard that expression? A lot of people
showed up. A lot of people showed they cared, and a lot of people
showed that he affected their lives in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jeter was 10, his grandfather took him to work and showed
him how to mow the football field. Jeter recalled that the grass
was almost a foot high and he had a mower with a bag, so he had to
stop dozens of times and empty it. Once Jeter finished the job
hours later, Connors told him to start over because the grass had
grown back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worked with him again,'' said Jeter, a smile creasing
his face.
</P>
<P>
   Sharlee, Derek's younger sister, referred to her grandfather's
work ethic in a eulogy, saying: ``He was a very strict boss. That's
why Derek has no problems playing for George Steinbrenner.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone inside the church laughed at the remark. It was another
tribute to a man who spent half a century tending to two different
churches, a man who was a loving father to 14 children and who
taught his baseball-playing grandson about the pleasures of working
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a wonderful person,'' Madden said. ``It will be a long
time before we see the likes of Sonny again. I've seen the way
Derek carries himself, and in the long run, hopefully, he'll be the
man his grandfather was. If he is, he'll really be accomplishing
something in his life.''

NEW YORK CITY TO MAKE SUMMER SCHOOL MANDATORY FOR SOME STUDENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying he was ``drawing a line in the sand'' against
``low-performing kids in low-performing schools in low-performing
districts,'' Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said Tuesday that he
would make summer school mandatory this year for third, sixth and
eighth graders who do poorly on New York's citywide reading and
math tests and in their courses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which Crew is to announce at Wednesday's meeting
of the Board of Education. As many as several thousand students
will have to repeat a grade unless they complete a six-week
remedial course starting in July. It will be the city's broadest
use of mandatory summer school since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Crew's plan adds New York City to a growing list of school
districts around the nation that are turning summertime into just
another semester. As in many of those districts, the aim is to
prepare students for rising academic standards and the impending
end of ``social promotion,'' the policy of advancing students to
the next grade even if they have not mastered the material in the
previous one.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said the summer classes would be a step toward his
oft-stated goal of extending the school year for all students,
which he cannot do without the approval of the state Legislature.
Proposals in the last two years for such a change have gone nowhere
in the Legislature, in large part because of opposition from the
teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory summer school is a growing practice. The Council of
the Great City Schools, a Washington-based coalition of the 53
largest school districts in the country, said that 22 of its
members had such policies. About three-quarters of them adopted the
programs in the last three years, said Michael Casserly, the
executive director of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said that next month schools would begin sending letters to
parents of low-performing students warning them that they may be
held back if they do not go to summer school. The aim is not just
to warn parents but to frighten students into shaping up, said Bill
Casey, the administrator who oversees the summer school program.
``It's almost like tough love,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many details remain to be worked out, including the precise
criteria that would lead to summer school and promotion to the next
grade. But school officials said Tuesday that placement would be
based mainly on students' performance on this spring's citywide
reading and math exams (not the statewide reading tests given last
month), as well as course work and the recommendations of teachers
and principals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For now, the officials said, mandatory summer school would be
reserved for the very lowest-performing students, and the summer
classes would be more rigorous than those now offered.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education has set aside about $70 million for the
summer programs, about the same as last year for voluntary summer
school, but children who are required to go will be given priority.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 of New York's 1.1 million public school students
now take summer programs, which have been growing in popularity.
But since the early 1980s, when a mandatory program started by
Chancellor Frank J. Macchiarola was gradually abandoned, summer
classes have been almost entirely voluntary.

U.S. INDICTS HUSBAND OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Albert J. Pirro, an influential real estate
lawyer and the husband of Westchester County District Attorney
Jeanine Pirro, was indicted Tuesday on federal charges of hiding
more than $1 million in income by improperly deducting home
furnishings, baby-sitters, family vacations and luxurious cars _
including his wife's Mercedes-Benz _ as business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro, 51, had been the subject of earlier federal
investigations, but the disclosure in the 66-count tax fraud
indictment that several of the improper deductions benefited his
wife raises questions about her political future.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pirro, 47, had been mentioned as a possible candidate for
the U.S. Senate, a prospect that has had the blessing of top
Republicans in the state, including Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, the Pirros appeared side by side in his law
office and, in brief statements, angrily told a news conference
that they were confident that he would be found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an invasive and hostile process for my husband
and for my family,'' an anxious Mrs. Pirro said, placed in the
unusual role of championing a criminal defendant. ``I am convinced
of my husband's innocence and confident that he will be
exonerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bracken, a personal spokesman for Mrs. Pirro, appeared
to make a point later of putting a firm wall of separation between
the district attorney and her husband, saying Mrs. Pirro ``was not
involved in the professional and business activities of Pirro and
she had no personal knowledge of the matters under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the indictment announced by U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White,
detailed many benefits to the Pirro family, including limousine
services, clothes, artwork and the salary for a domestic servant.
And it seemed to suggest that Mrs. Pirro did little to question how
her husband was managing the family's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said that from 1988 through 1997 Pirro routinely
declared lavish personal purchases as the expenses of his law firm,
real estate firm or other closely held companies. The salary of his
family's domestic servant was paid for by a Pirro firm, while a
$3,700 awning for the family's marble-clad Italianate mansion in
Harrison, N.Y., was assigned to another Pirro firm.
</P>
<P>
   Other family expenses assigned to his business or not declared
on his joint personal tax returns included: a $123,000 Ferrari
sports car; a leased Mercedes-Benz for his mother-in-law; and
$10,000 worth of furnishings for a vacation home in West Palm
Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said that Pirro even charged to his law practice
the legal bills for a paternity suit in which Pirro was named by an
Indiana woman as the father of her 15-year-old girl. DNA tests last
year subsequently confirmed his paternity.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on all charges, Pirro faces a maximum of five years
in jail on a conspiracy count, five years in jail on each of four
tax evasion counts, and three years in jail on each of 28 false tax
return counts.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro's tax returns were prepared by his brother, Anthony G.
Pirro, 43, an accountant who was indicted on the same tax fraud
charges and was also charged with witness tampering and accused of
trying to manipulate the grand jury testimony of an unidentified
vendor.

UCLA POINT GUARD PONDERS JUMP TO NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From Pac-10 standings to NCAA Tournament seedings,
UCLA will have plenty at stake Saturday when it plays
Washington. &UR;  &LR; But looming over the proceedings like a raised gavel _
with UCLA's future underneath _ is a simple question with a
complicated answer:
</P>
<P>
   Is it Baron Davis' last home game?
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a sophomore, is considering a jump to the NBA, and he's
playing like someone with a higher calling than Syracuse,
Washington or the NCAA Tournament. He has averaged 22.8 points in
his past five games and has directed the Bruins with an unwavering
determination. Next month, he'll become UCLA's latest All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Although Davis and his sister, Lissa Hodoh, insist they've made
no decision _ ``We've thought about it, but we haven't talked about
it,'' Hodoh said _ NBA executives have no doubt about Davis' plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was done a long time ago,'' said a Western Conference
personnel director who requested anonymity. ``There are 29 teams in
the league assuming he's coming out. He's in everyone's draft
projections.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's high in those projections _ perhaps a top-five pick,
certainly a top-10 selection.
</P>
<P>
   According to several NBA talent evaluators, Davis will be the
second guard taken behind Maryland junior Steve Francis and ahead
of the nation's best seniors, Utah's Andre Miller and Arizona's
Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
   NBA scouts love Davis' athleticism and his size. He's nearly
6-foot-3, he weighs 205 pounds, and he's only 19. In addition,
Davis has regained the strength and flexibility in his surgically
repaired left knee, and he has developed a consistent jumper. The
NBA sees a point guard who can both run a team and create his own
offense _ a mix from which all-stars are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The substantive questions that existed after his freshman year
_ his knee and his ability to shoot the ball _ have been erased,''
said Mark Warkentien, the Portland Trail Blazers' assistant general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are aware of Davis' potential _ pending? _ departure
and have scanned L.A. high schools for senior guards. They
recruited Compton's Tito Maddox until his poor academic standing
intervened, and they are watching Verbum Dei's Marlon Parmer
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're monitoring the progress of several players,'' UCLA coach
Steve Lavin said. ``But the staff believes Baron's coming back. In
all of our conversations, he has worked under the presumption that
he'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis will discuss his future with Hodoh and his grandmother,
Lela Nicholson, after the season. Several factors figure to
dominate the discussions:
</P>
<P>
   __ Will he risk another college season on his reconstructed
knee? One bad landing could jeopardize his future and cost him
millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury has definitely changed my thinking and I'm sure it
has changed his,'' Hodoh said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Is Davis emotionally ready to leave his friends behind and
treat basketball as a business? There are no Earl Watsons to laugh
and cry with in the NBA, which has 82-game seasons, trades and
grueling road trips. Is he prepared to live in Detroit or New
Jersey with no friends and family in sight?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love college,'' he said. ``I'd be missing out on the best
years of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is about whether I want to pursue my dream,'' he
continued. ``I think about the NBA all the time, watching games on
TV and reading the papers. It's something I think about every day,
that I'm closer to the dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has always had the talent, but when he arrived in the fall
of 1997 _ fresh from the Blazergate controversy and a brilliant
high school career at Santa Monica Crossroads _ his game was
untamed.
</P>
<P>
   He was often out of control, taking bad shots, forcing passes,
and committing fouls. The presence of seniors Toby Bailey, Kris
Johnson and J.R. Henderson stymied his leadership instincts.
</P>
<P>
   But his career took a dramatic turn March 15 when he landed
wrong against Michigan and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in
his right knee. During a nine-month rehabilitation, he fought his
body and his mind _ and tested his physical therapist's patience.
</P>
<P>
   Davis returned Dec. 2 and slowly regained conditioning and
rhythm. He dunked against Loyola Marymount (Dec. 29) and was in
fabulous form against Arizona a few days later. He made
game-winning shots against Oregon and USC, scored 50 points in the
Bay Area, and, aside from a ragged performance against Syracuse,
has shown patience and control: 32 assists and 13 turnovers this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so good it's unbelievable,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said.
``Put him on any team in the Pac-10 and you have a contender. The
difference this year is, he's smarter. It's like he has gained 10
years in age. It's like a guy who has gone from 19 years old to 29
years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has been on his best behavior since a postgame outburst at
Washington drew a public reprimand from the Pac-10. He has become
the dominant locker-room voice, challenging teammates after an
18-point loss at Cal. He is usually the last one off the practice
floor, often shooting jumpers alone while his teammates laugh and
play one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Davis has emerged as UCLA's best player and most
demanding leader since Ed O'Bannon carried the Bruins to the 1995
NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came back (from the knee injury), I was just
trying to fit in,'' Davis said. ``I've gradually assumed a
leadership role. I'm trying to be more of a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   His cerebral approach extends to opponents. Davis no longer
watches games, he studies them. He has always been able to recite
lineups, standings and statistics from across the nation. Now, he
examines a player's style and applies it to his own game.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible, Davis studies Arizona's Terry, Maryland's
Francis, North Carolina's Ed Cota and Connecticut's Khalid El-Amin.
From Stanford's Art Lee, he has learned patience and timing. From
Utah's Miller, he has learned defense, rebounding and the
importance of all-around play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, for every big game I'd come in real hyped and
emotional,'' Davis said. ``This year, I'm thinking more. I've
become more of a student. I watch these guys to scout them but also
to pick stuff up.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis then described his style as a mix of Francis' athleticism
and Miller's versatility. As his sophomore season concludes _ and
with it, perhaps his UCLA career _ the NBA seems to agree.

UPDATING THE TOWER WOOLWORTH BUILT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For rent: one cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   After 85 years under the same ownership, the glistening Gothic
stalagmite known as the Woolworth Building was sold two months ago
for $126.5 million by the Venator Group, formerly the Woolworth
Corp., which is keeping its headquarters in the 54-story tower but
shrinking to four floors from eight.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the new owners _ the Witkoff Group, Rubin Schron and
other investors _ with the challenge of leasing a tower clad in
medieval frosting to tenants obsessed with the latest technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The Woolworth Building, soaring over City Hall Park, is very
much a public icon, the ``cathedral of commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   And the new owners are discovering that a cathedral designed by
Cass Gilbert comes with a lot of extras.
</P>
<P>
   There is a marble-bordered swimming pool, an office stuffed with
gilt-edged relics of Frank W. Woolworth's reign, a subterranean
storeroom called the bone yard, where hundreds of Gothic ornaments
are stockpiled in case they are needed as replacements on the
exterior. There is a boiler room so titanic it once provided steam
to Con Edison.
</P>
<P>
   But under the copper finials and flying buttresses at the
tiara-like spire are plenty of nooks for telecommunications
equipment. And the mechanical shafts, or ``risers,'' running
through the building are large enough to accommodate new wiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genius of Cass Gilbert is that he leaves behind a lot of
room for us to address the needs of the 21st century,'' said George
M. Stone, senior managing director of the Witkoff Group.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, any work on the lobby or the exterior would be subject
to approval by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The
renovation architects are Beyer Blinder Belle, whose projects
include Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center. Interior
design is by the Switzer Group.
</P>
<P>
   Witkoff plans to spend about $30 million on the electrical,
mechanical and communications systems in the building, as well as a
cleaning of the terra cotta exterior and the marble- and
mosaic-filled lobby.
</P>
<P>
   To insure a sense of continuity, Witkoff has licensed the name
``Woolworth Building'' from Venator. The corporation once occupied
25 floors but pulled back as it changed its name and nature,
closing its five-and-ten stores to concentrate on footwear and
sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the space in the 932,000-square-foot building will
become available this year. Among prospective tenants are music and
film companies, advertising agencies and Internet operators, most
them from mid-Manhattan, said Bradley P. Gerla, managing director
of Insignia/ESG, the leasing agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are companies that have never really looked downtown,''
Gerla said. ``I think Woolworth offers that intrigue.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Woolworth Building was high-tech from the start.
Its lights were switched on by a telegraph signal from President
Woodrow Wilson in the White House on April 24, 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Built without a mortgage, the 792-foot-1-inch skyscraper at 233
Broadway, between Barclay Street and Park Place, was the tallest
building in the world until it was eclipsed in 1929 by 40 Wall
Street and the Chrysler Building.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 cents, visitors could ascend by express elevator to the
54th floor and board a shuttle elevator worthy of a Jules Verne
fantasy _ encased in a cylindrical glass shaft and encircled by a
spiral stairway _ which pierced the gloomy space inside the
pyramidal summit.
</P>
<P>
   At top was an octagonal outdoor deck, 65 feet around, so loftily
isolated from Manhattan's clamor that the loudest noise was the
wind. The deck has been closed almost 50 years and the elevator no
longer works, but both still exist.
</P>
<P>
   So does the 15-by-55-foot basement swimming pool. Although it is
not in use, it could be filled again. ``Nobody's going to come here
because there's a pool,'' Stone said. ``But if they do come, it's
an amenity they won't get at One Chase Manhattan Plaza or the World
Trade Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Incongruously set in Venator's sleekly modern 24th-floor suite
is Frank Woolworth's office, paneled in green marble, now a lounge
for company executives. It was copied from Napoleon's palace at
Compiegne and was originally adorned with a portrait of the
emperor, later replaced by one of Woolworth himself.
</P>
<P>
   The portraits are in storage, as is Woolworth's claw-footed
chair and his desk, a massive battleship of mahogany, leather and
bronze with a hidden four-button console: ``Sten,'' ``Sec,''
``Elev'' and ``Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolworth's presence is inescapable _ in the W's that ornament
the elevator grilles and doorknob plates and in the gargoyle
greeting visitors to the lobby, a nickel clutched in its hand. As
if the founder were still alive, Ernest A. Conrad of Landmark
Facilities Group, the building systems engineers, refers to him
simply as ``F.W.'' And everyone understands.

EX-OFFICER IS CONVICTED IN RACIALLY TINGED BEATING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ A Suffolk County jury convicted a former New
York City police officer Tuesday of aiding in the bludgeoning of a
young Long Island man in a racially tinged brawl outside a
Westhampton Beach nightclub three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Constantine Chronis, 37, of Hicksville, appeared
stunned as the jury forewoman announced that he had been found
guilty of assault with depraved indifference, official misconduct
and menacing.
</P>
<P>
   The case stemmed from the near-fatal beating of Shane Daniels,
23, of Riverhead, during a fight outside the Marakesh nightclub
early on the morning of May 26, 1996. The jury found Chronis not
guilty of intentional assault.
</P>
<P>
   Chronis had been free on a $200,000 bond that was secured, in
part, by property owned by his relatives. But Judge Joel L.
Lefkowitz increased the bond to $250,000 in cash after the
conviction and ordered that Chronis be taken to jail to await
sentencing on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   The judge granted a motion by a defense lawyer that Chronis be
held in protective custody at the jail. Chronis faces a sentence of
7{ to 15 years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution said Chronis, a former narcotics detective,
pulled his service revolver to hold back a group of Daniels'
friends while a co-defendant in the case, Austin Offen, beat
Daniels as he shouted racial slurs and epithets. Daniels is black
and Chronis and Offen are white. About three months after the
incident, in August 1996, Chronis resigned from the Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Offen, 28, of Queens, pleaded guilty on Jan. 6 to assaulting
Daniels with a metal bar used for locking automobile steering
wheels. He was sentenced Feb. 4 to 10 years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels was in the courtroom for Tuesday's verdict, and he told
reporters afterward that he was relieved that the nearly three-year
ordeal had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over, but it's taken a heavy toll on everyone,''
he said as he left the courtroom with his fiancee, Jen Costa, and
their 20-month-old son, Desmond.
</P>
<P>
   Chronis' brother, Peter, and mother, Helen Chronis, left without
commenting. Like the Daniels family, they had been in court for
much of the seven-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   When Daniels testified as the final prosecution witness last
week, he told the jury that he had no memory of the attack but that
his injuries would be with him the rest of his life. As a result of
the beating, he said, he had a permanent tube embedded under his
skin to drain fluid from his brain, and his peripheral vision was
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Trial evidence showed that Daniels' blood splattered on the
defendant's shoes, and the prosecutor, Stephen L. O'Brien, said the
blood proved that Chronis was nearby when Daniels was beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Chronis' lawyer, Stephen A. Grossman, argued that many of the
people who saw the brawl could have had traces of blood on their
shoes. He denied that Chronis had taken part in the beating. He
said that Chronis was himself a victim during the brawl, that he
had been cut over the right eye and that he was acting in
self-defense.

HE WON'T DANCE, DON'T ASK HIM 
NO TEARS IN HIS BEER

   The scene: The New York State Theater at Lincoln Center in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The event: A benefit for the School of American Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   The players: Dancers and reluctant dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Robinson, a partner in Highland Asset Management, was
sitting on the sidelines on Monday night when the dancing began.
Asked if he was going to join in, he said, ``Not until I go back to
Miss Quimby's Dance School in New Canaan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hadn't paid close attention to Miss Quimby when he
was her student. But his wife, Elizabeth Stribling, the real estate
executive, said, ``He's a great dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson suggested that she had metal caps on her dancing shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Another husband proved to be a great dancer. Peter Martins, the
chairman of faculty at the School of American Ballet (where his son
was a student) and the ballet master in chief of the New York City
Ballet, danced a few graceful rounds with his wife, ballerina Darci
Kistler, who was wearing high-heeled mules. Martins said she could
dance in those because ``she's a pro.''
</P>
<P>
   To the appreciation of several other women, Martins spread the
talent around. One of his partners, Coco Kopelman, once a student
at the ballet school and a member of its board, said: ``It was
amazing. He made me feel like I weigh 10 pounds.'' (She doesn't
weigh much more than that anyway).
</P>
<P>
   Epilogue: Michael Bloomberg, the financial information
publisher, received the corporate leadership award. The dinner
raised $600,000.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No Tears In His Beer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the booziest of bar fantasies: write 50 words
about one of your favorite things _ beer _ to win the deed to
another of your favorite things _ a pub _ in one of your favorite
places on earth to drink beer in a pub _ Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   It probably helps if your name is something like Trevor
O'Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, O'Driscoll, now 23, won the contest that is kind of
like Lotto for Irish bar patrons in the United States: the Guinness
``Win Your Own Pub in Ireland'' contest, sponsored by the beer
maker, which each year buys a pub that is up for sale somewhere in
Ireland and then gives it to the contestant who writes the best
essay about why it would be nice to own such a pub.
</P>
<P>
   (The 1999 contest is accepting entries until March 31. The entry
forms are usually available at _ you guessed it _ places where
Guinness is sold.)
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the other winners over the last five years who
decided to sell their prize _ the pubs are generally worth several
hundred thousand dollars _ O'Driscoll, a legal assistant at the law
firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, left his job last
summer to go run his.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction from everybody I knew was like, `Of course that's
what he's going to do,''' said O'Driscoll, who grew up in
Philadelphia and graduated from Brown University. ``I knew I didn't
want to go to law school.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of O'Driscoll's friends dropped what they were doing _
graduate school and a consulting job _ to join him.
</P>
<P>
   And they have made their new home above Finucane's (pronounced
Fih-NU-kins), the cozy pub O'Driscoll won in Listowel, a tiny
village in County Kerry near the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, there was plenty of competition for drinkers
in Listowel: it has 3,000 people and 45 pubs. But O'Driscoll says
he is doing fine. The townspeople like him, and he learned a lot
about running a pub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been on the other side plenty of times, but I never been
behind the bar,'' he said by phone from Listowel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added: ``At the end of the day, it's really not rocket
science. You just have to make sure you have enough beer, and then
you sell the beer.''

HOWARD BOATWRIGHT, VIOLINIST, COMPOSER AND PROFESSOR, 80
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Conn., Texas, Calif. Fla., Mass.)   (nk) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Howard Boatwright, a prolific composer who was also a concert
violinist, a musicologist and the author of a widely used music
theory textbook, died on Saturday at Crouse Memorial Hospital in
Syracuse, N.Y. He was 80 and lived in Fayetteville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said John Harvith, a spokesman for
Syracuse University, where Boatwright was the dean of the music
school from 1964 to 1971, before becoming a professor of
composition and theory at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Boatwright's works were often rigorously chromatic, but by
adhering to traditional classical structures and by using rugged
harmonies to support arching, shapely themes, he invariably created
pieces with an appealing clarity, directness and emotional
resonance. Recordings of several of his works, most notably the
vital String Quartet No. 2 (1975), have been released by CRI
Records, and the label recently reissued them on a CD compilation
(CRI 775).
</P>
<P>
   He published about 100 works, including a Symphony (1976),
Variations for Small Orchestra (1949), a Serenade for Strings and
Winds (1952), a Clarinet Sonata (1980), about 20 choral works and
50 songs.
</P>
<P>
   He intended to become a violinist not a composer but began
writing music in 1941 as a way to court Helen Strassburger, a
soprano. They married in 1943 and performed and recorded new music,
standard repertory and early music together for many years. The
first songs he wrote for his wife were not performed until
November, when she sang them in a recital in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Boatwright was born in Newport News, Va., and began studying the
violin when he was 10. He worked with a single teacher, Israel
Feldman, until 1942, when Boatwright played a New York debut
recital at Town Hall. The next year, he joined the faculty of the
University of Texas in Austin, and in 1946 he went to Yale
University to study composition with Paul Hindemith.
</P>
<P>
   After Boatwright completed his master's degree, Hindemith
recommended him for a faculty position at Yale, which he held until
1964. Boatwright also conducted the Yale Symphony, was
concertmaster of the New Haven Symphony Orchestra and first
violinist of the Yale String Quartet. As a member of Hindemith's
Collegium Musicum, he took up early instruments for performances of
Baroque works, and as the director of music at St. Thomas Church in
New Haven he presented programs of Baroque rarities.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left Yale to become dean of the Syracuse
University School of Music in 1964, Boatwright had published his
``Introduction to the Theory of Music'' (1956) and two books on
Indian music, ``Indian Classical Music and the Western Listener''
and ``A Handbook on Staff Notation for Indian Music,'' that he
wrote after a year in Bombay as a Fulbright lecturer. His most
recent book was the 1994 ``Chromaticism: Theory and Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Syracuse Boatwright transformed the music school, making it
an important center of composition and new-music performance by
presenting festivals and establishing an electronic music studio.
He also introduced non-Western music to the curriculum and expanded
its early-music programs by acquiring collections of antique
instruments. From 1969 to 1988, when he stopped teaching, he also
directed a summer music program in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Alice Karth
Boatwright of San Francisco; two sons, Howard 3d, of Fayetteville,
N.Y., and David Alexander, of Northampton, Mass., and a brother,
Paul Mabry Boatwright, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

<P>
   It is just as well that American author Elinor Burkett is
neither fainthearted nor afraid of flak (``I thrive on it
actually'') because it seems that she has started a civil war in
the U.S. workplace with a book she hasn't even finished writing
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Procreation Privilege'' _ a working title _ will give a voice
to what she sees as the last minority group in America: the
childless working woman.
</P>
<P>
   According to Burkett, women who choose not to have children are
increasingly furious about tax and time concessions being given to
those who do.
</P>
<P>
   Childless workers, she says, feel discriminated against like
never before: punished for their lack of parental status in terms
of both policy and perception.
</P>
<P>
   Her theories began during the Clinton/Dole campaign of 1996.
Both political parties were pitching at the so-called ``mythic
soccer mom'' and pushing family-friendly policies to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they said the word `family,' at first I thought they
meant me. I'm a member of a family,'' she says. ``But `family'
turned out to be a euphemism for `parent,' which I'm not because I
don't want to be. Then I started to wonder about stuff like why
parents get tax breaks that aren't income-sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, my brother-in-law earns $145,000 a year and yet
he still gets $3,000 in tax breaks because he's a parent. Even he
admits he doesn't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The more research she did, the more convinced she was that she
had a case. American couples with children, she discovered, are
allowed up to 12 days of extra holiday a year, as well as parents'
evenings and sports days.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want to offend the people they worked with, but
single people were starting to feel like second-class citizens in
much the same way that working mothers felt relegated by their male
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But when Burkett wrote a piece about the subject for the New
York Times, there was outrage. ``They freaked when they read it and
wouldn't print it,'' she says. ```Atlantic Monthly' magazine didn't
believe my findings and just about every other publication I write
for _ except `Mirabella' magazine _ got hostile. That's when I knew
there was a book in it.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the book proposal was strong too. ``I received a fax
from one publisher saying it was the most selfish thing he had ever
read. I asked the assistant to my literary agent what she thought
of it. She said that I came across as a Nazi bitch. Me. I've been a
feminist all my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Betty Friedan for a comment and she screamed at me,
at the top of her lungs, that she didn't believe this sort of bad
feeling existed in the workplace. I told her that my job was merely
to report what was going on and she hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that I'm not causing women to turn against each
other; it's policy that's doing that.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During research, Burkett interviewed many childless women in the
workplace. She wasn't short of anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   There was the copy editor at the New York Times who was forced
to work every Christmas because she had no family ties.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the female construction worker in Baltimore who
did all the early-morning and late-evening shifts because the men
she worked with were fathers.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the shift worker who, when she requested to work
days, was told it would never happen because ``we give first choice
to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just women. ``A guy I interviewed in New York is
thinking of suing his company because, out of a team of three, he
always does all the foreign travel and extra hours because the
other two are mothers,'' she says. ``Flexitime isn't available to
the childless in the way that it is to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   All this, Burkett points out, is at a time when more women than
ever before are choosing to be childless.
</P>
<P>
   While she knows that parents have to be able to work she ``wants
to frame things in a different way; from the point of view of the
childless worker.'' In her view, people are being punished for
their lifestyle choice while others are given ``every break going''
for theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction in Britain to Burkett's arguments has been as outraged
as in America. Marcelle D'Argy Smith, editor of ``Woman's
Journal,'' actively chose not to have children but says she is
``absolutely furious'' with Burkett's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last thing we need, and I think that the childless
women who say that they are unhappy about working mothers are the
ones that really want children themselves _ they're bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know mothers work very hard indeed and yes, it is unfair,
but you have to cover for them sometimes _ I've covered maternity
leave three times for pregnant women. They're continuing the human
race, for God's sake, so you have to do it. I'm thrilled not to
have children but I know someone's got to and we have to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Natasha Walter agrees: ``Children are not just the
responsibility of the individual, they are a collective
responsibility for society as a whole. And anyway, this support
doesn't go on forever; children are only young for a very few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a work colleague being frowned upon when he took
two weeks' paternity leave. I find that pathetic, as if it's
``bunking off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., the argument has begun to move on. Democrats are
suggesting that companies exchange maternity and paternity leave
for ``benefits accounts,'' so all employees can take time off.
</P>
<P>
   Those who start a family can spend time with the new baby, while
the childless have the opportunity to fulfil some other kind of
ambition, like going travelling. It's an idea with which Natasha
Walter agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very unhappy about the idea of a fight between
childless women and working mothers,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said, I think our aim should be for more flexibility in
the workplace for everyone, including the childless who may want
the opportunity to go off and be educated or do voluntary work. But
at the moment we're right to prioritize the needs of parents.'' &QL;

   During research, Burkett interviewed many childless women in the
workplace. She wasn't short of anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   There was the copy editor at the New York Times who was forced
to work every Christmas because she had no family ties.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the female construction worker in Baltimore who
did all the early-morning and late-evening shifts because the men
she worked with were fathers.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the shift worker who, when she requested to work
days, was told it would never happen because ``we give first choice
to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just women. ``A guy I interviewed in New York is
thinking of suing his company because, out of a team of three, he
always does all the foreign travel and extra hours because the
other two are mothers,'' she says. ``Flexitime isn't available to
the childless in the way that it is to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   All this, Burkett points out, is at a time when more women than
ever before are choosing to be childless.
</P>
<P>
   While she knows that parents have to be able to work she ``wants
to frame things in a different way; from the point of view of the
childless worker.'' In her view, people are being punished for
their lifestyle choice while others are given ``every break going''
for theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction in Britain to Burkett's arguments has been as outraged
as in America. Marcelle D'Argy Smith, editor of ``Woman's
Journal,'' actively chose not to have children but says she is
``absolutely furious'' with Burkett's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last thing we need, and I think that the childless
women who say that they are unhappy about working mothers are the
ones that really want children themselves _ they're bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know mothers work very hard indeed and yes, it is unfair,
but you have to cover for them sometimes _ I've covered maternity
leave three times for pregnant women. They're continuing the human
race, for God's sake, so you have to do it. I'm thrilled not to
have children but I know someone's got to and we have to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Natasha Walter agrees: ``Children are not just the
responsibility of the individual, they are a collective
responsibility for society as a whole. And anyway, this support
doesn't go on forever; children are only young for a very few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a work colleague being frowned upon when he took
two weeks' paternity leave. I find that pathetic, as if it's
``bunking off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., the argument has begun to move on. Democrats are
suggesting that companies exchange maternity and paternity leave
for ``benefits accounts,'' so all employees can take time off.
</P>
<P>
   Those who start a family can spend time with the new baby, while
the childless have the opportunity to fulfil some other kind of
ambition, like going travelling. It's an idea with which Natasha
Walter agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very unhappy about the idea of a fight between
childless women and working mothers,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said, I think our aim should be for more flexibility in
the workplace for everyone, including the childless who may want
the opportunity to go off and be educated or do voluntary work. But
at the moment we're right to prioritize the needs of parents.'' &QL;

<P>
   It is just as well that American author Elinor Burkett is
neither fainthearted nor afraid of flak (``I thrive on it
actually'') because it seems that she has started a civil war in
the U.S. workplace with a book she hasn't even finished writing
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Procreation Privilege'' _ a working title _ will give a voice
to what she sees as the last minority group in America: the
childless working woman.
</P>
<P>
   According to Burkett, women who choose not to have children are
increasingly furious about tax and time concessions being given to
those who do.
</P>
<P>
   Childless workers, she says, feel discriminated against like
never before: punished for their lack of parental status in terms
of both policy and perception.
</P>
<P>
   Her theories began during the Clinton/Dole campaign of 1996.
Both political parties were pitching at the so-called ``mythic
soccer mom'' and pushing family-friendly policies to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they said the word `family,' at first I thought they
meant me. I'm a member of a family,'' she says. ``But `family'
turned out to be a euphemism for `parent,' which I'm not because I
don't want to be. Then I started to wonder about stuff like why
parents get tax breaks that aren't income-sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, my brother-in-law earns $145,000 a year and yet
he still gets $3,000 in tax breaks because he's a parent. Even he
admits he doesn't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The more research she did, the more convinced she was that she
had a case. American couples with children, she discovered, are
allowed up to 12 days of extra holiday a year, as well as parents'
evenings and sports days.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want to offend the people they worked with, but
single people were starting to feel like second-class citizens in
much the same way that working mothers felt relegated by their male
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But when Burkett wrote a piece about the subject for the New
York Times, there was outrage. ``They freaked when they read it and
wouldn't print it,'' she says. ```Atlantic Monthly' magazine didn't
believe my findings and just about every other publication I write
for _ except `Mirabella' magazine _ got hostile. That's when I knew
there was a book in it.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the book proposal was strong too. ``I received a fax
from one publisher saying it was the most selfish thing he had ever
read. I asked the assistant to my literary agent what she thought
of it. She said that I came across as a Nazi bitch. Me. I've been a
feminist all my life.

   WASHINGTON _ Americans who travel abroad have become wearily
accustomed to accusations that they are responsible for ``dumbing
down culture,'' otherwise known as the Disneyfication of _ well _
pretty much everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Small matter that one of the fiercest rearguard actions against
colonization by Disney was fought not on the poppy-strewn fields of
the Ile de France but on the (real) battlefields of Manassas,
outside Washington, D.C. _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   Small matter, too, that Euro-Disney, known as Disneyland Paris,
is now a commercial success and that Disney's profits at its U.S.
sites have taken a (shallow) dip.
</P>
<P>
   Most astonishing of all, perhaps, might be the discovery that if
you are looking for sophistication in food and drink, you stand a
better chance of finding it these days in the themed restaurants of
a Disney park than in most American cities, with the possible
exceptions of Manhattan, San Francisco and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Even San Francisco, though, has its limits, exemplified in the
decision of the renowned Chinese chef and gourmet, Kenneth Hom, to
hang up his toque and head to France.
</P>
<P>
   Hom's departure should have been shocking to any American fan of
Chinese food. First, because _ despite being lionized in Europe _
he is actually an American-Chinese born and bred.
</P>
<P>
   Second, because world-ranking chefs _ if they travel _ tend to
go to the vast American market, not away from it.
</P>
<P>
   And third, because he left with a degree of disillusionment,
shaking the crumbs of what he regarded as bastardized
Chinese-American food from his shoes as he went.
</P>
<P>
   Hom's complaint could be summed up as the dumbing down of
America's tastebuds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't appreciate Chinese food,'' he said recently.
``The perception is that Chinese food is cheap grub.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the scale, he says that when Americans buy
themselves a wok and set out to prepare Chinese food, they wanted
nothing less than a banquet _ and exhausted themselves in the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   His last book published in the U.S. was based on
simple-to-prepare family food using accessible ingredients. But he
still could not crack the American market.
</P>
<P>
   A recent random survey of ethnic cooking confirmed much of what
Hom said. Americans will eat anything and everything, so long as it
tastes and looks passably familiar.
</P>
<P>
   And for all their embrace of ``lite'' this and ``healthy'' that,
if it's not big and beefy, it is unlikely to pass muster. Foreign
food is very quickly submerged into the mainstream of American food
and loses much of its character.
</P>
<P>
   While no news at all to the ranks of first-generation immigrants
or frequent travellers, such observations often shock
restaurant-going Americans, who are under the impression that veal
parmigiana, spaghetti with meatballs, and other American culinary
delights are genuine imports rather than mutants catering to the
convention that any self-respecting dish must have meat and
vegetables and bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Such meals, if well prepared, may have merits _ just as Chicago
pizza pie has merits _ but they bear no resemblance to anything on
a menu in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate and most frequently encountered mutant is ``French
dressing,'' which comes thick, heavy, creamy, stuffed with
preservatives and _ like every American salad dressing in a bottle
_ completely dominates what it is supposed to complement.
</P>
<P>
   But salads were not Hom's chief complaint. His was a spice and
texture problem. On the one hand, Chinese food was seen as
``cheap,'' on the other hand, when a particular restaurant becomes
fashionable, Americans will pay whatever it takes, ordering off the
top of the menu without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   But if the food does not then taste vaguely familiar, they will
complain it is inedible. That means easy on the spices, heavy on
the portions, and let the customer mix and match the ``sides''
(trumping the chef and letting one hundred flavors fight).
</P>
<P>
   That Americans could be shocked to find out that their favorite
``ethnic'' dishes are not genuine may, in fact, be a small sign of
change.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the past year, quite ``ordinary'' restaurants will
produce a tray of olive oil and vinegar if you ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are publishing letters from returning American
tourists expressing amazement that what they ate ``over there''
tasted nothing like its counterpart ``over here.'' And classes have
been started in New York where ``grandmas'' are recruited to teach
second and third generations in preparing the food of their
homeland, lest the art _ and the tastes _ be lost.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the grannies to have an effect, though, you
could do worse than to order a hamburger. Its ambitions are few and
it tastes as it should. Just hold the French dressing. &QL;

<P>
   Maybe money can't buy you love, but perhaps it can buy you
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The shop-till-you-drop, ``retail therapy'' culture may have
become more dominant in the last few years, particularly in the
U.S. and U.K., which have seen seven or eight years of solid
consumer growth. But are we really any happier for it?
</P>
<P>
   One person who thinks we are not is Robert Frank, a U.S.
economics professor whose new book, ``Luxury Fever,'' has been
causing a bit of a stir in the States.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that we live in an age of ``profound waste.'' The
very rich spend their money on Cartier watches, Lexus sports cars,
Prada trousers and, at the top of the range, Gulfstream jets. Yet
they are still dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The world's industrial moguls are dreaming up yet more
sophisticated objects for the new super-rich to buy (I heard the
other day from a Gulfstream executive that they are looking at a
supersonic executive jet that will fly faster than Concorde), to
the general detriment of Western societies as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is nothing new in this. A hundred years ago the
economist Thorstein Veblen drew attention to the ``conspicuous
consumption'' of the rich, and the social damage it caused.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in the Sixties, the British economic journalist
Fred Hirsch identified ``positional goods'' _ goods by their nature
rare, such as Impressionist paintings, or a Queen Anne house _ and
worried about the way in which the rich bid up the prices for them
and so add to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the burst of consumerism in the U.S., which has
pushed the saving rate into negative territory, gives a new bite to
these well-rehearsed concerns, which is probably why Professor
Frank's book has attracted such attention.
</P>
<P>
   His solution, insofar as there is one, falls into two parts.
First, we should all try to focus attention more on ``inconspicuous
consumption,'' spending time with family and friends, going for
walks in the country, being free from traffic congestion, and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he believes public policy could help to shift this
balance by scrapping income tax and imposing a progressive
consumption tax on families: the more they spent in any one year,
the higher the tax rate would be. If additional money were raised,
it could be used to fund government investment in public goods.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to buy the whole thesis to feel that there is
something a touch distasteful about excesses of consumption. Not
many of us would like to see a family consumption tax, particularly
if it were used to fund public projects such as the Millennium
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, most of us would accept that, despite the enormous
rise in living standards of most people in developed countries over
the last 40 years, people are not much happier as a result.
</P>
<P>
   This common-sense judgement is supported by academic evidence.
Economists now study happiness, trying to measure how happy people
are and what makes them happier.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for shopaholics, it seems that ``retail therapy'' is not
particularly effective. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may have some slight effect: Warwick University's Andrew
Oswald, a leading authority on the economics of happiness, found
that between 1970 and 1990 there was a slight relationship between
wealth and happiness. But it seems that it is really only at the
very bottom of the income scale that the amount of money people
have influences how happy they are.
</P>
<P>
   Relative wealth, how rich people are compared with the people
around about them, seems to matter more than absolute wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of many people to this will be to say: ``Hold on a
moment, how do they know whether people are happy or not?'' In fact
it is possible to make some measurements, partly by asking people
whether they feel happy, but also by measuring things such as
stress levels.
</P>
<P>
   You can also look at suicide and attempted suicide rates _
apparently attempted suicide is much more common than is generally
appreciated _ and make some judgements from that.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we know about happiness? One of Professor Oswald's
latest findings is that in relative terms the young are becoming
happier, which is great for the (relatively youthful) readers of
this newspaper. Not so good news is the finding that all other
groups are becoming less happy.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployed tend to be unhappy, which is a powerful moral
argument not just for encouraging general economic growth, but also
for encouraging people into jobs where possible.
</P>
<P>
   And _ a particularly troubling finding _ it seems that black
people are less happy than white people.
</P>
<P>
   Any pointers to policy? If relative wealth were more important
than absolute wealth, you might imagine that societies that are
more egalitarian are happier than those that are not. But in fact
that does not seem to be the case, either here in the U.K. or
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Thus international studies suggest that Japanese people are not
particularly happy, despite the small income differentials there,
while Brazilians are relatively happy despite their very large
differentials. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So is there nothing that governments can do to make their
citizens happier? Well, there is one very interesting study about
to come out, by Professor Bruno Frey, of Zurich University.
</P>
<P>
   He has found that the more democracy there is _ and remember
that Switzerland is strong on that _ the happier people become. We
cannot do anything about our age or our race, but if we become
happier the more democratic control we feel we have, then that is
something to hang on to.
</P>
<P>
   Given that any individual's control over the level of democracy
is minimal, and given that spending money does not seem to bring
more happiness, what should we all do to make ourselves happier?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago David Lykken, a psychologist at the
University of Minnesota, wrote a book called ``Happiness,'' in
which he studied a large group of identical twins who had been
separated at birth.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he concluded that happiness was genetically
determined: people were either born happy or not. ``Trying to be
happier is as futile as trying to be taller.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to a recent article in ``The New Yorker,'' he
thinks he was wrong. People still have set points of happiness,
but, he believes, they can lift their level of happiness above
those points by learning some new habits, such as keeping busy,
taking regular exercise and, apparently, getting married.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what his advice would be for people who are already
frantically busy, who go to the gym three times a week, who have
been married for years, and despite all that are still profoundly
miserable.
</P>
<P>
   However, put together his view that people can lift their
happiness and the evidence that young people are becoming happier,
and there may be a clue. We cannot, of course, become any younger,
but we can perhaps think younger.
</P>
<P>
   That, plus just a little bit of retail therapy, a few drinks, a
few parties... doesn't it sound more fun? &QL;

EDITORIAL: AN OSCAR PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking thing about the decision to give Elia
Kazan an honorary Academy Award at this year's ceremony is the fact
that it was made unanimously. The 39-member board of the Motion
Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences approved the choice of Kazan
``with enthusiasm,'' according to one board member, and without
debate. If so, it is the first time Kazan has failed to provoke
debate since early 1952, when he twice appeared before the House
Un-American Activities Committee, informed against eight friends,
and took out an ad in The Times to explain, with rather incomplete
logic, the reasons for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the news of Kazan's upcoming Oscar, a subdued
protest _ the omission of applause _ has been organized by former
blacklisted writers and their families and friends. The protest is
certainly merited, but so is the award, for Kazan's truly
distinguished work as the director of films like ``A Streetcar
Named Desire'' and ``On the Waterfront.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academy has done what it has not always been able to do _
distinguish clearly between the merit of an artist's work and the
merit of his behavior or convictions. Meanwhile, the protesters
will make the necessary if implicit point that Kazan remains
accountable for a decision he made not as a film maker but as a
human being.

EDITORIAL: AMERICA'S AMAZING ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 24:
</P>
<P>
   These are astounding economic times. Overseas, Europe is
slowing, most of Asia is in recession and Brazil threatens to drag
down much of South America. But in the United States, consumers are
spending with abandon and economists continue to be surprised by
how robust the economy is.
</P>
<P>
   It was against that background that Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, testified before the Senate Banking
Committee on Tuesday. He again predicted that the economy would
slow this year, and again warned that stock prices appeared to be
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street may hang on every word from Greenspan, but most
Americans seem quite unconcerned. They continue to buy stocks,
pushing prices higher and allowing them to feel and act richer. As
Greenspan noted, the net worth of households is up about 50 percent
since 1994, and personal consumption expenditures rose more last
year than at any time since the mid-1980s. The Conference Board
reports that Americans think current conditions are better than at
any time since the board began its consumer confidence surveys in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists, including Greenspan, have been overly
pessimistic about the American economy for several years, and
consumers seem to have decided to believe their own eyes rather
than heed the warnings of fallible forecasters. In retrospect, it
appears that growth was enhanced by technological change and aided
by plunging commodity prices that reflected weakness abroad.
Economists also underestimated the degree to which soaring stock
prices would encourage spending, and the Fed's lowering of interest
rates late last year, as it feared a weakness that did not
materialize, only moved stock prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly enjoyable to see things constantly come out
better than expected. But it is also slightly unnerving to realize
that the experts are so confused. ``We are, in a sense, learning as
we are doing,'' Greenspan said on Tuesday. ``There is no Economics
101 which carries us through what's going on today. We're probably
writing the textbooks, but we don't have them to read yet.''

   Video-games prop open a door in kids' brains, creating an
opening through which knowledge can march with almost no
resistance. Game-playing children absorb enormous amounts of
information and develop outlandishly high skill levels.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, virtually none of what they learn has any value
beyond the joystick and glowing screen.
</P>
<P>
   But medical researchers are also exploiting the magical power of
video games to convey useful information.
</P>
<P>
   Recent findings provide compelling evidence that the right games
can train kids with diabetes and asthma to keep their conditions
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Stanford University Medical Center worked with
about 60 kids, aged 8 to 16, suffering from diabetes. The children
were given a video game to take home.
</P>
<P>
   Some got an ordinary game, such as ``Tetris''; the other half
took home a specially designed game, called ``Packy &AMP; Marlon,'' in
which two elephants try to survive on an outing by collecting food
in a simulated environment _ all the while remembering to check
their blood glucose and administer insulin to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Over the study's six-month period, the kids who
played ``Packy &AMP; Marlon'' needed 77 percent fewer urgent-care
visits to a doctor or emergency room than the kids who played the
placebo game.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers told kids in both groups to play their games as
much or as little as they wanted. The study reports that the
children spent about the same amount of time playing ``Packy &AMP;
Marlon'' _ about 1.5 hours a week _ as the control group devoted to
the noninstructional game.
</P>
<P>
   Another game from the same company that makes ``Packy &AMP; Marlon''
_ Mountain View, Calif.-based Click Health _ teaches asthma
sufferers the basics of how to keep breathing well.
</P>
<P>
   Year-long trials of ``Bronky the Bronchiasaurus'' are under way
with 200 asthmatic kids _ half in Oakland and half in rural
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bronky,'' players have to maneuver a dinosaur hero through
a standard-looking video-game-style world, picking up treasures and
stomping on enemies as the screen scrolls horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple-choice questions pop up on the screen, interrupting the
action by quizzing the player on tactics for avoiding asthma
``triggers'' and on the proper technique for measuring one's own
``peak flow.''
</P>
<P>
   After a wrong answer, the game directs the player to find Hazel,
a character who will reteach basic asthma-care techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Next up from Click Health will be an electronic pet, similar to
the wildly popular Tamagotchi, that will help teach kids with
cystic fibrosis how to keep their often fragile bones in the best
possible working condition.
</P>
<P>
   Another game could aid children with sickle-cell anemia, says
Click Health's founding chairman and CEO Alan Miller, who
previously founded two successful video-game companies, Activision
and Accolade.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of video games in teaching real-life skills to
children cuts both ways, says one new-media researcher. ``People
are always asking about the negative effects of video-game
violence,'' says Georgia Tech professor Amy Bruckman.
</P>
<P>
   Showing that Click Health's games can change kids' behavior for
the better also accentuates the concern that violent games are
equally effective at imparting their less benign lessons, Bruckman
says. &QL;

<P>
   Anyone who has recently kept a bedside vigil in a hospital's
intensive-care unit (ICU) is likely to have been impressed by just
how much information is now gathered on a critically ill patient.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated monitors surround the bed, the electronic screens
spewing out a torrent of data.
</P>
<P>
   That information can be vital, particularly for those near
death. But it also poses a critical challenge for today's hurried
nurses and physicians: how to make sense of all that data.
</P>
<P>
   To help out, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania
Medical Center are testing a ``smart'' ICU technology that collects
and analyzes a patient's vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial-intelligence system produces a 3-D graph that
could make it easier for a clinician to quickly pick up any warning
signs.
</P>
<P>
   The smart ICU uses adapted off-the-shelf software for neural
networks and fuzzy logic that allows it to analyze several
measurements simultaneously, looking for dangerous trends; it can
also ``learn'' the patterns of a patient, including their ideal
vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not intended to replace a physician,'' says C. William
Hanson, section chief of anesthesia/critical care at the medical
center and developer of the technology. ``It's intended to act as
an intelligent assistant that's vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients in the ICU, says Hanson, are ``monitored for everything
we can monitor electronically, and there's very sophisticated
minute-by-minute information'' on everything from respiratory rates
to blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   But actual analysis of the data ``is, in reality, totally
unsophisticated,'' says Hanson. ``There's hidden information in a
lot of that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   By uncovering that information, the smart ICU will, if it works,
flag dangerous conditions soon after they develop.
</P>
<P>
   For example, says Hanson, blood accumulating around the heart
can be a serious problem for some patients, but it's often not
noticed until the individual's blood pressure significantly falls.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are early warning signs, including a series of
interrelated, predicting signals, such as a drop in blood pressure
and an increase in heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   While a ``really good clinician'' would likely notice those
indicators, says Hanson, that ``presupposes that there's a really
good, experienced clinician _ and that they're at the bedside.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary real-life tests of the system are under way. Hanson
notes that the medical center's ICU is already installing a PC at
every bedside that will collect information from the monitors and
act as an electronic spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world of information technology, that's a fairly
trivial thing to do,'' says Hanson. ``There are a lot more
interesting things the PCs can do. There's still a lot of
smartening up that can go on in the ICU.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's busy hospitals, a more intelligent ICU can only be a
good idea. &QL;

MAN TESTIFIES HE WAS BEATEN BY A TOP OFFICIAL IN CORRECTION
OFFICERS' UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mentally retarded man testified Tuesday that guards
at the Nassau County Jail held him while a top official of the
correction officers' union repeatedly beat his head and body with a
pot or a pan in a 1993 attack which left him with broken ribs and
spinal fractures.
</P>
<P>
   The former inmate, Thomas F. Donovan Jr., 39, is suing the union
leader, Salvatore Gemelli, the county and its jail on charges of
violating his civil rights, and is seeking $100 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, Donovan said
that Gemelli assaulted him twice shortly after he arrived at the
jail _ once from behind a desk, with a pot or pan apparently
borrowed from a pantry used by guards, and again a short time later
in a room where inmates are given orange jump suits to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, who has an IQ of 58 and the emotions of a third grader,
appeared nervous as he took the stand, misspelling his first name
as he was sworn in. But he spoke cogently over three hours of
testimony about the beatings and their aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Though he contradicted himself about some details, he recalled
the precise days and dates of many key events in the criminal
investigation of his allegations, which did not lead to a
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan had been charged with child sexual abuse; he later
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony, before Judge Allyne R. Ross, came amid a widening
federal investigation into possible civil rights violations at the
Nassau jail, where many current and former inmates have described
beatings as an everyday occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry began after the Jan. 13 death of Thomas Pizzuto, 38,
whose family says he was beaten by guards and then left untreated
for days. His death, which was ruled a homicide, is being
investigated by the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the importance with which Donovan's case is being
viewed, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York,
Zachary W. Carter, listened to much of Donovan's testimony Tuesday
morning from a bench in the rear of the courtroom. Carter, whose
jurisdiction includes Long Island, declined to comment as he left.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are also interviewing witnesses in the
Donovan trial, according to lawyers close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned Tuesday by his lawyer, Stephen Civardi, Donovan
testified that after the first attack by Gemelli, he was assaulted
again by him and other guards a short time later in the jail's
clothing room. ``The beating started all over again,'' he said.
``They punched me. They kicked me. I fell to the floor. They held
my arms down. I screamed and cried. Then the beating stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said that later that day, he told no one in the jail
that guards had attacked him, and no one asked where he got his
bruises _ not even a jail house doctor who drew blood and took his
blood pressure in a routine examination.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when another doctor had him remove his shirt,
revealing welts as large as 10 inches across, Donovan said he told
the doctor he had fallen at home.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan testified that he believed the correction officers would
retaliate if he told the truth to anyone while in jail. ``I was
scared for my life _ that they were going to kill me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by Gemelli's lawyer, Chris P. Termini,
Donovan admitted giving another conflicting explanation of his
injuries when he was interviewed more than a week later by officers
in Garden City. He told the officers that he had been beaten by
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   His conversation with the officers, during which neither his
parents nor his lawyer was present, was secretly recorded. The tape
is expected to be played later in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you scared of them?'' Termini asked, referring to the
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Donovan replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you surprised to learn that there was a tape recording of
that conversation?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Civardi, Donovan believed at the time that he was
about to be sent back to the Nassau jail, on the original charge of
child sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Termini asserted that Donovan was actually beaten by inmates
while walking up a staircase unsupervised by guards. But Donovan
denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Gemelli, a past president of the correction officers' union who
is now its vice president, is expected to testify Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At a symposium at the Boston University (BU) Photonics Center
last fall, the attendees broke for coffee as usual. But something
was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of professors munching cookies and chatting about the
latest research, men in suits stood facing blank walls, whispering
into cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   They are high-powered investors, but they're not from Silicon
Valley _ they're from the research center's ninth floor.
</P>
<P>
   Better toss out the old stereotypes about academia and get with
the latest rage _ ivory tower goes venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding to spin off more technologies, boost local economies,
and just plain make money, many research institutions and
universities are creating their own venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital has traditionally been the domain of private,
deep-pocketed investors hoping to earn a windfall, often by picking
off promising university research. Most of the action has centered
around big-name schools, such as MIT and Stanford University,
located near East Coast and West Coast hubs of venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   But now an increasing number of universities around the country
want their piece of the pie _ and are willing to do what it takes
to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example is BU's Photonics Venture Partners. The fund
is privately managed, but the university is both an investor and a
manager _ one of the firm's three generals partners is Donald
Fraser, also the Photonics Center's director.
</P>
<P>
   Working cheek-by-jowl with BU researchers studying blue lasers
and quantum communication, the venture capitalists plan to leverage
the center's technical acumen to invest in the rapidly growing
field of photonics.
</P>
<P>
   No two of the university funds turned up by a ``Technology
Review'' survey are exactly alike. Some are wholly-owned
subsidiaries, others are independent firms awarded preferential
rights to an institution's technology.
</P>
<P>
   They also have varying aims. At BU, the strategy is to invest in
any photonics company likely to return a profit.
</P>
<P>
   At Vanderbilt University, on the other hand, administrators have
christened a $10 million fund that will invest in companies built
around the school's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Steranka, Vanderbilt's director of technology licensing,
says the main reason for the do-it-yourself funds ``is that many
promising university inventions are simply too early-stage and too
risky to interest mainstream venture capitalists.''
</P>
<P>
   But based on a study of schools that have previously tried
venture funds, Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard Business School,
thinks university administrators often have unrealistic
expectations for financial success.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner thinks they also underestimate the challenge of combining
the quick-to-move venture culture with rule-bound academia. ``It's
very hard to marry these organizational forms,'' says Lerner. &QL;

   At a symposium at the Boston University (BU) Photonics Center
last fall, the attendees broke for coffee as usual. But something
was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of professors munching cookies and chatting about the
latest research, men in suits stood facing blank walls, whispering
into cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   They are high-powered investors, but they're not from Silicon
Valley _ they're from the research center's ninth floor.
</P>
<P>
   Better toss out the old stereotypes about academia and get with
the latest rage _ ivory tower goes venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding to spin off more technologies, boost local economies,
and just plain make money, many research institutions and
universities are creating their own venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital has traditionally been the domain of private,
deep-pocketed investors hoping to earn a windfall, often by picking
off promising university research. Most of the action has centered
around big-name schools, such as MIT and Stanford University,
located near East Coast and West Coast hubs of venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   But now an increasing number of universities around the country
want their piece of the pie _ and are willing to do what it takes
to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example is BU's Photonics Venture Partners. The fund
is privately managed, but the university is both an investor and a
manager _ one of the firm's three generals partners is Donald
Fraser, also the Photonics Center's director.
</P>
<P>
   Working cheek-by-jowl with BU researchers studying blue lasers
and quantum communication, the venture capitalists plan to leverage
the center's technical acumen to invest in the rapidly growing
field of photonics.
</P>
<P>
   No two of the university funds turned up by a ``Technology
Review'' survey are exactly alike. Some are wholly-owned
subsidiaries, others are independent firms awarded preferential
rights to an institution's technology.
</P>
<P>
   They also have varying aims. At BU, the strategy is to invest in
any photonics company likely to return a profit.
</P>
<P>
   At Vanderbilt University, on the other hand, administrators have
christened a $10 million fund that will invest in companies built
around the school's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Steranka, Vanderbilt's director of technology licensing,
says the main reason for the do-it-yourself funds ``is that many
promising university inventions are simply too early-stage and too
risky to interest mainstream venture capitalists.''
</P>
<P>
   But based on a study of schools that have previously tried
venture funds, Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard Business School,
thinks university administrators often have unrealistic
expectations for financial success.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner thinks they also underestimate the challenge of combining
the quick-to-move venture culture with rule-bound academia. ``It's
very hard to marry these organizational forms,'' says Lerner. &QL;

DEEJAY'S MISSION: BRING COUNTRY TO THE CITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (nk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a woman whose career _ at least sort of _ is
talking, Laura Cantrell apologizes a lot when she's doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' she said last Saturday afternoon, over a bowl of
beans, ``you can totally just cut me off anytime you want.'' And
later: ``Well this is turning out to be a really long story.'' And
later: ``Am I droning on or what?''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is there are thousands of radio listeners in the New
York area who plan their Saturdays around listening to Ms. Cantrell
do just that (she actually drones very little) and hearing her play
the beaten-up records she carries in the back of her beaten-up
Crown Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   She has the sort of easy Tennessee accent that seems to keep
your coffee warm. Her decidedly uncatchy signature line _ ``Well,
there you have it, folks'' _ has become a lazy weekend mantra for
her fans. And over the last six years, her noon-to-3-p.m. show,
``The Radio Thrift Shop'' on WFMU, the famously eclectic New Jersey
radio station, has made her one of the city's best-known deejays
among music lovers with a country-and-western bent.
</P>
<P>
   After a show last Saturday, Ms. Cantrell, 31, packed up her
records and repaired to the Flamingo diner just down the street
from WFMU in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   There, she explained exactly how it was that a daughter of two
successful Nashville lawyers _ her father sits on the Tennessee
state Court of Appeals _ ended up with an English degree from
Columbia University and parlayed it into a professional performance
life that has never earned her a dime. (The deejays on WFMU, 91.1
FM, are all volunteers. Ms. Cantrell pays the bills by working as
an administrative assistant at a Wall Street brokerage.)
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are very proud of me being up here and that I love
what I do,'' she said. ``But they're still sort of scratching their
heads, like, `What does she do in New York again?'''
</P>
<P>
   She described herself as a ``closet country fan'' while growing
up. But she really fell in love with it when she was 17 and found a
summer job as a tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame.
Waiting to hand out tickets, she stood near a jukebox that oozed
history: honky-tonk stars like Webb Pierce and Lefty Frizzell, and
female stars she had never really listened to before, like Kitty
Wells and Loretta Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cantrell moved to New York in 1985, and found her way to
Columbia's campus station, WKCR, 89.9 FM, where she revived a
country show called, appropriately enough, ``The Tennessee
Border.'' During four years at Columbia, it felt almost as if she
were attending two schools, she said. ``Here I was toting around
the most giant Riverside Shakespeare ever and I had two Hank
Williams records in my bag.''
</P>
<P>
   But after college came the quandary: how to do what she loved
and somehow get paid. She worked briefly (``I hung on until the
12th month just so I could say I was there a year'') at the ABC
Radio Network, cracking the whip at affiliate stations to make sure
they played commercials at the right times. Then she tried out
unsuccessfully for a job with Garrison Keillor when he broadcast
from New York in the early 1990s. Without a hint of bitterness, she
says now: ``I think I really was hung up on the idea: `Hey,
shouldn't I get paid for doing this?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When you eventually abandon that idea,'' she adds, laughing,
``it's very liberating.''
</P>
<P>
   At WFMU, she volunteered for more than a year before she got her
own show, and she continues to spend most of her free time pitching
in, as do all the deejays. ``I clean the bathrooms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (Two years ago, she also found time to get married. Her husband,
Jeremy Tepper, is one of New York's foremost jukebox experts and
runs a small record label based in Brooklyn. They live in
Williamsburg.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cantrell's rambling, relaxed show is eclectic by any
commercial radio standards. Last Saturday the playlist ranged from
Les Paul to Spade Cooley to Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   But at WFMU, the country's longest-running free-form station,
one with shows named ``Vortex of Chaos'' and ``Inflatable Squirrel
Carcass,'' Ms. Cantrell could be considered almost prim.
</P>
<P>
   She is well aware that many New Yorkers probably see country
music fans as pretty close to the parody in the movie ``The Blues
Brothers.'' (Dan Aykroyd: ``What kind of music do you usually have
here?'' Bartender: ``Oh, we got both kinds. We got country, and
western.'')
</P>
<P>
   And so she has made it her mission to unearth the strange but
numerous connections between country and other genres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live for things like saying, `OK, here was where Jimmie
Rodgers and Louis Armstrong were playing on the same record,''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also tries to show New Yorkers that early country music
caught on just as easily in tenements as in shotgun shacks.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s and 40s, in fact, there were several popular
country music radio shows in the New York area. One old California
vaudevillian, Zeke Manners, whom Ms. Cantrell still interviews on
air from time to time, had a long-running country-folk music show
in the city beginning in the 1930s and also had a popular quartet
here called Pappy, Zeke, Ezra and Elton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this totally weird hillbilly thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And then added before forging ahead into yet more hillbilly
weirdness, ``Oh geez, I know I'm really going on, but ... ''
