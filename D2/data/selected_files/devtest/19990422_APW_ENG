<HEADLINE> Library Becomes Field of Lost Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Atop one desk sat a calculus book, its  
pages propped wide by a half-finished sheet of homework problems. 
Upon another, an open history textbook displayed a Civil War 
picture. Near the entrance, a computer ran Windows 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosaic items all, emblems of the type of quiet so familiar to  
school libraries -- but unsettlingly ordinary amid the silence that 
followed the terror and death imposed upon the Columbine High 
School library. 
</P>
<P>
	That was what greeted Dr. Chris Colwell when he walked through  
the double doors of the second-floor library Tuesday afternoon. He 
entered a field of carnage unthinkable even for the trained eyes of 
an emergency-room physician. 
</P>
<P>
	Before him: 12 young men and women, all dead, a scene so  
disturbing that one SWAT team member likened it to ``something from 
Dante's `Inferno.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``You walk in there with that hope that there might be somebody  
who's still alive and still salvageable,'' Colwell, the associate 
medical director of the paramedic division at Denver Health Medical 
Center, said Wednesday. ``It didn't take long to see that wasn't 
the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A library is typically one of a high school's more popular  
refuges, a place to both learn and quickly forget the Dewey Decimal 
System, to socialize, to get told to shush -- and even, now and 
then, to study. Part of the background scenery of adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the gunmen chose the library, no one can say just yet.  
Perhaps they believed it would offer one-stop target shopping, 
which, sadly, it did; roughly 45 students were inside during lunch 
hour. Perhaps they were stalking adversaries they knew would be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	But choose it they did. And they died there, too. Dylan Klebold  
and Eric Harris fell alongside their victims, apparently of 
self-inflicted head wounds from two of the myriad guns that had 
just killed and wounded so many. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the students, authorities and witnesses say, were shot  
where they sat and fell alongside backpacks and friends. Others, 
farther away, retreated under desks and tables. Hiding, they could 
see only the gunmen's shoes and long trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these kids were (found) underneath things like they  
were hiding,'' said Jefferson County District Attorney Dave Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the kids still had a pencil in his hand,'' he told  
NBC's ``Today'' this morning. ``It's just something I wish I could 
erase from my memory but probably never will.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Students said Klebold and Harris strode through the library,  
asking people why they should let them live. One assailant 
expressed excitement after shooting a library patron and seeing his 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``They yelled, `This is revenge!''' said Brittany Bollerud, 16,  
a library survivor. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others died outside the library: a teacher in a closet and  
two students on the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors managed to flee the library, and as midday stretched  
into afternoon, the bodies lay in the library while police searched 
for pipe bombs made sure no other gunmen were lurking around the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until 4:30 p.m., when Colorado's afternoon sun shone  
through the broken windows of the west-facing library, that Colwell 
-- called in by authorities and accompanied by a SWAT team member -- 
was permitted to ascend the stairs, walk through the book-theft 
detector and examine the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, only broken glass indicated something amiss. To  
Colwell's left was the librarian's station, empty. Before him were 
computers (still on), four-person tables (undamaged) and shelves of 
books (unscathed) -- ``just like my high-school library,'' said 
Colwell, 33. 
</P>
<P>
	Then: a suburban battlefield. Windows shot out. Ammunition clips  
and homemade bombs on the floor. The smell of discharged weaponry 
in the air. Young bodies littering bloody floors, worse than 
anything Colwell had ever seen in movies or on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	And silence -- unremitting, unnatural, unwelcome silence.  
</P>
<P>
	Most bodies were spread out evenly, Colwell saw, though the  
suspects were lying away from the rest of the bodies, their ammo 
belts and guns alongside them. 
</P>
<P>
	He set to work and pronounced the 12 teen-agers dead at 4:45  
p.m. after making sure none was alive. Some bodies were badly 
damaged; others just appeared asleep. He realized quickly that an 
earlier arrival would have been irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	``If medical personnel had been standing on top of these  
victims, it wouldn't have made any difference,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finished, Colwell left for a decompression debriefing with  
counselors. Behind him, the 12 young men and women would lie in 
their library through the night until all bombs could be defused 
and the school deemed safe. At a nearby elementary school, their 
parents waited through the night for word that wouldn't come. 
</P>
<P>
	For Colwell, it hadn't been a good day to be the physician on  
duty. He went home, spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a beer, and I had a long hot shower. And I went to  
bed,'' the doctor said. ``I didn't sleep real well.''

<HEADLINE> Daunting Track Awaits Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- Steve Park, in only his second year  
racing in NASCAR's Winston Cup series, is still amazed by the 
transitions that the top stock car drivers must make from track to 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	After racing the past two weeks on half-mile ovals in Bristol,  
Tenn., and Martinsville, Va., this week the drivers face the high 
banks of 2.66-mile Talladega Superspeedway, the sport's longest, 
fastest and arguably most dangerous oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just spent two weekends on short tracks, beating, banging,  
routing and gouging each other, then they put us at Talladega where 
we need a drafting partner,'' Park said with a shake of his head. 
``So now I'm supposed to rely on a guy who I've been mad at for two 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park, who drives for Dale Earnhardt's team, may be joking, but  
only a little. 
</P>
<P>
	Talladega and Daytona, which is 2 1/2 miles around, are NASCAR's  
two fastest tracks. For more than a decade, the sanctioning body 
has required carburetor restrictor plates be used on Winston Cup 
cars at those two tracks to keep them under the 200-mph speeds that 
once were routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even with the plates in place -- cutting horsepower by  
restricting airflow to the carburetor -- Park, Earnhardt and their 
competition all run speed well into the 190s. 
</P>
<P>
	A corollary is that restrictor plates keep the engines pretty  
equal, meaning that most of the 43-car field at races like Sunday's 
DieHard 500 run bunched together, two-by-two and sometimes 
three-wide. 
</P>
<P>
	The result of that is at least one wild multi-car crash at just  
about every Talladega and Daytona race. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year in Talladega, it was Earnhardt and Bill Elliott who  
got caught up in the biggest, with Elliott getting singed by the 
flames from Earnhardt's upside-down Chevrolet as both slid down the 
long front straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restrictor plate races pose certain challenges for the  
driver,'' said Ken Schrader. ``You race flat-footed around the 
entire track, but you're always in a pack of cars. That's the first 
challenge because you have no room to slip up like you do on short 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You give the slightest tap at these tracks and you're going to  
cause a 20-car pileup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Jarrett, who won the Winston 500 in Talladega in October,  
said drivers can't afford to be tentative at Talladega. 
</P>
<P>
	``Call us crazy or whatever it may be, but that's not the  
mentality that we come back with. I don't think a driver who really 
has that competitive spirit inside of him is going to let that 
enter his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that guys come in here being tentative. I think  
what they'll do is go into the race realizing that if we all use a 
little bit more patience that this race is won in the last 50 
miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett says a driver can help another guy out, let him into a  
tight spot that may push you back a little, until the last 50 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``That isn't going to change the outcome of the race because you  
have plenty of time to make that up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice and qualifying get underway Friday for the Winston Cup  
drivers, several of whom will also take part Saturday in the second 
round of the International Race of Champions series.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Reminded of Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Even as they moved forward Thursday  
night, the Carolina Hurricanes were still reminded of their past. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes held the first-ever NHL playoff game in their new  
state, drawing a raucous sellout crowd of 11,059 to the Greensboro 
Coliseum -- including several fans from the franchise's old hometown 
of Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	As the puck dropped to start the game against Boston, the crowd  
of red, white and black-clad Hurricanes supporters was speckled 
with some fans wearing the green, blue and white of the Hartford 
Whalers. That group included Mike Garilli, who drove 11 hours from 
his home in Hartford, the city that the franchise left two years 
ago for North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had season tickets for many years,'' Garilli said, shaking  
his head. ``I'm glad to be here, but it's kind of sad, too. It's 
just not the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garilli got some sympathy from NHL commissioner Gary Bettman,  
who also was on hand to watch the franchise's first playoff game in 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Whalers' fans have to view this moment as  
bittersweet,'' Bettman said in an interview during the first 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bettman said he remains confident in the overall health of  
the franchise, which has been plagued by poor attendance in 
Greensboro for two seasons while the Hurricanes' new arena is being 
built in Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Carolinas are truly hockey country, just as is the rest of  
the Sun Belt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of the Hurricanes' support came Thursday night in the  
form of a nearly 200-car caravan of fans who made the 75-mile trip 
to see the game. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a trip that many people in Raleigh have been reluctant to  
make while they wait for the expected completion of the new arena 
this fall. And the fans in Greensboro have been hesitant to embrace 
a team that is only a temporary resident of their arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Compounding the matter has been the region's longtime allegiance  
to college basketball. A 55-foot-long trophy case in the Greensboro 
Coliseum's north concourse has 39 exhibits, all of them related to 
great moments in college basketball, including North Carolina 
State's triumph in the 1974 NCAA title game in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey is mentioned nowhere in the trophy case.  
</P>
<P>
	Out in the seating bowl, however, it was a different story. The  
fans spent much of the game standing and chanting, and they found 
some creative ways to express themselves. One woman tied a rope 
around a Teddy bear's neck, tethered it to the end of a hockey 
stick and adorned it with a sign that said, ``Bruins Must Die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman wasn't about to take sides, except on the issue of  
seeing the relocation of the Hurricanes succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew this would be a building process, but we knew this  
would work,'' he said. ``It just takes time.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Changes Live TV Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston TV stations have pledged in principle to  
run no live local pictures of SWAT teams, no live footage of 
escaping victims and no cell phone interviews of the sort seen and 
heard during the murderous attack at Colorado's Columbine High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary regulations, which were developed months ago,  
before Tuesday's massacre in Littleton, Colo., set coverage 
guidelines during local hostage situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven TV stations and several local radio broadcasters agreed to  
the pact, which pertains to events in Massachusetts, does not 
prohibit live coverage and carries no penalty if broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does it govern whether local stations air video feed coming  
in from outside the state, such as the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston police are still meeting with station managers to  
finalize the details. While police consider the guidelines to 
already be in place, some TV executives still consider them a work 
in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Littleton scene unfolded Tuesday, Boston's three major  
network affiliates -- ABC, CBS and NBC -- broke in and out of feeds 
from their parent networks and CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Berryhill, news director at the NBC affiliate, WHDH, said  
the station wasn't overly concerned about showing sensitive 
material because it wouldn't affect the crime scene thousands of 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the pact is to protect those involved in local  
hostage situations rather than to protect viewers from unfolding 
tragedies elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just about who wins the coverage. It's not about  
ratings and competition,'' Candy Altman, vice president and news 
director at Boston's WCVB-TV, an ABC affiliate, said Thursday. 
``It's about giving the public the information they really need to 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar pacts were made last year among broadcasters in  
Portland, Ore., and Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston agreement limits stations to one pool camera on the  
ground and one helicopter pool in any hostage incident deemed 
``critical'' by Boston, Brookline or Massachusetts State Police. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement began to take shape after a televised  
hostage-taking in Tampa last May. The suspect holed up in a gas 
station after fatally shooting three police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A reporter was talking about SWAT teams going in the back  
door, and you just wanted to go, `Oh, my God, she just got 
potentially five officers killed,''' said Sgt. Detective Margot 
Hill, the Boston police media director who helped develop the 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the pledge, police will give Boston stations  
better locations to set up pool cameras and more frequent updates. 
But sensitive footage cannot be shown until the situation has been 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Harper, a journalism professor at Ithaca College in  
New York and a former ABC bureau chief, said the problem with 
voluntary guidelines is that it's only a matter of time before 
somebody breaks them. 
</P>
<P>
	Patti Dennis, vice president of news at KUSA-TV, the NBC  
affiliate in Denver, said she held back from showing SWAT teams 
converging on Columbine High, fearful the killers might be watching 
television from within the building. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she felt the station erred in broadcasting a cell  
phone interview with a student trapped in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, the Sun-Times kept the Littleton killings off its  
front page for a second day Thursday, running the story inside on 
pages 2 through 6. The tabloid's editor, Nigel Wade, said 
front-page coverage might traumatize children and lead to copycat 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Society of Professional Journalists and the American Society  
of Newspaper Editors said Thursday it knows of no other newspapers 
deliberately leaving the story off Page 1.

<HEADLINE> Wells Returns to New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- David Wells has something to prove to his beloved  
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite trying to downplay his return to Yankee stadium by  
saying his start on Friday night isn't a big game, Wells' true 
feelings were apparent during a half hour press conference on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``George wanted Roger Clemens so bad that he had to give up  
three guys. Toronto made a good deal. I think he made a big 
mistake,'' Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquired by the Blue Jays in February, Wells, who became a  
favorite of Yankee fans for his perfect game and his love of Yankee 
lore, will face Orlando Hernandez on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to stay poised because it's going to be a very  
emotional and nerve wracking day,'' said Wells, whose childhood 
dream of playing for the Yankees was cut short. ``I loved New York 
and I wanted to play there. But I understand how things 
transpire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone, who consoled his depressed friend when he was  
traded, has spoken to Wells several times since then, including 
last Sunday. Cone said Wells has been talking about Friday's game 
since the day of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he went into (Toronto manager Jim) Fregosi's office  
before the season started and counted back from Friday night to 
make sure he would pitch here,'' Cone said. ``I know he wanted to 
pitch here Friday night, not Saturday or Sunday afternoon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells said Cone told him Clemens' was booed during a recent  
start at Yankee Stadium. But Wells, who is 3-0 with a 2.55 ERA, 
said he takes no pleasure in having a better start than Clemens. He 
also said it's a shame Clemens was booed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, who compares Toronto fans to the understated personality  
of John Olerud, now a New York Met, said he misses Yankee fans. He 
also said he misses New York's nightlife and his appearances on the 
David Letterman and Howard Stern shows. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he's eager to show his younger Toronto teammates  
how to prepare for a big game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these young guys see how I approach this start, hopefully  
it can rub off on them and allow them to see what its like to go 
into a huge situation,'' said Wells, who arrived in New York a day 
ahead of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells has already made dinner reservations.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get a good pasta dinner, reminisce with some  
friends and get prepared for the game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has Fregosi's blessing, so long as he arrives at the hotel  
before the team does at 2 A.M.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Makes $58B Bid For MediaOne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. offered $58 billion Thursday for  
MediaOne, the nation's fourth-largest cable-television company, 
hoping to thwart a merger agreement that Comcast Corp. and MediaOne 
reached two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said its rival bid, a combination of cash and stock,  
exceeded what Comcast promised to pay by 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	An AT&AMP;T deal would make the nation's largest telecommunications  
company also its No. 1 cable TV company. AT&AMP;T, which completed its 
acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. last month, has 12.5 
million cable subscribers. MediaOne has 5 million. Time Warner, 
currently the largest, has 12.6 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is in the market for cable-TV companies because it plans to  
use cables to deliver a combination of phone service, high-speed 
Internet access and interactive entertainment to millions of U.S. 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	While AT&AMP;T is the nation's largest long-distance company, it has  
stumbled using more conventional methods to break into the 
lucrative local phone market.

<HEADLINE> PepsiCo's 1Q Profit Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- PepsiCo Inc.'s profit fell 11.7 percent in the  
first quarter due to a charge for snack food plant closings, but 
its operating earnings climbed on strong revenue growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The company responsible for beverages like Pepsi, Mountain Dew  
and Tropicana juice and snacks like Tostitos and Lay's potato chips 
beat analysts' expectations with the operating results announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But after moving higher early in the day, PepsiCo's stock price  
reversed course, falling 5.1 percent, or by $2 a share, to $36.93 3/4 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts blamed the stock's setback on an unexpected disclosure  
in a midday conference call that PepsiCo planned to spend $70 
million to $75 million this year to make the information technology 
systems of its various operations compatible. 
</P>
<P>
	``They finally came through with the operating numbers and then  
this IT spending came along out of nowhere and we see a dramatic 
reversal,'' said Tim Swanson, who follows PepsiCo for A.G. Edwards 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Mike White also told analysts that he  
was comfortable with expectations of full year-earnings of $1.20 to 
$1.24 a share before the technology spending and other one-time 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Cohen, beverage analyst at Goldman Sachs, said the earnings  
comment also disappointed some analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purchase, N.Y.-based conglomerate reported net income of  
$333 million, or 22 cents a share, in the three months ended March 
20, down from $377 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Those results included a charge for the previously announced  
plans close three Frito-Lay plants that reduced net income by $40 
million, or 3 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the charge, its operating profit rose 11.9 percent to  
$660 million, or 25 cents a share, beating the 24 cents that 
analysts surveyed by First Call had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 17.5 percent to $5.11 billion from $4.35.  
</P>
<P>
	Roger Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive, said the  
double-digit growth in operating profit reflected marked 
improvements in all of its operating businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Frito-Lay North America's operating profit surged 12 percent on  
a 7 percent increase in sales. The international division's profits 
rose 3 percent on a 4 percent increase in sales, but would have 
done much better if economically troubled Brazil were excluded from 
the comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi-Cola North America's operating profit rose 4 percent on a  
4 percent increase in sales. International soft drink profits rose 
by $6 million to $16 million on a 3 percent sales increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Enrico said Tropicana, acquired last August, exceeded  
expectations despite crop shortages that reduced the supply of 
available fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo recently spun off a 60 percent interest in its bottling  
operations through an initial public offering.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Star Pippen Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen's struggles as a Houston Rockets  
player spilled off the court Thursday, when he was arrested in the 
wee hours on suspicion of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
	The star forward released a statement through his agent that  
denied the charge against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not intoxicated when arrested after the game last night  
and I'm confident the evidence will support me in the end,'' the 
statement read. Pippen added that he had no further comment and was 
turning the matter over to his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates supported Pippen during a brief practice before  
jetting to Los Angeles for a game with the Clippers on Friday. 
Pippen didn't attend the workout, but coach Rudy Tomjanovich said 
he would accompany the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it won't be a distraction,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We  
are trying not to make any assumptions. It would be unfair to 
comment when nothing has been established. I'm sort of used to 
unexpected things happening. You just try not to lose your 
composure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, currently fourth in the Western Conference, was beaten  
by the Dallas Mavericks 109-95 Wednesday night, keeping the Rockets 
from clinching a spot in the playoffs and snapping an 11-game 
losing streak to the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen had four points and three rebounds and was repeatedly  
beaten defensively in one of his worst games as a Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie is my teammate and I'm behind him 100 percent,''  
Charles Barkley said. ``This is not Armageddon. It happened. 
Scottie Pippen probably wasn't the only person stopped last night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie Pippen is a role model. If all the kids grew up to be  
like Scottie, the world would be a better place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley planned to offer serious support to his teammate but  
also said Pippen wouldn't get off lightly with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get on the plane and take the PA and say,  
`Attention Mr. Pippen, last call for alcohol,''' Barkley joked. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer who stopped Pippen around 1:30 a.m. said the Rockets  
star ran a red light. A member of the department's DWI task force 
was called after suspecting Pippen was intoxicated, said police 
spokesman Fred King. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 33, did poorly on the field sobriety test and was taken  
into custody, where he was videotaped and given the opportunity to 
take a Breathalyzer test, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	After he refused the Breathalyzer, Pippen was booked on  
suspicion of DWI and released on $500 bond just before 7 a.m. His 
arraignment is set for next Thursday before Harris County 
Court-at-Law Judge Sherman Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen has not formally hired a lawyer, but Houston lawyer Rusty  
Hardin said he is set to meet with Pippen next week after both men 
return from road trips. The Rockets go on to play at Phoenix on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He adamantly denies he was intoxicated,'' said Hardin, who  
spoke with Pippen after the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen has struggled to fit into the Rockets' alignment after  
earning seven NBA All-Star appearances and helping the Chicago 
Bulls win six NBA championships. He broke out with a season-high 31 
points on April 15 against Portland and had 22 points and 11 
rebounds in a victory over Seattle on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Pippen was traded from the Bulls, with whom he had  
spent his 11-year pro career, and signed a five-year, $67.2 million 
contract with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who has been slowed by back and hand injuries but hasn't  
missed a game, is averaging 14 points and six rebounds, both below 
his career averages. His six assists per game is slightly better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been my experience that a lot of times, something  
negative off the court brings you together and makes you stronger 
on the court,'' teammate Matt Bullard said.

<HEADLINE> Colorado H.S. Shooting Probe Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- With the bodies of the victims finally  
removed from Columbine High School, investigators tried to find out 
today whether the two outcasts who massacred their school mates had 
help before the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, while again searching the school today for hidden  
explosives, turned their attention to the community, interviewing 
acquaintances, classmates and relatives of the gunmen to find out 
why they did it -- and who else might have helped. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a large number of (explosive) devices and it wasn't  
done in a couple of hours,'' said District Attorney Dave Thomas. 
``It is possible other people were involved in constructing those 
devices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with sawed-off  
shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, pistol and homemade bombs stuffed 
with nails and shotgun shells, killed 12 students and one teacher 
Tuesday, Then they killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	They left behind such a pile of ammunition and explosives that  
authorities wondered whether they had help. ``That's a lot for two 
boys to carry,'' said Sheriff John Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was at least a conspiracy between two people. How much  
broader than that I do not know,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials today said Columbine will be closed  
indefinitely as damage is assessed. Other schools in the district 
reopened today, and officials said proms and graduations would go 
on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's prom took place earlier this month, and graduation  
is scheduled for early May, though officials did not say whether 
that would go on as scheduled. Students here will finish out the 
school year at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The removal of the victims' bodies more than a day after the  
shootings allowed investigators to begin cataloging evidence and 
turn their attention to other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tracing the weapons and individual purchases to  
determine how these young adults obtained these illegal weapons,'' 
Rich Marianos of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the bombs were made from materials that could  
have been bought at most hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno arrived in Denver on Wednesday  
to talk about how to avert the next school shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get the guns out of the hands of young people,''  
Reno said before leaving for Colorado. ``We've got to make sure 
they have the counseling, the support to help them come to grips 
with the anger of their life when it occurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was already clear, however, that the string of school  
shootings in Kentucky, Oregon and elsewhere will be tough to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's attack inspired a copycat act by teen-agers on  
Wednesday, although there were no weapons involved. Four teens were 
charged with trespassing in Colorado Springs after arriving at a 
school in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspects were mocking yesterday's events,'' a police  
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools in Jefferson County are reopening today with  
tightened security, although a spring snowstorm caused some school 
closings. Officers and school staff plan ``sweeps'' and greater 
security at entrances and exits, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trench coats like the ones worn by the two gunmen were banned in  
Denver and two other Colorado school districts because they could 
be used to hide weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, Denver and other communities, grieving parents and  
students gathered for services to remember those killed and to 
offer mutual support. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a cold rain and wind that set in Wednesday night,  
hundreds of friends, classmates and relatives filed past the 
flowers, balloons, poems, prayers and teddy bears that were heaped 
up on the ground in a park near the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students huddled in white blankets given out by aid  
workers. They wept around the car belonging to Rachel Scott, one of 
the dead students. The car was also heaped with flowers and poems 
and prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the small bouquets and large wreaths at the park stood a  
small potted pine with a card addressed to the school's students 
and staff: ``You are all heroes. You are all courageous,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel's brother, Craig, who was in the library when the  
shooting began, said he prayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just ended up laying on the floor,'' he told NBC's  
``Today.'' ``I was praying to God , to give me courage, and to keep 
protection over us. He told me to get out of there. God told me to 
get out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Shoels' son, Isaiah, one of the students who was killed,  
was black and an athlete, two things that made him a special target 
of the shooters, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had two strikes against him,'' Shoels said today.  
</P>
<P>
	The families of the killers issued brief statements that mixed  
apology with grief and, just as among the victims' relatives, an 
inability to comprehend the incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling to understand  
why this happened,'' Klebold's family said. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said Harris and Klebold were part of an outcast group  
called the Trenchcoat Mafia and that they wore black and spoke 
German to each other. They believe their choice of Adolf Hitler's 
birthday for the attack was no coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts from students indicated Harris was a leader, a boy who  
would come to class as if to war, in steel-toed combat boots and a 
German cross, while Klebold was a follower. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessie Boyer Jr., a former friend of Harris, said he was  
surprised Harris criticized ``jocks'' because he had liked sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an upbeat guy, but something changed. He associated  
himself with Nazis, and listened to a techno-Nazi band,'' Boyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris also liked war games with his friends.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was into combat more than anyone else I've ever seen,''  
said Andrew Beard, a fellow student. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators interviewed the parents of the suspects and  
searched their homes. They also were interviewing dozens, if not 
hundreds, of Columbine's 1,800 students. Some were fellow members 
of the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe was complicated by the massive, heavily damaged crime  
scene -- an entire high school and its grounds -- and the need to 
catalog every shell casing, every piece of shrapnel, every damaged 
ceiling tile. They also had to photograph the location of every 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, 16 people remained hospitalized, 11 in critical or  
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wondered whether they would be asked to return to the halls  
where their classmates killed and were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think anybody wants to go back in there,'' said  
Susan Dewitt, 17, glancing toward the barricaded school Wednesday 
night. Her voice broke as she spoke. ``Even if they remodel it, 
we'll all know where everything is.''

<HEADLINE> Gitic Has Trouble Recovering Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUANGZHOU, China (AP) -- A bankrupt Chinese investment trust gave  
a gloomy account of its finances on Thursday, saying that only 
about one-third of its assets could be recovered for repaying 
creditors, Dow Jones Newswires reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp., or  
Gitic, has debts of 38.78 billion yuan ($4.69 billion). It said 
that of 21.29 billion yuan ($2.57 billion) in assets, just 6.5 
billion yuan ($786 million) can be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Creditors were angered that they were not allowed to ask  
questions in the meeting in Guangzhou, in southern China, Dow Jones 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Chinese court report concluded that the creditors'  
efforts to get their money back will be further stymied by debtors 
who refuse to acknowledge what they owe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gitic lent 11.31 billion yuan ($1.36 billion) to 268 customers,  
but just 46 of them have acknowledged their debts, said the report, 
which was prepared by the People's High Court of Guangdong 
Province. A copy of the report was obtained by Dow Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	In February and March, the court sent repayment notices to all  
268 debtors, but just 90 of them with total obligations of 4.5 
billion yuan ($544 million) have responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those 90, 44 debtors with obligations of 2.5 billion yuan  
($302 million) ``have disputed the amount of indebtedness,'' making 
full recovery doubtful, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the court told 59 banks on Thursday that they cannot  
be recognized as creditors of Gitic because they did not properly 
document their claims. 
</P>
<P>
	About 61 percent of Gitic's loans were made to manufacturing  
companies, while 3 percent were made to property companies and 1 
percent to financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese government allowed Gitic, the main investment arm of  
China's wealthiest province Guangdong, to go bankrupt earlier this 
year in a move that rattled the financial community and forced 
several banks in Hong Kong to write off loans.

	Clinton Backs NATO on Troops  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of an alliance summit, President  
Clinton met with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana today and 
backed plans to reassess whether the Yugoslavia campaign should be 
limited to the air. ``I think it is a wise and prudent course,'' 
Clinton said of the military reassessment on the use of ground 
troops. Asked about a report that Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic had told Russia he was willing to accept a U.N. presence 
in Kosovo, Clinton said he had not studied the offer, but he added, 
``I suppose that represents some step forward.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Milosevic OKs Kosovo 'Presence'  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic has  
accepted the idea of a U.N.-controlled ``international presence'' 
in Kosovo if the NATO bombing stops and the alliance withdraws 
troops from Yugoslavia's borders, a Russian special envoy said 
today. Former Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin held a day-long 
meeting with Milosevic. It was unclear, however, whether such a 
force would be armed and under what guidelines it would operate. 
NATO has insisted on an armed presence in Kosovo.

	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- An Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed  
early today at Fort Campbell, killing seven people and injuring the 
other four aboard. An Army photo of the crash scene showed the 
helicopter scattered in several large pieces in a wooded area 
beside a road. The Black Hawk is the primary helicopter for air 
assault, air cavalry and medical evacuation units. It can carry an 
11-person squad. Fort Campbell is the headquarters for the 101st

	Bombs Found in Colo. School Kitchen

<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two outcasts who massacred their  
classmates before killing themselves intended to blow up Columbine 
High School, authorities said today after discovering two large 
propane bombs hidden in the school's kitchen. The discovery also 
could provide more evidence of a wider conspiracy, Sheriff John 
Stone said. Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with 
sawed-off shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, pistol and homemade 
bombs, killed 12 students and one teacher Tuesday. Authorities had 
already been looking into the possibility of additional suspects 
because of the amount of ammunition and explosives left behind.

	Clinton Talks to Va. Students  
</P>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton urged students, parents  
and teachers across the country today to consider whether graphic 
violence on television and the Internet plays a role in tragedies 
such as the killings at a school in Littleton, Colo. The 
president's discussion with students and teachers at T.C. Williams 
High School was broadcast via cable to millions of students 
nationwide. Clinton also said he had been struck by reports that 
the two killers in Colorado felt ostracized by their peers and 
embraced racist views. Clinton urged the students to look beyond 
their differences and emphasize what they all had in common.

<HEADLINE>  Ayala Says He's Ready For Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Philadelphia (AP) -- It is not uncommon for professional boxers  
to take lengthy layoffs between fights. No one has ever taken a 
16-year break -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Ayala Jr. said Thursday he will attempt to restart a boxing  
career that saw him go undefeated (22-0, 19 knockouts) before an 
aggravated sexual assault conviction forced him to spend 16 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be in the gym by the end of this month and hope to  
fight sometime in July,'' Ayala, 36, said. ``I'm not going to fight 
bums. I'm in this to go for the title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala was the WBA's top-ranked junior middleweight contender  
after consecutive knockouts of Robbie Epps and Carlos Herrera in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy Jones Jr., Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad, I've got  
my eyes on all of them,'' said Ayala, who was nicknamed ``El 
Torito,'' the Little Bull, for a fearless and ferocious style in 
the ring. ``There is only one way you can find out if you still 
have it, and that is by fighting the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala began thinking about a possible comeback two years ago  
while in prison after being inspired by the success of George 
Foreman, who came back to boxing after a 10-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreman was fighting guys half his age and he was beating  
them. So that planted an idea in my head that maybe, just maybe, I 
could come back and make history,'' Ayala said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are skeptics who feel Ayala is no better prepared to  
return to society, let alone the ring, than was Mike Tyson. Ayala 
concedes there are similarities with Tyson, but that he has changed 
and realizes the opportunity that lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tyson had a golden opportunity when he got out of jail, but he  
was out of control and made bad choices,'' Ayala said. ``He will 
have to learn that he has to live with the choices that he makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala's father, Tony Ayala, said he will once again train his  
son as he did many years ago. He plans to remain in Philadelphia 
for the next month, and then return to San Antonio, Texas with his 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony is the type of fighter that every trainer dreams of,''  
the elder Ayala said. ``He always runs the extra mile and goes the 
extra round. I will definitely know in the gym if he is ready or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Ayala said he weighs about 190 pounds, but that he  
would eventually like to get back to his fighting weight of 154 
pounds. And he remains optimistic that the long layoff will not 
effect his success. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get in shape and a fight is made, I would expect to  
kick ... well, let's just say I would expect to do good,'' said 
Ayala, who discounts critics who think he is too old. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's unprecedented, rare, and insane, but that is what  
I'm going to do,'' Ayala said. ``People said I was too short, too 
fat, too slow and too dumb when I was growing up, but I proved them 
wrong by beating every middleweight in the country.''

<HEADLINE> Laundry Firms Settle With Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The federal government has sent two Florida  
marketing firms to the showers for claiming their laundry products 
emit negative charges that force dirt from soiled fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketers of the plastic balls, sold as alternatives to  
laundry detergent, have agreed to settlements with the Federal 
Trade Commission and 11 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC had filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Tampa on  
Wednesday against Tradenet Marketing Inc. and Top Marketing 
Business Consulting Inc., charging both made false and 
unsubstantiated claims for their two products -- The Laundry 
Solution and The SuperGlobe. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies touted their products as effective substitutes  
for laundry detergents, the FTC said. 
</P>
<P>
	But tests showed the gadgets, filled with blue liquid, ``do  
little more than clean out your wallet,'' said Jodie Bernstein, 
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the devices -- sold for about $75 apiece -- were at best  
marginally better than washing clothes in hot water alone, and not 
as effective as using laundry detergent.

	``At worst, the products are completely useless,'' Bernstein

	The settlement did not call for the firms to admit wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE>  Ayala Says He's Ready For Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Philadelphia (AP) -- It is not uncommon for professional boxers  
to take lengthy layoffs between fights. No one has ever taken a 
16-year break -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Ayala Jr. said Thursday he will attempt to restart a boxing  
career that saw him go undefeated (22-0, 19 knockouts) before an 
aggravated sexual assault conviction forced him to spend 16 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be in the gym by the end of this month and hope to  
fight sometime in July,'' Ayala, 36, said. ``I'm not going to fight 
bums. I'm in this to go for the title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala was the WBA's top-ranked junior middleweight contender  
after consecutive knockouts of Robbie Epps and Carlos Herrera in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy Jones Jr., Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad, I've got  
my eyes on all of them,'' said Ayala, who was nicknamed ``El 
Torito,'' the Little Bull, for a fearless and ferocious style in 
the ring. ``There is only one way you can find out if you still 
have it, and that is by fighting the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala began thinking about a possible comeback two years ago  
while in prison after being inspired by the success of George 
Foreman, who came back to boxing after a 10-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreman was fighting guys half his age and he was beating  
them. So that planted an idea in my head that maybe, just maybe, I 
could come back and make history,'' Ayala said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are skeptics who feel Ayala is no better prepared to  
return to society, let alone the ring, than was Mike Tyson. Ayala 
concedes there are similarities with Tyson, but that he has changed 
and realizes the opportunity that lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tyson had a golden opportunity when he got out of jail, but he  
was out of control and made bad choices,'' Ayala said. ``He will 
have to learn that he has to live with the choices that he makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala's father, Tony Ayala, said he will once again train his  
son as he did many years ago. He plans to remain in Philadelphia 
for the next month, and then return to San Antonio, Texas with his 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony is the type of fighter that every trainer dreams of,''  
the elder Ayala said. ``He always runs the extra mile and goes the 
extra round. I will definitely know in the gym if he is ready or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Ayala said he weighs about 190 pounds, but that he  
would eventually like to get back to his fighting weight of 154 
pounds. And he remains optimistic that the long layoff will not 
effect his success. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get in shape and a fight is made, I would expect to  
kick ... well, let's just say I would expect to do good,'' said 
Ayala, who discounts critics who think he is too old. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's unprecedented, rare, and insane, but that is what  
I'm going to do,'' Ayala said. ``People said I was too short, too 
fat, too slow and too dumb when I was growing up, but I proved them 
wrong by beating every middleweight in the country.''

<HEADLINE> N.H. Ends Ban on Gay Adoption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The New Hampshire Legislature gave final  
approval Thursday to the repeal of a law prohibiting gays to adopt 
children or serve as foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 18-6 to repeal the 1987 law, which also  
requires heterosexual couples wishing to adopt or be foster parents 
to sign a form attesting that no adult in the household is gay. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill passed the House last month, and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen  
has said she will sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	The repeal leaves Florida as the only state where adoption by  
gays is prohibited by state law. At least two other states -- 
Arkansas and Utah -- use state agency rules to prevent gays from 
adopting. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the repeal said fear of AIDS and the mistaken  
belief that homosexual parents would be predisposed to molest 
children prompted the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the ignorance, discrimination and prejudice of that  
Legislature, the foster children of New Hampshire have suffered,'' 
Sen. Katie Wheeler said.

	Bombs Discovered in Colorado School  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- After discovering a powerful  
propane-tank bomb in the Columbine High School kitchen, 
investigators theorized today that the two gunmen in Tuesday's 
massacre planned to blow up their school and probably had help from 
others. ``It's a feeling from our investigators that the chances 
are very, very good that we have more than two people involved,'' a 
sheriff's spokesman said. Authorities had already been looking into 
the possibility of additional suspects because of the amount of 
ammunition and explosives left behind. Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold used sawed-off shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol 
and homemade bombs to kill 13 people before taking their own lives.

	Feds Want Gun Controls Boosted  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration prepared to release  
$1.5 million from the Crime Victims' Fund to compensate victims of 
the Colorado school shooting and voiced hope that the tragedy would 
spur passage of ``reasonable restrictions on the possession of 
guns.'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said the administration 
would send Congress suggested gun-control legislation that includes 
banning gun possession for people who committed violent crimes as 
juveniles. The federal funds would be used to help families pay for 
funerals, uninsured medical expenses, lost wages and mental-health 
counseling.

	Clinton Backs NATO on Ground Troops  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After meeting with NATO Secretary-General  
Javier Solana at the White House, President Clinton today said he 
supported NATO's decision to prepare a new military assessment on 
the use of ground troops against Yugoslavia. Although he called the 
move ``wise and prudent,'' Clinton insisted this was not a step 
toward a land campaign. Meanwhile, Pentagon officials presented a 
comprehensive briefing of damage inflicted so far. Air Force Maj. 
Gen. Charles Wald suggested that NATO has been so effective in 
crippling Slobodan Milosevic's lines of communication that the 
Yugoslav leader probably does not know the full extent of damage. 

</P>
<P>
	Milosevic May Accept U.N. `Presence'  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic will  
accept a U.N.-led force in Kosovo, but only if the bombing stops 
and NATO withdraws troops from his borders, a Russian envoy said 
today. But former Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin said that 
what kind of international force it will be or from which countries 
it would be assembled had not yet been discussed. NATO has insisted 
it must lead an armed presence in Kosovo to enforce any peace 
agreement.

	NATO Summit Will Address Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders toned down this weekend's  
celebration of the alliance's 50th birthday and pledged their 
summit would focus on stopping the bloodshed in Kosovo. With a 
swarm of VIP jets delivering leaders of 19 NATO nations and 23 
partner countries to the capital for three days of summitry, 
President Clinton declared: ``Our alliance is strongly united 
today.'' Washington braced for limousine gridlock and tight 
restrictions in a 100-block downtown security zone.

	AT&AMP;T Makes $58B Bid For MediaOne

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. offered $58 billion today for  
MediaOne, the nation's fourth-largest cable-television company, 
hoping to thwart a merger agreement that Comcast Corp. and MediaOne 
reached two months ago. AT&AMP;T said its rival bid, a combination of 
cash and stock, exceeded the value of the Comcast deal by 17 
percent. An AT&AMP;T deal would make the nation's largest 
telecommunications company also its No. 1 cable TV company.

installed, an expert says. The security breach was discovered by 
Joe Harris, a computer technician at Blarg! Online, a Seattle-area

``it's only the tip of the iceberg.''

a five-run first in which the Rockies had seven straight hits as 
Colorado defeated the San Francisco Giants 8-5 today. The Rockies,

patches on their sleeves in memory of the victims.

<HEADLINE> Del. Executes Man Who Killed Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Del. (AP) -- A Delaware man who fatally stabbed his wife  
and set a fire that killed three children was executed early 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	David J. Lawrie, 37, confessed to the killings and did not  
request a pardon in the days leading up to his execution. He was 
pronounced dead at 12:17 a.m. after being injected with three 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to thank my family and friends for being by my  
side all the way,'' he said moments before his death. ``I would not 
have made it this far without my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrie killed his estranged wife, Michelle Lawrie, two of their  
children and a third child she was babysitting on Aug. 6, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Incensed after his wife filed for divorce, Lawrie walked to the  
home where Michelle Lawrie, 25, and two of their children were 
living, doused it with gasoline and set it ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	He then broke into a bedroom where Mrs. Lawrie, their daughters,  
and two children Mrs. Lawrie was babysitting were hiding, stabbed 
Michelle Lawrie in the chest, and escaped through a window. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Lisa Humbertson, then 8 years old, survived. She testified  
that Michelle Lawrie handed her out the window to her estranged 
husband, but when Mrs. Lawrie tried to escape, he shoved her back 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 3-year-old brother, Charles Humbertson, and two of the  
Lawries' children, 4-year-old Fawn and 2-year-old Tabitha, died in 
the fire along with Mrs. Lawrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrie was convicted of four counts of murder and sentenced to  
death on July 8, 1993.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Jobs Lead in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Information is replacing products as the economic  
leader in Massachusetts, where high technology produced one-fourth 
of new jobs between June 1995 and last June, a new report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The state gained 116,817 jobs during that period, according to  
the report prepared by Craig Moore, a University of Massachusetts 
professor of political economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those jobs, 28,783, were in the ``information technology  
sector,'' which had about 148,000 workers last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The study shows ``the most significant shift in our economy and  
growth that's taken place in decades,'' Moore told The Boston 
Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts ``is moving from a product-based economy to an  
information-based economy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's unemployment rate last month was 2.8 percent, the  
lowest since the late 1980s when manufacturing minicomputers was 
the big thing. 
</P>
<P>
	But those manufacturers lost jobs, and 61,000 service jobs, many  
of them in software companies, were added during the three years 
studied. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had 36,640 software jobs, compared with 134,419 in  
California and 56,778 in Texas, two larger states. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a 43 percent increase in software jobs in  
Massachusetts during the three years, less than the nationwide gain 
of 52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the systems industry, including companies producing software  
and hardware for telecommunications, the Internet and computer 
systems connections, added 11,386 jobs in Massachusetts, growing at 
a rate of 174 percent, compared with a national growth rate of 52 
percent, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Fall, Milosevic Still Stands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Ambassador Richard Holbrooke walked out  
of his final negotiation with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, the Serb leader turned to the American envoy and asked, 
``Will I ever see you again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's up to you, Mr. President,'' Holbrooke replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The next night, NATO began dropping precision-guided bombs on  
Yugoslavia, a campaign designed to get Milosevic ``to change his 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the four-week mark, the Yugoslav leader continues to defy  
Clinton administration expectations. Emboldened by NATO's decision 
not to use ground troops, Milosevic has stepped up the killing of 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo even as the bombardment has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks have even encouraged Serbs to rally around their  
leader, strengthening his hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
	Military and foreign policy experts say the administration  
miscalculated Milosevic's determination to withstand punishing 
airstrikes to retain control of the rebel Kosovo province. In so 
doing, NATO left the province's ethnic Albanians unprotected from 
the massacres that ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you begin to assemble any ground force, Milosevic  
doesn't need to worry. He knows by now what the air campaign can 
do,'' said Anthony Cordesman, a military analyst with the Center 
for Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Senate hearing last week, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,  
pressed Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
about the decision to rule out ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``How does it make sense, Gen. Shelton, to remove an option, to  
tell your enemy before you go into a conflict that you will not 
exercise whatever options are necessary?'' McCain asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no argument,'' Shelton replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Morton Abramowitz, an undersecretary of state during the Bush  
administration, said the Clinton administration may have based its 
calculation on the last time NATO used air power in the Balkans. In 
1995, air attacks and Croatian ground action forced Milosevic and 
Bosnian-Serbs to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, there were no ground troops, and Milosevic  
made clear he cared more about Kosovo than Bosnia. ``Obviously, the 
strategy did not work in terms of getting him to back down,'' 
Abramowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flaw in the strategy is they didn't protect the  
Kosovars,'' Abramowitz added. ``They left them terribly exposed and 
you can see the results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were some warnings before the bombing began.  
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director George Tenet told lawmakers in February that Kosovo  
was a ``tinderbox'' and that Yugoslavia would seek to ``crush the 
Kosovo Liberation Army once and for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet said any political settlement in Kosovo would be fragile  
and ``likely to generate pressure for the international community 
to deploy ground forces to enforce implementation and deter new 
fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with sending troops, Shelton told lawmakers last  
week, was that the 19 NATO countries weren't prepared to back a 
ground invasion of Yugoslavia. ``It was a NATO decision to only 
have an air option,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other U.S. officials now say they always  
understood the risk that Milosevic might hunker down. But in the 
first days of the attacks, U.S. officials suggested Milosevic might 
capitulate quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The night before the airstrikes began, Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright predicted the campaign ``is not something that 
is going to go on for an overly long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Albright says, ``The air campaign will go on as long as is  
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been other adjustments in public statements by the  
United States and NATO: 
</P>
<P>
	--On March 19, Clinton said, ``Action and resolve can stop  
armies, and save lives.'' This week, Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles 
Wald told reporters, ``I don't think anybody said air (power) can 
do everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The airstrikes were designed to force Milosevic to resume  
negotiations. This week, Albright said, ``It is harder and harder 
to imagine that the United States could negotiate with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the original administration goals have either been  
thwarted or grown more remote: stopping a humanitarian disaster; 
bringing Milosevic to the negotiating table; returning Kosovars to 
their homes; increasing internal political pressure on Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration now argues that it simply had to act.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was only one possibility that we and our NATO allies  
were not willing to entertain,'' Clinton told newspaper editors 
last week, ``that the international community would look the other 
way in the face of this brutality.''

<HEADLINE> Ducks' Selanne Says Patience Is Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- For 53 minutes in Wednesday night's playoff game  
against Detroit, Anaheim's Teemu Selanne seemed to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	The only time the NHL's leading scorer was noticed during the  
Mighty Ducks' Western Conference opener was when he was getting a 
face full of glove from Kirk Maltby or slashed by Steve Yzerman. 
</P>
<P>
	Then suddenly, the puck was loose, the ``Finnish Flash'' scored,  
and it was a one-goal game again. That's why the Red Wings, who 
gave Selanne and Paul Kariya little room to move in a 5-3 victory, 
say they need to do better in Game 2 on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're always in the game because those two guys are capable  
of scoring a goal so quickly,'' said Yzerman, who had three goals 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The slightest turnover, whether it's at your own blue line or  
the other team's end, one little bit of open ice they capitalize 
on, and capitalize on quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the case Wednesday. Kariya got a bit of room early in  
the second period and before defenseman Chris Chelios could close 
on him, he one-timed it past goalie Chris Osgood. Selanne's goal 
came after a Red Wings turnover behind their net. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne finished the season in a bit of a slump. He had 45 goals  
in the first 67 games he played, or two goals every three games. In 
his final eight games he scored only twice, costing him a shot at a 
third straight 50-goal season. 
</P>
<P>
	He complained down the stretch of feeling tired, but said that  
was not the reason for his play Wednesday. He just couldn't get 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so hard when you play against a team that is really good  
at forechecking and you know you're not going to get breakout 
passes that often,'' he said. ``You're not going to see many pretty 
goals in this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg said part of Selanne's inability  
to get many chances is the Red Wings' left-wing-lock style of play. 
It's a defensive system that looks to funnel the player taking the 
puck out of his zone into an area where defenders can converge on 
him and cause turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Using that system, the Red Wings managed to shut down Brett  
Hull, Mike Modano and Petr Bondra in the playoffs last year, Eric 
Lindros the year before. So Selanne is in good company. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to have to find ways to get away,'' Hartsburg said.  
``But he knows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya said the Red Wings' defensive scheme worked Wednesday,  
but it may not continue to work all series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be a plus or a minus,'' Kariya said. ``If we get out on  
a break and he's going against a forward instead of a defenseman, 
that can help. But at the same time, if the puck is tied up in our 
zone the forward tends to be more aggressive and that might shut 
him down a little bit more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne said the key for him on Friday is patience.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can find a way to do our damage,'' he said. ``It  
doesn't matter if you have 20 scoring chances or two scoring 
chances. When we get the chance, we have to bury them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every shift that Kariya and Selanne played, the Red Wings  
matched them with Chelios, a three-time winner of the Norris Trophy 
as the league's best defenseman, and Nicklas Lidstrom, a finalist 
for the Norris last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya, making only his second playoff appearance, said he  
believes some of his teammates may have been awed by the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some guys who were a little hesitant and maybe didn't  
know what to expect,'' Kariya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Ducks played their first playoff game Wednesday, and the  
team averages 19 playoff games per player. The Red Wings, who have 
won two consecutive Stanley Cups, had no playoff rookies and 
average 87 playoff games per player. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne said he believes the Ducks must play better defense.  
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of mistakes cost the game last night,'' he said.  
``But I think it was a good confidence builder for us. We realize 
that we can compete with these guys.''

<HEADLINE> FTC Sues Firm for Deceptive Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An investigative company impersonated bank  
account holders to get confidential information about their 
financial affairs, and then sold it to anyone willing to pay, the 
Federal Trade Commission said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has filed suit against the company, Touch Tone  
Information Inc. of Denver, accusing it of ``pretexting,'' or 
calling banks, brokerages and other financial institutions and 
lying to get the information. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, Touch Tone workers impersonated  
account holders by providing their name, addresses, dates of birth 
and Social Security numbers. To get additional information, the 
worker then lied about the circumstances of the call by saying, for 
example, he had forgotten his checkbook. 
</P>

	Transcripts of telephone calls made to First Chicago NBD show  
Touch Tone callers trying to get information on checking account 
balances that belonged to account holders who volunteered to 
participate in the investigation. The volunteers were bank 
employees; one was a bank security officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got this credit card that I have to pay off today and I just  
wanted to make sure I had enough funds,'' one caller told a First 
Chicago customer service representative. ``Is there any way for you 
to pull up, like, an account with my Social Security number because 
I have kind of like no -- I didn't bring my checkbook or anything 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the bank employee declined to release information  
after the caller, who identified himself as Dr. Stanley Mocek, was 
unable to provide any information besides a Social Security number 
-- such as the date and amount of a recent deposit or the maiden 
name of the account holder's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators say Touch Tone was able to get private  
information in other calls, and they believe the company was fairly 
successful among information brokers, which typically sell their 
information to attorneys and debt collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Touch Tone is one of the bigger players, and we think  
it's a growing problem,'' said attorney David Medine, the FTC's 
associate director for financial practices. ``But we also expect 
that this case will send a strong message that lying to obtain 
someone's account information is illegal and will be vigorously 
prosecuted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to reach Touch Tone for comment were unsuccessful.  
</P>
<P>
	First Chicago cooperated with the FTC in the investigation of  
Touch Tone, turning over recordings it usually makes of customer 
service calls, Medine said. The customer service representatives, 
however, were not aware of the sting. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC filed suit Wednesday in federal court in Denver,  
accusing Touch Tone of using unfair or deceptive trade practices in 
commerce. The agency is asking a judge to order the company to stop 
engaging in pretexting and forfeit profits made with the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view lying to obtain sensitive financial information as  
outrageous conduct,'' Medine said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time the government has gone after an  
information brokerage agency engaging in such practices, Jodie 
Bernstein, the director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection 
told a joint meeting of two House subcommittees Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein said the information can be used to open fraudulent  
credit card accounts in other names and run up delinquent debts, 
leaving innocent consumers with the bills and destroying their 
credit ratings.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Decline by 5,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing applications  
for unemployment checks declined last week from a three-month high 
the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	A seasonally adjusted 314,000 unemployed people claimed  
benefits, down from a revised 319,000 the previous week, the Labor 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third consecutive week of claims higher than 300,000  
and followed a nine-week stretch of weekly numbers below that mark, 
the longest since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes  
fluctuations in the volatile data series, rose by 4,750 to an 
11-week high of 306,250. 
</P>
<P>
	But, even with the increase, economists don't foresee more than  
a modest weakening in the strong labor market, which in March 
reduced the nation's unemployment rate to a 29-year low of 4.2 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Union Pacific Earns $129M in 1Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Union Pacific Corp. reported Thursday it earned  
$129 million during the first quarter, an improvement over a loss 
suffered a year earlier due to congestion problems on its railroad 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest railroad reported earnings of 52 cents per  
share. That compared to a net loss of $62 million, or 25 cents per 
share, in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Pacific's results beat Wall Street expectations of 46  
cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating revenue rose 6 percent to $2.74 billion from $2.59  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Davidson, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed  
the change to operational improvements that have allowed the 
railroad to run more efficiently. He said the railroad was working 
to restore the confidence of customers whose shipments were 
stranded during months of gridlock in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have blamed the delays on the railroad's merger with  
Southern Pacific Rail Corp. in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Union Pacific surged more than 5 percent, rising $3 ot  
$56.31 1/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Should Springer Guests Be Arrested? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- When fists fly and hair is yanked on the set of  
``The Jerry Springer Show,'' guests shouldn't just be separated -- 
they should be arrested, a City Council member says. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderman Edward Burke, a former policeman, said the off-duty  
Chicago officers who provide security for the show should enforce 
the law. He wants to call those officers before the council's 
Police and Fire Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are committing batteries, assaults and other offenses,  
then why isn't the police department taking appropriate action?'' 
Burke asked Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the show had no comment.

it.

<HEADLINE> $3M Bias Award Against UAL Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An appeals court has upheld a nearly $3  
million jury award to a former United Airlines cleaning crew worker 
who claimed he was the victim of anti-Muslim bias. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st District Court of Appeals ruled that the evidence  
justified the panel's conclusion that Ahmad Abu-Aziz suffered 
severe harassment due to his religion and Jordanian national 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Aziz said he was wrongly fired by United after enduring  
months of ridicule, including an order to clean an airplane toilet 
with his hands rather than a brush. 
</P>
<P>
	When he complained to his supervisor, Tracy Bryant, in December  
1994, Abu-Aziz said she told him he wasn't a ``team player'' and 
suggested that he keep a low profile. Bryant denied he ever 
complained about discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Aziz was fired after being accused of stealing company  
property and drinking wine at an unauthorized party held aboard a 
parked plane in January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury said the accusations were ``highly suspicious'' and  
awarded him $246,000 for economic losses, $50,000 for emotional 
distress and $2.67 million in punitive damages in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline spokesman Matthew Triaca said the company was  
``exploring our options.'' United, which claimed errors in jury 
instructions and a lack of evidence to support the verdict, could 
appeal.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Address High Schoolers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton is visiting a suburban  
Washington high school today to meet with students trying to weigh 
the implications of the Littleton, Colo., massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's discussion with two dozen T.C. Williams High  
School students was being broadcast via cable to millions of 
students nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The President just wants a chance to listen to the discussion  
the kids were going to have and join with them in discussing some 
of the issues that Littleton raises,'' said White House press 
secretary Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has visited T.C. Williams High before to highlight the  
Alexandria school district's emphasis on safety and training 
students in non-violent conflict resolution. About 1,800 students 
from a variety of ethnic and religious backgrounds attend classes 
at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	The students scheduled a session to discuss conflict resolution  
in the school's media center after two students at Columbine High 
School killed 12 classmates, a teacher and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The session offered Clinton, wary about visiting Littleton  
because it might disrupt the community's efforts to deal with the 
fallout of the shootings, a chance to meet with students and 
address school safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Channel One cable broadcast to classrooms nationwide reaches  
12,000 schools, or 8 million students. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart noted that T.C. Williams ``is recognized throughout the  
region for having strong programs dealing with conflict resolution. 
Alexandria City public schools have a high priority on school 
safety.''

<HEADLINE> Gunmen's Video Foreshadowed Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Months before the massacre at Columbine  
High, the two killers made a class-project video depicting 
themselves in their trench coats, gunning down athletes in the 
school hallway, a classmate says. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed and wounded dozens of  
students at the school before taking their own lives Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Their spasm of violence was foreshadowed by several videos they  
made last fall for a class, classmates said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one video, ``they had their friends pretend to be the jocks,  
and they pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' high school 
junior Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a little upset they couldn't show their video to the  
whole school. But there were guns in every scene of the video, so 
you can't show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hadn't yet determined whether such a  
video was made, and the teacher who taught the class refused to 
comment. But another student said the pair's video projects were 
uniformly disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always were the same kind of videos,'' said Eric Veik,  
16. ``They always wore trench coats. They always wanted to be the 
intimidators, the good guys out to get the bad guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At school, the pair were known as members of a group of outcasts  
who called themselves the ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' for the long black 
coats they wore, regardless of the season. Klebold and Harris 
openly admired Hitler, wore German crosses to school, and played 
violent video games for hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbing thing, to some, is that Klebold and Harris came  
from respected, middle-class families. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and Susan Klebold lived in a home worth nearly $400,000,  
a modernistic cedar-and-glass structure with matching guest house 
tucked between two huge stone formations on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold's father, Thomas, 52, a retired geophysicist who  
consulted with companies exploring gas and oil, now runs a mortgage 
management business from his home. His mother, 50, has worked for 
the Colorado community-college system for years, helping disabled 
students gain access to education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all scratching our heads right now,'' said Michael  
Briand, who knows Ms. Klebold from his work as a 
community-development consultant at Arapahoe Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the elder Klebold is known as a liberal, in favor of gun  
control. Ms. Klebold is a sensitive listener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly  
normal,'' Briand said. ``They did everything right. But somehow the 
pain and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't 
reach it. This has got to be a pervasive thing in our society if it 
can reach this far, into families like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y., where  
his father, Wayne Harris, was an Air Force pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, neighbors said, the family appeared quiet. The  
elder Harris, now retired, and his wife, Katherine, would wave 
across the fence while out in the yard but made little effort to 
socialize with neighbors. Their tidy, two-story home on a quiet 
cul-de-sac is assessed at $184,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Former neighbors in Plattsburgh remember a solid, middle-class  
family with a likable young son. They were shocked to learn that 
Eric Harris had shot up a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mouth just dropped,'' former classmate Kyle Ross said. ``He  
was a typical kid. He didn't seem anything like what is portrayed 
on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The families were avoiding reporters, but both issued statements  
expressing sympathy for the victims, and Klebold's family wondered 
what went wrong: ``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling 
to understand why this happened.''

<HEADLINE> Rubin Supports Economic Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and other major economies  
have put together a ``powerful program of reform'' to deal with the 
worst economic crisis in 50 years and help to prevent future 
Asian-style currency crises, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Delivering a major policy speech on the global economy, Rubin  
said the United States and its allies were focusing on an approach 
that will more actively involve the private sector in dealing with 
crises and help developing countries avoid some of the pitfalls 
that triggered the the recent turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said that in upcoming meetings of finance officials from  
the world's seven richest industrial countries and the spring 
meetings of the International Monetary Fund, the United States will 
be pushing reforms to help countries handle the huge amounts of 
money that can flow around the world with the click of a few 
computer keys. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the rapid withdrawal of investor capital that leveled the  
economies of a number of Asian nations beginning in July 1997. The 
contagion from that turmoil spread to Russia in August 1998 and 
then struck Brazil in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no magic wands,'' Rubin said in a speech to the  
School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins 
University. ``But over time, the steps we have taken and those we 
propose constitute a very powerful program of reform. ... The 
result should be a more robust global economy -- one less 
susceptible to crises, one better equipped to deal with crisis and 
one with greater growth, more broadly shared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus told  
reporters today he believes the global economy has ``come a long 
way'' in resolving the 20-month-old financial crisis since top 
finance officials had last gathered in Washington six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, Camdessus said the main questions he received from  
reporters concerned the possibility that the global financial 
system could experience a ``systemic meltdown'' in the turbulent 
period after Russia defaulted on billions of dollars of debt, 
sending the U.S. stock market and other global markets into a steep 
nose dive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the climate is distinctly better,'' Camdessus said, noting  
that the IMF forecast expects the world to avoid a global recession 
and believes the one-third of the global economy that is now in 
recession will return to positive growth later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking specifically about Latin America, which became the  
latest region to fall victim to the spreading financial contagion 
earlier this year, Camdessus said Brazil and other nations in 
recession see a ``V-shape'' pattern in which they will quickly 
emerge from the sharp downturns and resume solid growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing comments President Clinton made Tuesday at the White  
House, Camdessus said, ``The situation is better but there is no 
room for complacency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted a key element of administration strategy, a  
proposal to set up a new lending window at the IMF to ward off a 
currency crisis by providing pre-emptive lines of credit, would be 
discussed at next week's meetings of finance ministers and should 
win approval. 
</P>
<P>
	He also expressed optimism about another Clinton administration  
initiative, to provide up to $70 billion in additional debt relief 
for the world's poorest countries. He noted a number of nations 
have advanced debt-relief proposals and he said there was 
``widespread support'' among IMF members to deal with this issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus called Russia ``the most difficult problem we must  
tackle,'' referring to that country's deepening economic problems. 
But he said that in recent days IMF staff in Moscow have reported 
hopeful signs in negotiations with Russia over new IMF loans. He 
predicted an agreement could be reached ``in the next few days'' 
that would allow the agency to resume lending to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Clinton has told a gathering at the White House that  
``we will never be able to banish'' financial crises altogether. He 
added that, ``Acting on the lessons we have learned from this 
experience, we can find a way to harness the benefits of an open 
global economy while taming the global cycles of boom and bust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States hopes to receive approval for its new ideas at  
a meeting Monday of finance officials of the world's seven richest 
industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, 
Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. economy has escaped significant harm from the  
global crisis that has pushed one-third of the world into 
recession, Clinton is coming under increased criticism because of 
America's rising trade deficit, which hit a record $19.4 billion in 
February.

<HEADLINE> Senate Moves To Limit Y2K Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has begun debate on what many feel  
could be the real Year 2000 computer crisis -- the economic meltdown 
caused by thousands of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very, very serious issue,'' said Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., chief sponsor of legislation that seeks to limit 
litigation resulting from the so-called Y2K computer problem. ``The 
potential drain on the nation's economy and the world economy is 
staggering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One commonly cited estimate puts the litigation from Y2K at $1  
trillion, far exceeding damages sought in breast implant or 
asbestos lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill would give companies up to 90 days to fix computer  
problems before having to face lawsuits, and would encourage 
mediation, put caps on punitive damage and limit class action 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, as it came out of the Senate Commerce Committee McCain  
chairs, was opposed by most Democrats and the Clinton 
administration, which said it undermined consumer rights and gave 
businesses an opportunity to avoid their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has led efforts to improve consumer  
protections in the bill, and negotiations continue to make it 
acceptable to both sides. A vote on proceeding with debate is 
scheduled for Monday. A similar bill awaits House action. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on  
the Commerce Committee, said he still opposed the bill because it 
was backed by businesses ``interested in distorting the tort 
liability laws of America'' to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Three consumer groups, Consumer Union, Public Citizen and U.S.  
Public Interest Research Group, issued a statement last week saying 
the McCain bill and other Y2K litigation bills ``would restrict the 
rights that individual and small-business consumers have under 
current law and would undermine incentives for companies to correct 
Y2K defects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the National Association of Manufacturers, in a letter,  
urged Congress to pass legislation, saying a flood of contentious 
litigation ``could have serious consequences for consumers in 
higher prices, workers in lost jobs and our technology pre-eminence 
in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem could arise when computers that use only two  
digits to read dates mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900, 
resulting in computer systems putting out wrong information or 
breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate special panel on the Y2K problem, chaired by Sen.  
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, heard testimony on Thursday from oil 
experts who concluded that the U.S. oil industry has prepared for 
the millennium bug and had the reserves to handle short-term 
cutoffs in supplies from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kripowicz, the Energy Department's principal deputy  
assistant secretary for fossil energy, expressed ``cautious 
optimism'' that oil producers, shippers and refiners would be ready 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the oil industry's built-in flexibility because of its  
experiences in handling natural disasters and its financial 
incentive to keep oil flowing and the nation's Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, which now holds an inventory of 561 million barrels of 
crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States imports some 10.4 million barrels of oil a  
day, 56 percent of the nation's consumption. Kripowicz said up to 
4.1 million barrels a day could be withdrawn from the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Major suppliers -- Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Mexico and Canada --  
are making serious efforts to prepare their computer systems, 
although there are ``gaps'' in the department's information about 
other producing nations, Kripowicz said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ramsay of the Paris-based International Energy Agency  
also cautioned that ``a few minor glitches can compound to create 
bottlenecks.'' He said some experts are predicting that Y2K-related 
problems ``could last into the second quarter as problems compound 
down the supply chain over time.''

<HEADLINE> BankBoston Pay Proposal Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Ben &AMP; Jerry's-style proposal to limit the ratio  
between the salaries of BankBoston's top executives and its 
lowest-paid workers was defeated Thursday at the company's annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	But the group of dissident shareholders who came up with the  
proposal said they had merely hoped to generate dialogue at the 
company about the wage gap between BankBoston's brass and the rest 
of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't looking to win,'' said Betsy Leondar-Wright,  
spokeswoman for United for a Fair Economy, a Boston-based advocacy 
group leading a movement to bring the income gap issue into the 
board rooms of some of the nation's biggest companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping it sends a message this is something shareholders  
are concerned about,'' she added. ``(It) could still change the 
climate in the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont-based Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. drew attention in the  
1980s for its progressive policy restricting the pay of top 
executives to no more than seven times that of the lowest-paid 
permanent worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The company abandoned the policy in 1994. But it still provided  
a model for UFE's proposal, which got just under 5 percent of the 
``yes'' vote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have such a wide discrepancy in pay is discouraging ... and  
it exacerbates the larger problem in the U.S. of inequality between 
the rich and poor,'' said Jennifer Ladd, a BankBoston Corp. 
stockholder who presented the resolution at the meeting. ``There 
are many people who make a corporation work, but they don't all get 
valued in the same way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution called for BankBoston to establish a cap on CEO  
compensation by making it a multiple of the compensation of the 
lowest-paid worker at the company. It did not specify what that 
multiple should be. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, UFE's Responsible Wealth project has recruited  
shareholders to file resolutions at nine U.S. companies to examine 
the wage gaps within their labor forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1990 and 1997, according to the nonprofit UFE, CEO  
salaries rose 86 percent, while the wages of factory workers rose 
22 percent. Business Week magazine recently reported that top 
executives earn 419 times the average wage of a blue-collar worker. 
The ratio was 42-to-1 in 1980, Leondar-Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	At BankBoston, CEO Charles ``Chad'' Gifford made $2.96 million  
in salary and bonuses last year -- down from $3.6 million in 1997 -- 
according to company records. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures for the lowest-paid employee salaries were not  
available, and BankBoston representatives declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But in its proxy statement, BankBoston had urged shareholders to  
vote against the salary resolution, saying the cap on CEO salary 
would ``restrict the corporation's ability to attract and retain 
the experienced and dedicated leaders necessary for its business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to BankBoston, similar resolutions have been filed  
on the proxies for AlliedSignal, AT&AMP;T Corp., BankAmerica Corp., 
Citigroup Inc., Computer Associates, General Electric Co., Huffy 
Corp. and R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons Co. 
</P>
<P>
	At Huffy's shareholder meeting Thursday in Dayton, Ohio, a  
UFE-drafted resolution that would require the bicycle manufacturer 
to compile a report about its wage gap got 8 percent of the vote, 
Leondar-Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	At General Electric's shareholder meeting on Wednesday in  
Cleveland, a proposal similar to BankBoston's was supported by 5 
percent of voters. 
</P>
<P>
	According to GE's records, chairman Jack Welch received a base  
salary of $2.8 million in 1998, a bonus of $7.2 million, nearly $1 
million in other compensation, and stock options on 500,000 shares 
that could be worth $63 million in 10 years (based on a 10 percent 
annual growth rate). 
</P>
<P>
	``Is my salary too high? Somebody else will have to decide that,  
but this is a competitive marketplace,'' said Welch, who pointed 
out that many GE employees besides himself have benefited from 
stock options.

<HEADLINE> Technology Advances Key to Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, R.I. (AP) -- In the increasingly high-tech sport of  
America's Cup sailing, the brainpower of techno-geeks may be more 
important than the derring-do of sailors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a sailboat race. It is a technology battle between  
nations,'' said boat builder Eric Goetz, who is working on the New 
York Yacht Club's boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetz and other members of the yacht club's Young America  
syndicate discussed their progress during a news conference 
Thursday here at the Hall Spars warehouse, where the group's masts 
are being designed. 
</P>
<P>
	The syndicate is pinning its hopes on technological advances as  
it prepares for the America's Cup in 2000. It is spending $40 
million and has assembled leading experts in hull, keel, mast and 
sail design. 
</P>
<P>
	A chart listing the various experts working on the Young America  
boats reads like a design team for a NASA rocket, with individuals 
assigned to ``experimental analysis,'' ``velocity prediction'' and 
``computational fluid dynamics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the team tested its experimental boat designs at  
the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Bethesda, Md., where the Navy 
tests its vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the technology is secret, and photographers were not  
allowed to enter a portion of the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	All the boat experts assembled said the 2000 boats will  
represent a giant bound forward in technology and design. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been astounded by the developments,'' said Goetz, who  
has worked on eight America's Cup boats. 
</P>
<P>
	If Young America qualifies to race against New Zealand and wins,  
it would bring the Cup races back to Newport, where they were held 
for 132 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yacht Club, which has racing headquarters in  
Newport, lost the Cup to Australia 16 years ago, ending its 
132-year domination of sailing's most prestigious event. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Conner and the San Diego Yacht Club brought the Cup back  
to the United States by beating Australia. The Cup remained in San 
Diego until 1995, when New Zealand took it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is to win for America,'' said Marshall, who  
believes Young America has a big head start over many other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The syndicate includes yacht clubs in Portland, Maine;  
Annapolis, Md.; St. Petersburg, Fla.; Chicago; Detroit and Fort 
Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, a series of challenge races will begin to determine  
which team will face New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Young America will face 14 teams from 10 countries, including  
entries from Hong Kong, Switzerland, Australia, Spain, Japan, 
England, Russia, France and Italy. San Diego and San Francisco also 
are competing.

<HEADLINE> Private School Scholarships Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forty-thousand poor children across the nation  
were awarded scholarships Wednesday to attend private school -- 
winners of a lottery that attracted one of every 50 school-age 
children in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Hinds' 10-year-old son Tristan was one of the recipients  
of the $1,000 scholarships for private school tuition from the 
Children's Scholarship Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	He is learning Japanese, loves computers and has always attended  
programs for gifted kids in New York public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's not enough,'' Ms. Hinds said on Wednesday.  
``They're failing our children. He needs exposure to a better, more 
cultural environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scholarship program attracted applications from over 1.25  
million children; that's about one of every 50 school-age children 
in America. The actual pool of eligible applicants was even smaller 
due to income guidelines similar to those for free school lunches. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, 170,000 children applied, or about one out of every  
30 eligible kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``In anybody's book that has to be an amazing demonstration of  
dissatisfaction with the present system -- and a demand for 
alternatives,'' said Theodore Forstmann, the billionaire financier 
who founded the program with Wal-Mart heir John Walton. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners, who were chosen by lottery, will get grants averaging  
about $1,000 a year for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	That would cover almost half of the $1,900 a year tuition at a  
New York City Catholic school, but only a fraction of the expense 
of an exclusive private school, which can be $15,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say Forstmann, Walton and other supporters of the  
program have a larger agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about helping poor children. It's about advancing  
efforts to privatize education,'' said Barry Lynn, director of 
Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ``And most of 
the people who applied for this do not realize how little money it 
is. They're going to be very disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forstmann, in New York Wednesday, said the scholarships would  
bring competition to public schools, which he described as a 
``monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hinds hopes to get Tristan into Brooklyn Friends School, a  
highly regarded school where tuition is about $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have to do two jobs, I will do it,'' said Ms. Hinds, who  
works as an assistant teacher in the public schools.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in Abortion Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A man who knelt and pretended to shoot an  
imaginary rifle into a crowd of anti-abortion picketers outside a 
hospital became the first person arrested during a weeklong 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
	James Krentel of Rochester was charged Wednesday with harassment  
and possessing a loaded weapon in a vehicle. Police said they found 
two rifles, ammunition and knives in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they did not suspect that Krentel, 34, had any  
links to activists on either side of the abortion issue. He was to 
be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not appear that he is affiliated in any way,'' said  
police Chief Robert Duffy, adding that ``a potential tragedy was 
averted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-abortion protests called Operation Save America started  
in Buffalo on Sunday and moved 75 miles east to Rochester on 
Wednesday. Protesters returned to Buffalo early this morning, 
standing in a cold rain in front of the women's clinic where slain 
physician Barnett Slepian worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital security guards told police Krentel appeared to be  
pointing a weapon at one of them as he drove by in a gray 
Oldsmobile, the police chief said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time police intervened, he was on his knees ``facing  
toward the protesters and simulating what appeared to be him 
holding a rifle,'' Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Carlos Garcia said Krentel didn't remove the  
weapons from the back seat of the Oldsmobile and had not pointed a 
weapon at either protesters or clinic workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode passed largely unnoticed a half-block from Genesee  
Hospital, where some 200 anti-abortion protesters were reciting 
hymns and prayers and holding placards aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	Alongside them, a smaller number of abortion rights activists  
chanted their opposition in slogans and song. About 100 police 
officers were deployed to ensure the demonstrations were 
nonviolent.

<HEADLINE> Australian Recommended To Open Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Elizabeth II, Britain's queen and  
Australia's head of state, will not play the key ceremonial role of 
opening the Sydney 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The job will go instead to an Australian, almost certainly Prime  
Minister John Howard -- who is a staunch monarchist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games announced  
today it has recommended to the International Olympics Committee 
that an Australian should open the games in September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC chief Juan Antonio Samaranch has indicated he is likely to  
accept SOCOG's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is sure to anger some monarchists, who argue that  
Australia is still part of the British Empire and that its monarch 
should open the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia has been independent since 1901, but along with many  
other Commonwealth countries, such as Canada and Papua New Guinea, 
still recognizes Elizabeth II as its head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	But she rarely visits, and the role of her permanent  
representative (the governor-general) is mostly ceremonial -- 
rubber-stamping parliamentary bills, swearing-in the elected 
government and playing host to official functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Australians will vote in a referendum in November on whether to  
dump the queen and become a republic. If the referendum is passed, 
the monarchy would be replaced by an Australian presidency in 
January 2001, well after the games. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG president Michael Knight said the board's decision was  
unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	It recommended that ``should Australia have a president in place  
by 15 September, 2000, he or she should open the Sydney 2000 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, if no such office is in place, that the elected Prime  
Minister of Australia perform this role of national and 
international significance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Howard said he welcomed SOCOG's announcement.  
Although against Australia becoming a republic, Howard believes an 
Australian should open the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The queen will make her 13th visit to Australia in the first  
half of 2000, but has timed the trip to fall between the republic 
referendum and the opening of the Sydney Games.

<HEADLINE> Steel Imports Up After Reductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- March shipments of foreign steel increased 25  
percent, reversing course after four consecutive months of 
reductions, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley declared that  
the Clinton administration's policy on combating steel imports was 
working, an indication officials would not seek stronger trade 
sanctions soon against Japan and other steel-producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never expected this to be resolved in a matter of months,''  
Daley said. ``There are bound to be variations in import levels 
from month to month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-month increase could help boost support in the Senate  
for quotas on foreign shipments. Last month, the House 
overwhelmingly passed a quota bill despite the threat of a 
presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``These numbers make it clear that, while our nation fails to  
act, the steel import crisis continues,'' said Sen. Jay 
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., vice chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	He called his quota legislation ``the only truly effective means  
for finally ending this crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The imports are blamed for thousands of layoffs and bankruptcies  
at three U.S. companies. They resulted from the Asian economic 
crisis, which lowered demand for steel abroad and forced foreign 
producers to increasingly rely on U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate action Thursday, the U.S. International Trade  
Commission authorized tariffs against six countries on stainless 
steel plate in coils, a relatively small product line. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission found that illegal pricing by Belgium, Canada,  
Italy, South Africa, South Korea and Taiwan has injured domestic 
producers, a move that will lead to tariff orders within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tariffs would range from 7 percent for some Taiwanese steel to  
60 percent for most Italian steel. The action applies only to the 
stainless steel product that comes rolled up like carpet and is 
used in specialized tasks such as chemical processing, pollution 
control and petroleum refining. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary government figures for March showed shipments of  
foreign steel to the United States totaled 2.5 million metric tons. 
That is a 25 percent increase from the 2 million metric tons a 
month earlier. Still, the total represented a 30 percent drop from 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments from Japan and Brazil, two of the chief targets of the  
U.S. industry's trade complaints, recorded a one-month increase of 
39 percent and 54 percent, respectively. Russia, which has 
tentatively agreed to reduce future shipments to the United States, 
posted a 53 percent reduction in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia, South Korea and Taiwan also posted increases.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest steel numbers are likely to add fuel to industry  
arguments that despite preliminary U.S. rulings threatening 
punitive tariffs on hot-rolled carbon steel from Japan, Russia and 
Brazil, those countries could simply shift to other products. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic producers and their unionized workers believe a  
comprehensive response is needed to avoid product shifting and to 
keep other countries from filling the void on hot-rolled steel, a 
major steel product. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past several months, the administration has struggled  
over the proper response to last year's surge in foreign shipments, 
fearing that too high a trade barrier could start a trade war and 
hurt the ability of U.S. companies in other industries to send 
goods abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials prefer to let the problems ease without  
the stronger sanctions. Steelworkers, a key ally of Democrats, have 
been vocal about demanding quotas.

<HEADLINE> Russia Torn Over Yugoslavia Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia is under growing pressure to send military  
aid to help Yugoslavia fight NATO, a top parliamentary leader said 
today. The government reasserted its determination to stay out of 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one advanced Russian anti-aircraft missile system would  
enable the Yugoslav military to shoot down dozens of NATO planes 
and halt the air attacks, claimed Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist 
who serves as speaker of the Duma, the lower chamber of parliament. 
He said the Russian people would demand Moscow supply such aid if 
the conflict continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear NATO is preparing a ground operation in Yugoslavia,  
so Russia must clearly state how it can render serious 
military-technical aid to Yugoslavia,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has denounced NATO's airstrikes, repeatedly  
calling for their immediate suspension to allow political 
negotiations on solving the Kosovo crisis. But President Boris 
Yeltsin has said Moscow will not be dragged in to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has been trying to mediate a political settlement and  
Yeltsin's special envoy, ex-premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, visited 
Belgrade today for talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin's delegation was told by Yugoslav officials that  
some 500 people had been killed and another 400 wounded in the air 
attacks, the Interfax news agency reported. About 500,000 people 
had been left unemployed because factories and businesses were 
destroyed by the bombing, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev reiterated the  
Kremlin's refusal to provide military aid to Yugoslavia. He said 
such a move would undermine Russia's efforts to negotiate a 
political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only Russia has the unique possibility to use its special  
relations with Yugoslavia and its remaining relations with NATO ... 
to find a peaceful political way out,'' he told the Federation 
Council, parliament's upper chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Avdeyev also said the United States and other nations had urged  
Moscow to reconsider its decision to boycott the summit marking 
NATO's 50th anniversary that starts Friday in Washington. Russia 
refuses to attend the three-day summit because of the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO and the United States ... tried to persuade us to take  
part in the NATO summit until the last moment. Even last night 
(Wednesday) we were asked by telephone to send at least our 
ambassador to the anniversary celebrations. We won't go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While opposing NATO's use of force, Moscow has yet to offer any  
concrete suggestions on how peace that would satisfy both Belgrade 
and the Western alliance could be restored to Kosovo. Russia has 
called repeatedly for the NATO attacks to be halted to allow talks 
to start, a condition rejected by the alliance.

<HEADLINE> Washington Governor Had Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- When Gov. Gary Locke -- a former prosecutor  
and supporter of the death penalty -- was invited to deliver a 
commencement address, he didn't realize a condemned killer would 
also be speaking. 
</P>
<P>
	That presented something of a dilemma for Locke, a Democrat who  
has had support from law-enforcement groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Locke, graduates at Evergreen State College are  
scheduled to hear June 11 from Mumia Abu-Jamal, who will make a 
tape from his cell on Pennsylvania's death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal, awaiting execution for murdering a Philadelphia  
police officer in 1981, has become a symbol for anti-death penalty 
groups. He claims that he never received a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Locke's staff did not know of Abu-Jamal's invitation until they  
read about it in Evergreen's campus newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	After his staff talked with Evergreen officials Wednesday, Locke  
decided to attend. The governor is to speak early in the program, 
well before Abu-Jamal's 10-minute tape is played.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Dwight Brown, a former Northwestern football  
player, was indicted Thursday for allegedly lying to grand juries 
during a federal probe of illegal sports gambling at the Evanston 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Brown, 26, lied to grand juries in 1995 and  
again in 1998 when he denied placing bets on basketball and 
football games through campus bookie Brian Ballarini. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he didn't know that his roommate, Gregory Gill, and  
other athletes were also placing bets on games, according to a 
statement from U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, from Holland, Mich., played at Northwestern from 1991  
through 1994 and graduated in June 1995. His arraignment has yet to 
be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill, 28, pleaded guilty Thursday to the same perjury charge  
Brown is facing and is expected to be sentenced July 27. He now 
lives in suburban Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballarini, 25, was sentenced earlier this month to three years  
probation.

<HEADLINE> Family Angry After Boy Leaves Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALDWELL, Idaho (AP) -- Dan Engelbert kissed his son goodbye and  
put him aboard an airplane for a trip to visit his grandparents. 
Eleven-year-old Seth ended up on an entirely different journey, and 
his parents are furious. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy apparently walked off United Airlines Flight 2221 just  
before it left the Boise Air Terminal, then walked and trotted 30 
miles along a busy interstate to his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth's parents say the airline was wrong to let the boy off the  
plane, did little to ease their distress while their son was 
missing and refuses to take responsibility or apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were thinking about burying him. How do we tell the four  
other children we can't find him?'' said his mother, Corina 
Newfield. 
</P>
<P>
	United and Boise Air Terminal officials stand by their handling  
of the April 11 incident. The parents considered a lawsuit, but 
believe they would have little chance of success against a huge 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth was supposed to fly to Long Beach, Calif., with a stopover  
in San Francisco. His parents paid an extra $30 for special 
attention for Seth. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelbert said he watched his son walk down the ramp to the  
airplane, then left. 
</P>
<P>
	United's Boise general manager, Joe Marotta, said parents of  
children flying alone are required to remain in the gate area until 
the plane departs. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth apparently wanted a last hug from his father, and the  
flight attendant allowed him to leave. Seth roamed the airport 
looking for his father and left when officers refused to let him 
back through the security checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	In the parking lot, he thought he saw the family car pull onto  
the freeway. A gas station attendant pointed Seth toward Caldwell, 
and the boy started what turned into a five-hour trip on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	When Engelbert got home, Newfield told him a United employee had  
called to say Seth was not on the plane when it arrived in San 
Francisco. The couple raced back to Boise, where they contend 
airport security officers ``just blew us off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airport manager John Anderson said his officers conducted a  
full-scale search and placed an all-points bulletin with police. He 
said one airport officer even drove eight miles down the interstate 
looking for the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth, meanwhile, made it to Caldwell, where a homeowner took the  
boy in, fed him and called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember what time it was, but I was freezing,'' the  
boy said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a week later, the family still is angry.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think, emotionally, it made Seth think he's stupid, he's  
ignorant,'' Newfield said. ``Dan is a big hillbilly and we're at 
fault for trusting United.''

<HEADLINE> Steel Imports Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel imports rose in March after a four-month  
decline, a reversal that could help boost support in Congress for 
quotas on foreign shipments, the Commerce Department reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of foreign steel to the United States totaled 2.5  
million metric tons in March, according to preliminary government 
figures. That's a 25 percent increase from the 2 million metric 
tons a month earlier. Still, the total represented a 30 percent 
drop from November. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments from Japan and Brazil, two of the chief targets of the  
U.S. industry's trade complaints, recorded a one-month increase of 
39 percent and 54 percent, respectively. Russia, which has 
tentatively agreed to reduce future shipments to the United States, 
posted a 53 percent reduction in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia, South Korea and Taiwan also posted increases.  
</P>
<P>
	The imports are blamed for thousands of layoffs and bankruptcies  
at three U.S. companies. They resulted from the Asian economic 
crisis, which lowered demand for steel abroad and forced foreign 
producers to increasingly rely on U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest steel numbers are likely to add fuel to industry  
arguments that despite preliminary U.S. rulings threatening 
punitive tariffs on hot-rolled carbon steel from Japan, Russia and 
Brazil, those countries could simply shift to other products. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has been seeking even tougher sanctions. Last  
month, the House overwhelmingly passed a quota bill despite the 
threat of a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic producers and their unionized workers believe a  
comprehensive response is needed to avoid product shifting and to 
keep other countries from filling the void on hot-rolled steel, a 
major steel product. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past several months, the administration has struggled  
over the proper response to last year's surge in foreign shipments, 
fearing that too high a trade barrier could start a trade war and 
hurt the ability of U.S. companies in other industries to send 
goods abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials prefer to let the problems ease without  
the stronger sanctions. Steelworkers, a key ally of Democrats, have 
been vocal about demanding quotas.

<HEADLINE> Scottie Pippen Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen was arrested on suspicion of  
driving while intoxicated early this morning after running a red 
light, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer who stopped the Houston Rockets star about 1:30 a.m.  
in downtown Houston was said to have called a member of the 
department's DWI task force after suspecting Pippen was driving 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen did poorly on the field sobriety test and was taken into  
custody, where he was videotaped and given the opportunity to take 
a breathalyzer test, said police spokesman Fred King 
</P>
<P>
	After he refused, Pippen, 33, was booked on suspicion of DWI and  
released just before 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a seven-time NBA all-star with the Chicago Bulls,  
appeared cooperative, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any kind information about any trouble at all,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets spokesman Tim Frank would not discuss the arrest.  
</P>
<P>
	``All I can tell you is that he was arrested,'' Frank said. ``I  
have not seen any of the documentation on this, so I'd prefer not 
to comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How the arrest will affect Pippen's role with the team was  
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to get all the facts before we start looking  
at any team policy,'' Frank said. ``I think that would be 
premature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Pippen left the Bulls, where he had spent his  
11-year pro career, and signed a five-year, $67.2 million contract 
with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Pippen scored just four points Wednesday night in  
the Rockets' 109-95 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. He missed all 
four of his 3-point tries and was 2-8 from the field.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in 11-Year-Old's Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man was indicted Thursday on charges of  
murdering an 11-year-old girl -- a crime for which two little boys 
originally were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd Durr was ordered held without bail in the slaying of honor  
student Ryan Harris. He was already being held in three other 
attacks on little girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan was found July 28 in a South Side lot, sexually molested  
and beaten, with her skull fractured, her underpants stuffed in her 
mouth and twigs and leaves in her nostrils. 
</P>
<P>
	A 40-count indictment charges him with first-degree murder,  
aggravated sexual assault and kidnapping in the girl's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Geary Kull said his client was ``despondent''  
over the charges. He questioned whether Durr could get a fair trial 
in view of the heavy media attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``These charges are ugly,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Two boys, 7 and 8, were charged 12 days later after being  
interrogated by police. But the charges were dropped Sept. 4 when 
semen was found in the girl's underpants. Medical experts said the 
boys were probably too young to produce semen. 
</P>
<P>
	Durr was first named a suspect in Ryan's death in October. At  
the time, prosecutors said he admitted performing a sex act over 
her body but denied killing her. 
</P>
<P>
	The long period during which Durr was not charged angered many  
Chicago residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Anger lingers as well over the treatment of the two boys. The  
family of the 8-year-old boy has sued the city for $100 million, 
charging that detectives framed the boys despite evidence an adult 
committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``My client will always be the 8-year-old who was charged with  
murder,'' attorney Andre Grant said after Durr's indictment was 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the boy was himself an honor student but now is failing  
in school, has nightmares and is afraid to play with other 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent  
Terry Hillard acknowledged errors had led to charges against the 
youngsters and said new procedures have been put in place to 
prevent a repeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very troubled by what happened last summer, for a lot  
of people, not the least being Ryan Harris, her family and the 
families of those involved,'' Hillard said.

<HEADLINE> Utah Polygamist Pleads No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOGAN, Utah (AP) -- With jury selection less than half over, a  
member of a well-known polygamous clan passed a note to the 
daughter he was accused of beating and forcing to marry his 
brother, then pleaded guilty to child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	John Daniel Kingston, 44, had been charged with second-degree  
child abuse, which brings up to 15 years in prison. He pleaded 
guilty Wednesday to third-degree child abuse, for which he could be 
sentenced to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't known what was in the note Kingston passed to his  
17-year-old daughter, who claims her father made her marry his 
brother and, when she ran away, whipped her with a belt until she 
fainted. 
</P>
<P>
	``After seeing (my daughter) here, I feel like it would be in  
her best interest not to put her through more than what she has 
already gone through,'' Kingston told Judge Ben Hadfield, who 
scheduled sentencing for June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl cried as her father spoke.  
</P>
<P>
	``She wanted her father to admit to the charges and say he was  
sorry,'' said sheriff's Detective Scott Cosgrove, who investigated 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases against Kingston and his brother, David Ortell  
Kingston, 32 -- who faces trial in June on an incest charge -- have 
generated enormous interest in a state with an estimated 25,000 
polygamists. 
</P>
<P>
	Plural marriage was abandoned by the Mormon church in 1890 and  
outlawed by the state, but numerous sects with Mormon roots 
continue the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of anti-polygamous groups praised Kingston's daughter  
for pursuing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time that we've actually seen a polygamist  
accused and prosecuted and the outcome was good,'' said Carmen 
Thompson, spokeswoman for Tapestry of Polygamy, an advocacy group 
comprised of former polygamous wives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the message that is sent is that women and children in  
polygamy can trust the outside world and the justice system does 
work.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against the Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen and the  
euro Thursday, unable to hold onto gains made during a 
rollercoaster day of trading. The euro hit its lowest level yet and 
the dollar rose above 120 yen before reversing course. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0614, up  
from $1.0611 late Wednesday. During the day, the euro fell to 
$1.0561, its lowest level since it began trading in January on 
behalf of 11 European nations. The dollar was worth 119.52 Japanese 
yen, down from 119.73 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially rose in Asia as high as 120.40 yen as  
traders anticipated the actions of finance officials from the Group 
of Seven industrialized nations meeting Monday in Washington. 
Traders expected Japan to seek a public commitment for keeping the 
dollar above 120 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the dollar slid as traders rethought that strategy,  
recalling that G-7 communiques ``tend not to focus on a specific 
level,'' said Lisa Finstrom, a senior currency futures analyst at 
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. The dollar's upward move also was capped 
by Japanese exporters who sold dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell to its newest low as traders continued to worry  
about the costs of the ongoing struggle in Kosovo, the possibility 
of ground troops being introduced there and the strength of U.S. 
stocks. The Dow Jones industrials rode to another high, rising 
145.76 points. 
</P>
<P>
	French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn was quoted by the  
Wall Street Journal Thursday as saying that a further fall in the 
euro ``doesn't appear desirable.'' He also said that Europe's 
economic growth was good. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5084 Swiss francs, up from 1.5073,  
and 1.4793 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4868. The British pound 
was quoted at $1.6139, up from $1.6064. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8426 
German marks, down from 1.8433; and 6.1805 French francs and 
1,824.82 Italian lire, both unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Largest Lava Flow Ever Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Volcanic rocks newly discovered in Brazil  
indicate that an eruption 200 million years ago produced the most 
widespread lava flow in Earth's history, splitting apart North and 
South America, Europe and Africa. Scientists say it may have caused 
a massive extinction at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	A previously unrecognized area of ancient lava flow covering  
about 965,000 square miles in the Amazon basin turns out to be 
related to lava flows on three other continents, researchers say in 
Friday's issue of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The eruption occurred at the same time and had the same origin  
as lava flows found in North America, Africa and Europe, said Paul 
Renne of the University of California at Berkeley, who led the 
international team that conducted the research. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he added in a telephone interview, an early mass extinction  
at the same time seems likely to have been connected to the huge 
magma flow. The giant dinosaurs made popular in recent movies 
developed after this period and were killed off in another mass 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	The great eruption, which occurred over a few million years,  
tore apart the ancient continent of Pangea, opening up what is now 
the Atlantic Ocean, the scientists reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The lava field it produced has been named the Central Atlantic  
Magmatic Province, or CAMP. With the addition of the newly found 
Brazilian flow, it totals some 2.7 million square miles, Renne 
said, adding, ``We don't really know for sure that we've got it all 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the best known portion of CAMP for Americans are the  
palisades, towering along the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the next largest known lava flows are the Deccan  
Traps in India and the Siberian Traps, each just under half the 
size of CAMP. 
</P>
<P>
	Because different parts of CAMP are located on different  
continents they had been studied separately, Renne said, so no one 
previously recognized the region's full extent. 
</P>
<P>
	He likened it to several blind people touching different parts  
of an elephant and trying to describe the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	The eruptions would have released a variety of gases into the  
atmosphere and thus were probably a factor in the extinction of 
much sea life and early reptiles that occurred at the time, known 
as the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best example of flood basalts associated with an  
extinction,'' Renne said. ``Some of the best stratigraphic evidence 
of the mass extinction occurs in exactly the same site in which you 
find the flood basalts -- they sit right smack on top of one 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been at least four mass extinctions in Earth's  
history and their causes spark sharp debate among scientists. Giant 
lava flows are suspected in some cases, while meteors striking the 
Earth are viable candidates for the cause of others.

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh Students Want Gay Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A group of University of Pittsburgh students  
are in the eleventh day of a hunger strike, protesting the school's 
refusal to extend medical benefits to the lesbian partner of a 
former writing instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22 students say they will end their hunger strike if the  
Board of Trustees meets with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel that starvation is any worse than  
discrimination,'' said Robin Moll, 25, a senior creative writing 
major who has dropped 20 pounds since the strike began. She and 
other students at a news conference Wednesday wore T-shirts that 
read ``Hunger Strike for Human Rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute began three years ago when instructor Deborah Henson  
filed a complaint with the city's Human Relations Commission 
accusing the school of violating a city ordinance banning 
discrimination against gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	The university argued that the city has no authority to enforce  
the law because the state of Pennsylvania does not have such a 
statute. State law provides protection based on race, color, 
religion, age, sex, nationality and disabilities but not sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights advocates said the university's action threatens  
civil rights laws in Pittsburgh and other Pennsylvania cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you remove the ordinance, it would be perfectly legal to  
discriminate against gay people in Pittsburgh,'' said ACLU attorney 
Christine Biancheria. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Mark Nordenburg met with the student hunger strikers,  
but said he could not force the trustees to meet with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members have declined interviews and referred questions to  
school spokesman Ken Service, who said members were considering 
their request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand the students are acting out of principle, but we  
think it's misplaced,'' Service said. ``The appropriate forum to 
argue the point in question is in the state legislature.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton, Students Air Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Among the same literary classics and  
reference volumes that stock the library -- now crime scene -- at 
Columbine High, President Clinton sat with students at another high 
school Thursday and confronted their mix of anger, frustration and 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
	He sought to assure: ``On balance, our schools are still the  
safest place our kids can be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He sought to prescribe: A safety hot line in schools could give  
students an ``alarm bell'' against violent peers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But across the ring of orange chairs arranged for Clinton in the  
fiction section of the T.C. Williams High School library, Jonelle 
Mitchell wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to have that guarantee of safety and, truthfully, I  
don't feel safe any more,'' pleaded Mitchell, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``When are YOU going to do something for the students out  
there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appeared helpless.  
</P>
<P>
	He said something about the federal government not running  
schools. He promised to send a bill to Congress proposing more 
funds for prevention programs. He talked about the 
violence-prevention guide that his administration sent to 200,000 
schools last fall and planned to distribute to 150,000 more next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, a senior, later said she was disappointed. ``I just  
wanted to know that something was going to be done immediately,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene from Clinton's visit to this suburban Washington  
school seemed to encapsulate the futility and determination felt by 
students, parents, policy-makers and educators as they search for 
answers in the aftermath of the shootings Tuesday at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	While facts continue to trickle out about the two students there  
who apparently killed 12 classmates, a teacher and themselves, 
Clinton reached for a diagnosis, noting reports the killers felt 
ostracized by their peers and embraced racist views. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had the wrong reaction to the fact they were `dissed,'''  
Clinton said. ``Look, everybody gets `dissed' some time in life -- 
even the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To snickers, Clinton added: ``Sometimes, especially the  
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had ``some pretty tough times'' when he was a  
teen-ager and recalled how getting in the right group can feel like 
everything. He urged that children be taught early how to deal with 
anger, loneliness and alienation. 
</P>
<P>
	School uniforms or a ``nonprovocative-dress'' code could address  
``this whole black trenchcoat deal,'' Clinton said, making 
reference to the dress of the killers at Columbine High. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cuico, a studded choker around his neck, said he feared the  
Littleton episode would launch a ``backlash'' against students into 
rock music and Gothic culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Four chairs down, Patrick Egan said policy-makers must ``be  
careful that we ensure people's security without running high 
school like a prison system ... treating young people like 
second-class citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Egan echoed the popular gripe when metal detectors were first  
installed at airports, Clinton said. ``And then people saw planes 
hijacked and blown up, and they said, 'Please infringe my liberty a 
little bit.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 30 students who met with Clinton at T.C. Williams  
extolled their full-time counselors, peer mediators and anonymous 
hot lines as a good way for students to report and deal with 
anti-social behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as they engaged Clinton in an hourlong conversation,  
news reports from 1,500 miles away said investigators found a bomb 
built from a 20-pound propane tank in the Littleton school's 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Doo Kim, in baggy track pants and a shag haircut streaked  
orange, was incredulous that the Internet makes bomb recipes 
available to children. ``What is our government doing to prevent 
this?'' Parents must patrol their children's computer use, Clinton 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want me to choke off the Internet. It's one of the  
greatest things that ever happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The session offered Clinton a chance to talk through issues of  
school safety with students. 
</P>
<P>
	But bits of the discussion appeared to hit a personal nerve.  
</P>
<P>
	Arguing against the adage ``sticks and stones may break my  
bones, but words will never hurt me,'' Clinton said much 
destruction starts with words. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially in Washington, Clinton said, too little gets  
accomplished because people ``at the highest levels of power and 
influence get hurt by what other people say about them -- mean, bad 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Tyler Cotrone asked how youngsters end up with guns,  
Clinton sounded defensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every little thing I've tried to do -- from the passing of the  
Brady Bill to the passing of the assault-weapons ban -- all of these 
things have met with violent opposition as if I were trying to 
destroy the American way of life,'' Clinton said.

reference volumes that stock the library -- now crime scene -- at 
Columbine High, President Clinton sat with students at another high 
school Thursday and confronted their mix of anger, frustration and 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
	He sought to assure: ``On balance, our schools are still the  
safest place our kids can be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He sought to prescribe: A safety hot line in schools could give  
students an ``alarm bell'' against violent peers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But across the ring of orange chairs arranged for Clinton in the  
fiction section of the T.C. Williams High School library, Jonelle 
Mitchell wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to have that guarantee of safety and, truthfully, I  
don't feel safe any more,'' pleaded Mitchell, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``When are YOU going to do something for the students out  
there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appeared helpless.  
</P>
<P>
	He said something about the federal government not running  
schools. He promised to send a bill to Congress proposing more 
funds for prevention programs. He talked about the 
violence-prevention guide that his administration sent to 200,000 
schools last fall and planned to distribute to 150,000 more next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, a senior, later said she was disappointed. ``I just  
wanted to know that something was going to be done immediately,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene from Clinton's visit to this suburban Washington  
school seemed to encapsulate the futility and determination felt by 
students, parents, policy-makers and educators as they search for 
answers in the aftermath of the shootings Tuesday at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	While facts continue to trickle out about the two students there  
who apparently killed 12 classmates, a teacher and themselves, 
Clinton reached for a diagnosis, noting reports the killers felt 
ostracized by their peers and embraced racist views. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had the wrong reaction to the fact they were `dissed,'''  
Clinton said. ``Look, everybody gets `dissed' some time in life -- 
even the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To snickers, Clinton added: ``Sometimes, especially the  
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had ``some pretty tough times'' when he was a  
teen-ager and recalled how getting in the right group can feel like 
everything. He urged that children be taught early how to deal with 
anger, loneliness and alienation. 
</P>
<P>
	School uniforms or a ``nonprovocative-dress'' code could address  
``this whole black trenchcoat deal,'' Clinton said, making 
reference to the dress of the killers at Columbine High. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cuico, a studded choker around his neck, said he feared the  
Littleton episode would launch a ``backlash'' against students into 
rock music and Gothic culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Four chairs down, Patrick Egan said policy-makers must ``be  
careful that we ensure people's security without running high 
school like a prison system ... treating young people like 
second-class citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Egan echoed the popular gripe when metal detectors were first  
installed at airports, Clinton said. ``And then people saw planes 
hijacked and blown up, and they said, 'Please infringe my liberty a 
little bit.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 30 students who met with Clinton at T.C. Williams  
extolled their full-time counselors, peer mediators and anonymous 
hot lines as a good way for students to report and deal with 
anti-social behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as they engaged Clinton in an hourlong conversation,  
news reports from 1,500 miles away said investigators found a bomb 
built from a 20-pound propane tank in the Littleton school's 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Doo Kim, in baggy track pants and a shag haircut streaked  
orange, was incredulous that the Internet makes bomb recipes 
available to children. ``What is our government doing to prevent 
this?'' Parents must patrol their children's computer use, Clinton 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want me to choke off the Internet. It's one of the  
greatest things that ever happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The session offered Clinton a chance to talk through issues of  
school safety with students. 
</P>
<P>
	But bits of the discussion appeared to hit a personal nerve.  
</P>
<P>
	Arguing against the adage ``sticks and stones may break my  
bones, but words will never hurt me,'' Clinton said much 
destruction starts with words. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially in Washington, Clinton said, too little gets  
accomplished because people ``at the highest levels of power and 
influence get hurt by what other people say about them -- mean, bad 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Tyler Cotrone asked how youngsters end up with guns,  
Clinton sounded defensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every little thing I've tried to do -- from the passing of the  
Brady Bill to the passing of the assault-weapons ban -- all of these 
things have met with violent opposition as if I were trying to 
destroy the American way of life,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Spring Wakes Up Florida Alligators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Jimmy Jordan couldn't believe it. Walking his  
dog, Pete, along a lake in St. Petersburg, he whistled for the 
golden retriever and then watched in horror. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as he looked back at me, the alligator grabbed him by  
his whole head and whipped him into the water and was gone,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could easily have been a child. This thing could have  
taken anybody, anything just as quickly as it took an 85-pound dog. 
And that's insane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warm spring days are awakening cold-blooded gators from their  
winter sluggishness, animal experts said Thursday. And as the 
reptiles search for food and mates, they're making their presence 
felt in developed areas that used to be their home turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``In residential areas where you have canals or ponds ... you  
never know where an alligator might pop up,'' said Jim Huffstodt of 
the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. ``In front of 
your garage door, in your swimming pool ... they end up in the 
oddest places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is found in  
rivers and swampy lowlands of the southeastern United States, 
ranging from North Carolina to the Rio Grande in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, which has the most gators, there have been 248  
alligator attacks on humans since 1948, Huffstodt said. Half of 
them involved children, and nine were fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-foot bull alligator that snatched Jordan's dog last week  
was in a city lake directly behind a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-foot beast in Fort Myers recently snapped at a bobbing  
volleyball while the residents of an RV park looked on. The gator 
grabbed its inflatable prey and swam around a lake for three hours 
with the ball trapped between its teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gator-human interaction tends to increase during peak alligator  
activity from late March through June, Huffstodt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That sun is their alarm clock, and when we get relatively  
consistently warm days, their blood warms up,'' he said. ``They 
start to move out and they start to look around. They're looking 
for food ... and they're looking for mates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reptiles are a protected species, but the state commission  
issues permits to trappers for complaints about gators that are 
extremely large or that have lost their fear of humans. Some 12,865 
permits were issued statewide last year, mostly in the St. 
Petersburg and Fort Myers area. 
</P>
<P>
	The chance of a person dying from an alligator attack is much  
lower than death by drowning or lightning strike, according to the 
fish and game commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Less severe attacks come from alligator mothers protecting their  
young during mating season, said wildlife biologist Christopher 
Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	As water temperatures increase, alligators have less reason to  
leave the water to warm up, and that decreases the chances of human 
interaction, Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the alligator is a predator, a very primitive animal with  
a small brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know why certain situations trigger attacks,''  
Huffstodt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gators four feet and larger eat just about anything: large  
turtles, fish, wading birds, ducks, muskrats, nutria, otters, 
raccoons, carrion, an occasional deer and even other alligators. 
</P>
<P>
	And as Jordan knows, they can also take down a dog. He was  
furious to learn the gator that snatched Pete was a well-known 
presence in the lake. The creature even had a nickname -- Old 
Grandpa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything over 4 feet has to come out and be relocated'' from  
public parks, Jordan said. ``It's just too much to have an 
alligator that size and that mean, that wily, to be anywhere where 
... it had access to residential homes.''

	Colo. Shooters Planned Explosion  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The discovery of two powerful bombs  
today in Columbine High School's kitchen has heightened suspicions 
that the two gunmen behind Tuesday's massacre had help from other 
people. Investigators said Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, 
were planning to blow up their school. ``It's a feeling from our 
investigators that the chances are very, very good that we have 
more than two people involved,'' a sheriff's spokesman said. 
Authorities had already been looking into the possibility of 
additional suspects because of the amount of ammunition and 
explosives left behind. Two days after the attack, 14 people 
remained hospitalized.

	Clinton Backs NATO on Ground Troops  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After meeting with NATO Secretary-General  
Javier Solana at the White House, President Clinton today said he 
supported NATO's decision to prepare a new military assessment on 
the use of ground troops against Yugoslavia. But while he called 
the move ``wise and prudent,'' Clinton insisted this was not a step 
toward a land campaign. Meanwhile, Pentagon officials presented a 
comprehensive briefing of damage inflicted so far. Air Force Maj. 
Gen. Charles Wald suggested that NATO has been so effective in 
crippling Slobodan Milosevic's lines of communication that the 
Yugoslav leader probably does not know the full extent of damage. 

</P>
<P>
	Milosevic May Accept U.N. `Presence'  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic will  
accept a U.N.-led force in Kosovo, but only if the bombing stops 
and NATO withdraws troops from his borders, a Russian envoy said 
today. But former Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin said that 
what kind of international force it will be or from which countries 
it would be assembled had not yet been discussed. NATO has insisted 
it must lead an armed presence in Kosovo to enforce any peace 
agreement. In Washington, President Clinton said he had not studied 
the offer but added, ``I suppose that represents some step 
forward.'' 

</P>
<P>
	NATO Summit Will Address Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders toned down this weekend's  
celebration of the alliance's 50th birthday and pledged their 
summit would focus on stopping the bloodshed in Kosovo. With a 
swarm of VIP jets delivering leaders of 19 NATO nations and 23 
partner countries to the capital for three days of summitry, 
President Clinton declared: ``Our alliance is strongly united 
today.'' Washington braced for limousine gridlock and tight 
restrictions in a 100-block downtown security zone.

	Capitol Suspect Ruled Incompetent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man accused of killing two police officers  
in the Capitol last summer is incompetent to stand trial, U.S. 
District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled today. Sullivan ordered 
Russell Eugene Weston Jr. placed in a facility that offers mental 
health services. He set a conference for Sept. 9 to evaluate 
Weston's treatment and its effect on his competency. Weston is 
charged with murdering Capitol Police officers John M. Gibson and 
Jacob J. Chestnut. He has not entered a plea.

	Deadbeats Contribute to Poverty  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Absentee parents who fail to pay child support  
often have children who could really use it: One-third of their 
kids live in poverty, the Census Bureau reports. The numbers 
spotlight a striking problem in the era of welfare reform, where 
child support is supposed to make up some of the money lost when 
families leave the rolls. The report also points to the importance 
of connecting non-custodial parents to their children. Just 35 
percent of parents without joint custody or visitation agreements 
made payments in 1995.

	AT&AMP;T Makes $58B Bid For MediaOne  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. offered $58 billion today for  
MediaOne, the nation's fourth-largest cable-television company, 
hoping to thwart a merger agreement that Comcast Corp. and MediaOne 
reached two months ago. AT&AMP;T said its rival bid, a combination of 
cash and stock, exceeded the value of the Comcast deal by 17 
percent. An AT&AMP;T deal would make the nation's largest 
telecommunications company also its No. 1 cable TV company.

reached last week. The union said the league had introduced

<HEADLINE> National Semiconductor Lays Off 165 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- National Semiconductor has laid off 165  
workers, about 10 percent of the total at its Singapore plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs announced Thursday show that Singapore's economic  
problems are not over despite recent optimism that Asia's financial 
crisis may be easing, officials in the island republic said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Semiconductor plant in Singapore is a subsidiary of  
National Semiconductor Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif. The company 
makes chips for personal computers, communications and consumer 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	A record 28,300 people were laid off in Singapore last year, the  
highest number since the 19,529 lost jobs in 1985 during the last 
recession. The unemployment rate has tripled to 4.3 percent over 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	National Semiconductor said it would provide benefits as  
outlined in its collective agreement, outplacement services and 
some medical insurance coverage for six months to the laid-ff 
employees. It said it would also help employees pay for training 
courses to raise their skill levels.

<HEADLINE> Investors Can Express Views Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shareholder democracy has gone online. A new  
Web site allows investors to tell companies their views on more 
than 200 shareholder resolutions on such issues as affirmative 
action, job discrimination and labor practices overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	As an alternative to picketing corporate headquarters,  
shareholders can go to an Internet site called the Shareholder 
Activism Center, which describes itself as a financial information 
site for ``socially responsible'' investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, anyone can express their views on shareholder proposals  
using the Web site: they don't have to own shares in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The new project, announced Wednesday, was developed by the  
Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based 
group made up ofsome 200 religious institutional investors. The Web 
site is at www.socialfunds.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers say the project grew out of a successful campaign last  
spring in which more than 2,000 people and groups sent letters to 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, pushing to give 
shareholders a bigger voice in how companies are run. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the SEC reversed its longstanding policy, opening  
the way for shareholder votes on a range of social issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC adopted changes requiring companies to consider a  
variety of proposals from shareholders. Proposals that raise 
``significant social policy matters,'' such as hiring and labor 
policies, are no longer automatically barred from being voted on by 
all company stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also dropped an earlier provision that would have  
made it more difficult for shareholders to resubmit proposals that 
failed to receive certain levels of voting support. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Falk, a former investment manager and a director of the  
Social Investment Forum who established the new Web site, called it 
``an exciting means by which to harness the power of the Web in 
order to give a voice to investors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesman John Heine had no immediate comment on the  
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the Web site, people can express their views on social  
issues to individual companies or a group of companies linked by a 
category of issues. Categories include the environment, corporate 
accountability, health and tobacco, corporate governance and 
executive pay, hiring and employment practices, and global finance. 
</P>
<P>
	The messages sent to companies do not constitute actual proxy  
votes on the shareholder resolutions. The Web site provides 
instructions to shareholders on filing proxy votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Investment Forum was among the 340 groups that  
mounted the lobbying campaign to reverse the SEC's stance on 
shareholder resolutions. The criticsalso included the AFL-CIO and 
other unions, the Episcopal Church, Catholic, Jewish and Baptist 
groups, the National Organization for Women, civil rights groups, 
environmentalists, children's advocates, the YWCA and some 
corporations and financial firms -- such as Burrito Brothers and 
U.S. Trust Co. of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the changes it adopted last year, the SEC reversed  
its policy on a high-profile case involving shareholders' 
unsuccessful attempts to force a vote on hiring practices at 
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc., based in Lebanon, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved a shareholder proposal to bar the restaurant  
company from discriminating against gay job applicants. The company 
refused to include the proposal on its proxy statement for a vote 
by all shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Reversing its policy, the SEC said Cracker Barrel could not  
legitimately exclude the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Group May Buy Chip Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Hyundai Group has agreed to pay 2.56  
trillion won ($2.13 billion) to buy a computer memory chip-making 
arm of LG Group, a government official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement ended months of tough negotiations over the deal,  
which is a key part of government efforts to restructure South 
Korea's bloated conglomerates, or chaebol. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can consider it a deal done because there are only  
procedural matters left,'' said Lee Hun-jae, head of the 
government's Financial Supervisory Commission, which oversees 
corporate reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Hyundai will take a 59.98 percent stake in LG  
Semicon. LG Semicon's remaining shares are owned by individual 
minority shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was reached more than three months after the two groups  
agreed to the takeover that would make Hyundai Electronics Industry 
Co. the world's largest computer memory chip maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai and LG together accounted for 20.8 percent of the  
world's $23.9 billion memory chip market last year. Samsung 
Electronics Co., also of South Korea, had 20.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The two groups acknowledged that they were close to agreement  
but refused to comment on Lee's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The national Yonhap News agency said that in addition to the  
price, Hyundai agreed to guarantee job security for LG Semicon 
workers. The two sides were discussing how and when Hyundai would 
pay the LG Group, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai, the nation's top-ranked conglomerate, and LG Group,  
which is No. 3, have been pushing the merger to cut out overlapping 
investments and boost competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean conglomerates have been accused of excessive  
expansion during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds for the 
current financial crisis that forced the nation to accept a $58 
billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim Dae-jung has been urging the nation's top five  
conglomerates -- Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK -- to merge or 
swap overlapping subsidiaries to boost foreign confidence in the 
South Korean economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In another major business deal, Daewoo Motors Co., the nation's  
second largest automaker, is pushing to take over the industry's 
newcomer, Samsung Motors Corp.

<HEADLINE> IBM Stock Rises on Profit News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM stock soared as much as 15 percent this  
morning after the big computer maker reported a 42 percent jump in 
first-quarter profits and across-the-board growth in revenue, 
greatly exceeding Wall Street's predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in its stock price, up $26.25 at $198.12 1/2 before  
retreating somewhat, powered the broader market higher. IBM shares 
accounted for most of a 90.78-point early rise in the Dow 
industrial average, of which the company is a component. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were expecting a strong quarter, but they beat our bullish  
expectations,'' said John Jones, an analyst with Salomon Smith 
Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question this was a big surprise,'' said George  
Elling, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``It's certainly excellent 
results in a quarter where Wall Street was wary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the three months ended March 31, International Business  
Machines Corp. earned $1.47 billion, or $1.55 a share, compared to 
earnings of $1.04 billion, or $1.06 a share, in the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted earnings of  
$1.41 a share for the Armonk, N.Y.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenue rose 15 percent to $20.3 billion from  
$17.6 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Jones and Elling cautioned, however, that the increases  
seen in virtually all sectors needed to be considered in light of a 
poor first-quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While IBM officials credited software and service revenue for 60  
percent of their gross profit, the computer giant's report had 
strength across the board, and throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardware sales rose 17 percent to $8.6 billion, with PC sales  
rising 50 percent to $3.6 billion. Server performance was mixed, 
though IBM noted strong sales for its System/390 server. 
</P>
<P>
	Software sales for both IBM and non-IBM platforms rose 10  
percent to $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from business services, through which IBM installs and  
runs corporate computers, rose 19 percent to $7.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Douglas Maine said during a conference  
call with analysts that IBM had received nine service contracts 
worth nearly $10 billion in the quarter -- including deals with AT&AMP;T 
Corp., CompUSA, Ford Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Trust -- and now has 
contracts totaling $55 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Louis Gerstner said in a statement  
that the results -- which set first-quarter records for earnings per 
share, revenue and net income -- were a ``direct reflection of the 
power of the strategies we have put in place over the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Services is clearly the largest and fastest-growing portion of  
the information technology industry, and we continue to extend our 
leadership position in each quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM also said it will continue to explore direct sales over the  
Internet to businesses and consumers. Maine said that IBM expects

added.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Cuts Budget After IOC Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The organizing committee for the Sydney  
Olympics today slashed $32 million from its expected revenue, 
blaming the International Olympic Committee's bribery scandal for 
sponsorship shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizers for months have been trying to rally sponsors  
to fill a hole in projected revenue, but conceded today that cuts 
will have to be made to keep the games within budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said the cuts would not affect athletes, spectators  
or the overall quality of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe the public will notice the changes,'' said  
Michael Knight, president of the Sydney Organizing Committee for 
the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the writedown, SOCOG announced it would add an  
extra $16 million to its ``rainy-day'' contingency fund, requiring 
further savings to be found in the games budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall reduction in the $1.6 billion games budget was $48  
million, some of which had already been achieved, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC bribery scandal has dominated Olympic news in  
the past four months, putting off many potential new sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last few months the focus in the media and elsewhere  
on the IOC problems has left us with a period in which it was 
incredibly difficult to go and pitch to sponsors,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly cost us in that circumstance.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the scandal,  
which involved a million-dollar scheme to buy votes in Salt Lake 
City's successful bid for the winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian IOC member Phil Coles was implicated in the Salt Lake  
scandal, and is still the subject of an IOC investigation into 
allegations he accepted gifts from someone associated with Athens' 
1996 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A Games Priorities Committee made up of Knight, SOCOG chief  
executive Sandy Hollway and vice-president John Coates will make 
recommendations to the board on where the cuts should be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Coates said ``economies'' might be made in the Olympic village  
and in the running of sports venues, including staffing levels and 
perhaps the merging some services.

<HEADLINE> New York To Host DiMaggio Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio's friends thought a memorial  
service at St. Patrick's Cathedral would be an appropriate way to 
honor the Hall of Fame outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	The church on Fifth Avenue is as much a New York landmark as  
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Babe Ruth and Billy Martin had funeral masses there, and the  
cathedral was the setting for a memorial Mass for Roger Maris. 
Longtime Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen was remembered there in a 
prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to give him the kind of a send-off he wanted ...  
first class for a first class man,'' said Dr. Rock Positano, who 
helped arrange today's service for DiMaggio, who died of 
complications from lung cancer on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list included Woody Allen, Henry Kissinger and Yogi  
Berra. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who buoyed DiMaggio's spirits  
with two visits during his illness, planned to be there, as well as 
Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's former attorney and next-door neighbor 
in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal John O'Connor was to officiate at the service.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Cardinal was a Philadelphia A's fan, but he was also a  
DiMaggio fan, and lately, a fan of the Yankees.'' archdiocese 
spokesman Joseph Zwilling said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The DiMaggio service starts a weekend that will culminate Sunday  
with the unveiling of a granite and bronze monument to the Yankee 
Clipper at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the same people who will be at the memorial service will  
participate in the ceremony at the stadium's Memorial Park, which 
also includes monuments to Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and 
Miller Huggins, who managed the Yankees from 1918 to 1929. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Simon, the singer-songwriter whose 1968 ``Mrs. Robinson''  
includes the line ``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio,'' and became 
a classic ode to nostalgia, will sing the song during the unveiling 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a tribute to DiMaggio on Wednesday in Hollywood,  
when a park was dedicated in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a perfect thing to do, and very appropriate because  
DiMaggio loved that park,'' Engelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bought a golf cart, and we would drive there two or three  
times a week -- it wasn't far from where we lived. Joe and I would 
sit there talking about sports and reading The New York Times for a 
couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe would love to watch the kids playing. He really enjoyed  
the place.''

<HEADLINE>  Muhammad Ali Backs Boxing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Silently but effectively, Muhammad Ali gave  
his support to boxing reform legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion, who suffers from Parkinson's  
syndrome, told the Senate Commerce Committee through longtime 
friend Howard Bingham that Ali is particularly interested in the 
parts of Sen. John McCain's bill that would stop exploitation of 
boxers by promoters 
</P>
<P>
	Bingham said the controversial Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield  
draw last month was the ``lowest point'' for a sport beset with 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ali has become increasingly upset about the scandals that have  
occurred in professional boxing,'' Bingham said Thursday as Ali 
gazed intently at committee members from a witness table. 
</P>
<P>
	One part of McCain's bill would prohibit ``coercive option''  
contracts that prevent fighters from controlling their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Muhammad Ali believes that fighters deserve the same  
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, respect, as all other professional athletes in this 
country,'' Bingham said. ``Currently, they aren't respected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona Republican and 2000 presidential aspirant,  
told Ali: ``Your support of this legislation is absolutely vital to 
our chances of passing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, McCain's bill would establish new standards  
for sanctioning organizations that rank fighters, create new 
financial disclosure requirements for promoters and event 
organizers, and require that state boxing commissions be informed 
when charges, costs and fees are taken from a boxer's purse. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an avid boxing fan who attended the Lewis-Holyfield  
fight, said the sport has too few ethical boundaries and a ranking 
system controlled by promoters that ``defies all reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When honest and open competition is inhibited, it is the  
boxers who suffer most,'' McCain said. ``But millions of 
ticket-buying fans in America are also hurt by monopolistic 
practices in boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former boxing referee Mills Lane, now a judge on a TV court  
show, said boxing's credibility suffers because sanctioning bodies 
-- the IBF, WBA and WBC -- play too large a role in which judges and 
referees work the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subtle pressures are there and nobody can tell me  
they're not,'' Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walter Stone, counsel to the International Boxing  
Federation, said fight organizers are already working to address 
the problems, such as a new IBF rule in which the No. 1 ranking 
cannot simply be assumed by a boxer moving up due to others' 
losses. Instead, one ranked boxer would have to beat another ranked 
boxer to take the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've recognized what the problems are and we've moved to try  
to correct them,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., expressed concern that the McCain bill  
might unfairly target certain promoters and invite numerous court 
challenges. He said the bill must address multiyear broadcast 
contracts in which contenders stay under a network's control in 
return for a shot at the champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question when it comes to revenues, the broadcast  
industry packs the biggest wallop,'' Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is likely to move the bill through the Commerce Committee  
later this year. An identical measure last year passed the Senate 
but went nowhere in the House.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Can't Agree on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From Capitol Hill to the campaign trial,  
Republicans are divided over the U.S.-led NATO airstrikes in 
Yugoslavia. And for all of the debate within the GOP, most 
Americans aren't listening anyway, a poll says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, says pollster Andrew Kohut, evidence that the Kosovo  
crisis has pulled down President Clinton's approval ratings on 
foreign policy suggests the issue has a ``potential for real 
political impact'' in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, the response to the NATO campaign ranges from  
general support to strong opposition to any military involvement in 
the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	In part, the reactions reflect a longtime rift within the GOP  
between isolationists and internationalists. In addition, lawmakers 
and candidates said in interviews, the lack of a clear party 
position reflects confusion over the definition of victory against 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, as well as the lack of 
direction from senior Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have some Republicans now who are saying, 'Look, now that  
we've started the war, let's win it,''' said Sen. Bob Smith, 
R-N.H., a longshot hopeful for the GOP presidential nomination. 
``Well, I don't know what they consider winning. Is winning 
returning the refugees to Kosovo? Is winning getting rid of 
Milosevic?'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have said little aside from supporting the mission  
now that it's in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	There are divisions as well on Kosovo among Democratic  
lawmakers, but generally they have been more supportive of Clinton 
in the Balkan conflict than Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	As GOP presidential hopefuls try to define themselves early in  
the nomination fight, their positions range from sending ground 
troops only if military leaders advocate them (Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush and Elizabeth Dole) to pushing for land war preparation now 
(Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.), to giving diplomacy another chance 
(Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Pat Buchanan oppose the mission outright.  
</P>
<P>
	Billionaire businessman Steve Forbes opposes sending ground  
troops. But he and another GOP presidential contender, former 
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, say NATO should arm the Kosovar 
refugees and train them to fight for their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander in an interview Thursday attributed the GOP split to  
the GOP being out of power. War-making policy is historically 
driven by the White House in the early stages of a conflict, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a president who is our agenda setter, so we have  
multiple voices on every issue,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a poll conducted April 15-18 by the Pew Research  
Center for the People and the Press, 60 percent of Americans 
surveyed support the air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 1,000 adults surveyed, less than a fifth had heard or read  
about the positions of any one candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's stance on Kosovo rang a bell with the most surveyed,  
with 17 percent saying they had knowledge of his thinking. Mrs. 
Dole's was the second-most known position, with 12 percent of the 
respondents saying they had heard about it. Bush, who has been more 
reticent on the matter, came in third with 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican congressional leaders struggling to hold  
their congressional majority in 2000 have stayed largely silent on 
Kosovo. But that hasn't stopped GOP lawmakers from speaking out. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., is trying to challenge the NATO  
campaign against Yugoslavia under a Vietnam War-era law that could 
confront the House with a stark choice next week. 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders of both parties were scrambling Thursday to try to  
find ways to avoid the votes on whether to invoke the 1973 War 
Powers Act. It would require withdrawal of U.S. forces from a war 
zone after 60 days unless Congress gives approval for the 
deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell vowed to press his challenge all the way to the Supreme  
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	In another expression of unease, nearly 80 Republican House  
members, joined by a handful of Democrats, wrote Appropriations 
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., asking him to include a 
provision in the next spending bill that would direct Clinton to 
seek reimbursement for the mission from other NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said the letter ``neither condones nor  
condemns U.S. involvement in Yugoslavia,'' underscoring the lengths 
GOP sponsors must take to bridge their internal policy gap.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Corn Tumble; Wheat Slips / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures tumbled Thursday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade after China said it will impose a tax on soybean meal 
imports. Corn and wheat also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans fell sharply as market participants were hit with  
a triple dose of bad news. China announced it on May 1 would begin 
imposing a 13 percent tax on soybean meal imports, while U.S. Agriculture 
Department Secretary Dan Glickman said there were no new talks scheduled 
for food donations to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
        Further, meteorologists' forecasts for a return of drier weather  
to the Midwest next week has boosted expectations farmers will be able 
to get into the fields and plant record acreage. A bumper harvest would 
add to bin-busting supplies that have been stored since last year because 
of a global economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures also fell. While the USDA announced weekly corn  
sales came in at an unexpectedly strong 1.1 million metric tons, investors 
said the figure will not boost annual sales projections. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures fell in sympathy with corn and soybeans, but  
held some of its ground on strong weekly export sales and overnight 
bids from Taiwan and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans for July delivery fell 11 1/2 cents to $4.91 3/4 a  
bushel; July corn fell 4 1/4 cents to $2.25 1/4 a bushel; July wheat 
fell 1/4 cent to $2.67 1/2 a bushel; July oats fell 1 1/2 cents to 
$1.20 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while lean hogs were mixed and pork bellies advanced. 
</P>
<P>
        June live cattle fell .83 cent to 62.67 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .78 cent to 70.82 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .12 cent to 55.60 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .60 cent 
to 55.30 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Surge Higher; Dow Up 96.79 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher Thursday as IBM's strong  
profit report lifted technology shares and sent the Dow Jones 
industrial average further into record high territory. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow was up 96.79 at 10,678.21,  
moving well past Wednesday's closing high of 10,581.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 10.41 to 1,346.53, and the Nasdaq composite 
index rose 40.46 to 2,529.54. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM led the Dow, rising 22 3/4 to 194 5/8, a gain of more than 13  
percent. After the market closed Wednesday, IBM reported 
first-quarter earnings of $1.55 a share, decisively beating 
year-ago results of $1.06 and analysts' estimates of $1.41. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's results reassured investors who have been nervously  
shuttling between technology issues and more conservative blue-chip 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Other big companies had positive earnings reports, but their  
stock prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron and McDonald's, both Dow components, met analysts  
forecasts, for their first quarter earnings. Chevron was down 1 
7/16 to 94 15/16 and McDonald's was up 1/16 to 45 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent Technologies was up 2 3/16 at 61 5/16, GTE fell 1 3/8 to 65 1/2  
and Bell Atlantic slipped 1 11/16 to 56 13/16. All either met or 
exceeded forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 427.8 million shares, 
up from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.50 at 636.21, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.03 to 752.62.

<HEADLINE> National TV Turnoff Week Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The government has some advice for kids: Turn  
off the TV and go outside and play. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher has thrown his support to National  
TV Turnoff Week, a usually little-noticed yearly effort to wean 
people of excessive tube watching. This year's TV Turnoff Week 
began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher, worried about an epidemic of obesity, said it would  
help to get up off the couch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the most sedentary generation of young people in  
American history,'' he said. ``Reducing the amount of television 
our children watch is one way to encourage more healthful 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through some schools, Satcher is distributing a ``prescription  
for less TV'' and urging parents to tape it in front of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor's prescription: ``Go bicycling, play soccer, jump  
rope, fly a kite, dance, start a garden, wash the dog, swim laps, 
clean your room, do gymnastics, throw a Frisbee, walk around the 
block, learn to rollerskate, build a fort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher's endorsement was a pleasant surprise to TV-Free  
America, the Washington advocacy group that has spearheaded 
National TV Turnoff Week for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government had never been involved before Satcher  
and Shirley Watkins, the undersecretary of agriculture for food, 
nutrition and consumer services, asked if they could endorse the 
effort, said Henry Labalme, executive director of TV-Free America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real watershed to have someone of Dr. Satcher's stature  
and influence and authority make the statement that Americans 
really need to cut back on their tube time for health reasons,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labalme estimated that 6 million people have pledged through  
schools, libraries and religious groups to go without TV for the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	His group says TV increases obesity, stifles creativity and  
shortens attention spans among young people. Nielsen Media Research 
estimated the average American TV viewer watched four hours and 
nine minutes of TV each day in March. 
</P>
<P>
	TV networks have never noticed a falloff in viewers during past  
TV Turnoff weeks, said David Poltrack, chief researcher at CBS. In 
fact, during some of the weeks, viewership has actually been above 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that doesn't discriminate and says that for a period  
of time you should watch no television is basically 
self-defeating,'' Poltrack said. ``There's no justification with 
all the good quality programming on television to call for a 
blanket boycott.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An executive with the popular childrens' cable network  
Nickelodeon said she supports the surgeon general's effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon occasionally runs a public service announcement  
called ``Actual Reality,'' encouraging children to experience life 
instead of watching televised versions of it, said Cyma Zarghami, 
Nick's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said it wasn't fair to blame Nick for sedentary kids.  
Studies show kids watch about the same amount of TV as they have 
for the past several years, Zarghami said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we're here as a great alternative for kids,'' she  
said. ``If we weren't here, they wouldn't necessarily be outside 
playing sports.''

<HEADLINE> Cooke Withdraws Redskins Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- John Kent Cooke wasn't going to win, so he  
quit the race. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that is either a ploy to gain sympathy from NFL owners  
or just an admission of defeat, team president Cooke withdrew his 
bid to buy the Washington Redskins on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week I presented a greatly increased offer to the other  
executors of my father's estate for the Washington Redskins and 
Jack Kent Cooke Stadium,'' Cooke said in a statement. ``The 
executors failed to act on my offer, and today I have withdrawn 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke's withdrawal will have little tangible effect on the  
current state of the sale. Sources close to the situation told The 
Associated Press that the trustees are close to a making a deal to 
sell the team to communications executive Daniel Snyder for $800 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was a partner with New York real estate developer Howard  
Milstein in an $800 million offer that in January was named the 
winner of a lengthy blind auction conducted by the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milstein withdrew the bid earlier this month when it became  
apparent that NFL owners would not approve it. The owners said 
Milstein was using too much borrowed money to finance the purchase, 
and there were also concerns about the type of owner he would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, head of Bethesda, Md.-based Snyder Communications, did  
have ready cash behind his part of the bid and was well received by 
some NFL owners. He has since assembled his own group that includes 
publishing executives Mort Zuckerman and Fred Drasner to match the 
$800 million offer he originally made with Milstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources told the AP that a deal with Snyder could be  
completed within 10 days and presented to the owners at the May 
25-26 league meetings in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, the trustees have essentially ignored Cooke's latest  
offer, which he said was higher than the $680 million he put on the 
table in the earlier round of bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to be used merely to increase the bids of others,  
since it is well known that I have always wanted to keep the 
Redskins in my family,'' Cooke said. ``My offer would have set a 
record for a sports franchise. It was financially sound and 
reflected today's fair market value of the Washington Redskins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A team spokesman said Cooke was out of town and would not  
elaborate on the statement, but team sources said Cooke had finally 
had enough in his contentious battle with the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke's remaining hope is that the league's owners will react  
negatively to Snyder's bid, just as they did Milstein's. 
</P>
<P>
	League officials refused to comment, but commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue indicated Saturday that the team could be sold on ``an 
expedited schedule,'' which seemed to imply that there would not be 
another round of open bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``(It's possible) we would present something at our league  
meeting in May, if not before,'' Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kent Cooke died April 6, 1997. Rather than leave the  
Redskins to his son, he instructed that the team be sold and the 
proceeds used to establish a scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the trustees declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Had Premonition in Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Months before they massacred a dozen  
students and a teacher, two high school students made a video 
portraying themselves in trench coats, shooting athletes as they 
walk down their school hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	The video was made for a class last fall.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold wearing black trench  
coats, walked into the school, spraying gunfire and setting off 
explosives before killing themselves. Witnesses said they targeted 
athletes, 
</P>
<P>
	In the video, the two ``had their friends pretend to be the  
jocks, and they pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' junior 
Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News Thursday. ``I saw 
the video Eric and Dylan made. .... It represented what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Veik, 16, who helped the two produce several videos, said  
all were in a similar genre. ``They always wore trench coats. They 
always wanted to be the intimidators, the good guys out to get the 
bad guys,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veik turned over three to four copies of the videos to police  
after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Teacher Garrett Talocco, who taught the class, declined comment,  
as did school district spokeswoman Kay Pride.

<HEADLINE> Korean Air to Shuffle Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The head of Korean Air stepped away  
from direct management of the airline today, two days after 
President Kim Dae-jung said the airline's poor safety record was 
giving his country a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
	Cho Yang-ho, 50, who had run Korean Air as president since 1992,  
left that post to become chairman of the airline, a subsidiary of 
the Hanjin Group. 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeds his father, Cho Joong-hoon, 79, who left the airline  
but will retain the chairmanship of Hanjin, South Korea's 
sixth-largest conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shim Yi-taek, 60, a vice president, replaces the junior Cho as  
the airline's president with direct, day-to-day management 
responsibility. Shim is considered one of the few professional 
aviation managers in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll do my utmost to build a new business culture with  
emphasis on the safety of human lives,'' Shim told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the senior Cho's departure would significantly  
affect the operation of Korean Air. His influence on the airline 
and its subsidiaries was overwhelming, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kang Bong-kyun, chief presidential secretary for economic  
affairs, welcomed the shakeup as an important step toward making 
the South Korean carrier safer to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim had demanded changes in the airline's management Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Korean Air must have professional managers,'' he told a  
Cabinet meeting. ``The issue of Korean Air is not a matter of an 
individual company but a matter of the whole county. Our country's 
credibility is at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the airline had put rapid expansion and profits ahead of  
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's comments came five days after a Korean Air cargo  
jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Shanghai last week, killing 
its three crewmen and six people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a series of accidents that have given  
Korean Air one of the worst safety records in commercial aviation. 
More than 700 people have died in Korean Air accidents in the past 
20 years, including 228 in the 1997 crash of a Boeing 747 on Guam. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Shanghai crash, Delta Air Lines dropped its  
code-sharing flight partnership with Korean Air, saying that it 
would not do business with any carrier it did not believe to be 
safe. Air Canada followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Beside the government pressure to change its management, Korean  
Air faced other penalties, including a drastic cut in its domestic 
and overseas flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air, formerly Korean Airlines, was founded 30 years ago  
by the senior Cho with eight planes flying domestic routes. The 
airline has since grown into the world's 13th largest carrier.

<HEADLINE> New, Safer Diabetes Drug Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Diabetics frightened by reports a popular  
treatment may destroy some patients' livers may soon get a new 
choice: Government advisers recommended Thursday the approval of 
Avandia, a drug that promises to fight diabetes with fewer liver 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	No one can say for certain that Avandia never will damage  
diabetics' livers, advisers to the Food and Drug Administration 
said. Indeed, they urged Avandia patients to have intensive liver 
testing similar to the kind now required for patients who take the 
controversial competing drug Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies of over 4,000 patients who tried Avandia have not shown  
signs it has damaged anyone's liver. Still, if liver damage is a 
rare side effect, as it is for Rezulin, then it may appear only as 
hundreds of thousands of diabetics try Avandia, said FDA panel 
chairman Dr. Henry Bone of the Michigan Bone and Mineral Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this drug is far safer,'' said Dr. Leonard Seef, a  
liver expert from the National Institutes of Health. But he joined 
other panelists in insisting patients get precautionary liver 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes, which afflicts  
millions of Americans whose bodies lose the ability to properly use 
insulin, the hormone that processes blood sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin, known chemically as troglitazone, was cheered widely  
when it hit the market in 1997 because it is the only drug sold 
that resensitizes the body to insulin. Many doctors contend it is 
invaluable for patients who have failed other diabetes therapies. 
Some 750,000 Americans now use the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Rezulin hit the market, however, it began causing  
liver failure. FDA officials list 43 Rezulin patients who suffered 
acute liver failure. Of those, 28 died and seven needed liver 
transplants to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA warned that those cases may represent only 10 percent of  
all Rezulin-related liver damage, and the agency's advisers last 
month urged that new restrictions be put on Rezulin's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	So diabetes specialists were excited to learn that FDA is  
considering new drugs -- SmithKline Beecham's Avandia and Takeda 
Pharmaceuticals' Actos -- that promise to provide Rezulin's benefit 
with fewer liver risks. Experts have predicted that if those two 
drugs pass FDA scrutiny, Rezulin use will fall dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA is not bound by Thursday's recommendation on Avandia,  
but typically follows the panel's advice. The advisers will not 
vote separately on Actos, but will get a sneak peak at that drug's 
safety on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the advisers recommended that every drug related to  
Rezulin bear warnings that call for liver tests until doctors are 
sure the drugs are less risky. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies, Avandia, known chemically as rosiglitazone,  
significantly lowered blood glucose, particularly when used with 
another popular diabetes drug called metformin. For some reason, it 
worked best in women. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big question was safety. In studies, no one suffered  
jaundice or liver failure -- but neither did any Rezulin patients 
when that drug first was studied. 
</P>
<P>
	To predict liver damage, doctors measure patients' liver  
enzymes. Elevations are a danger signal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rezulin's studies, 2 percent of patients showed significantly  
elevated liver enzymes. But Avandia patients had no difference in 
elevated liver enzymes compared with patients taking a placebo or 
other diabetes medicines, FDA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Why would Avandia be less risky? SmithKline said Avandia  
requires 100 times less drug per dose to treat diabetes, is 
metabolized differently and seems to accumulate far less in the 
liver. 
</P>
<P>
	But Avandia is not without risk, the FDA panel said. It can  
increase cholesterol levels, particularly the so-called ``bad 
cholesterol'' or LDL. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetics with high LDL levels probably should not be prescribed  
Avandia, and all patients need cholesterol tests, the panel said. 
Also, the drug seemed to cause weight gain of about 4 pounds to 6 
pounds, a concern because diabetics are supposed to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, animal studies suggested Avandia use in pregnancy  
can be toxic to fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin maker Parke Davis warned Thursday that no one will know  
if Avandia is safer until hundreds of thousands of diabetics try 
it.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Victims Had Big Dreams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Kelly Fleming wanted to write songs.  
Isaiah Shoels wanted to produce them. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey DePooter was saving to buy a boat so he might take his  
buddies fishing. Daniel Mauser joined the debate team to overcome 
his shyness. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Townsend, a candidate for valedictorian, spent spring  
break in England on a school trip. John Tomlin built homes for the 
poor in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Football players and thespians. Weightlifters and debaters.  
</P>
<P>
	They were among the 12 students and a popular teacher who were  
slain at Columbine High School on Tuesday before the gunmen -- two 
outcast schoolmates wearing black trench coats -- took their own 
lives. Twenty-three others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies, some fearsomely damaged, lay where they fell for  
more than a day until specialists cleared three dozen bombs from 
the school. Authorities released the names of the dead on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The director of one Littleton cemetery is offering to bury all  
of the victims in a special hillside plot with a memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	DePooter, 17, was a former wrestler. He quit so he could take a  
maintenence job at a golf club and save money for a fishing boat. 
He died hiding under a library table with friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Kechter, 16, was a junior football player who alternated  
on the offensive and defensive lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend, 18, was captain of the girls' volleyball team. Her  
mother was the coach. Teammates said she was ``consumed'' by the 
sport, but she also was a member of the National Honor Society and 
a valedictorian candidate at her graduation next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels was singled out because he was black, as well as a  
football player. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's no reason to die,'' said his father, Michael Shoels.  
</P>
<P>
	The younger Shoels wanted to be a music executive and talent  
scout like his father, who works for Notorious Records. The 
teen-ager survived open-heart surgery as a boy and, while only 
5-foot-4, played football and wrestled. He could bench-press twice 
his weight. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a popular figure at the overwhelmingly white high school.  
But Shoels had been previously threatened by the shooters' clique, 
the Trenchcoat Mafia. He and his sister, also a Columbine student, 
had complained to their parents and to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	When the shooters entered the school, Shoels was on their list.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were going through the halls shouting, `Where's that  
little nigger?''' Michael Shoels said. ``I had told them they 
should try to be stronger and try to be smarter. My son would be 
here today if I had listened to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cassie Bernall, 17, once considered life as bleakly as her  
killers. Friends and counselors said she was fascinated by 
witchcraft and suicide when she was in middle school. But she found 
God two years ago. She carried a Bible and had a bracelet engraved 
with ``What Would Jesus Do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other victims were religious, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Rachel Scott wanted to be a missionary in Africa and  
choreographed Christian music in her own theatrical productions. 
John Tomlin, 16, liked to go four-wheeling in his battered Chevy 
pickup, but he also went to Juarez, Mexico, last year on a 
Christian mission to build houses for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin planned to enlist in the Army after high school.  
</P>
<P>
	Steven Curnow, 14, dreamed of being a Navy top gun, piloting an  
F-16. He watched the ``Star Wars'' movies so many times he would 
recite the dialogue along with the actors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fleming and her family moved to Littleton 18 months ago from  
Phoenix. She turned to music and fiction writing to express her 
feelings and was learning to play the guitar. All this, while 
keeping up with her schoolwork, learning to drive and seeking 
part-time work, perhaps at a day-care center or the Dairy Queen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard to uproot,'' said her mother, Diedra. ``But Kelly  
had made several good friends. She was your basic, normal, 
beautiful teen-age girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least two died trying to help others survive.  
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Rohrbough, 15, was shot as he held an exit door open for  
other students. He died on the sidewalk, a few steps from safety. 
His body lay outside for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped his father in his electronics business. He was  
fascinated by computer games, stereos and home theater systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been hard to live with if I found out that he  
could've been helped,'' said his grandmother, Maxine Rohrbough. 
</P>
<P>
	The only adult among the victims was William ``Dave'' Sanders,  
47, a computer and business teacher at Columbine for 24 years and 
coach of the girl's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said Sanders, married with five grandchildren, had been  
shot twice in the chest while shielding students fleeing down a 
hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said he grew cold and repeated, ``I'm not going to make  
it. Tell my girls that I love them.''

<HEADLINE> Avs Head to San Jose for Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Had it been a normal practice, Colorado Avalanche  
coach Bob Hartley probably would have gone apoplectic. 
</P>
<P>
	Their concentration wavering, their energy lacking, the  
Avalanche endured a sloppy start to their first full workout since 
a shooting tragedy at a suburban Denver high school on Tuesday left 
15 dead and 23 wounded and a city still in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a tough start, and that's very understandable,''  
Hartley said Thursday. ``I can tell you that I wouldn't have 
accepted that kind of start if we hadn't known the kind of tragedy 
that happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``But our concentration got better as the practice went on.  
Getting on the ice for us is a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley had no doubt his team will be ready for the opening game  
of their first-round playoff series with the San Jose Sharks on 
Saturday. The series was supposed to open in Denver, with games on 
Wednesday and Thursday. But because of the tragedy, those two games 
were postponed and the series will open in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is very sad,'' he said. ``It's tough to explain how  
we feel as a team. But we just have to focus on Game 1, and I trust 
my players will be ready for that game. Getting away from Denver, I 
think, is going to be good for our focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was worried about playing the first two games on the  
road, Hartley said, ``Looking at what this community has had to go 
through for the last two days, I think worrying about home ice 
would be very selfish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the decision to reschedule for the community. Now we  
have to find a way to support our community by winning hockey 
games. We're going to San Jose on a mission. That mission is that 
we want to dedicate our games to Columbine High School.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley admitted that he, too, was deeply affected.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the last 24 hours or so, it's been pretty tough to focus  
on hockey,'' he said. ``There are many dads on this team. I'm a 
dad. When I go home, I look at my two kids. It makes you wonder as 
a parent: Where are we going? Since this tragedy, I'm having a hard 
time being a hockey coach. Hockey is far away right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if, as a Canadian, he viewed the United States as a  
violent society, Hartley said, ``I don't think we can look at this 
as Canadian or American. I think we have to look at this as people 
in a society. We are the examples. We are the adults, and we have 
to lead these kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here only since August, and I can tell you that I've  
enjoyed every minute. In the last two days, I don't know how many 
calls I got from friends asking me about my son and my daughter. 
That touched me a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no members of the Avalanche organization were believed  
directly affected by the shootings, all were touched emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Pierre Lacroix regularly takes walks with his  
wife in a park adjacent to the school. Lacroix and Charlie Lyons, 
CEO of the company that owns the Avalanche, live within a mile or 
two of the school. A number of players live nearby, and forward 
Claude Lemieux's babysitter attends that school. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last few days, it's been very difficult to think about  
what we had to do,'' Lemieux said. ``The decision to postpone those 
games was best for everybody. I feel there will be enough time for 
us to be ready and have our minds on the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche forward Peter Forsberg agreed with his coach that ``it  
might be good for us to start on the road because of what happened 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Quaker Operating Profits Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Quaker Oats Co. reported its first-quarter  
operating profits jumped 29 percent as it pursued a strategy of 
concentrating on its core cereals and Gatorade businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended March 31, the Chicago-based maker of  
Cap 'N Crunch cereal and Rice-a-Roni reported income from 
continuing operations of $152.3 million, or 51 cents a share, 
compared to $118 million, or 37 cents a share in the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 6 percent to $1.07 billion from $1.01 billion, led by  
a 30 percent increase in U.S. and Canadian Gatorade sales and 
strong sales of hot and ready-to-eat boxed cereals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a lot to deliver in the upcoming quarters when  
the majority of our annual income is earned,'' said company chief 
executive Robert Morrison. ``But we feel very good about our start 
to the 1999 year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income for U.S. and Canadian Foods increased 27  
percent and for U.S. and Canadian Gatorade increased 66 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatorade's strong sales bode well for the company, since the  
peak drinking period for the sports drink did not begin until April 
and lasts through September. Still, the company's fortunes often 
depend on how hot the weather gets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our marketing plans are in place. Gatorade Fierce and our new  
packaging are on shelf, our new advertising is on air, and our 
availability initiative is in full force,'' Morrison said. 
``Beating last year's stellar performance is going to be a 
challenge, but we're ready to take it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also reported improved sales of its goods in Asia,  
while it continued to struggle with weaker economic times in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1999 quarter, Quaker saw a gain of 10 cents a share on  
the sale of its Brazilian pasta business, tax changes and a credit 
for unused restructuring costs, which boosted net income to $86.7 
million. During the first quarter of 1998, Quaker recorded $9.1 
million in pretax restructuring charges, or $.04 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaker's earnings topped Wall Street analysts' expectations. Its  
stock climbed $4.25 to $67.18 3/4 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Budget Deficit Rises in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government recorded a  
significantly higher budget deficit in March, reflecting increased 
tax refunds and military spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit last month, $22.4 billion, was 62 percent more than  
the $13.8 billion recorded a year earlier, the Treasury Department 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the government remains on track to register a  
bigger surplus in all of fiscal 1999 than the $69.2 billion in 
1998, its first surplus since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1, the  
deficit totals $49.9 billion, up 28.5 percent from the first half 
of fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is forecasting a surplus of $79.3  
billion for all of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect the surplus for April -- the month when most  
Americans settle their tax bill -- should exceed the surplus of 
$124.6 billion in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the higher deficit this March was a 15 percent  
increase in tax refunds from a year earlier, to $26.4 billion. That 
reflects the new $400 per child credit and credits for higher 
education as well as the increasing popularity of electronic filing 
and direct deposit, which offer speedier refunds than paper returns 
and paper checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason is higher military spending, which totaled $24.2  
billion in March, up 25 percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 145.76, Closes Above 10,700 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A strong profit report from IBM gave investors  
the signal to buy technology stocks again today, pushing the Dow 
Jones industrial average to yet another new high. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 4 p.m. close on Wall Street, the Dow was up 145.76 at  
10,727.18, moving well past Wednesday's new closing high of 
10,581.42 and posting its 10th record high close in 14 sessions. 
The Dow is now up nearly 17 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher as Monday's fierce  
selloff in technology shares became a distant memory. The Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 22.71 at 1,358.83, just eclipsing its own 
previous closing high of 1,358.63. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq composite  
index rose 72.54 to 2,561.62. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM led the Dow higher, advancing more than 25 points and  
pushing other technology stocks higher. After the market closed 
Wednesday, IBM reported first-quarter earnings of $1.55 a share, 
decisively beating year-ago results of $1.06 and analysts' 
estimates of $1.41. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's results reassured investors who have been nervously  
shuttling between technology issues and more conservative blue-chip 
issues. ``Today's rally began at 4:01 p.m. yesterday,'' said Ed 
Laux, lead stock trader at ABN Amro/The Chicago Corp., ``when IBM's 
earnings came out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Johnson, First Albany Corp.'s market strategist, said IBM's  
earnings, which included strong results overseas, also signaled 
that the world economy is recovering after a nearly 2-year-long 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``IBM seems to have put to rest all of the worries about the  
tech sector of the U.S. economy and about personal computers in 
particular,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell today, but Wall Street for once did not follow  
-- an apparent return to the classic market tenet that a growing 
economy is good for the stock market although it pushes interest 
rates higher and bond prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was down $10.62 per $1,000 value late  
in the day, pushing its yield, which moves opposite the price, up 
to 5.60 percent from 5.53 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares led the broad advance in the stock market.  
Dell and Intel were higher in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In the telecommunications sector, Lucent Technologies rose on  
better-than-expected earnings. But GTE and Bell Atlantic fell after 
those companies just met forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks rose, despite a drop in Chevron's first-quarter  
profits, as oil prices continued higher. Crude oil futures were up 
past $18 per barrel in late trading. Chevron's shares advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were so upbeat about the economy that even  
transportation stocks, which often fall when oil prices rise, moved 
higher. The Dow Jones transportation average was higher, as were 
airline shares. ``A stronger economy means more people are in the 
airline seats,'' Laux said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shares of companies that are highly sensitive to changes in  
the economy were lower after making a brief appearance earlier this 
week and last week on investors' buy lists. Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing was down sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks, which often do better in a shrinking economy,  
lost ground as well. McDonald's shares fell after the company's 
first-quarter earnings matched analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, the Nikkei index in Tokyo gained 1.04  
percent as investors there also bought technology shares. In 
Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt advanced 1.08 percent, also on 
active buying of technology shares. The FT-SE 100 index in London 
fell 0.71 percent, and the CAC index in Paris closed flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-7 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,703 up, 1,316 down and 538 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 918.35 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
914.5 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 7.26 to 640.97, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 7.79 to 758.38. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.27 to 428.84.

<HEADLINE> Rebuilding Balkans to cost $2 billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than $2 billion will be needed to help  
rebuild Balkan countries affected by the fighting in Kosovo, World 
Bank President James Wolfensohn said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bank and its sister institution, the International  
Monetary Fund, are closely examining what resources will be needed 
but much depends on how long the fighting lasts and the extent of 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn said the boards of the two organizations would  
discuss the issue during their annual spring meeting, which is just 
getting under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to require the attention of the international  
community and, assuming a resolution of the conflict, it is not 
going to be cheap,'' Wolfensohn said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the World Bank and the IMF would focus their attention  
on helping Macedonia and Albania cope with the flood of refugees 
from Kosovo and the disruption the fighting has caused their 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wolfensohn said the bank and the IMF would also examine how  
other countries in the region -- Bosnia, Croatia, Bulgaria and 
Romania -- could be helped. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bank already was providing $70 million in loans to  
Albania and Macedonia and would re-examine these programs to see if 
any funds could be shifted to humanitarian relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn said it was premature to talk about what would be  
needed for rebuilding in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to Russia, Wolfensohn said bank negotiators are ``very,  
very close'' to an agreement with Russia that would release $1.8 
billion in stalled loans. 
</P>
<P>
	These loans -- and financial support from the IMF -- were  
suspended last August after Moscow devalued the ruble and defaulted 
on its foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn said he returned from a visit to Moscow earlier this  
month ``''with a pretty constructive view of what the Primakov 
government is trying to do'' to reform the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had meetings with several leading members of Russia's  
parliament, the Duma, and that all, with the exception of 
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, pledged support for Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn said he agreed with the assessment made Wednesday by  
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus that last fall's global 
financial crisis was bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the poor nations where the bank makes loans still  
are suffering because of the decline in commodity prices.

<HEADLINE> Brits, AT&AMP;T Plan Japan Telecom Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Telecommunications giants AT&AMP;T Corp. and British  
Telecommunications PLC have agreed to take a combined 30 percent 
stake in Japan Telecom Co., a newspaper report said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, AT&AMP;T and British Telecom each hold a 15 percent  
stake in Japan Telecom, Japan's third-largest long-distance 
telephone carrier, and gain a seat on the company's board of 
directors, the Nihon Keizai financial daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	The total size of their combined investment is expected to be  
between $1.26 billion and $1.51 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Telecom spokesman Mitsuhiro Kurano said today that the  
company has not yet decided to strike an alliance with AT&AMP;T and 
British Telecom. He added that he had no comment on the newspaper 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiyoko Saeki, a spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T in Tokyo, also refused to  
comment when asked about the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The three firms are reportedly planning a broad alliance in  
which AT&AMP;T and British Telecom's will integrate most of their 
Japanese operations with Japan Telecom's units. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies will offer Internet and other data  
communication services to multinational corporations and will also 
cooperate in neighboring Asian telecommunications markets, the 
Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the largest long distance and international carrier in  
the United States, while British Telecom is Britain's biggest 
telecommunications company. Japan Telecom is an affiliate of East 
Japan Railway Co.

<HEADLINE> Jury Urges Freedom for Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former school teacher who spent 20 years in  
psychiatric hospitals for killing a teen-ager and eating some of 
his body parts is no longer dangerous and should be freed, a jury 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Long Island jury on Wednesday found that Albert  
Fentress, 57, still requires treatment and rehabilitation for 
mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Harry E. Seidell is considering motions to overturn the  
decision, which, if it stands, could result in freedom for Fentress 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Fentress confessed to killing 18-year-old Paul Masters after the  
teen wandered into his backyard in upstate New York. Fentress lured 
Masters into his basement, tied him to a post, sexually abused and 
mutilated him, and shot him twice in the head before cooking and 
eating parts of the boy's body. 
</P>
<P>
	Fentress, found innocent by reason of insanity in the August  
1979 killing, was granted the jury trial after he contested a 
decision by state judges to extended his confinement in a state 
psychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	If released, Fentress would not have to register as a sex  
offender because his crime was committed before the state law 
requiring such notification was enacted.

<HEADLINE> 5 Picked To Register Web Addresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The organization that will manage much of the  
Internet selected five companies, including America Online, to help 
consumers register Web addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and  
Numbers represents an important 60-day experiment aimed at opening 
the worldwide computer network to capitalist competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who want to register addresses now must pay $35 each  
year to Virginia-based Network Solutions Inc., which has enjoyed a 
lucrative exclusive agreement with the government since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Under plans announced Wednesday, people can instead pay AOL or  
four other companies or continue doing business with Network 
Solutions, which also will continue to administer a master list of 
more than 4 million Web addresses ending in ``com,'' ``net'' or 
``org.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Senior Vice President George Vradenburg called it ``an  
important step in the Internet's evolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Seidman, who distributes an e-mail newsletter about AOL  
to 50,000 subscribers, predicted that AOL, the world's largest 
Internet provider, will encourage its more than 17 million members 
to register vanity Web addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty easy to see that they'll try to get to the space  
of personal vanity Web site hosting,'' Seidman said. ``They have a 
huge infrastructure from a promotional point of view to support 
that. The opportunity for them is going to be huge. There, they'll 
have an advantage over anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Network Solutions administering the master list  
of addresses, the five companies agreed to pay it a one-time fee of 
$100,000, plus $9 per year for each address they register. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped propel Network Solutions stock 53 percent higher  
Wednesday; it rose $32 to close at $92. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL hasn't decided what price it will ultimately charge  
consumers, spokesman Jim Whitney said, adding that ``questions of 
marketing, pricing, are all for down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions said it will continue charging $35 a year.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government announced last year it plans to largely end  
its management of the Internet and turn over control of most 
functions to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
Numbers, a California-based nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would still be responsible for assigning Internet  
addresses with the ``gov'' and ``mil'' suffixes for federal 
agencies and military institutions, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four companies selected were the Internet Council of  
Registrars, France Telecom, Melbourne IT and Register.Com.

<HEADLINE> Colo. High School Students Edgy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Students returned to classes Thursday at  
Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High 
haunted the halls. Jittery staff and students walked past armed 
guards and cried and hugged inside. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, two bomb squad trucks sped to the school after a  
backpack scare. Dozens of students streamed out of the school hours 
early, unable to stand the tension any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a prison in there,'' said Jessica Miller, 15.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't even go to the bathroom without permission, and then  
they time you,'' said Holly Bernside, also 15. ``All the teachers 
are wearing nametags, and there is one at every door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school's marquee proclaimed ``Rebels our thoughts are with  
you.'' Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine 
High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and 
dozens wounded. Columbine is about three miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed deputies stood guard at the only entrance and students  
needed their parents' permission to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Students leaving the school said the intense security inside  
scared them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very uncomfortable in there. There are a lot of people  
crying,'' said Tyler Herbert, 16, a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors quickly spread, these days fueled on the Internet as well  
as by phone, that ``Chatfield would be next,'' said Ms. Miller, a 
sophomore. Parents drove up and asked a reporter if it was true 
that a student was barricaded inside a classroom. It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were forbidden to leave their backpacks lying around.  
Some of the bombs used in the assault at Columbine were planted in 
knapsacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal came onto Chatfield's public address system and  
urged students to wear ``more moderate clothes both in school and 
when you go out,'' Ms. Bernside said. The killers at Columbine wore 
black trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of two bomb squad trucks with sirens blaring further  
shook those inside. The bomb squad was called because a backpack 
had been found unattended in a hallway. It contained books. 
</P>
<P>
	A pizza delivery followed. The school wanted to make sure there  
was enough to eat since students couldn't leave campus for lunch 
and get back in. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Hitchingham of the Jefferson County school system said  
schools were getting phony bomb threats. School officials kept 
reporters out of Chatfield and other Jefferson County schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bernside, a sophomore, said all the efforts to counsel  
students and banners in the school lamenting the deaths made things 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Murphy, a 16-year-old sophomore, said that anyone with a  
free hour was required to go to the school's commons. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert interjected: ``I'm a little worried about putting all  
the kids in one place. If someone wanted to come and start shooting 
again it would be real easy for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of hours after Chatfield opened, Nancy Hoag decided to  
pull her daughter, Melissa, 15, out. ``I was a little nervous about 
her going back and it is scary in there,'' she said, her voice 
choking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have friends whose children go to Columbine,'' Mrs. Hoag  
said. ``They were lucky, but why do you have to be lucky?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert said he had to leave because ``I needed a smoke. I went  
three hours without one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Monsu, who oversees the county's high schools, said more  
students than expected had come to class. Chatfield has 1,870 
students. She said the school was allowing students to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the kids want to be here,'' she said. ``They need to be  
here.''

<HEADLINE> Former Viking Carl Eller Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Former Minnesota Vikings great Carl  
Eller was released from jail Thursday while police investigated a 
woman's report that he sexually assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
	North Mankato police received a 911 call at 1:55 a.m. Wednesday  
and arrested Eller without incident at the scene where the alleged 
assault happened, Capt. Wayne Hoffman said. He declined to say 
where it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Eller was held in the Nicollet County Jail in St. Peter and was  
released Thursday pending further investigation, Hoffman said. No 
charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Eller, in a statement issued Thursday night, denied the  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely troubled concerning allegations surrounding  
this matter,'' he said. ``I know that I have done nothing wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman declined to give details about the incident. He would  
not reveal the woman's condition or whether she had any prior 
relationship with Eller. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman at the Nicollet County attorney's office said no one  
would comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Eller was a star defensive end with the Vikings' ``Purple People  
Eaters,'' the front four that helped Minnesota to four NFC 
championships and Super Bowl appearances in the late 1960s and 
1970s. Eller made six Pro Bowl appearances and was among 15 
finalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year, though he 
did not get in. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently accepted a newly created position with the Minnesota  
Department of Human Services as a policy analyst and spokesman on 
risky behavior after spending nearly two decades as a drug and 
alcohol abuse counselor. He opened three clinics over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	When Eller retired from football, he had to deal with his own  
drug and alcohol problems, which included cocaine addiction.

<HEADLINE> Phone Cos.' Profits Meet Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Profits at three major telecommunications companies, Lucent  
Technologies, Bell Atlantic and GTE, met or surpassed Wall Street 
expectations Thursday, lifted by stronger demand for both 
traditional and advanced communications services. 

</P>
<P>
                      *Lucent Technologies Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The huge telecommunications equipment maker reported its  
quarterly profit more than doubled, beating Wall Street 
expectations, amid booming sales of networking products and 
microprocessor chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time charges, Lucent said it earned $457 million,  
or 17 cents a share, in its fiscal second quarter ended March 31. 
That was up from a profit in the year-ago quarter of $186 million, 
or 7 cents a share, also excluding one-time charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose by a third to $8.22 billion from $6.18 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The results beat the expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call, who predicted a profit of 15 cents a share. Lucent stock 
closed on Thursday up $2.62 1/2 a share, or 4.4 percent, at $61.75 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., said its networking  
equipment was in high demand by telecommunications companies racing 
to build high-speed networks to transmit voice and data to 
businesses and consumers. Lucent's chips, which are the brainpower 
in cellular phones and other electronics products, also saw sales 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower tax rate contributed to the profit gain.  
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Richard McGinn said Lucent is on track to  
increase revenues by 19 to 20 percent and profit-per-share by 35 
percent for the full fiscal 1999, excluding one-time gains and 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of fiscal 1999, Lucent's profit rose 41  
percent to $1.90 billion, or 69 cents a share, excluding one-time 
charges. Revenue grew 17 percent to $17.48 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                        *Bell Atlantic Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest regional telecommunications company  
reported a 28 percent increase in quarterly profit that met Wall 
Street predictions, citing increased sales of local and cellular 
phone service and demand by other carriers for its 
telecommunications network. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bell Atlantic said it earned $1.14 billion, or 72  
cents a share, in the three months ended March 31. That was up from 
a profit of $893 million, or 56 cents a share, in the comparable 
quarter last year. Revenue grew 4 percent to $7.97 billion from 
$7.65 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the impact of a one-time charge, Bell Atlantic would  
have earned 73 cents a share, meeting the forecast of analysts 
surveyed by First Call. Bell Atlantic stock fell 62 1/2 cents, or 1.07 
percent, on Thursday to close at $57.87 1/2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic said sales of local phone service rose 4 percent  
to $3.47 billion, network access services rose 2 percent to $1.94 
billion, and wireless services rose 16 percent to $990 million. 
However, revenue from long-distance service dropped 6 percent to 
$474 million. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                             *GTE Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The provider of local- and long-distance telephone service  
reported profits rose 16 percent in the first quarter to meet Wall 
Street forecasts, helped by stronger demand for local phone service 
and network access services. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time charges, GTE said it earned $723 mllion, or  
74 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31. That was up from a 
profit of $624 million, or 65 cents a share, in the comparable 
quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $5.88 billion from $5.47 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The Irving, Texas-based company said sales of local phone  
service rose 3 percent to $1.47 billion, network access services 
rose 5 percent to $851 million, and directory and other services 
rose 9.5 percent to $705 million. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE chief executive Charles R. Lee said the company expects  
per-share profits to grow between 13 and 15 percent for the full 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE stock closed Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange down 6 1/4  
cents at $66.81 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Senate Links Italy Restitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Thursday linked restitution to  
the families of 20 skiiers killed in Italy when a U.S. military jet 
clipped a gondola cable to Germany compensating relatives of nine 
Americans killed in a 1997 crash off the coast of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the victims in the February 1998 gondola crash were  
German. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States should not make any payment to citizens of  
Germany as settlement of such citizens' claims for deaths arising 
from the (gondola) accident ... until a comparable settlement is 
reached between the govenment of Germany and the families'' of 
those killed in the 1997 crash, the Senate said in a nonbinding 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and passed by voice

killed when a German transport plane flying at the wrong altitude 
slammed into an Air Force C-141 off the coast of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Cindrich, 28, of North Charleston, S.C., asked the Senate  
to make the $40 million payment to the gondola victims' families 
conditional on Germany compensating her and the families of other 
airmen with her husband Greg in the C-141 crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government has rejected Cindrich's claim.

<HEADLINE> Oil Experts Say U.S. Reserves OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite concerns about some foreign oil  
suppliers, the United States has the reserves needed to withstand 
some shortages caused by Year 2000 computer breakdowns, oil experts 
told a Senate hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, on the Senate floor, lawmakers began debate on a bill  
aimed at curbing what many fear could be an economically disastrous 
flood of lawsuits arising out of computer problems that might occur 
on or after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would urge prudency in planning but certainly not panic,''  
said Robert Kripowicz, the Energy Department's principal deputy 
assistant for fossil energy, told a special Senate panel on the 
so-called Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Kripowicz expressed ``cautious optimism,'' citing the oil  
industry's built-in flexibility because of its experiences in 
handling natural disasters, its financial incentive to keep oil 
flowing and the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which now 
holds an inventory of 561 million barrels of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States imports some 10.4 million barrels a day, 56  
percent of the nation's consumption. Kripowicz said up to 4.1 
million barrels a day could be withdrawn from the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil supply has been one of the biggest worries of those studying  
the Y2K problem because of the high reliance on imports and the 
possibilities for disruptions in shipping, docking and unloading, 
and refining. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, head of the Y2K panel with Sen.  
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., noted that even the slight reduction in 
OPEC production recently has resulted in a 20 percent increase in 
gas prices. ``Clearly a minimal reduction in world supply can have 
disproportionate effects on price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kripowicz said the four largest suppliers of oil to the United  
States -- Venezuela, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Mexico -- are making 
serious efforts to fix their computers and expect to be prepared by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But less is known about other suppliers, and there is concern  
that infrastructure problems in some countries, such as electric 
power or telecommunications shutdowns, could disrupt oil supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited estimates that gas prices would jump seven to 12 cents  
a gallon at the pump if supplies drop 1 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Cavaney, president and CEO of the American Petroleum  
Institute, said oil companies were moving well in preparing for the 
millenium bug and that one of their big worries was the 
``unintended consequences'' of people overreacting and hoarding 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	The litigation bill introduced on the Senate floor is aimed at  
staving off what many predict could be $1 trillion in lawsuits 
filed by those claiming damages from computer breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would  
establish a grace period allowing companies to fix computers before 
suits could go forward, encourage mediation and cap punitive 
damages at three times compensatory damages or $250,000, whichever 
is greater, or, in the case of a small business, whichever is less. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats and the White House opposed the bill as it came  
out of McCain's Commerce Committee, saying it was an effort by 
businesses to avoid responsibility and change tort law. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he and McCain had made changes  
to ensure that consumer interests would continue to be protected 
and that punitive damages would still apply in egregious cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said negotiations on language in the bill were still going  
on but there was a need to stop the ``unwarranted litigation which 
could destroy some small companies that don't have the campacity to 
take on the kind of predator lawsuits that too often have done more 
damage than good.''

<HEADLINE> Another Cubs Pitcher on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Kevin Tapani kept saying he felt fine, that the  
stiffness in his shoulder that's prevented him from starting the 
last 10 days wasn't a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But manager Jim Riggleman heard what else Tapani was saying, and  
it was enough to convince him the pitcher should be on the disabled 
list, not working his way back into the rotation. Tapani, who's 
already missed one scheduled start, was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list Thursday, with the move retroactive to April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``As he's talking to me, he's going like this and saying, `I  
feel a little something here,' Riggleman said, rolling his 
shoulder. ``Using all those words except pain and injury. I think 
Tap feels he really couldn't go out there and confidently air it 
out and go four or five innings and feel pretty sure everything was 
going to be pain free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just what the Cubs need, another ailing pitcher. Tapani is the  
fifth pitcher to go on the DL this year -- and the season's only 
three weeks old. It's the most pitchers the Cubs have had on the DL 
in one season since 1995, when they opened with four on it and had 
a total of seven. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend started with NL Rookie of the Year Kerry Wood, who  
tore a ligament in his pitching elbow in his first spring start. 
Terry Adams joined him soon after with a sprained elbow, and then 
came Kurt Miller with a strained rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth pitcher, Jeremi Gonzalez, is still recovering from  
elbow surgery last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not decimated,'' Riggleman said of his pitching staff. ``It's  
the nature of pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tapani left the April 12 home opener after three innings because  
of the sore shoulder, and was scratched from his next scheduled 
start as a precaution. He threw off the mound Monday, and Riggleman 
was toying with the idea of starting him Saturday against the New 
York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	But after watching Tapani throw hard in a 60-pitch, 10-minute  
session, Riggleman decided Tapani needed some more time. He'll be 
eligible to come off the DL next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggleman still isn't sure who will start Saturday. Steve  
Trachsel (0-2), scheduled to pitch against the Houston Astros on 
Thursday in a game postponed by rain, will go Friday against the 
New York Mets. Terry Mulholland could go Saturday or the Cubs could 
go with Brad Woodall. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston will stay with Chris Holt on Friday and Mike Hampton on  
Saturday against Cincinnati. Sean Bergman (0-1), who was supposed 
to pitch against the Cubs, will now go Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Tapani's) making a lot of progress, but I just don't feel  
confident that we could put him out there and let him air it out 
for five innings plus,'' Riggleman said. ``He's not throwing 100 
percent down there in the bullpen. I can't have him go into the 
game and say, `Give me all you've got,' when he can only give me 80 
percent in the bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was fine with Tapani, especially since it allows  
the Cubs to add another pitcher to the roster. Chicago recalled 
right-handed reliever Richie Barker from Triple-A Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker is 1-0 with one save and a 1.35 ERA in six games for Iowa  
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``All it does is cost me three days time, and if I'm not going  
to pitch on Saturday because I didn't have good enough side work 
yesterday, then we might as well have an arm here that can throw,'' 
Tapani said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm going to start (next week), I could have 15 days on the  
DL and we could have a pitcher here rather than be shorthanded,'' 
he added. ``With the rainouts and the off days, I don't think we've 
ever been in a position where we might be short or need an extra 
arm out there. But going against Houston and New York back-to-back, 
I think we want as many arms here available to throw as we could, 
in case you need him. ... Makes sense to me.''

<HEADLINE> Daunting Track Awaits Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- If ever a place could make a courageous  
race driver nervous, it's Talladega Superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to get fast again,'' Ward Burton said as his Bill  
Davis Racing crew prepared his Pontiac for Sunday's DieHard 500. 
</P>
<P>
	After racing the past two weeks on half-mile ovals in Bristol,  
Tenn., and Martinsville, Va., this week the drivers face the high 
banks of the 2.66-mile Talladega track, the sport's longest, 
fastest and arguably most dangerous oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just spent two weekends on short tracks, beating, banging,  
routing and gouging each other, then they put us at Talladega, 
where we need a drafting partner,'' Steve Park said. ``So now I'm 
supposed to rely on a guy who I've been mad at for two weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park, who drives for the team of fellow competitor Dale  
Earnhardt, may be joking, but only a little. 
</P>
<P>
	Talladega and Daytona, which is 2 1/2 miles around, are NASCAR's  
two fastest tracks. For more than a decade, the sanctioning body 
has required carburetor restrictor plates be used at those tracks 
to keep the cars under the 200 mph speeds that once were routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even with the plates in place -- cutting horsepower by  
restricting airflow to the carburetor -- the Winston Cup competitors 
race at speeds well into the 190s. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the restrictor plates keep the engines pretty  
equal, meaning that most of the 43-car field run bunched together, 
two-by-two and sometimes three-wide. 
</P>
<P>
	The result of that is at least one wild multi-car crash at just  
about every Talladega and Daytona race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big wreck is the thing that's on everybody's mind once the  
race starts,'' Burton said. ``Every single driver out there is 
thinking about that. ... But you're not looking at the big wreck 
from a danger standpoint. I mean, wrecking isn't exactly the most 
pleasant feeling in the world if you're sitting in that race car, 
but it usually hurts a whole lot more to have your day end early. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to avoid, though. The cars running that bunched up  
with restrictor plates, one little bobble from one car at the wrong 
time and the next thing you see is smoke and car numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year in Talladega, it was Earnhardt and Bill Elliott who  
were at the forefront of an 11-car crash, with Elliott getting 
singed by the flames from Earnhardt's upside-down Chevrolet as both 
slid down the long front straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dale Jarrett, who won the Winston 500 in Talladega in  
October, said, no matter what happened to you the last time, you 
can't afford to be tentative at Talladega. 
</P>
<P>
	``Call us crazy or whatever it may be, but that's not the  
mentality that we come back with. I don't think a driver who really 
has that competitive spirit inside of him is going to let that 
enter his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that guys come in here being tentative. I think  
what they'll do is go into the race realizing that if we all use a 
little bit more patience that this race is won in the last 50 
miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett says a driver can help another guy out, let him into a  
tight spot that may push you back a little, until the last 50 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``That isn't going to change the outcome of the race because you  
have plenty of time to make that up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice and qualifying got underway today for the Winston Cup  
drivers, several of whom will also take part Saturday in the second 
round of the International Race of Champions series.

<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bowes, the winningest football coach in  
the Atlantic 10 Conference, announced his retirement today after 27 
seasons at New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowes leaves May 1 with 175 victories to his credit. He will be  
replaced by assistant Sean McDonnell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowes said he is leaving after 34 years because he always wanted  
to retire at age 55. He turned 55 in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a question of when I would do it. I wanted to be  
100 percent certain,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowes retires with a record of 175-106-5. He ranks fourth in  
number of victories among Division IAA coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite going 4-7 last season, the Wildcats won the conference's  
New England Division for the third straight season. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonnell, 43, is a former Wildcats captain and team most  
valuable player. He has been Bowes' assistant for eight years, the 
last five as offensive coordinator.

<HEADLINE> Largest of Florida Fires Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A wildfire that burned for a week and scorched  
170,000 acres in the Everglades was finally contained Thursday, but 
the smoke left behind could cause breathing problems for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the breather,'' said Arlene Vincent, a spokeswoman for  
the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 75, South Florida's main east-west highway known as  
Alligator Alley, was reopened in the morning after thick smoke that 
hung overhead at daybreak cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Highway Patrol closed about 60 miles of the highway  
Wednesday. The road has been opened sporadically since the fire 
started April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Levees, canals and a four-lane highway helped firefighters hold  
the flames inside a section of the Everglades more than 20 miles 
west of Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze started in the eastern Everglades and may have been  
ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic converter. 
</P>
<P>
	Aided by swirling winds, the fire was the largest of at least  
2,615 wildfires that have burned almost 250,00 acres in Florida 
this year. Flames left an area of blackened sawgrass estimated at 
24 miles long and 15 miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush asked President Clinton to declare the Florida  
fires an emergency, making federal funds available to the state's 
67 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, environmental officials said a statewide health  
advisory, issued Wednesday because of smoke, would remain in effect 
until the fires stop and the weather conditions change. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials are hoping the worst is over, but the National  
Weather Service has predicted dry weather with no significant 
rainfall forecast through the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't put away the hose just yet,'' said Gene Madden, a  
spokesman for the state Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters have been brought in from California, North  
Carolina, Arizona, Oklahoma and Mississippi. Local firefighters are 
getting a rest so they will be at full strength if serious fires 
blaze up, said Tom Efird, a spokesman at the state Emergency 
Operation Center. 
</P>
<P>
	As well as the Everglades fire, two fires Thursday in  
Apalachicola and Osceola national forests were burning but were 
contained, Efird said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Torn Over Yugoslavia Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia is under growing pressure to send military  
aid to help Yugoslavia fight NATO, a top parliamentary leader said 
today. The government reasserted its determination to stay out of 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one advanced Russian anti-aircraft missile system would  
enable the Yugoslav military to shoot down dozens of NATO planes 
and halt the air attacks, claimed Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist 
who serves as speaker of the Duma, the lower chamber of parliament. 
He said the Russian people would demand Moscow supply such aid if 
the conflict continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear NATO is preparing a ground operation in Yugoslavia,  
so Russia must clearly state how it can render serious 
military-technical aid to Yugoslavia,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has denounced NATO's airstrikes, repeatedly  
calling for their immediate suspension to allow political 
negotiations on solving the Kosovo crisis. But President Boris 
Yeltsin has said Moscow will not be dragged in to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has been trying to mediate a political settlement and  
Yeltsin's special envoy, ex-premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, visited 
Belgrade today for talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin's delegation was told by Yugoslav officials that  
some 500 people had been killed and another 400 wounded in the air 
attacks, the Interfax news agency reported. About 500,000 people 
had been left unemployed because factories and businesses were 
destroyed by the bombing, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev reiterated the  
Kremlin's refusal to provide military aid to Yugoslavia. He said 
such a move would undermine Russia's efforts to negotiate a 
political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only Russia has the unique possibility to use its special  
relations with Yugoslavia and its remaining relations with NATO ... 
to find a peaceful political way out,'' he told the Federation 
Council, parliament's upper chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Avdeyev also said the United States and other nations had urged  
Moscow to reconsider its decision to boycott the summit marking 
NATO's 50th anniversary that starts Friday in Washington. Russia 
refuses to attend the three-day summit because of the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO and the United States ... tried to persuade us to take  
part in the NATO summit until the last moment. Even last night 
(Wednesday) we were asked by telephone to send at least our 
ambassador to the anniversary celebrations. We won't go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While opposing NATO's use of force, Moscow has yet to offer any  
concrete suggestions on how peace that would satisfy both Belgrade 
and the Western alliance could be restored to Kosovo. Russia has 
called repeatedly for the NATO attacks to be halted to allow talks 
to start, a condition rejected by the alliance.

<HEADLINE> Dead-Beats Contribute to Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Absentee parents who fail to pay child support  
often have children who could really use it: One-third of their 
kids live in poverty, the Census Bureau reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers spotlight a striking problem in the era of welfare  
reform, where child support is supposed to make up some of the 
money lost when families leave the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Census report, being released Friday, includes data from  
1995. Since then, there have been new efforts to collect more money 
and collections have risen. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, advocates are worried.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nonpayment of child support is a crime that causes poverty in  
America,'' said Geraldine Jensen, president of the Association for 
Children for Enforcement of Support. ``Certainly with welfare 
reform, children are going to be even more at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem is that many of the fathers of these  
children are also poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have similar if not more barriers to getting work,'' said  
Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human 
Services. ``A lot of them have jail time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report also points to the importance of connecting  
non-custodial parents to their children. About three-fourths of 
those who had joint custody or visitation agreements made payments 
in 1995. That compares to just 35 percent of those without these 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, projects are under way across the country  
that try to connect fathers with their children, for both emotional 
and financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the report found that $17.8 billion was paid in support  
in 1995. That's 63 percent of the $28.3 billion that parents said 
they were owed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census report is the nation's only estimate of all child  
support paid and owed across the country. HHS releases similar 
numbers, but those figures only capture parents who pay through the 
government's collection system, explaining why the HHS collection 
numbers for 1995 were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Census report also concluded that just $28.3 billion was  
owed, whereas HHS says nearly $50 billion was due that year. That 
may be because parents responding to the Census questionnaire did 
not mention all the support owed from previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings in the Census report include:  
</P>
<P>
	--In spring 1996, 22.8 million children under 21 years lived with  
13.7 million parents while their other parent lived elsewhere. 
That's 28 percent of all children under 21 living in families. 
</P>
<P>
	--The vast majority -- 85 percent -- of these custodial parents  
were women. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mothers were more likely to receive child support from absentee  
fathers than fathers were from absentee mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	--About seven in 10 custodial parents who were due child support  
got at least a portion of what was owed. The average received was 
$3,732. 
</P>
<P>
	--About four in 10 got everything they were owed.  
</P>
<P>
	--About 32 percent of custodial parents who were owed child  
support but did not get anything lived below the poverty line. By 
contrast, about 22 percent of parents who got at least part of what 
they had coming were poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Focusing on custodial mothers, the report found that moms were  
most likely to receive payments if they were wealthier, white, 
educated, older than 30 and divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, 62 percent of poor women received at least some of  
the money, compared with 73 percent of non-poor women. Nearly three 
out of four white women got something; for blacks it was 59 percent 
and for Hispanics, 58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over half of women who had never been married got payments  
versus 73 percent of those who had been divorced.

<HEADLINE> Dangling Student Inspired SWAT Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- It was one of the most frightening  
scenes of the massacre, a boy dangling from a school window with 
one bloody arm hanging useless, his other arm flailing for help. 
</P>
<P>
	SWAT members eventually rushed to his rescue as he dropped from  
the second-floor library window Tuesday. Two days later, he had not 
yet been publicly identified. 
</P>
<P>
	As the video clip begins, the weight of the boy's body leans  
against broken glass, and his blood-soaked shirt displays the 
violence he was trying desperately to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	His plight grabbed the attention of the Lakewood SWAT team as  
they searched for explosives at Columbine High School. Within 
seconds, their armored truck was on the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned to the driver and said, `Let's go get him.' We drove  
over the curb, over a couple of planters. We almost drove over a 
bicycle rack,'' said Sgt. George Hinkle. 
</P>
<P>
	With the truck in place under the shattered window, Sgt. John  
Romaniec and senior agent Donn Kraemer climbed on the roof and 
reached for the outstretched hands of the boy, know to them only as 
Rich. 
</P>
<P>
	Using his remaining strength, the boy kicked up his legs and  
escaped from the library, which 90 minutes earlier had been ravaged 
by two teen-agers who laughed as they gunned down a teacher and 12 
of their unsuspecting classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Romaniec and Kraemer were able to grasp the boy's hands as he  
lunged out the window and slammed into the side of the armored 
truck. His body bloodied and his awareness fading, the boy was 
finally safe from the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was slipping in and out of consciousness,'' Romaniec said  
Thursday. ``Once we got him into the back of the van I had another 
officer ask him his name and talk to him. You could see the life 
was slipping away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was taken to paramedics. He is believed to be a  
15-year-old boy who remains in critical condition with wounds to 
his head and one of his arms. The hospital has not released his 
name at his family's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that this young man deserves all the credit,''  
Romaniec said. ``He is a survivor in the true meaning of the word 
survive. He was determined to get out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the only bright spot that we had in the whole day, and  
even that wasn't a bright spot,'' Hinkle said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Pat  
Buchanan says stricter gun laws could not have prevented the deadly 
school shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is who has the weapons, the good people or those  
who are ugly and warped,'' he said. ``The problem began long before 
they walked into school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people, including the two killers, died Tuesday in a  
shooting and bombing spree at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``The massacre is a tragic reflection of the dark side of  
American society,'' Buchanan told reporters Wednesday. ``At 
Littleton, America got a glimpse of the last stop on that train to 
hell America boarded decades ago when we declared that God is dead 
and that each of us is his or her own god who can make up the rules 
as we go along.''

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Rise Slightly / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages rose slightly this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was 6.88 percent, up from an eight-week low of 6.87  
percent the previous week, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company said 
Thursday. So far this year, rates have fluctuated between 6.74 
percent at the end of January and 7.11 percent in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.51 percent this week, up from an eight-week low of 6.47 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.56 percent, the same as the previous 
week's four-month low. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Boy Tells How Friend Was Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Craig Scott had just finished painfully  
describing on national television how his schoolmate Isiah Shoels 
was shot to death. Then Isiah's father grasped his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig, whose sister was among those killed at Columbine High  
School, and Michael Shoels held tightly to one another's hands and 
choked back tears as the 16-year-old student detailed on NBC's 
``Today'' this morning the horrifying scene he witnessed in the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walked by and they saw Isiah and one of them said to the  
other one, `There's an `n-word' over here,''' said Craig, declining 
to use the racial slur the killers had actually used during 
Tuesday's killings. ``Isiah tried to back up. Isiah didn't say 
anything. And then they shot Isiah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels sobbed quietly as Scott told of laying on the floor with  
his friends' bodies around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was praying to God to give me courage, and to keep  
protection over us,'' Craig said. At that moment Shoels reached 
over to touch the boy's arm and took both his hands in his own. 
</P>
<P>
	The father cried and shook quietly earlier in the interview when  
Craig told of how well-liked Isiah was, and how happy Craig had 
been to see his friend in the library that day. 
</P>
<P>
	A loud noise -- an explosion -- had just gone off and a teacher  
yelled at everyone to hit the floor. The two boys thought it was a 
joke at first and talked under a desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him, and I said, `Hey Isiah,' and he came under the  
table and he said, `What's up?''' Craig said. ``I really liked 
Isiah. ... He was just a fun kid to be around, and I wish I could 
give him a hug today, so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels said he now agonizes remembering how his son, as well as  
his two other children, had told him about the so-called Trenchcoat 
Mafia and how they taunted him and his siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	``By us being new in this neighborhood, I thought they were just  
feeling inferior, but that wasn't the situation. It was true. ... I 
should have listened to my son and my children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have went to the authorities when this stuff was  
going on,'' he said. ``But I felt as though they were strong enough 
to overcome it, because I trained my children to live with every 
and anyone.''

<HEADLINE> Gores To Visit Littleton Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper,  
will travel to suburban Denver this weekend to visit with the 
grieving community of Columbine High School, Gore's office 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They are scheduled to attend a Sunday afternoon memorial service  
in Clement Park, next to the high school where two teen-aged 
students massacred 12 of their classmates and a teacher before 
killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	On a political trip through New Hampshire Thursday, Mrs. Gore  
said Littleton's tragedy is a wake-up call to adults responsible 
for the violent images in children's entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have to be aware of it,'' said Mrs. Gore, an outspoken  
opponent of violence in song lyrics and movies during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is: Adults and parents should tune into what their  
children should be looking at ... and how they are spending their 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a discussion with students at Nashua High School, Mrs. Gore  
also said the nation should appeal to the entertainment industry to 
``tone it down.''

<HEADLINE>  Ayala Says He's Ready For Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Philadelphia (AP) -- It is not uncommon for professional boxers  
to take lengthy layoffs between fights. No one has ever taken a 
16-year break -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Ayala Jr. said Thursday he will attempt to restart a boxing  
career that saw him go undefeated (22-0, 19 knockouts) before an 
aggravated sexual assault conviction forced him to spend 16 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be in the gym by the end of this month and hope to  
fight sometime in July,'' Ayala, 36, said. ``I'm not going to fight 
bums. I'm in this to go for the title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala was the WBA's top-ranked junior middleweight contender  
after consecutive knockouts of Robbie Epps and Carlos Herrera in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy Jones Jr., Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad, I've got  
my eyes on all of them,'' said Ayala, who was nicknamed ``El 
Torito,'' the Little Bull, for a fearless and ferocious style in 
the ring. ``There is only one way you can find out if you still 
have it, and that is by fighting the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala began thinking about a possible comeback two years ago  
while in prison after being inspired by the success of George 
Foreman, who came back to boxing after a 10-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreman was fighting guys half his age and he was beating  
them. So that planted an idea in my head that maybe, just maybe, I 
could come back and make history,'' Ayala said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are skeptics who feel Ayala is no better prepared to  
return to society, let alone the ring, than was Mike Tyson. Ayala 
concedes there are similarities with Tyson, but that he has changed 
and realizes the opportunity that lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tyson had a golden opportunity when he got out of jail, but he  
was out of control and made bad choices,'' Ayala said. ``He will 
have to learn that he has to live with the choices that he makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala's father, Tony Ayala, said he will once again train his  
son as he did many years ago. He plans to remain in Philadelphia 
for the next month, and then return to San Antonio, Texas with his 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony is the type of fighter that every trainer dreams of,''  
the elder Ayala said. ``He always runs the extra mile and goes the 
extra round. I will definitely know in the gym if he is ready or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Ayala said he weighs about 190 pounds, but that he  
would eventually like to get back to his fighting weight of 154 
pounds. And he remains optimistic that the long layoff will not 
effect his success. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get in shape and a fight is made, I would expect to  
kick ... well, let's just say I would expect to do good,'' said 
Ayala, who discounts critics who think he is too old. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's unprecedented, rare, and insane, but that is what  
I'm going to do,'' Ayala said. ``People said I was too short, too 
fat, too slow and too dumb when I was growing up, but I proved them 
wrong by beating every middleweight in the country.''

<HEADLINE> Boston Changes Live TV Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston TV stations have pledged to run no live  
pictures of SWAT teams, no live footage of escaping victims and no 
cell phone interviews of the sort seen and heard during the 
murderous attack at Colorado's Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact between the broadcasters and police is among the  
country's first in this age of ratings-driven television. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary regulations were developed months ago, before  
Tuesday's massacre in Littleton, Colo., heightened the debate over 
the impact of instant news coverage of dramatic and dangerous 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, the Sun-Times kept the Littleton killings off its  
front page for a second day Thursday, running the story inside on 
pages 2 through 6. The tabloid's editor, Nigel Wade, said 
front-page coverage might traumatize children and lead to copycat 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Society of Professional Journalists and the American  
Society of Newspaper Editors said Thursday it knows of no other 
newspapers deliberately leaving the story off Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's seven TV stations and several local radio broadcasters  
pledged to abide by the ``Partnership Agreement for Responsible 
Broadcasting,'' which sets coverage guidelines during hostage 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact, which pertains to events in Massachusetts, does not  
absolutely prohibit live coverage and carries no penalty if broken. 
Nor does it govern whether local stations air video feed coming in 
from outside the state, such as the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Its goal is to protect those involved in local hostage  
situations rather than to protect viewers from unfolding tragedies 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just about who wins the coverage. It's not about  
ratings and competition,'' Candy Altman, vice president and news 
director at Boston's WCVB-TV, an ABC affiliate, said Thursday. 
``It's about giving the public the information they really need to 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar pacts were made last year among broadcasters in  
Portland, Ore., and Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston agreement limits stations to one pool camera on the  
ground and one helicopter pool in any hostage incident deemed 
``critical'' by Boston, Brookline or Massachusetts State Police. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement began to take shape after a televised  
hostage-taking in Tampa last May. The suspect holed up in a gas 
station after fatally shooting three police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A reporter was talking about SWAT teams going in the back  
door, and you just wanted to go, `Oh, my God, she just got 
potentially five officers killed,''' said Sgt. Detective Margot 
Hill, the Boston police media director who helped develop the 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Tuesday's live footage of a bloodied Columbine High  
student dangling from a window might have endangered the teen-ager 
and his SWAT team rescuers by showing their precise location to the 
attackers, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the pledge, police will give Boston stations  
better locations to set up pool cameras and more frequent updates. 
But sensitive footage cannot be shown until the situation has been 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Harper, a journalism professor at Ithaca College in  
New York and a former ABC bureau chief, said the problem with 
voluntary guidelines is that it's only a matter of time before 
somebody breaks them. 
</P>
<P>
	Patti Dennis, vice president of news at KUSA-TV, the NBC  
affiliate in Denver, said she held back from showing SWAT teams 
converging on Columbine High, fearful the killers might be watching 
television from within the building. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she felt the station erred in broadcasting a cell  
phone interview with a student trapped in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the news media shouldn't be blamed for doing their job,  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to say it's your fault for covering it and it's your  
fault (the shooters) did it in the first place,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> St. Pat's Holds DiMaggio Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio drew big crowds whenever he played.  
</P>
<P>
	The memory of the Yankees Hall of Fame outfielder will bring a  
diverse throng of Joe Fan types, celebrities and former teammates 
to St. Patrick's Cathedral on Friday for a memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list includes Woody Allen, Henry Kissinger and Yogi  
Berra. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner will be there and so will  
Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's next-door neighbor and lawyer who was 
with the ballplayer when he died of complications from lung cancer 
on March 8 at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal John O'Connor will officiate at the service.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Cardinal was a Philadelphia A's fan, but he was also a  
DiMaggio fan, and lately, a fan of the Yankees.'' archdiocese 
spokesman Joseph Zwilling said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Patrick's, as much a New York landmark as Yankee Stadium,  
has become known as the Yankees' cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	Babe Ruth and Billy Martin had funeral Masses there. A Mass was  
held in the church on Fifth Avenue for Roger Maris. Longtime 
Yankees' broadcaster Mel Allen was remembered in a prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	The DiMaggio service will be part of a weekend that will  
culminate Sunday with the unveiling of a granite and bronze 
monument to the Yankee Clipper at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the same people who will be at the memorial service will  
participate in the ceremony at the stadium's Memorial Park which 
also includes monuments to Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and 
Miller Huggins, who managed the Yankees from 1918 to 1929. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Simon, the singer-songwriter whose 1968 ``Mrs. Robinson''  
became a classic ode to nostalgia, will sing the song during the 
unveiling ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a tribute to DiMaggio on Wednesday in Hollywood,  
Fla., where he spent his last 16 years, when a park was dedicated 
in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a perfect thing to do, and very appropriate because  
DiMaggio loved that park,'' said Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bought a golf cart, and we would drive there two or three  
times a week -- it wasn't far from where we lived. Joe and I would 
sit there talking about sports and reading The New York Times for a 
couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe would love to watch the kids playing. He really enjoyed  
the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial at St. Patrick's was organized by Dr. Rock Positano  
and Mario Faustini, two of the friends DiMaggio would visit when he 
came to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to give him the kind of a send-off he wanted,''  
Positano said. ``First class for a first class man.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Approval Rating Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's job approval has slipped  
with the public because of concerns over his handling of foreign 
policy, says a new poll on the conflict in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's overall job approval rating slipped to 56  
percent in a poll released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center for 
the People &AMP; the Press, his lowest level in almost two years. His 
job approval rating had been in the low 60s much of the last year, 
including during his impeachment inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two-thirds of Americans in the poll say ground troops  
will be needed to resolve the conflict in Yugoslavia, and a growing 
number are very worried the fight over Kosovo will cause U.S. 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds say they're very concerned that U.S. troops  
might suffer casualties in the conflict. The portion who are very 
worried there will be casualties, 66 percent, has grown by more 
than 10 percentage points in the last month. And the number very 
concerned about the financial cost of sending troops has grown from 
a fifth of Americans to more than a third. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost three-fourths say it's very important for Clinton to get  
approval from Congress before committing ground troops to stop the 
Serb attacks on the ethnic Albanians who live in Kosovo, a province 
in southern Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Public support has held steady, about six in 10, for NATO's  
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, but more than half said they think 
the attacks will not make the Serbs more likely to agree to a peace 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people recognize the bombing that started four weeks ago is  
``not even coming close to matching the lofty rhetoric used to 
spell out the goals of the campaign,'' said John Hillen, a senior 
fellow in political military studies at the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies. ``You see the creeping realization that 
other forms of pressure will be needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's job approval remained steady among those who  
approve of his foreign policy, with the decline coming among those 
who disapprove of his handling of international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, said the drop  
in the president's job approval is ``a warning sign, not a sea 
change in public opinion about Bill Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though a majority believe ground forces will be necessary  
to stop the Serb attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, public 
opinion is about evenly divided on the use of ground troops if 
airstrikes do not stop the attacks, the poll indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds say the United States and its NATO allies misjudged  
the ability of President Slobodan Milosevic and the Serb military 
to withstand airstrikes, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal 
poll released today. And seven out of 10 in that poll say Clinton 
is reacting to events in Yugoslavia as they occur. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew telephone poll of 1,000 adults was taken April 15-18 and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The 
NBC-WSJ poll of 1,006 people was taken Saturday through Monday and 
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Shopping Software May Be Flawed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Internet surfers can tap online shoppers'  
personal data, including credit card numbers, when common 
``shopping cart'' software used by small retailers is improperly 
installed, an expert says. 
</P>
<P>
	A technician's warning Thursday on the Internet represents one  
of the most wide-ranging security breaches to hit online commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Exposure of confidential information has always tempered Web  
shopping enthusiasm. Despite reservations, though, the government 
has cited private industry figures showing consumers spent $9 
billion online last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The security breach was discovered by Joe Harris, a computer  
technician at Blarg! Online, a Seattle-area Internet service 
provider. He found the problem while examining operations on an 
online store hosted by his service. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 sites on the World Wide Web with the vulnerability  
were found by Harris, who believes ``it's only the tip of the 
iceberg'' and there are hundreds more with similar problems with 
improperly installed shopping cart software. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many would-be Web site developers out there who  
don't know how to set up an online store safely, but they don't 
tell their clients,'' Harris said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing anyone wants to do is kill the golden goose of  
Internet commerce. But this isn't good,'' he said. ``Full 
disclosure is the best policy. If the site doesn't have a privacy 
statement or if it doesn't clearly spell out how they secure their 
data, then shop elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that it managed to  
download more than 100 pages of credit card numbers, travel 
reservations, e-mail and other information from Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a fear in my mind,'' Marilyn Schwab of Portage,  
Wis., whose private information was obtained by the Times, told the 
newspaper. ``Now we know it is not as secure as we think it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Computer programs that are vulnerable to Web browsers if  
improperly installed include those from Order Form, Seaside 
Enterprises, QuikStore, PDGSoft and Mercantec. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sites didn't follow their guidelines. The (software)  
vendors shouldn't be blamed,'' Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Myrtle Beach, S.C.-based QuikStore spokesman Dwight Vietzke said  
only two of its estimated 700 users have reported problems with 
shopping cart installations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a case when human error comes into play,'' Vietzke said.  
``The server has to be set correctly. If they don't know it's a 
problem it just sits there (for all to see).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shopping cart software, if installed incorrectly, saves  
customer order information in an exposed file that can be viewed by 
anyone on the Internet, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Web surfers can download files containing customer names,  
addresses, telephone and credit card numbers, expiration dates and 
order data simply by using a search engine like Hotbot or AltaVista 
and punching in a few simple search words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those files aren't meant to be accessed by a Web browser.  
There is no reason for it to be listed there in the Web site 
tree,'' Harris said. ``If it's not encrypted it shouldn't be there. 
</P>
<P>
	Online stores usually retrieve order information using  
encryption and other security measures, but the orders are 
sometimes placed in a file on the Web site's computer system that 
is easily accessible to an outside Web surfer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think most companies see the magnitude of this. They  
have to take action very quickly,'' said Tara Lemmey, president of 
San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit 
group that promotes online privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	When correctly installed, shopping cart software creates a file  
for confidential information that is inaccessible to outsiders.

<HEADLINE> Left Field to Left Out for Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds took a quick look at teammates  
putting on their uniforms before a game against the Florida 
Marlins, then glanced down at the cast on his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to get back to work,'' he said, explaining his decision  
to show up in the clubhouse Wednesday, about 24 hours after having 
surgery to repair a triceps tendon and a bone spur in his elbow. 
``Because this is what I do for a living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said the San Francisco Giants will be without Bonds for  
a minimum of 10 weeks. Bonds, who in the past has healed quickly 
from other injuries, cannot accept such a timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the cast will come off Friday, and he'll immediately  
begin rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing two months without baseball will be the toughest  
challenge for the slugger, who was batting .366 with four homers 
and 12 RBIs and an .805 slugging percentage this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's painful to watch games on TV. It's just painful to me,''  
Bonds said. ``I'll be here (in the clubhouse) with them off and on. 
I'm not supposed to be here today, but I can't sit at home. That's 
not something I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time NL MVP, who had missed just 20 games in his first  
six seasons with San Francisco, is on the disabled list for the 
second time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only air is invincible,'' he said. ``Last time I checked,  
we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-time All-Star left fielder does not expect to go on  
the Giants' road trip to Montreal, New York and Pittsburgh 
beginning next Tuesday, so he can focus on rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd rather I stay here because I can get more done rather  
than sitting in a hotel and then going to the ballpark,'' he said. 
``What am I going to do in Montreal and Pittsburgh?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds said doctors told him the surgery had to be done now, or  
he could have risked ending a career during which he has become the 
only major leaguer with 400 homers and 400 stolen bases. He has 415 
homers and 447 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was have the surgery or maybe never play baseball  
again,'' he said. ``The doctors said, `What do you want to do? Play 
for several more years, or just roll the dice and maybe tear the 
whole entire triceps?' You never know if you can come back from 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds first felt pain in the elbow during a series at home  
against Houston last week. The pain kept getting more intense, and 
he told Giants manager Dusty Baker about it before Friday's game at 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried playing and sleeping with a rubberized sleeve on the  
elbow, but the sensation worsened. If he spent too long in the 
outfield during an inning, he needed someone to rub his arm before 
batting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew something was wrong. I just didn't know what it was,''  
he said. ``I couldn't straighten my arm out. I felt like something 
was blocking me from extending my arm.''

<HEADLINE> Scottie Pippen Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen was arrested on suspicion of  
driving while intoxicated early this morning after running a red 
light, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer who stopped the Houston Rockets star about 1:30 a.m.  
in downtown Houston was said to have called a member of the 
department's DWI task force after suspecting Pippen was driving 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen did poorly on the field sobriety test and was taken into  
custody, where he was videotaped and given the opportunity to take 
a breathalyzer test, said police spokesman Fred King 
</P>
<P>
	After he refused, Pippen, 33, was booked on suspicion of DWI and  
released just before 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a seven-time NBA all-star with the Chicago Bulls,  
appeared cooperative, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any kind information about any trouble at all,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets spokesman Tim Frank would not discuss the arrest.  
</P>
<P>
	``All I can tell you is that he was arrested,'' Frank said. ``I  
have not seen any of the documentation on this, so I'd prefer not 
to comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How the arrest will affect Pippen's role with the team was  
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to get all the facts before we start looking  
at any team policy,'' Frank said. ``I think that would be 
premature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Pippen left the Bulls, where he had spent his  
11-year pro career, and signed a five-year, $67.2 million contract 
with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Pippen scored just four points Wednesday night in  
the Rockets' 109-95 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. He missed all 
four of his 3-point tries and was 2-8 from the field.

<HEADLINE> Two Groups Put Down $12M For A's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- With two groups having put down $12  
million deposits to buy the Oakland Athletics, public officials 
have until May 11 to select one and forward that bid to major 
league baseball for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement worked out months ago with current team  
owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann, the Oakland-Alameda County 
Coliseum Authority had until Wednesday to receive bids from 
investors willing to buy the team for $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the groups includes former A's executive Andy Dolich,  
Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan and Bob Piccinini, the 
chairman of Modesto-based Save Mart Foods, who provided the deposit 
for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The other group includes former pitcher Steve Stone, now a  
broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs, and former A's coach and New York 
Yankees general manager Bob Watson. That group's deposit was 
provided by Arizona banker Lyle Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolich said he's optimistic his group will have its bid  
forwarded to baseball for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we think the community is looking for is a local group of  
business people, civic leaders, baseball people and people with 
experience in the local political structure who will make a 
long-term commitment,'' Dolich said. ``We have met all the 
parameters that have been laid out, and we are excited to be the 
group that closes this deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement reached with Schott and Hofmann in  
October that set the sale price at $120 million, the Athletics 
agreed to remain at the Oakland Coliseum for at least three more 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The A's agreed to stay in Oakland through the end of the 2001  
season, with a right to extend their lease on a year-to-year basis 
through the 2004 season. When Schott and Hofmann bought the A's for 
$85 million in 1995, they signed a nine-year lease at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	If either of the groups buys the A's, they will be required to  
keep the team in Oakland through at least the end of the 2004 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	If public officials cannot work out a deal to sell the team,  
Schott and Hofmann will have the right to sell or move the A's. San 
Jose has been mentioned as a city possibly interested in seeking 
the team.

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses To Stop CBS Broadcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Hidden-camera footage in a CBS report on the  
nation's largest psychiatric hospital chain showed workers 
complaining about a lack of training and changing the vital signs 
on a patient's chart without checking the patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Another portion of the ``60 Minutes II'' broadcast Wednesday  
night showed workers restraining a screaming girl who had not been 
informed she was being committed. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS aired the report about Charter Behavioral Health Systems  
just hours after a federal judge in Charlotte denied Charter's 
request to stop the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter, which runs 91 hospitals in 32 states, accused CBS of  
violating patient confidentiality by hiring a social worker to work 
undercover at Charter Pines in Charlotte and to wear a hidden 
camera on his eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS used footage shot by the clinical worker, Terrance Johnson,  
to document alleged cases of falsified records and patient 
mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The hour-long program was prompted by the death of 16-year-old  
Tristan Sovern, who died in March 1998 at a Charter hospital in 
Greensboro after being restrained with a bed sheet and towel over 
his mouth and nose. 
</P>
<P>
	A Charter employee, Megan Duffany, 23, is charged with  
involuntary manslaughter in Sovern's death. Her trial began Monday 
in Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, attorneys for Charter asked U.S. District Judge  
Graham Mullen for a temporary restraining order to block the 
telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter attorney John Wester argued that the program would  
violate patients' privacy, even though patients' faces were blurred 
and their voices were altered for the report.

	CBS attorney Lee Levine said the report raised important  
questions about the quality of care at psychiatric hospitals.

<P>
	Mullen said he was concerned that laws might have been broken in  
assembling the hidden-camera report, but he said he had no choice 
but to deny the motion.

	``It appears to this court that the Supreme Court has elevated  
press powers to the point where prior restraint is all but 
impossible to obtain, even when the press sets out to commit a 
crime,'' he said.

<P>
	``Certainly, the press is not free to commit a crime or set  
people out to commit a crime,'' Mullen said. ``But even if they 
did, it does not give me the opportunity to shut it down.''

<P>
	The judge said he would ask the U.S. attorney's office to look  
into whether CBS or its employees violated federal mail fraud laws.

<P>
	``The judge refused to stop this program, but that's not going  
to prevent a lawsuit on the news gathering conduct,'' said David 
Hudson, an attorney at the First Amendment Center in Nashville, 
Tenn. ``That's a trend we're seeing; news services are being sued 
(for claims) other than defamation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News, said the network's news  
gathering was within the law.

<P>
	``I'm very confident that we can successfully defend ourself  
against any litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over use of hidden cameras by a television news  
organization comes two years after a North Carolina jury ordered 
ABC to pay $5.5 million for using the technique in an investigation 
of the Food Lion supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	The award later was reduced to $315,000 and is still under  
appeal.

<HEADLINE> Chevron Earnings Drop 35 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Chevron Corp.'s earnings dropped 35 percent  
in the first quarter because of low oil, gas and chemical prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron reported Thursday it earned $329 million, or 50 cents  
per share, from $507 million, or 77 cents per share in 
first-quarter 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched the expectation of Wall Street analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron's total revenues for the first quarter were $6.7  
billion, a decrease of 12 percent from $7.6 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron joined other oil companies in announcing earnings that  
were hurt by depressed crude oil, natural gas and commodity 
chemical prices. Lower demand around the world due to poor economic 
conditions has forced oil companies to lower the prices they charge 
their customers, reducing their revenues and profits along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been operating in this difficult price environment for  
more than a year now,'' said chairman and CEO Ken Derr. The recent 
move upward in crude oil and natural gas prices came too late to 
help first quarter earnings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter, the company's average U.S. crude oil sale  
prices fell 20 percent to just under $10. Chevron's natural gas 
sales prices also fell 22 percent to $1.63 per thousand cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it reduced expenses by about $80 million during  
the quarter. It hopes to cut expenses overall by $500 million.

<HEADLINE> Giants Acquire Pitcher Spradlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Giants acquired relief  
pitcher Jerry Spradlin from the Cleveland Indians on Thursday night 
for minor league outfielder Dan McKinley and a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Spradlin began his career with Cincinnati in 1993 and played two  
full seasons with Philadelphia before he was traded to Cleveland in 
the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 right-hander was 4-4 last season with a 3.53 ERA in  
69 games, including a 28-game stretch without walking a batter. 
With the Indians, he had given up six runs in three innings without 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had our eye on him for the last two years,'' Giants  
general manager Brian Sabean said. ``We felt this was a chance to 
further strengthen our bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley, a compensation draft pick in 1997, spent last year in  
Single-A Bakersfield and Double-A Shreveport, his first season in 
professional baseball. He hit a combined .273 with 19 doubles, 
seven triples and six home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Spradlin is signed through 2000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says APEC Should Acting on Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Time for talking about the Y2K problem has run  
out in the Asia-Pacific region and leaders must begin seeking 
solutions, the top U.S. millennium bug troubleshooter said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning by John Koskinen, head of the President's Council on  
Year 2000 Conversion, came a day after the Clinton administration 
predicted the greatest threat to America from the Year 2000 glitch 
could come from computer failures overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest report on preparing for the Y2K problem, the White  
House has said failures are all but certain in some foreign 
countries because of their late efforts to fix systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the stage when we need to go beyond awareness and  
focus on action,'' Koskinen told experts in Singapore via video 
link from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen was addressing 150 experts from the Asia-Pacific  
Economic Cooperation forum who gathered for a two-day conference on 
the millennium bug. The glitch, an offshoot of old programming that 
doesn't distinguish between the years 1900 and 2000, could cause 
catastrophic computer shutdowns on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Several experts have said the forum's aim is not to judge the  
region's readiness for combating the problem. Instead, they said, 
they will identify areas that might break down and spread to other 
economies in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	But Koskinen called for a more solution-oriented approach,  
noting there are ``only 254 days to go'' until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thinking about this conference, it's clear we must be moving  
on from discussing the nature of the problem and simply sharing the 
information,'' Koskinen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, he said, major problems in the region should be  
identified and solutions to them suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to focus in depth on specific problems,'' such as  
transportation, energy, telecommunications and financial services, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another speech at the Singapore gathering, Takeo Shiina, a  
Y2K expert from Japan, said it is ``very important'' for 
governments and businesses as well as individuals to make 
contingency plans for Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every family should have its own contingency plans,'' to avoid  
panicking and social unrest, Shiina said. 
</P>
<P>
	APEC includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong  
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, 
Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, 
Thailand, Vietnam and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	As one of the first countries to enter the year 2000, experts in  
New Zealand are worried they will be jammed with inquiries from 
around the world on how things went Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think a mechanism should be set up so that institutions and  
individuals from all over the world don't call us all at once,'' 
John Good, an adviser to New Zealand's Y2K Readiness Commission, 
told The Associated Press on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: U.N. Monitors Damaged Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAURA, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq on Thursday accused U.N. disarmament  
experts of damaging its main livestock vaccine plant by destroying 
equipment during a search related to biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusation by plant director Muntasir al-Ani disputes claims  
by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler that the factory is 
still capable of producing the vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	The government took foreign media representatives on a guided  
tour Thursday of the plant in Daura, 12 miles south of Baghdad. 
Entangled pieces of destroyed equipment and small heaps of scrap 
dotted the sprawling facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventilation pipes and sluices were chopped off at several  
places. One autoclave, in the shape of a circular container for 
sterilizing and heating, was left intact while another in an 
adjacent room was cut to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. inspectors had raided the plant in 1996 to dismantle  
equipment that Iraq acknowledged was installed in the plant to make 
weapons for germ warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	But the inspectors ``did not only destroy those parts but have  
disabled the whole factory,'' Sinan Abdul-Hassan of Iraq's National 
Monitoring Directorate told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The directorate coordinated U.N. disarmament activities in the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Ani, the plant director, said the inspectors spared some 40  
pieces of equipment but also cemented and chopped off the factory's 
air-handling system, without which it will be impossible to start 
production. He said 28 pieces of equipment were dismantled, but he 
did not give details. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Special  
Commission, which Butler heads, insisted Thursday that inspectors 
had done the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason why we destroyed it was because the Iraqis admitted  
themselves that they had indeed turned the place into a biological 
weapons factory producing the deadly agent botulinum toxin,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler said in a letter released last month that 40 major  
pieces, originally imported for the production of foot-and-mouth 
disease vaccine, had been left intact and could be put back to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization reported last month  
that at least 1 million farm animals in Iraq have been crippled by 
a foot-and-mouth epidemic and at least 400,000 have died because of 
a lack of vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the cease-fire terms ending the 1991 Persian Gulf War,  
Iraq must rid itself of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as 
well as its long-range missiles. The disarmament is a key condition 
to the lifting of U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 
invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspectors left Iraq shortly before the United States and  
Britain launched the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes in response to what they 
said was Iraqi provocation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes bombed Iraqi air defense sites in the  
northern no-fly zone Thursday after being threatened by 
anti-aircraft fire, the U.S. military said. Iraq said one civilian 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern and southern no-fly zones were set up after the Gulf  
War to prevent Iraqi military aircraft from threatening opposition 
groups living in the northern and southern portions of the country.

<HEADLINE> Open Scoring System Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three championship fights makes for an  
attractive card, yet it's the controversial open scoring system 
that could make Saturday's night of boxing at the MCI Center an 
event to remember. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Boxing Association will post scores from the ringside  
judges after each round when Sharmba Mitchell defends his super 
lightweight title against Reggie Green. The other two bouts will 
employ a different type of open scoring, which has not been used in 
any form this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores will be announced after the fourth, eighth and final  
rounds in the World Boxing Council middleweight fight between 
Hassine Cherifi of France and Keith Holmes of Washington. That 
system will also be used when Washington's Mark Johnson meets 
Ratanchai Vorapin for the vacant International Boxing Federation 
junior bantamweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually everyone associated with the sport has an opinion on  
open scoring, which has become fashionable again in the wake of 
last month's questionable draw in the heavyweight unification bout 
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Open scoring advocates, including promoters Don King and Bob  
Arum, insist that open scoring will deaden the cries of ``fix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It will help restore public trust in boxing,'' Arum said.  
</P>
<P>
	Others say open scoring will only create further controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not one good thing that can come out of open  
scoring,'' said promoter Dan Goossen of America Presents. ``We're 
trying to alleviate incompetency and dishonesty, and open scoring 
does neither.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goossen was the only promoter to testify Thursday at a Senate  
committee hearing on the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, a bill 
that would essentially limit restrictive option contracts to one 
year and increase financial disclosures by promoters to state 
boxing commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Goossen is even more adamant about the eradication of opening  
scoring, comparing it to a surveillance tape of a thief robbing a 
convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	``A crime was still committed; now you just have a tape of it.  
If a fight is scored poorly, then the only thing open scoring does 
is depict the crime in progress,'' Goossen said. ``I'm not saying 
there will be `crimes' committed this weekend, but we're not 
accomplishing what we need in this sport -- better officiating at 
ringside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goossen advocates a school for ringside judges and a rating  
system that would allow only the best judges to work championship 
fights. He also suggested that open scoring could taint the fight 
because a boxer with a sizeable point advantage late in the bout 
could simply run from his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things can go wrong. It didn't work then and it won't  
work now,'' said Harold Weston, Green's promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell (44-2, 29 KOs) will be making his second title defense.  
Green (29-2, 14 KOs) is 10-0 since October 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no telling how the fans in Washington might react if  
Green, the local favorite, appears to be dominating the fight but 
is shown trailing after the 10th round. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes (32-2, 21 KOs) will attempt to regain the WBC title he  
lost to Cherifi (26-2-1, 17 KOs) nearly a year ago. The two were 
scheduled to fight in February, but Cherifi withdrew after injuring 
his back.

<HEADLINE> What Is This Gothic Sub-Culture? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They call themselves ``Goths,'' short  
for Gothic, a subculture of youths who wear black, listen to shock 
rocker Marilyn Manson and think a lot about death. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a haven of dark fantasy, embraced by many adolescents  
looking for their own place in a confusing world. They form cliques 
at schools and communicate over the Internet in the countless Goth 
Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet for all their interest in doom and gloom, the Goths were  
largely seen as benign outsiders, a little weird perhaps, but 
certainly harmless. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Two Littleton high school students who adopted at least some of  
the trappings of the Goth lifestyle, from their dark trench coats 
to their interest in Manson's music, mowed down their classmates, 
killing 12 students and a teacher before taking their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Those in the Goth world quickly distanced themselves from the  
massacre at Columbine High School. Although they celebrate what 
they see as the beauty of the macabre, they said they don't believe 
in violence and hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not feel that those youths in any way reflect Goth youth  
or Goth culture,'' said Ali Ohta, publicity director for Cleopatra 
Records, a Goth music label based in Los Angeles. ``These youths 
were heavily troubled. Everyone, including the media, is looking 
for a scapegoat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manson said in a statement: ``It's tragic and disgusting any  
time young people's lives are taken in an act of senseless 
violence. My condolences go out to the students and their 
families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manson had been scheduled to headline a concert in Denver on  
April 30. The show was canceled by the radio station sponsoring it. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students described the suicide assailants, Eric  
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, as part of clique of about 15 
students who looked to their classmates like Goths. The dressed the 
part with their black trench coats, rain or shine. Harris belonged 
to a Web group featuring Gothic lore. 
</P>
<P>
	But some students said the pair only embraced some of the Goth  
look. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not that bad, with all the white makeup and all the  
ear piercings,'' said one student, Jalene Sauter, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, the two teen-agers apparently were influenced by  
neo-Nazism, harbored racist attitudes and were in a simmering feud 
with the school's jocks. All of which would be anathema to a true 
Goth, according to Rik Millhouse, managing editor of Interface 
magazine, which follows the Goth culture. 
</P>
<P>
	He described Goth fans as ``by and large passive peoples whose  
main direction in life is one of encompassing acceptance for 
persons of all colors, creeds and individual pursuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Goth movement is linked to music, growing out of post-punk  
Britain in the 1970s and rising in underground clubs in Los Angeles 
as ``death rock'' in the early 1980s. Goths are interested in 
vampires and witchcraft and death -- the darker side of life. Many 
cultivate a ghostly pallor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site for a Goth band called Lestat reads, ``Death is the  
mother of beauty.'' Other sites sell a variety of Goth gear, from 
leather armor, to cloaks and capes, to little gargoyle statues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for kids Goth is a source of power, a source of  
community,'' said Kirk Olson, an associate with Minneapolis-based 
Iconoculture, which does market research on cultural trends. ``Kids 
who feel alienated are searching for power in something else. One 
way of doing that is to differentiate themselves as much as 
possible from the mainstream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Hartmann, co-owner of Rising Phoenix, a Goth coffeehouse  
just outside Denver, said the Goth people are ``just like the 
hippies in the 1960s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just trying to find their own identity, to fit in,  
experiment,'' she Ms. Hartmann, whose shop has twice-weekly ``Goth 
Night'' dances. ``They're good kids, kids just like anybody's kids. 
They are anybody's kids.''

<HEADLINE> Cooke Withdraws Redskins Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Team president John Kent Cooke unexpectedly  
withdrew his bid for the Washington Redskins on Thursday, and The 
Associated Press has learned that the team's trustees are close to 
a making a deal to sell the team to communications executive Daniel 
Snyder for $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke, apparently ending his dream of owning the team his father  
owned, pulled out with a statement indicative of his ongoing 
frustration with the trustees overseeing his father's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week I presented a greatly increased offer ... for the  
Washington Redskins and Jack Kent Cooke Stadium,'' Cooke said. 
``The executors failed to act on my offer and today I have 
withdrawn it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to be used merely to increase the bids of others,  
since it is well known that I have always wanted to keep the 
Redskins in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees have essentially ignored Cooke's latest offer,  
which he said was higher than the $680 bid he made last fall, and 
have chosen instead to negotiate directly with Snyder, according to 
sources close to the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was a partner with New York estate developer Howard  
Milstein in an $800 million offer that in January was named the 
winner in a round of bidding conducted by the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milstein withdrew the bid earlier this month when it became  
apparent that NFL owners would not approve it. The owners said 
Milstein was using too much borrowed money to finance the purchase, 
and there were also concerns about the type of owner he would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, head of Bethesda, Md.-based Snyder Communications, did  
have ready cash behind his bid and was well received by some NFL 
owners. He has since assembled his own group that includes 
publishing executives Mort Zuckerman and Fred Drasner to match the 
$800 million offer he originally made with Milstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources told the AP that a deal with Snyder could be  
completed within 10 days and presented to the owners at the May 
25-26 league meetings in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	League officials refused to comment, but commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue indicated Saturday that the matter could be resolved in 
``an expedited schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``(It's possible) we would present something at our league  
meeting in May, if not before,'' Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kent Cooke died April 6, 1997. Rather than leave the  
Redskins to his son, he instructed that the Redskins be sold and 
the process used to establish a scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the trustees declined comment.

<HEADLINE> NATO Expansion Taking Back Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just six weeks ago, when Poland, Hungary and  
the Czech Republic joined NATO, it appeared further enlargement 
would be a major topic at the alliance's 50th anniversary meeting. 
Not any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the subject will be Yugoslavia, with talk of expansion  
shoved far into the background. 
</P>
<P>
	Though linked to NATO through its Partnership for Peace,  
Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Lithuania, Estonia and 
Latvia still yearn for full membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fully aware we can't survive alone,'' said Slovenian  
Foreign Minister Boris Frlec. ``We are continuing our endeavors to 
convince NATO we are reliable, dependable, trustworthy and capable 
allies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright this week said the summit  
would ``confirm our readiness to face the future with new members 
and new capabilities, prepared for new missions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But little more is promised to the countries that want to join  
the club: The summit is expected to keep the path clear for future 
expansion without saying which countries might be added or when. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had planned a summit that focused a bit on the past and a  
great deal on the future. That will still be very central to the 
summit's agenda, but now it's necessary to have it focus intensely 
on the present as well,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy 
Berger as last-minute changes were being made in the summit agenda 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The present is the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, which  
has been supported by all NATO members and at least accepted by 
most members of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before anniversary commemoration ceremonies Friday, NATO  
heads of state will meet to discuss the airstrikes aimed at 
stopping Yugoslav repression in Serbia's Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	The new members -- Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic -- take  
the spotlight later Friday with ceremonies in the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo action has thrust NATO into a new role of fighting  
abuse against people within a nonmember state -- something that 
encourages some prospective members. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also enhances Russia's strong opposition both to the  
alliance bombing of Yugoslavia and to its expansion eastward. 
Russia announced Wednesday it is boycotting the summit because of 
the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Success would engender enlargement,'' said Janusz Bugajski,  
analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, 
because prospective members will see it as evidence that NATO 
offers effective protection against aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failure would bring into question the whole purpose of NATO in  
eastern Europe, including the Balkans,'' Bugajski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance formed after World War II to counter the emerging  
power of the Soviet Union requires its new members to meet 
standards of democracy, economic freedom and military preparedness. 
Ten European members, the United States and Canada signed the 
original pact. Greece and Turkey joined in 1952, Germany in 1955 
and Spain in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries that want to join the alliance hope the 50th  
anniversary meetings will produce at least a date for the next NATO 
expansion summit, said Slovenian Ambassador Dimitrij Rupel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to have more specific dates and shorter time  
spans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Slovenia understands that a true breakthrough in  
NATO expansion would require Russian cooperation. And Russia views 
the eastward expansion of NATO as a danger to its security, made 
even more alarming by NATO bombing in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithuanian Ambassador Stasys Skalauskas said he is hoping that  
NATO will commit to a program that will help better prepare 
countries for full membership -- a program tailored to each 
partnership member. 
</P>
<P>
	``Countries are at a different level of preparedness,'' he said,  
adding that NATO also should set up a system to regularly review 
progress toward full membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithuania feels it has an advantage because its president is a  
former U.S. citizen who served as an official in the Environmental 
Protection Agency. Valdas Adamkus lived in the United States for 
five decades before returning to the country he had fled. He 
renounced his U.S. citizenship after he was elected.

<HEADLINE> James Signs Colts Injury Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Edgerrin James, the Indianapolis Colts'  
surprise first-round draft pick, plans to participate in the team's 
minicamp this weekend after signing an injury protection agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	James, who was selected ahead of Heisman Trophy winner Ricky  
Williams, is the only first-round pick who hasn't signed with an 
agent and the agreement was reached with the help of a group known 
as ``Team Edgerrin.'' James, who will become a multimillionaire 
once he signs, has said he doesn't see any reason to share his 
wealth with an agent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the NFL player's union contends that the collective  
bargaining agreement requires a player to either negotiate on his 
own or with the help of an agent certified by the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement allows the former Miami running back to  
participate in on-field activity while protecting his financial 
interest in case of injury. If he is hurt, the agreement guarantees 
he will receive an undisclosed amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no problem whatsoever. We haven't negotiated  
anything. This is not a contract,'' said Pierre Rutledge, who is 
among a group of men advising James at his request. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's for injury protection. Up until now the Colts and (team  
president) Bill Polian have been fair, that's all you can ask. We 
want this entire process to be handled fairly and properly and it 
will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James will be represented by someone certified by the player's  
union when contract talks begin, Rutledge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would not do anything that would jeopardize the Colts or  
Edgerrin James' future with the team,'' Rutledge said. ``Bill 
Polian helped write the collective bargaining agreement. Do you 
think he would do something to jeopardize Edgerrin?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polian declined to discuss the issue on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lehman Executive Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A vice president of the investment firm  
Lehman Brothers has apologized to Thailand's ambassador to the 
United Nations for saying the country ``deserved'' the Asian 
economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Dickson wrote in a two-page letter that he really meant  
that the crisis was ``unavoidable'' and wished to ``express my 
deepest regret if I offended anyone; it was never my intention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came during a presentation Dickson made March 15 at  
the United Nations. The letter, faxed to news organizations in 
Bangkok by the Foreign Ministry, was addressed to Ambassador Asda 
Jayanama. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickson wrote ``that my error has negatively affected my  
colleagues in Thailand, through no fault of their own, especially 
given that my participation on the panel was in an unofficial 
capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one was available at Lehman's office in Bangkok for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Thailand plunged into economic crisis in mid-1997 after the  
government was forced to float the currency following six months of 
unsuccessful defense against speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	The ensuing collapse revealed that the financial system had been  
poorly regulated for years. Half of the country's commercial 
financial institutions had to be shut down and the economy is only 
now thought to be bottoming out from the worst recession since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a poor word choice when I said that Thailand `deserved'  
the devaluation,'' Dickson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather, I should have more clearly expressed my view that the  
devaluation came partly as the result of domestic economic 
imbalances, created in large part by changing global credit 
conditions and also from direct external pressure,'' the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the global environment, the devaluation became virtually  
unavoidable (and only in this sense could it be called `deserved,' 
though in retrospect I thoroughly regret the use of the word),'' he 
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Ford Addresses Modular Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIXOM, Mich. (AP) -- ``Modular assembly'' is not the  
revolutionary cost-savings panacea that some in the auto industry 
have implied, the manufacturing chief at Ford Motor Co. says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a modular system, lower-cost suppliers do most of the  
preassembly work that commonly is done in U.S. assembly plants by 
high-wage union workers. Easy-to-install parts ``modules'' -- such 
as entire dashboards or complete doors -- are delivered to the plant 
for installation on the chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	Savings come from needing fewer assembly workers and by sharing  
more of the engineering and design costs with suppliers. Modular 
plants also are designed to be more flexible, so model changes can 
be made more often and at lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ford is not opposed to adopting modular assembly methods,  
it does not plan to start from scratch with all-new plants, James 
J. Padilla, vice president of manufacturing, said during a tour of 
Ford's Wixom assembly plant Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modularity is an opportunity, but it is not a panacea,''  
Padilla said. ``Where it makes sense, would we like to do some 
modularity? Yeah. Do I see this as a magic answer to everything? 
Absolutely not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM is building a modular assembly plant in Brazil and is  
considering plans to build three more in Ohio and Michigan. It's 
negotiating details of those plans with the United Auto Workers, 
whose president has dismissed modular assembly as ``just another 
way to destroy good-paying jobs and benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a modular plant may result in labor savings, labor  
represents only a portion of the cost of building a vehicle; if the 
new plant substantially increases the investment costs per car, 
``you may not have made a good tradeoff,'' Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM president G. Richard Wagoner Jr. acknowledged as much in an  
interview last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a cost to switch over, and sometimes it's actually a  
negative factor,'' Wagoner said. ``So it's going to be looked at 
product by product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, GM has talked mostly about building new modular plants  
to produce small cars. GM says its currently loses about $1,000 on 
each small car it sells in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's strategy is to make the plants it already has more  
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe in just building new `green field' plants to  
introduce a new process,'' he said. ``Ford's strategy is to build 
from the inside out. We've got one of the highest skilled, most 
capable work forces in the world and we're going to work with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW will negotiate new national contracts with GM, Ford and  
the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG in the summer and fall. 
Union president Stephen Yokich has indicated that modular assembly 
will be a major issue in the triennial talks. 
</P>
<P>
	GM enters the talks determined to repair its fractured  
relationship with its largest union. While Ford has not endured a 
UAW strike since 1986, the last decade has been marked by dozens of 
local strikes against GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Padilla suggested that equally significant or greater cost  
savings could come from platform engineering, in which multiple 
models that look and drive differently are built off the same 
``platform,'' an industry term that refers to a common chassis and 
major mechanical parts. 
</P>
<P>
	An example of that is the 2000 Lincoln LS luxury sedan, which  
went into regular production at Wixom this week. The LS will share 
its platform with the new 2000 Jaguar S-class, which will be built 
in England, and the new Ford Thunderbird roadster that also will be 
built at Wixom and debut in the 2001 model year. 
</P>
<P>
	By sharing engineering and development costs and many of the  
parts that the customer never sees, Ford expects the total 
per-vehicle cost of the three cars to be substantially lower than 
if each had been engineered and designed separately.

Carax; ``L'Humanite'' by Bruno Dumont; ``Nos Vies Heureuses,'' a 
debut film by Jacques Maillot; and ``Le Temps Retrouve'' by Raoul 
Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Chen's film, other Asian entries are Japan's Takeshi  
Kitano with ``The Summer of Kikujiro'' and ``Love Will Tear Us 
Apart,'' a debut film by Hong Kong director Yu Lik Wai. 
</P>
<P>
	Other films are Italy's ``La Balia'' by Marco Bellocchio;  
Belgium's ``Rosetta'' by Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne; Mexico's 
``No One Writes to the Colonel,'' by Arturo Ripstein; and 
``Moloch'' by Alexander Sokourov, a German-Russian production. 
</P>
<P>
	There will also be special showings sure to grab attention,  
including ``EDtv'' by Ron Howard; ``The Limey'' by Steven 
Soderbergh, also a former Golden Palm winner; and ``My Intimate 
Enemy'' by German director Werner Herzog.

<HEADLINE> UBS Announces 21 Pct Rise in Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Banking giant UBS AG Thursday  
reported a 21 percent rise in first-quarter profits to $1.08 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's biggest bank, formed last year by the merger of Union  
Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., said the improvement 
resulted from higher revenues and lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive officer Marcel Ospel told UBS shareholders that  
the ``strains and stresses the merger inevitably brought with it 
are now largely behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UBS' investment bank Warburg Dillon Read, hit last year with  
losses from various exposures, had an ``excellent'' performance in 
the first quarter, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, UBS announced a net profit of $2.2 billion in 1998  
despite hedge-fund losses and an out-of-court settlement of 
Holocaust claims in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Viking Carl Eller Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Former Minnesota Vikings great Carl  
Eller was arrested early today after a woman reported that she had 
been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	North Mankato police received the 911 at 1:55 a.m. and arrested  
Eller at an undisclosed location, Capt. Wayne Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eller was being held in the Nicollet County Jail.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman declined to give details. He would not reveal the  
woman's condition or whether she had any prior relationship with 
Eller. 
</P>
<P>
	Eller, 57, was a star defensive end with the Vikings' ``Purple  
People Eaters,'' the front four that helped Minnesota to four NFC 
championships and Super Bowl appearances in the late 1960s and 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Eller made six Pro Bowl appearances and was among 15 finalists  
for the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year, though he didn't get 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently accepted a newly created position with the Minnesota  
Department of Human Services as a policy analyst and spokesman on 
risky behaviors, after spending nearly two decades as a drug and 
alcohol abuse counselor. He opened three clinics over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	When Eller retired from football, he had to deal with his own  
drug and alcohol problems, which included cocaine addiction.

<HEADLINE> Utah Colleges May Break for Jan. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah's public colleges and universities  
are considering not holding classes the first week of 2000 to deal 
with the Y2K computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been some discussion of not having classes right  
away, that maybe they won't be open that first week, just so Jan. 1 
comes and goes and things are worked out,'' said Higher Education 
Commissioner Cecelia Foxley. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents at Utah's nine public colleges and universities  
requested $45 million to deal with the computer problem. The state 
Board of Regents trimmed that to about $20 million in its annual 
budget request to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers gave the schools $4.4 million, and now administrators  
are scrambling to patch together solutions so the colleges' 
electronic infrastructure does not crumble. 
</P>
<P>
	There are concerns about financial aid information, student  
records and extensive computer networks, as well as 
computer-dependent heating and security systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Community College President Frank Budd said that under  
the new semester system, his school would open just after Jan. 1, 
but now he is rethinking that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably bump back a couple of days, just to see what  
surprises we have in store,'' he said. ``It's better for us not to 
have 20,000 students show up along with hundreds of faculty and 
staff (in case) we have some systems glitch we didn't expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators appropriated $8 million for all of state government,  
with the colleges receiving more than half of that. 
</P>
<P>
	State computer experts allocated the funds to each school based  
on need. Funding ranges from $931,000 for the University of Utah to 
$108,000 for Snow College. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators did not set aside any funds to replace outdated  
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Educators said they will do the best they can, though they are  
predicting problems, especially in student computer labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew they weren't going to get everything,'' said Foxley.  
``They did the best they could with the scarce amount of funds.''

<HEADLINE> On Earth Day, Businesses Go Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Corporations are going green this Earth Day.  
</P>
<P>
	The Albertson's supermarket chain is handing out paper bags that  
students decorated with environmental messages. A Ford plant in 
Plymouth, Mich., is holding an energy fair. A group of companies in 
Sheboygan, Wis., is judging posters made by fifth graders. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all part of a plan for corporate America, tired of being on  
the defensive for Earth Day, to celebrate what spokesmen describe 
as $1 trillion worth of efforts to clean up air, water and land 
over 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Today is the 30th Earth Day.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to stop vilifying business,'' U.S. Chamber of  
Commerce spokesman Frank Coleman said. ``The theme is: Thank 
business for cleaning up the environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists say no thanks.  
</P>
<P>
	``These associations are distorting their anti-environmental  
record by celebrating Earth Day,'' said Deb Callahan, president of 
the League of Conservation Voters. ``It's something we call green 
scamming. These associations have not been showing any 
environmental leadership except in the realm of environmental 
rollbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders say they have an environmental record to be  
proud of. The Timken Co., a steel manufacturer in Canton, Ohio, 
installed a $17 million, state-of-the-art facility to treat and 
reuse the 10 billion gallons of water the firm uses each year. 
Timken is included in a book published by the National Association 
of Manufacturers highlighting 16 companies that found 
environmentally friendly ways to do business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to tell people what we're doing,'' said Bill Fladung,  
the company's general manager of environmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	While environmentalists float through wilderness on the Colorado  
River, protest logging with a hike in West Virginia's Blackwater 
Canyon and sponsor numerous rallies and shoreline cleanups, 
corporations have plans of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 50 businesses are sponsoring Earth Day events in 35  
cities, from Springfield, Mass., to Fremont, Calif., according to 
NAM. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Lilly is preparing to hand out Frisbee-style toys made of  
recycled plastic at a festival in Indianapolis. Anchor Glass 
Container Corp. of Henryetta, Okla., is offering coupons for 
groceries in glass bottles and jars, which can be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
	The chamber sent an opinion article to 1,000 newspapers and  
business journals, faxed talking points to 8,000 business owners, 
urging them to speak out locally, and crowed about the corporate 
environmental record on a special Internet site.

	That record in cleaning up the environment gives corporate  
America credibility in opposing further rules, Coleman said.

<HEADLINE>  U.S., NATO May Consider Ground Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and British officials said today it is  
prudent, after four weeks of airstrikes, to consider whether NATO's 
military policy in Yugoslavia should be reversed to allow the 
deployment of ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has asked Army Gen. Wesley  
Clark, supreme commander of NATO forces in Europe, to update the 
military assessment made in October that the Yugoslavia campaign 
should be limited to the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will make all the assessments necessary to make sure we  
succeed,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said after meeting 
with congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	At a State Department news conference with Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, ``We 
want the military to be ready for contingencies and to make sure 
that they're ready for all options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``But that doesn't mean to say the policy is  
changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials used the word ``prudent'' when  
discussing the decision to update the military assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not favor the employment of ground forces in a hostile  
environment,'' Albright said. But she added, ``I think it is 
inappropriate to rule anything out and we have not done so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said the reassessment would take  
into account new facts on the ground, including the buildup of 
Serbs forces in the past few months inside the Serbian province of 
Kosovo; the expulsion of up to 1 million ethnic Albanians from 
their homes; and the effects of NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The review would explore both what a NATO peacekeeping force  
would look like if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agrees to 
halt fighting Kosovar Albanians and what it would take to send 
ground forces into Yugoslavia and Kosovo ``in a nonpermissive 
environment,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Secretary-General Solana's feeling that given the changes  
on the ground in the last couple of months, it's just prudent to 
look at those plans and see where they stand,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no NATO consensus, however, to put together any detailed  
military planning for a ground invasion, Bacon said, which could 
take from 75,000 to 200,000 troops, according to the earlier 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO attacked one of Milosevic's homes in Belgrade late  
Wednesday because the two-story house contained elements of a 
command-and-control center and a military bunker, Bacon said. He 
disputed any notion the allies are trying to kill Milosevic or his 
family and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not targeting President Milosevic or the Serb people,''  
Bacon said. ``We are targeting the military and the military 
infrastructure that supports the instruments of oppression in 
Kosovo. ... We are going against the nervous system used to control 
the military forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO flew 324 sorties Wednesday night, bringing the total to  
9,300 since Operation Allied Force began March 24, the Pentagon 
said. Defense officials estimated half of Serb aircraft have been 
destroyed and 10 percent to 20 percent of their tanks and armored 
personnel carriers. Nearly one-third of the Serbs' top air defense 
batteries also have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen told a House Appropriations  
subcommittee Wednesday that NATO is not considering a ground 
assault, although plans could be updated ``very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The topic of ground troops is certain to dominate the agenda of  
the 50th anniversary NATO summit, which goes through the weekend. 
Blair and Clinton discussed the issue Wednesday night at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both leaders agreed that our common position has not  
changed,'' National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said 
afterwards. ``There is no intention to introduce ground troops into 
a nonpermissible environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon, meanwhile, awarded a $41 million contract to  
Boeing Co. to convert 95 nuclear-armed cruise missiles to the 
nonnuclear version that B-52 bombers have been launching at 
Yugoslavia. The work is scheduled to be finished by Nov. 30. The 
Air Force inventory of conventionally armed cruise missiles has 
been depleted by the heavy use against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Before flying to Washington, Blair told the House of Commons  
that sending ground troops ahead of a peace deal remained an 
option. Milosevic would not be able to prevent ground troops from 
being deployed, Blair said, though he added that an invasion 
against full-strength Yugoslav forces would pose ``formidable'' 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the United States  
had not asked for a reassessment of the airstrike strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``We believe that if the military command  
believes that this is the right way to go and that it would be 
prudent for them to update, then it's certainly something we'd 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials long have insisted that only an air  
campaign is envisioned against Yugoslav troops. But 25 days of air 
bombardment appear not to have stemmed Milosevic's aggression 
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province of the dominant 
Yugoslav republic of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore announced Wednesday that 20,000 Kosovar  
Albanian refugees would resettle temporarily in the United States. 
Gore said the effort would focus on ``those with close family ties 
in America and those who are vulnerable, and we will have them here 
until they are able to return home safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House deputy chief of staff Maria Echaveste said officials  
would try to match refugees with relatives or sponsors after the 
refugees arrived at two or three ports along the East Coast. 
``We're going to be focusing on family reunification,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the political front, the House International Relations  
Committee today put off until Tuesday a vote on a resolution by 
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., to invoke the War Powers Act and 
demand that U.S. forces on duty in and around the Balkans be 
brought home. GOP leaders said the measure likely would have won 
committee approval today -- providing a major embarrassment for the 
president as NATO leaders gathered.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Working To Save Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee is getting some  
help to recruit scandal-shy corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognized that we had a very tall task and a long way to  
go'' in raising money, Mitt Romney, president of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee, said Wednesday in announcing the hiring of a 
sports marketing company. ``If our coffers were full ... we 
wouldn't need to bring in another team member.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of International Management Group, which handled  
sponsorship sales for the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France; 
the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway; and the 1992 Summer 
Games in Barcelona, comes at a time when USOC and SLOC have been at 
odds over funding. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC and SLOC have a joint marketing venture, called Olympic  
Properties of the United States -- OPUS -- which is $300 million 
short of its goal of raising $859 million in contributions and 
in-kind services. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC officials blame the Salt Lake City bribery scandal for the  
marketing woes, while some officials connected with the Salt Lake 
City organizing effort have said that the marketing was going 
slowly even before the scandal hit late last year. Romney has 
called the OPUS goal ``very optimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just one sponsor -- longtime Olympic backer Seiko -- has signed  
with the USOC since it was revealed that Salt Lake City bid 
officials gave scholarships, lavish gifts, land deals, free trips 
and other perks to International Olympic Committee members and 
their families as the city tried to land the games. It was 
announced this week that Johnson &AMP; Johnson has backed out of an 
estimated $30 million sponsorship deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were way ahead of the curve ... and then I think the  
marketplace and the Olympic family have been distracted by the 
scandal,'' USOC marketing head John Krimsky Jr. said. ``We have to 
hit the ground running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Prazmark, IMG senior vice president of business  
development, who will spearhead the Olympic sales pitch, said, 
``OPUS is not out of time. They just lost their cushion of time and 
they just have to be flawless the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	He said companies are asking themselves if the Olympic name has  
been tarnished by the scandal, whereas before, ``that question was 
never raised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prazmark said the companies he has dealt with remain eager to  
help make the Olympics a success. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing deal extends through 2004 and applies to the U.S.  
Olympic teams for the Sydney, Salt Lake City and Athens games. 
Krimsky said 80 percent of the money generated will go to stage the 
2002 Winter Games in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG will be paid a commission for sponsors it brings to the  
USOC, but the officials refused to disclose the percentage the 
company would earn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far, far, far, far below industry standards,'' Prazmark  
said. ``It still has to be a business decision, but there's a lot 
of wanting to help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said IMG agreed to waive its commission for Utah-based  
sponsors. Also, the USOC has agreed to compensate SLOC for 
commission payments until the $859 million target for sponsorship 
revenues is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Prazmark said as many as 50 of the company's 2,000 staff members  
worldwide could work on the Olympic sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us arms and legs we simply don't have today,''  
Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a long way to go,'' Romney said. ``But (the SLOC and  
USOC) agree it makes sense not to just keep playing with the same 
number of players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, who was hired to take over the Salt Lake City Olympics  
planning in the wake of the scandal, has been preparing budget cuts 
in case the fund-raising efforts fall short. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his potential cuts involved operating expenses for the  
Winter Sports Park, which has ski jumps, the bobsled-luge track and 
the Oquirrh Skating Oval -- the speedskating venue.

<HEADLINE> Muhammad Ali Backs Boxing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He uttered not a word, but Muhammad Ali's  
presence at a Senate hearing Thursday spoke volumes about the state 
of professional boxing and lent support to Sen. John McCain's 
efforts to clean up the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion, who suffers from Parkinson's  
syndrome and has trouble speaking, told the Senate Commerce 
Committee through longtime friend Howard Bingham that the Lennox 
Lewis-Evander Holyfield heavyweight draw in New York last month was 
the ``lowest point'' for a sport beset with problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ali has become increasingly upset about the scandals that have  
occurred in professional boxing,'' Bingham said as Ali gazed 
intently at committee members from a witness table. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali is particularly interested in the parts of McCain's boxing  
reform bill that would stop exploitation of boxers by promoters. 
One provision would prohibit ``coercive option'' contracts that 
prevent fighters from controlling their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona Republican and 2000 presidential aspirant,  
told Ali: ``Your support of this legislation is absolutely vital to 
our chances of passing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the disputed fight, the three judges scored it a draw even  
though most boxing observers believe Lewis clearly had beaten the 
champion. The fight is under investigation by the Manhattan 
district attorney's office and the New York state Athletic 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill would establish new standards for sanctioning  
organizations that rank fighters; create new financial disclosure 
requirements for promoters and event organizers; and require that 
state boxing commissions be informed when charges, costs and fees 
are taken from a boxer's purse. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who attended the Lewis-Holyfield fight, said the sport  
has too few ethical boundaries and a ranking system, controlled by 
promoters, that ``defies all reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When honest and open competition is inhibited, it is the  
boxers who suffer most,'' McCain said. ``But millions of 
ticket-buying fans in America are also hurt by monopolistic 
practices in boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former boxing referee Mills Lane, a retired Nevada judge who now  
has his TV court show, said boxing's credibility suffers because 
sanctioning bodies -- the IBF, WBA and WBC -- play too large a role 
in which judges and referees work the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subtle pressures are there and nobody can tell me  
they're not,'' Lane told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walter Stone, counsel to the International Boxing  
Federation, said fight organizers are working to address the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a new IBF rule says the No. 1 ranking cannot simply  
be taken over by a boxer who moves up just because of losses by 
fighters rated ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., expressed concern the McCain bill might  
unfairly target certain promoters and invite legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bill must address multiyear broadcast contracts in  
which contenders stay under a network's control in return for a 
shot at the champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question when it comes to revenues, the broadcast  
industry packs the biggest wallop,'' said Reid, whose state is the 
site for many championship fights. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is likely to move the bill through the Commerce Committee  
later this year. An identical measure last year passed the Senate 
but went nowhere in the House.

<HEADLINE> Youth Smoking Prevention Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In their pursuit of billion-dollar settlements with the tobacco  
industry, states repeatedly used one of their most powerful 
weapons: children. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general and legislators accused Big Tobacco of  
marketing to teens. Scientists testified that the younger a person 
begins smoking, the harder it is to quit. Anti-tobacco forces used 
images of children lighting up in commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that the states have won the settlements and money is  
beginning to pour in, some legislators are asking a controversial 
question: Are anti-smoking programs aimed at youth such a wise 
investment? 
</P>
<P>
	Key lawmakers in Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Texas and  
Washington state want to either reduce spending on youth-related 
tobacco programs or keep tight purse strings on any new ones. 
They're unconvinced, they say, that education programs and 
advertising have any effect on young smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never looked behind the numbers. We don't know for sure  
that kids can be convinced,'' said Texas state Sen. Bill Ratliff, 
head of the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Legislature is debating two plans -- one that would  
have $10 million to $20 million of the $1.8 billion Texas will get 
over the next two years go toward anti-smoking programs, and 
another that would allot $40 million to $50 million. Ratliff said 
the settlement money should go toward health matters, not into the 
general revenue pot, but he is skeptical of the effectiveness of 
smoking prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate is intense in Massachusetts and Florida, whose youth  
programs that are regularly held up as national models for reducing 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida lawmakers agreed this week to reduce the $70 million  
budget of the state's year-old ``Truth'' advertising campaign, 
credited with drastically reducing teen smoking, to $45 million. 
Lawmakers noted that $11 million went unspent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush and the Senate had proposed spending about $61  
million for the program, while the House wanted to reduce it to $30 
million -- after initially balking at giving anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Debby Sanderson said that the program shouldn't be  
eliminated but that she isn't sure how effective it is. And, she 
said, the ads are in questionable taste: One features a flabby man 
in a bikini, smoking. Another shows a tobacco executive in hell. 
</P>
<P>
	She said there are other health-related programs that need  
money, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci came under fire earlier this  
year when he proposed adding no settlement money to the state's 
tobacco control program budget except for $500,000 to study whether 
it works. He also proposed diverting $4 million in cigarette tax 
revenue from smoking prevention to a program that has firefighters 
give safety lessons in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-tobacco advocates said lawmakers are questioning the  
effectiveness of these prevention programs to justify diverting 
tobacco dollars to their pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's simply impossible to study the existing data and conclude  
that well-run programs don't work,'' said Matthew Myers of the 
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minnesota, $202 million of the $6.1 billion settlement is  
earmarked for prevention, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield is kicking 
in $350 million. House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty said the 
settlement money should instead go toward health-related tax relief 
until there's proof that the prevention programs work. 
</P>
<P>
	Key fiscal leaders in Washington state agree. While Gov. Gary  
Locke wants to spend $150 million of the settlement on smoking 
prevention, House lawmakers argue that the money would be better 
spent on public health care. They say Washington already spends 
$2.5 million a year on prevention programs aimed mostly at youth.

<HEADLINE> NATO Leaders Tone Down Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Grappling with crisis in the Balkans, NATO  
leaders toned down a celebration of the alliance's 50th birthday 
Thursday and pledged their summit would focus on tougher steps -- 
possibly including ground troops -- to halt the bloodshed in Kosovo. 
President Clinton accused Slobodan Milosevic of ``reckless 
tyranny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the NATO meeting would  
send ``the clearest possible message of will and resolution'' that 
Milosevic will not prevail. Clinton declared: ``Our alliance is 
strongly united today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the summit, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's  
military commander, flew here from Brussels to brief the leaders at 
their opening session Friday. He will report on the progress of the 
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton conferred at the White House with NATO Secretary-General  
Javier Solana, who a day earlier ordered Clark to update plans for 
a possible ground invasion of Kosovo. ``It is a wise and prudent 
course,'' the president said. But he continued to say he believes 
airstrikes will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let there be no doubt NATO will see this through to the end,''  
Solana said in a Rose Garden appearance with Clinton. ``We have the 
means and we have the will. That will be no doubt the message of 
this Washington summit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A high-ranking NATO official said, ``Do not expect any decision  
on ground troops at this summit.'' However, the official said the 
issue could be widely discussed. The official, who declined to be 
identified, said the summit would send a conciliatory signal to 
Russia, expressing regret at its absence from the meeting and 
reaffirming that NATO wants to work with Moscow despite differences 
over the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reacted cautiously to a pre-summit overture from  
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Milosevic  
had accepted the idea of a U.N.-controlled ``international 
presence'' in Kosovo if the NATO bombing stops and the alliance 
withdraws troops from Yugoslavia's borders. It was unclear whether 
such a force would be armed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is an offer for a genuine security force, that's the  
first time Mr. Milosevic has ever done that and that represents, I 
suppose, some step forward,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	From across Europe, a swarm of VIP jets began delivering  
presidents and prime ministers of 19 NATO nations and 23 partner 
countries to the capital for three days of summitry beginning 
Friday. The meeting originally was planned as a 50th anniversary 
celebration of NATO's founding, but the festivities were recast 
into more serious discussions as the alliance confronted the crisis 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington braced for limousine gridlock and tight restrictions  
in a 100-block downtown security zone, including much of the 
National Mall. City schools were to be closed Friday and thousands 
of federal workers were given the day off. 
</P>
<P>
	At one dinner for dignitaries and members of Congress on  
Thursday night at the spacious National Building Museum, organizers 
scuttled plans for dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the summit concludes, Slobodan Milosevic and those who  
might see him as a role model are going to know that our alliance 
remains united and determined to prevail in this fight,'' Defense 
Secretary William Cohen told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some cracks in the declarations of unity. Greek Prime  
Minister Costas Simitis said his country supports NATO but would 
never join the military action against Yugoslavia. He cited polls 
indicating more than 90 percent of Greeks oppose the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit opens in the fifth week of airstrikes against  
Yugoslavia, with no sign that bombing has stopped the violence on 
the ground or the forced expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO brought its firepower closer to Milosevic, destroying one  
of his Belgrade homes in an attack that Yugoslav officials 
protested was an attempt to kill their leader. Milosevic was not 
inside the house. Clinton said the home was a command and control 
center, and denied the attack was an assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to repair his impeachment-marred record, Clinton is  
counting on the NATO meeting to increase the pressure on Milosevic 
with an oil embargo and a message of unmistakable resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serb forces there have pushed nearly 1.4 million people,  
three-quarters of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, from their homes,'' 
the president said. ``They have killed thousands.'' But he said 
NATO airstrikes were taking a heavy toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Milosevic can accept this outcome or he can watch as NATO  
grinds down his war machine and the Serb people he claims to 
represent face mounting hardship,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair met with congressional leaders at the Capitol after  
private talks with Clinton. The prime minister said it was 
essential that NATO ``give the clearest possible message of will 
and resolution that Milosevic and his policies will not prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary, said NATO ``cannot  
tolerate the rebirth of fascism within Europe. And that is what we 
are witnessing at the present time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders came to Washington seeking a new mission for the  
alliance, which was formed a half century ago to prevent a Soviet 
invasion of Europe. With that threat removed, the alliance is 
casting about for a new purpose beyond its traditional collective 
defense against threats to any member.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Films Infiltrate Internet </HEADLINE>

<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- The same technology that allows for  
the spread of bootlegged music over the Internet is now threatening 
the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Film filchers have begun distributing illegal copies of hot  
flicks like ``The Matrix'' using a data format similar to the 
so-called MP3 files that are being used to spread free music across 
cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	While the data files containing full-length movies are too big  
for the average home computer user to conveniently download, 
college students with high-speed hookups in their dorm rooms are 
doing it and the movie industry is shuddering. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very nice. I get to sit here in the comfort of my own  
room and watch a new movie without going to the theater and 
spending $7.50,'' said a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of 
California, Santa Cruz, who asked that his name be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not very nice, said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion  
Picture Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The theft of copyrighted material in any format cannot be left  
unaddressed. There is no exception in the case of Internet 
copyright theft. We won't condone it, and we will pursue those who 
steal film product and illegally transmit it via the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movies can be found on public Web forums, including those  
run by America Online, and on Internet message boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The movies are frequently distributed by students at colleges  
around the country -- including Stanford University, UC Berkeley and 
Virginia Polytechnic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The quality varies.  
</P>
<P>
	Cruel Intentions, Sony's new release about a pair of evil teens,  
looked vivid and sounded clear on a standard desktop computer in 
one cramped dorm room at Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	However, The Matrix, the surreal sci-fi film, looked somewhat  
dark and shady, and the musical soundtrack was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how the copying works: The originals usually come from  
either a mixing studio employee who steals a copy of a yet-to-be 
released movie, or a projectionist who brings a camcorder into the 
reel booth and makes a copy. 
</P>
<P>
	The video is then transferred digitally into a file, which is  
recorded into a computer. Once that computer file is distributed 
onto the Internet, it can be widely available. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawback is the size of the file.  
</P>
<P>
	While a song in MP3 format can be downloaded in a few minutes,  
it would take hours or even days to download a movie using a 
typical telephone connection to the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet analyst Mark Mooradian, who tracks the proliferation of  
music on the Web for the research firm Jupiter Communications in 
New York, said the large files are going to limit the widespread 
use of movies online until the technology improves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not going to be practical for most people,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many college students and offices have access to networks  
with speedy computer lines and vast memory space. With these 
systems, an entire movie can be downloaded in about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me a sense of satisfaction, like I found something  
and here's the proof that I have it,'' said one self-described 
``stereotypical computer-jockey-hacker'' who distributes movies 
campuswide at Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	About two years ago, college students and other techies started  
using MP3, an audio format that compresses music files at 
CD-quality sound for easy distribution over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, sharing new music over the Web has proliferated to  
more than 500,000 different music files online, despite critics who 
say the technology allows for massive music piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America and other music  
groups have recently teamed up with top technology companies to 
develop ways to distribute copyrighted music with protections 
against illegal copying. 
</P>
<P>
	If this effort works, similar versions could be applied to  
films, said Leonardo Chiariglione, a founder of the Moving Picture 
Experts Group, the organization that created MP3 and is helping to 
create a secure version. 
</P>
<P>
	The RIAA's anti-piracy chief, Frank Creighton, said movie  
studios should be very concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could easily explode,'' he said. ``Anyone with a computer  
now is a movie distributor. With a click of a mouse button these 
things are flying around the Internet.''

<HEADLINE> Assets of Mutual Funds Are Lower / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds decreased by $4.56 billion to $875.13 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category  
decreased by $2.63 billion to $723.09 billion for the week ended 
Wednesday, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. 
Tax-exempt fund assets decreased by $1.93 billion to $152.04 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds decreased by $6.29  
billion to $583.95 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets decreased by $2.79 billion 
to $539.62 billion while assets of tax-exempt funds decreased by 
$3.50 billion to $44.33 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.459 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.470 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell to  
4.30 percent in the week ended Tuesday from 4.31 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield remained unchanged at 4.34 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield also remained unchanged at 4.40  
percent, while the 30-day compounded yield fell to 4.43 percent 
from 4.44 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds rose  
to 61 days from 60 days the previous week, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts held steady at 2.10 
percent as of Wednesday, compared with the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
also held steady, remaining at 0.94 percent from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield was unchanged  
at 4.12 percent on six-month certificates of deposit. Yields 
remained steady on 1-year CDs at 4.36 percent, on 2 1/2-year CDs at 
4.45 percent and 5-year CDs at 4.61 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bird Hopes Pacers Focus on Winning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Bird, the former player, knows the  
dilemma facing Larry Bird the coach as his Indiana Pacers drive for 
the Central Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
	With a bench that includes Derrick McKey, Travis Best, Jalen  
Rose and Antonio Davis, Bird must divide the playing time and hope 
his players understand. 
</P>
<P>
	The bench has been a major weapon for Indiana, which leads the  
Central Division by 2 1/2 games and is trying to catch Miami and 
Orlando to secure homecourt advantage throughout the Eastern 
Conference playoffs. Indiana reserves have outscored the 
opposition's bench 35 times this season, including a 54-20 margin 
in Wednesday's 108-100 overtime victory over Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing you've got to understand is we've got 10 guys. ...  
It's hard to distribute minutes. The one thing about us if we go 
into the playoffs and guys are really worried about their minutes, 
it's really going to hurt us,'' Bird said. ``They've got to know 
we've got 10 guys that can play, and we're going to play everybody. 
... Guys have got to stay as a team, and play as a team if we're 
going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Bird has adjusted the rotation more than he did  
earlier when he often used two units. Reggie Miller, Dale Davis and 
Chris Mullin have started every game and Mark Jackson and Rik Smits 
have missed only one game each. 
</P>
<P>
	The division of minutes has become more complicated since McKey,  
who missed the first 37 games before coming off the injured list 
April 12, is seeing more action in recent games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not important as far as what we're trying to do,''  
Jackson said about concern over playing time and has consistently 
spent the fourth quarter on the bench with Best at point guard. 
``The main thing is winning and whoever is out there getting the 
job done, that's what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson admits he would rather play than watch Best with the  
game on the line in the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm a coach, I wouldn't want a player who is happy on the  
bench. That doesn't mean guys are complaining about minutes,'' he 
said. ``Our chemistry has always been great. We've got a bunch of 
guys who only care about winning, sacrificing individual ego to 
achieve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The depth of the Pacers has been noticed by others.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like they have two teams. They have one team that starts  
and another team that comes off the bench,'' Chicago's Mark Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got so much talent on that bench, they tend to wear  
you down,'' Milwaukee's Glenn Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	McKey's return has made a big difference defensively as the  
6-foot-10 forward with the big wingspan uses it effectively against 
shorter forwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they activated Derrick McKey to put him on Vince  
(Carter). I thought Vince had his most unproductive night and that 
was a good personnel move by them,'' Toronto coach Butch Carter 
said after McKey's first game this season.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Gains; Corn, Soybeans Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures rose early today on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while corn and soybeans edged lower amid forecasts 
for drying weather in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	While rainshowers continued to plague farmers trying to get into  
the fields for spring planting, forecasters are predicting most 
will come to an end by early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses were limited, however, after the U.S. Agriculture  
Department reported better-than-expected export sales. Wheat sales, 
which were particularly strong, and overnight purchases from Taiwan 
and Japan helped boost that market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.70 1/4 a bushel; July  
corn was unchanged at $2.29 1/2 a bushel; July oats rose 3/4 cent to 
$1.22 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans were unchanged at $5.03 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .15 cent to 63.35 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .13 cent to 71.47 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .23 cent to 55.95 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .90 
cent to 55.60 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Largest Lava Flow Ever Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists comparing newly found rock  
formations in Brazil with similar volcanic rocks on three other 
continents have discovered the most widespread lava flows in 
Earth's history. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive eruptions 200 million years ago tore apart the  
ancient continent of Pangea and may have caused a mass extinction 
of animals, the researchers report in today's issue of the journal 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, remnants of this event include the new Brazilian find as  
well as other formations in South America, West Africa, Spain and 
North America -- among them, the towering palisades along the Hudson 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	The previously unrecognized area of ancient lava flow covers  
about 965,000 square miles in the Amazon basin. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of the newly found rocks showed the eruption  
occurred at the same time and had the same origin as lava flows 
found on the other continents, said Paul Renne of the University of 
California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	A mass extinction at the same time seems likely to have been  
connected to the huge magma flow, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Giant dinosaurs developed after this period and were killed off  
in a different mass extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	The great eruption, which occurred over a few million years,  
split apart Pangea, opening up what is now the Atlantic Ocean, the 
scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lava field it produced has been named the Central Atlantic  
Magmatic Province, or CAMP. With the addition of the newly found 
Brazilian formation, it totals some 2.7 million square miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't really know for sure that we've got it all yet,''  
Renne said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the next-largest known lava flows are the Deccan  
Traps in India and the Siberian Traps, each just under half the 
size of CAMP. 
</P>
<P>
	Because different parts of CAMP are located on different  
continents, they had been studied separately, Renne said, with the 
result that no one previously recognized the region's full extent. 
</P>
<P>
	He likened it to several blind people touching different parts  
of an elephant and trying to describe the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	The eruptions would have released a variety of gases into the  
atmosphere and thus were probably a factor in the extinction of 
much sea life and early reptiles that occurred at the time, known 
as the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best example of flood basalts associated with an  
extinction,'' Renne said. ``Some of the best stratigraphic evidence 
of the mass extinction occurs in exactly the same site in which you 
find the flood basalts -- they sit right smack on top of one 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been at least four mass extinctions in Earth's  
history, and their causes spark sharp debate among scientists. 
Giant lava flows are suspected in some cases, while meteors 
striking the Earth are viable candidates for the cause of others.

<HEADLINE> Feds Want Gun Controls Boosted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration prepared Thursday  
to release $1.5 million to compensate victims of the Colorado 
school shooting and voiced hope that the tragedy would spur passage 
of ``reasonable restrictions on the possession of guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said at the department's  
weekly news conference Thursday that the administration would send 
Congress suggested gun-control legislation, which would include 
banning gun possession for people who committed violent crimes as 
juveniles. The current ban applies only to adult convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Friday will announce the immediate  
availability of as much as $1.5 million from the Crime Victims' 
Fund to help families in Littleton, Colo., pay for funerals, 
uninsured medical expenses, lost wages and mental-health 
counseling, a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department was also providing $70 million to station  
some 600 police officers for school security in 336 communities 
around the country, this official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Clinton's gun-control proposals failed in previous  
sessions of the Republican-controlled Congress and are opposed by 
the National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But, said Holder, ``The vast majority of the American people  
support reasonable restrictions on the possession of guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno met in Denver Thursday with law  
enforcement officers and community members on Tuesday's violence at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, where 14 students and a teacher 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic lawmakers in Congress, angry that their gun-control  
bills remain stalled, said they would increase their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voices from the American people are starting to rise,'' said  
Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., who promised to use procedural rules 
to force a vote on her gun bill if House Republicans leaders 
continue to block it. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, whose husband was killed in a 1993 shooting, is an  
outspoken gun-control advocate. Her bill would require new safety 
features on guns, among other things. It was not considered in the 
last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she asked House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., for his  
support Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he would look at it and he would get back to me,'' she  
said at a news conference. ``I'm hoping that he'll be reasonable. 
We're asking for a debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert spokesman John Feehery confirmed the conversation and  
said House leaders were looking at various proposals to address the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, more than 40 gun-control bills are pending,  
according to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who is sponsoring 
legislation to ban the import and sale of ammunition magazines that 
hold 10 or more rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to break the (National Rifle Association's) lock on  
the Congress,'' she said. ``If this incident doesn't galvanize 
America, what will?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, which opposes such efforts on grounds that they would  
interfere with the constitutional right of individuals to bear 
arms, refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the only appropriate response is one of grief and  
sorrow and prayers for the community (of Littleton) and anything 
that extends beyond that right now is not appropriate,'' spokesman 
Bill Powers said. Justice officials said their proposals would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Require manufacturers to install triggerlocks on guns.  
</P>
<P>
	--Raise the penalties for adults who transfer guns to juveniles.  
</P>
<P>
	--Impose a minimum three-day cooling-off period before a handgun  
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	--Extend the Brady Act's instant background checks on gun-buyers  
to sales at gun shows.

<HEADLINE> Majority of Playgrounds Found Unsafe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- American playgrounds are generally coming up short  
when it comes to providing adequate safety for children, an 
advocacy group has found. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Program for Playground Safety said many of the  
nation's playgrounds had inadequate surfaces to protect against 
falls -- the most common problem -- and other accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa-based safety program, which visited 1,353 playgrounds,  
was to release its findings today at the Boston conference of the 
American Association of Leisure and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 31 states in which playgrounds were studied, the group  
collected enough information to grade 27 states. Delaware received 
the highest grade, a B, while Michigan and Florida both received 
D-minuses. The national average was a C-minus. 
</P>
<P>
	Guidelines from the Consumer Product Safety Commission call for  
playground surfaces to be coated with wood chips, sand or other 
soft materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that in 62 percent of playgrounds those  
materials were not applied in the right areas, and were not deep 
enough in 56 percent of cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guidelines have been in existence since 1981 and many  
playgrounds are still substandard,'' said Mick Mack, the group's 
project coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found no adults present in 23 percent of the  
playgrounds visited. Also worrisome was a lack of separate areas 
for different age groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said childhood injuries rose from 93,000 in 1977 to  
200,000 in 1994. With improvements made to playground equipment, 
Mack said, the increase might mean there are simply a lot more 
children using playgrounds.

<HEADLINE> Denver-Area Schools Ban Trench Coats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) --There's a new rule in some Denver-area schools  
following this week's deadly rampage at Columbine High School: No 
more trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts in Denver, Douglas County and parts of Adams  
County are banning students from wearing the dusters. Officials say 
the coats are intimidating and inappropriate and could be used to 
hide weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing such a coat can also be ``alarming enough to others that  
it disrupts the educational environment,'' said Susan Carlson, 
spokeswoman for schools in Adams County. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people died during Tuesday's bloodbath at Columbine High  
School. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, opened fire  
with sawed-off shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, pistol and homemade 
bombs. They allegedly killed themselves during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The two belonged to a school group known as the Trenchcoat  
Mafia, after the group members' long black coats.

<HEADLINE>  Peca Pushes Sabres to Game 1 Win / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ont. (AP) -- While goalie Dominik Hasek grabbed the  
spotlight with another sensational game, Michael Peca turned in the 
best all-around performance in Buffalo's series-opening victory 
over Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Peca had a goal and an assist, shadowed Senators star Alexei  
Yashin and made a skate save in the third period to help preserve 
the Sabres' 2-1 victory over the Senators on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his play gets overshadowed by Dom,'' linemate Dixon  
Ward said after practice Thursday. ``But I think he was just as 
important in that game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, the NHL's most valuable player the past two seasons, made  
40 saves as Buffalo took the opener of the best-of-7 Eastern 
quarterfinal series. But Peca did it all, including a skate save on 
Radek Bonk's potential game-tying shot when Hasek was out of his 
net in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Peca also did a good defensive job on Yashin, who had eight  
shots on goal but didn't get a point. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see your captain get the first goal, kill penalties,  
shadow Yashin ... you need to see that from your leaders,'' Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa coach Jacques Martin doesn't plan any special moves to  
get Yashin away from Peca in Game 2 on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yashin's our best player,'' Martin said. ``I'm not going to  
keep him on the bench because Peca's on the ice. Every good player 
has someone covering him. Yashin had several scoring chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a change in goal, however. Damian Rhodes will  
replace Ron Tugnutt, who was weak on Peca's first-period goal, a 
misfired backhander that slid in from the slot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We alternated most of the year,'' Martin said. ``I said before  
we'd use both goaltenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Sabres are anticipating the return of center Joe  
Juneau, who has been out with a concussion. Buffalo could use an 
offensive spark after taking only 15 shots in Game 1, matching the 
franchise low for shots in a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-11, 180 pounds, Peca is four inches shorter and 45  
pounds lighter than Yashin. But he usually manages to hold his own 
against bigger players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to Michael is how he anticipates the play,'' said  
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff. ``The great checkers aren't necessarily 
the biggest players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has that ability to get inside a player's head. They know  
that if they come over the line with their head down, they might 
get a big hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peca is used to playing against big forwards like Philadelphia's

<HEADLINE>  Peca Pushes Sabres to Game 1 Win / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ont. (AP) -- While goalie Dominik Hasek grabbed the  
spotlight with another sensational game, Michael Peca turned in the 
best all-around performance in Buffalo's series-opening victory 
over Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Peca had a goal and an assist, shadowed Senators star Alexei  
Yashin and made a skate save in the third period to help preserve 
the Sabres' 2-1 victory over the Senators on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his play gets overshadowed by Dom,'' linemate Dixon  
Ward said after practice Thursday. ``But I think he was just as 
important in that game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, the NHL's most valuable player the past two seasons, made  
40 saves as Buffalo took the opener of the best-of-7 Eastern 
quarterfinal series. But Peca did it all, including a skate save on 
Radek Bonk's potential game-tying shot when Hasek was out of his 
net in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Peca also did a good defensive job on Yashin, who had eight  
shots on goal but didn't get a point. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see your captain get the first goal, kill penalties,  
shadow Yashin ... you need to see that from your leaders,'' Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa coach Jacques Martin doesn't plan any special moves to  
get Yashin away from Peca in Game 2 on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yashin's our best player,'' Martin said. ``I'm not going to  
keep him on the bench because Peca's on the ice. Every good player 
has someone covering him. Yashin had several scoring chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a change in goal, however. Damian Rhodes will  
replace Ron Tugnutt, who was weak on Peca's first-period goal, a 
misfired backhander that slid in from the slot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We alternated most of the year,'' Martin said. ``I said before  
we'd use both goaltenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Sabres are anticipating the return of center Joe  
Juneau, who has been out with a concussion. Buffalo could use an 
offensive spark after taking only 15 shots in Game 1, matching the 
franchise low for shots in a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-11, 180 pounds, Peca is four inches shorter and 45  
pounds lighter than Yashin. But he usually manages to hold his own 
against bigger players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to Michael is how he anticipates the play,'' said  
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff. ``The great checkers aren't necessarily 
the biggest players. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has that ability to get inside a player's head. They know  
that if they come over the line with their head down, they might 
get a big hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peca is used to playing against big forwards like Philadelphia's  
Eric Lindros and Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't go out there thinking they're bigger and stronger,''  
said Peca. ``Balance has a lot to do with it and believing in 
yourself is important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators, who went 1-for-9 on the power play in Game 1, know  
they'll have to do a better job to avoid a first-round upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had 103 points, so I don't think we need to change much,''  
Rhodes said.

<HEADLINE> Derby Trial Opens Churchill Downs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Trainers Bob Baffert, D. Wayne Lukas and  
Nick Zito each will try for the first half of what they hope to be 
a Derby Trial-Kentucky Derby double when Churchill Downs opens its 
spring meeting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although one of the trainers could win both races, it's not  
possible for one of their horses because the three they will saddle 
Saturday won't be in the 125th Derby a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, who has won the Derby the last two years, will go after  
the Derby Trial with Straight Man, fourth in the Gallery 
Furniture.Com on March 27 at Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas' starter in the $100,000-added Trial at one mile will be  
Yes It's True, winner of the Swale on March 13 at Gulfstream Park. 
Zito will saddle Doneraile Court, third in the Tampa Bay Derby on 
March 21 at Tampa Bay Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entered Thursday were Kutsa, Patience Game, Nebrasska,  
Hector, Prime Directive and Lead Em Home. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes It's True, Doneraile Court and Prime Directive, sixth in the  
Flamingo on April 3 at Hialeah, will be co-high-weighed at 122 and 
spot the other starters from 8 to 10 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert will try to win the Kentucky Derby with General  
Challenge and Prime Timber, first and second, respectively, in the 
Santa Anita Derby, and possibly the filly Excellent Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas' Derby starters will be Cat Thief, second in the Blue  
Grass Stakes at Keeneland, and Charismatic, winner of Keeneland's 
Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito's Derby horses will be Stephen Got Even, winner of the  
Gallery Furniture, and Adonis, winner of the Wood Memorial.

<HEADLINE> Witness in Microsoft Case Surprised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the government chose a relatively unknown  
software engineer from Boeing Co. to testify against Microsoft in 
its landmark antitrust trial, the decision puzzled many experts in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps no one was more surprised to learn of his pivotal  
role in one of the most important business trials in a century than 
the engineer himself, according to new testimony released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In transcripts from his interviews with lawyers, Boeing's Scott  
Vesey confessed that he initially heard he was a witness only after 
seeing his name on the front page of his newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyer, Tom Burt, was so surprised he did a  
double-take during his interview of Vesey. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the day that the witness lists were published in the paper  
... did you say?'' Burt asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Vesey offered.  
</P>
<P>
	That testimony from last September was the first to be released  
from more than 90 interviews conducted for the trial. The others, 
including three days of interviews with Microsoft Chairman Bill 
Gates, were expected to be made public by the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled earlier this year that an obscure  
1913 law allows the public to read the transcripts from those 
depositions, from some of the high-tech industry's most powerful 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling also ensured that the public can attend any future  
interviews with executives related to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of those was scheduled for Wednesday in Washington,  
when Microsoft lawyers will question Netscape executive Peter 
Currie. America Online, the world's largest Internet provider, said 
it expects its chairman, Steve Case, to be questioned the first 
week of May. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesey, who decides which Internet software that most Boeing  
employees use, never actually testified at the Microsoft trial, 
currently in a lengthy recess but expected to resume by mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, a month after it selected Vesey,  
replaced him and another witness, an economics expert, with 
executives from Apple Computer Co. and Sun Microsystems Inc. The 
government did show brief video excerpts during the trial of Vesey 
explaining why Boeing chose to use Netscape's browser, not 
Microsoft's. 
</P>
<P>
	Under rules to speed the trial, the judge limited the government  
and Microsoft to only a dozen witnesses each. That meant each 
choice carried important implications. 
</P>
<P>
	The full transcript of Vesey's interview, released Thursday,  
suggests why the government originally believed he might be a 
compelling witness against the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesey told lawyers, for example, that Boeing estimated a $5  
million savings by choosing to install a newer version of 
Netscape's software rather than also distributing Microsoft's rival 
Web software on its 170,000 personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We save support costs and are able to improve the quality of  
support to users based on setting a single product standard,'' 
Vesey explained. 
</P>
<P>
	One core issue at the trial is whether Microsoft illegally  
forces customers of its dominant Windows operating system also to 
use its Internet software, which is included within the most recent 
versions of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges Microsoft ``tied'' the products in  
violation of federal antitrust law, discouraging consumers from 
using a rival's software that might perform redundant functions. 
Microsoft said it integrated Internet features into Windows to 
benefit customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesey said asking Microsoft to remove its Internet software from  
Windows and allowing a rival's to replace it ``would be analogous 
to one of our airline customers saying, 'We like the Boeing 
airplane's wings, fuselage, control systems, and infrastructure but 
we want to use an Airbus cockpit to control the airplane.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Vesey acknowledged ``there are some benefits'' to integrating  
Microsoft's browser into Windows, but he also argued that it 
creates complexity and confusion for some customers.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Surges Above $18 a Barrel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures surged above $18 a barrel Thursday, continuing  
a remarkable recovery from 12-year lows amid concerns that output 
cuts and production problems will sharply reduce supplies going 
into the peak driving season. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, soybean and corn futures fell sharply, as did  
palladium. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil prices finished at their highest level in 16 months on  
the New York Mercantile Exchange, showing no signs of slowing down 
despite a lack of proof that world oil producers are adhering to 
promises to slash 2.1 million barrels, or 2.7 percent of daily 
world production, from the market. 
</P>
<P>
	While analysts say it will be at least a month before concrete  
determination of the cuts that began April 1 is made, market 
participants were surprised earlier this week that U.S. inventories 
fell a sharper-than-expected 2 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela added to the worries, announcing it would reduce  
production through April because of an explosion at a key pipeline 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of those concerns, investors digested market talk that  
Exxon Corp. was actively buying spot gasoline because of a reformer 
snag at its 140,000 barrel-a-day Baytown, Texas, refinery. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for June delivery rose 26 cents to $18.18 a  
barrel; May heating oil rose .59 cent to 44.12 cents a gallon; May 
unleaded gasoline rose 1.02 cents to 53.45 cents a gallon; May 
natural gas rose 5.4 cents to $2.225 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures tumbled on the Chicago Board of Trade after  
China said it will impose a tax on soybean meal imports. Corn and 
wheat also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell sharply as market participants were hit with a  
triple dose of bad news. China announced it on May 1 would begin 
imposing a 13 percent tax on soybean meal imports, while U.S. 
Agriculture Department Secretary Dan Glickman said there were no 
new talks scheduled for food donations to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, meteorologists' forecasts for a return of drier weather  
to the Midwest next week have boosted expectations farmers will be 
able to get into the fields and plant record acreage. A bumper 
harvest would add to bin-busting supplies that have been stored 
since last year because of a global economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also fell. While the USDA announced weekly corn  
sales came in at an unexpectedly strong 1.1 million metric tons, 
investors said the figure will not boost annual sales projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell in sympathy with corn and soybeans, but held  
some of its ground on strong weekly export sales and overnight bids 
from Taiwan and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	July soybeans fell 11 1/2 cents to $4.91 3/4 a bushel; July corn fell  
4 1/4 cents to $2.25 1/4 a bushel; July wheat fell 1/4 cent to $2.67 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange on  
news Degussa Corp. had developed a new platinum-based auto emission 
control device, called a catalytic converter. 
</P>
<P>
	The report boosted fears palladium users are actively seeking  
alternatives to the metal, most of which comes from Russia. That 
country has delayed shipments for three consecutive years, 
resulting in a sharp run-up in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	June palladium fell $5.75 to $371.15 an ounce.

	U.N. Says AIDS Outpacing Funding  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Spending by donor countries to combat AIDS in  
developing countries is failing to keep pace with the spread of the 
disease, now infecting nearly 6 million people worldwide each year, 
the United Nations said today. ``It is alarming that AIDS is 
expanding three times faster than the funding to control it,'' said 
Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, the Joint U.N. 
Program on HIV/AIDS. The agency says 95 percent of the people 
living with the HIV virus are in developing countries, most of them 
in Africa.

</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO destroyed one of President  
Slobodan Milosevic's Belgrade homes today in a daring attack that 
gutted the luxurious mansion, but Yugoslav officials expressed 
outrage, saying three laser-guided bombs blasted Milosevic's 
bedroom, living room and dining room. ``NATO committed a criminal 
act without precedence -- an assassination attempt against the 
president of a sovereign state,'' Goran Matic, government minister 
without portfolio, told reporters. NATO called the building a 
``presidential command post'' and legitimate target. Milosevic and 
his family were not inside the house when the missiles struck.

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union foreign ministers are

Yugoslavia, the EU said today, a move aimed at turning up the 
economic pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. ``There 
is a common position among member states,'' said EU trade spokesman 
Nigel Gardner. NATO airstrikes have recently focused on 
Yugoslavia's oil refineries and shipping terminals in an effort to 
impede Milosevic's ability to support his military machine. Eleven 
of the 15 EU nations are members of NATO.

more trench coats. School districts in Denver, Douglas County and

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen was arrested on suspicion of  
driving while intoxicated early this morning after running a red 
light, according to police. The officer who stopped the Houston 
Rockets star about 1:30 a.m. in downtown Houston is said to have 
called a member of the department's DWI task force after suspecting 
Pippen was driving drunk. Pippen did poorly on the field sobriety 
test and was taken into custody, where he was given the opportunity 
to take a breathalyzer test, a police spokesman said. After he 
refused, Pippen, was booked on suspicion of DWI and released.

<HEADLINE> Knight Ridder Earnings Rise 11 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Newspaper publisher Knight Ridder  
reported an 11 percent rise in first-quarter earnings Thursday, 
crediting strong ad revenues and cost-control efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder, which publishes major dailies including The Miami  
Herald and The Philadelphia Inquirer, earned $62.9 million in the 
three months ending March 28, compared with $56.5 million in the 
same period a year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Per-share earnings rose to 65 cents from 57 cents.  
</P>
<P>
	The year-ago figures did not include a one-time gain of 45 cents  
a share from Knight Ridder's sale of its stake in jointly owned 
cable systems and its newspaper in Gary, Ind. Including the gain, 
the year-ago net earnings were $101.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter were $770.8 million, up from $743.9  
million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Ridder, Knight Ridder chairman and CEO, singled out strong  
ad revenue growth and cost controls as two main factors behind the 
improved performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from the company's online operations grew 70 percent  
from a year ago, Ridder said, noting the launch of 
siliconvalley.com and Philly.com, the company's latest Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder is the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher  
after Gannett, with 31 daily newspapers in 28 U.S. markets, 45 
associated Web sites under the name Knight Ridder Real Cities, and 
investments in two newsprint mills. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Knight-Ridder shares  
rose 81 3/4 cents a share to $54.50.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Order PAL To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Ailing Philippine Airlines must  
arrange massive job cuts and find $200 million in new capital by 
June 4 or face closure, a government regulator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Perfecto Yasay, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, said the airline's large work force is one of the main 
reasons why it has had difficulties finding new investors. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL's majority stockholder, Lucio Tan, has pledged to provide  
$100 million in new equity. But Avelino Zapanta, the airline's 
newly appointed president, said Thursday that Tan was still looking 
for the additional $100 million outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta, in his first news conference as president, said Tan has  
put the first $100 million in an escrow account. If no other 
investors emerge, Tan will provide the additional money himself, 
Zapanta said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injection of new capital was demanded by creditors for their  
approval of PAL's rehabilitation plan. The SEC is to decide on June 
4 whether the plan is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL has been unable to repay more than $2.2 billion in debt,  
mainly because of an ill-timed expansion program, labor unrest, and 
Asia's financial crisis. In the past year it has slashed its fleet 
from 54 planes to 22 and its workforce from 13,000 to about 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta said that in the fiscal year that ended March 31, the  
airline again lost money but that more efficient operations have 
started to improve revenues in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making it already,'' Zapanta said. ``But that's not  
enough, because we have a huge indebtedness to settle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta, a former PAL vice president, was appointed president in  
a management reshuffle this week in which Tan also returned as 
chief executive. Tan, who owns 70 percent of the airline, 
relinquished direct management control only a few months ago under 
pressure from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the U.S. Export-Import Bank and a group of  
European credit agencies, owed about two-thirds of the carrier's 
total debt, wrote to the SEC protesting the management changes, 
saying they threatened security and progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta said he planned to meet with the major creditors next  
week to address their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In a radio interview, Yasay said PAL is unlikely to become  
profitable operating 22 aircraft with 8,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those conditions, ``we will have no option at the SEC but  
to close Philippine Airlines and everybody goes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``We have to resolve this long before June 4.  
Otherwise, we'll be left with no option but to order the 
liquidation of PAL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier interview, Yasay said the airline needs to cut its  
workforce to about 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta said PAL is negotiating with its unions and would try to  
find positions for laid-off workers at companies related to PAL.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Films Infiltrate Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- Look out Hollywood. College students  
whose technical prowess spread bootlegged music over the Internet 
are now watching newly released films on the computers in their 
dorm rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Copies of hit movies like ``The Matrix'' are being distributed  
with a data format similar to the so-called MP3 files that are 
being used to spread free music across cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	While the data files containing full-length movies are too big  
for the average home computer user to conveniently download, 
college students with high-speed hookups in their dorm rooms are 
doing it and the movie industry is shuddering. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very nice. I get to sit here in the comfort of my own  
room and watch a new movie without going to the theater and 
spending $7.50,'' said a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of 
California, Santa Cruz, who asked that his name be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not very nice, said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion  
Picture Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The theft of copyrighted material in any format cannot be left  
unaddressed. There is no exception in the case of Internet 
copyright theft. We won't condone it, and we will pursue those who 
steal film product and illegally transmit it via the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movies can be found on public Web forums, including those  
run by America Online, and on Internet message boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The movies are frequently distributed by students at colleges  
around the country -- including Stanford University, UC Berkeley and 
Virginia Polytechnic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The quality varies.  
</P>
<P>
	``Cruel Intentions,'' Sony's new release about a pair of evil  
teens, looked vivid and sounded clear on a standard desktop 
computer in one cramped dorm room at Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ``The Matrix,'' the surreal sci-fi film, looked  
somewhat dark and shady, and the musical soundtrack was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how the copying works: The originals usually come from  
either a mixing studio employee who steals a copy of a yet-to-be 
released movie, or a projectionist who brings a camcorder into the 
reel booth and makes a copy. 
</P>
<P>
	The video is then transferred digitally into a file, which is  
recorded into a computer. Once that computer file is distributed 
onto the Internet, it can be widely available. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawback is the size of the file.  
</P>
<P>
	While a song in MP3 format can be downloaded in a few minutes,  
it would take hours or even days to download a movie using a 
typical telephone connection to the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet analyst Mark Mooradian, who tracks the proliferation of  
music on the Web for the research firm Jupiter Communications in 
New York, said the large files are going to limit the widespread 
use of movies online until the technology improves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not going to be practical for most people,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many college students and offices have access to networks  
with speedy computer lines and vast memory space. With these 
systems, an entire movie can be downloaded in about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me a sense of satisfaction, like I found something  
and here's the proof that I have it,'' said one self-described 
``stereotypical computer-jockey-hacker'' who distributes movies 
campuswide at Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	About two years ago, college students and other techies started  
using MP3, an audio format that compresses music files at 
CD-quality sound for easy distribution over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, sharing new music over the Web has proliferated to  
more than 500,000 different music files online, despite critics who 
say the technology allows for massive music piracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America and other music  
groups have recently teamed up with top technology companies to 
develop ways to distribute copyrighted music with protections 
against illegal copying. 
</P>
<P>
	If this effort works, similar versions could be applied to  
films, said Leonardo Chiariglione, a founder of the Moving Picture 
Experts Group, the organization that created MP3 and is helping to 
create a secure version. 
</P>
<P>
	The RIAA's anti-piracy chief, Frank Creighton, said movie  
studios should be very concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could easily explode,'' he said. ``Anyone with a computer  
now is a movie distributor. With a click of a mouse button these 
things are flying around the Internet.''

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Beats Earnings Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Riding the spectacular debut of its new  
arthritis drug Celebrex, Monsanto Co.'s first-quarter sales jumped 
25 percent and earnings topped Wall Street projections. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company's higher interest expense and amortization costs  
offset improved sales, sending profits in the quarter down 33 
percent. Monsanto earned $132 million or 20 cents a share in the 
first quarter, compared to $196 million or 32 cents a share in the 
same period a year ago. Results beat analysts' estimates by 3 
cents, according to First Call Corp.. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based maker of drugs and agricultural products  
said total sales rose to $2.55 billion from $2.04 billion a year 
ago. Pharmaceutical sales, driven by Celebrex, soared 55 percent to 
$825 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex, a new breakthrough arthritis drug that significantly  
lessens stomach problems compared to traditional medicines, was 
launched in January. Celebrex, which was the second- fastest 
selling new drug in history after Viagra, had sales of $279 million 
in the quarter. More than 2 million prescriptions were written. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex has also been approved in eight other countries this  
year, including Canada, Peru, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex has virtually taken over the arthritis drug market. But  
Monsanto will face tough competition when Merck win U.S. approval 
for its new arthritis drug later this spring. Both Merck's Vioxx 
and Celebrex promise to relieve the pain from arthritis while 
lowering the risk for ulcers and other gastrointestinal side 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're encouraged by early 1999 events,'' said Robert B.  
Shapiro, chairman and chief executive officer. ``Most notably, 
early patient demand for Celebrex arthritis treatment is at an 
unprecedented level for any new drug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto officials said the higher amortization costs in the  
quarter were associated with acquisitions of seed companies. The 
company was also hurt by higher expenses relating to economic 
weakness in some parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural segment sales were also up sharply, rising 31  
percent, mostly on strong performances by herbicides and the 
biotechnology crop businesses. The 1999 results included sales from 
DeKalb Genetics Corp., Plant Breeding International Cambridge, and 
some operations of Cargill Inc.'s seed businesses, all acquired 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the nutrition and consumer products division dropped to  
$304 million from $385 million in 1998. Monsanto officials blamed 
the divestiture of the Ortho lawn and garden business, and lower 
sales of NutraSweet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Monsanto slipped 31 1/4 cents a share to $42.50 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> High Schools Crack Down on Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Four teens who wore black trench coats to a Colorado Springs,  
Colo., high school were arrested and an Ohio youth was taken into 
custody for threatening to kill his classmates in two incidents 
since a school shooting in Littleton, Colo., that left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	A day before Tuesday's shooting, Georgia officials arrested two  
teen-agers for allegedly threatening to shoot their classmates. The 
teens, who sometimes wore black trench coats like the ones worn by 
the gunmen in the Colorado shooting, had some sort of Internet link 
to the Colorado group, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four teens in Colorado Springs, described as ``Gothics'' by  
police, showed up at a neighboring high school wearing coats and 
black masks. They were confronted by a group of students. Three 
attend another school and the fourth is a 16-year-old dropout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspects were mocking yesterday's events,'' police in  
Colorado Springs, about 65 miles south of Littleton, said in a 
statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	All four -- three boys age 16, 17, and 18, and a 16-year-old girl  
-- face trespassing charges. One faces third-degree assault charges 
after allegedly hitting his father, who apparently then had a heart 
attack and was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio, a 13-year-old boy was taken into custody Wednesday  
after he said he was going ``to come into the school with a gun and 
kill all of the people that he didn't like,'' said Police Chief 
Scott Ballentine in Tuscarawas, 90 miles east of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, a 15-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy were  
suspended from school and arrested Monday after a handgun was found 
in one of their bedrooms after they allegedly threatened last week 
to bring the gun to school to shoot someone. 
</P>
<P>
	They are charged with misdemeanor possession of a firearm.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the students ... are quite shaken,'' State School  
Superintendent Linda Schrenko said. ``They don't want these kids 
let back in school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The connection between the Evans teen-agers and the Littleton  
teen-agers wasn't immediately clear. Schrenko said she didn't know 
if the local teens had merely visited the Littleton group's Web 
site or had been in communication with members of that group.

<HEADLINE> Long Island Lolita Could Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge Thursday opened the way for Amy  
Fisher's possible parole within days after the Long Island Lolita 
apologized in court to Mary Jo Buttafuoco, the woman she shot in a 
jealous rage. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened to you -- it wasn't your husband's fault ... it  
wasn't my father's fault. It was my fault and I'm sorry,'' the 
24-year-old Ms. Fisher said in a barely audible voice, looking 
directly at Mrs. Buttafuoco. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ms. Fisher walked past Mrs. Buttafuoco in the courtroom, they  
brushed fingers and the younger woman mouthed, ``I'm sorry,'' 
holding back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through faith in God I am able to forgive,'' Mrs. Buttafuoco  
said. ``It did not come easily or quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Ms. Fisher, then 16, knocked on the door of Mrs.  
Buttafuoco's Massapequa home and shot her in the head. At the time, 
Ms. Fisher was having sex with Mrs. Buttafuoco's husband, Joey. He 
later served six months in jail for statutory rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher had already won Mrs. Buttafuoco's forgiveness through  
letters the two began several months ago. But Thursday was the 
first time they had seen each another since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	During the court session, Judge Ira Wexner threw out Ms.  
Fisher's 1992 guilty plea to assault on the grounds that her lawyer 
at the time provided ineffective counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher then re-entered the plea and was sentenced to 3 1/2 to  
10 1/2 years. She has already served seven years of the original 
5-to-15-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be interviewed by the state Parole Board on May 3. If  
the board approves, she could be freed that week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are still a young woman and could be a productive member  
of society if you channel your energies,'' Wexner told her. ``Based 
on the information I have received, I believe you can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Buttafuoco said her recovery from the shooting gave her a  
second chance at life. ``You are being given a second chance, 
too,'' she told Ms. Fisher. ``I pray you take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buttafuocos now live in Los Angeles. He was not in court  
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Stress, Prostate Disease Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prostate trouble is an almost inevitable rite  
of passage for aging men. The walnut-sized gland can enlarge or 
become cancerous, but it's not something most men think they have 
to worry about until at least their 50s. 
</P>
<P>
	Less known is that prostates also can become inflamed, known as  
prostatitis -- an extremely painful, chronic disease that often hits 
younger men, in their 30s and 40s. Prostatitis accounts for 2 
million visits to doctors a year, but they're largely in vain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what causes it, and we don't know how to  
effectively treat it,'' said Dr. Leroy Nyberg of the National 
Institutes of Health, which now is seeking sufferers for a $5.5 
million study to better understand prostatitis. ``A lot of men are 
disabled by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enter the lowly rat. It seems that rats get inflamed prostates,  
too, especially when they're subjected to stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Stress can spur excess production of a hormone called  
prolactin that seems to be involved in the inflammation, says North 
Carolina State University's Dr. C. Lee Robinette. 
</P>
<P>
	To Robinette, a veterinarian who has spent years studying rats  
and prostate disease, that's a red flag signaling that stress also 
may be behind much of the human misery. 
</P>
<P>
	Humans produce prolactin. And while no one has yet researched a  
stress connection, some men do report that their prostatitis seems 
to wax and wane with stress -- getting worse when they're under more 
pressure at work or there's an illness in the family, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does appear that men in high-stress jobs, Type A  
personalities, are the ones that physicians see a lot of,'' agreed 
Nyberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, stress is one characteristic the NIH's new study will  
watch for this year as researchers try to pinpoint who is at risk 
for prostatitis, and then next year begin looking for treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostatitis symptoms include pain in the genital area and lower  
back accompanied by frequent and urgent urination. It can cause 
burning or pain during urination or ejaculation, and is one cause 
of sexual impotence. Severe cases can be disabling. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows just how many men have prostatitis, although  
experts estimate that half may experience it at some point. It can 
strike anytime, although of the first 100 men enrolled in the NIH's 
study, the average age is 41, and many sufferers are in their 30s, 
Nyberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acute bacterial prostatitis'' is caused by an infection that  
quickly clears up, but it is rare. The vast majority of cases are 
``chronic nonbacterial prostatitis,'' where symptoms go away and 
then return without warning. Doctors cannot find an infection, 
although for lack of anything else to help they often prescribe 
antibiotics -- a therapy that should never be used unless tests do 
uncover bacteria, Nyberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the mystery that drove Robinette's rat research.  
</P>
<P>
	He discovered that the prostates of aging rats frequently would  
become inflamed, and that injecting younger rats with certain 
compounds could induce similar prostatitis -- creating an animal 
model to test what causes the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	When rats' prostates are inflamed, they have extra-high levels  
of prolactin. Stress causes the body -- rats' and people's -- to 
produce more prolactin. So Robinette subjected 
prostatitis-suffering rats to stress to see if they got worse than 
prostatitis-suffering rats left alone. 
</P>
<P>
	How do you stress a lab rat? Put it in a small plastic cone for  
15 minutes, just small enough that it can't move. Restraint worries 
rats immensely, Robinette said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did this twice a day for four weeks. The stressed rats  
produced more prolactin and their prostatitis grew worse. The 
unstressed rats largely healed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rat studies don't always predict what happens in humans, and  
there's no way to know if rats felt more pain or other symptoms 
when they were stressed -- a key question for humans, Nyberg noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the study suggests ``that maybe stress does exacerbate  
chronic prostatitis,'' something the NIH's study will examine, he 
said. To enroll, check

<HEADLINE> US Ambassador's Japan Deals Curbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thomas Foley, the U.S. ambassador to Japan,  
will have to withdraw from matters involving the think tank where 
his wife is a researcher and the major Japanese bank closely tied 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Foley was often controversial as the unpaid chief of  
staff to her husband when he was House speaker. The State 
Department, billing itself as ``family friendly,'' has ruled that 
Mrs. Foley's new job conforms with ethics rules but that her 
husband must not be involved in decisions on matters involving the 
think tank, the Japan Research Institute, or its affiliate, 
Sumitomo Bank, which, in turn, is part of a huge Japanese 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Foley has authorized us to say that she is happy to be  
working,'' the State Department said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said a department review before Mrs. Foley began  
her job in October found ``her employment conforms with all 
relevant State Department regulations regarding employment 
overseas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sensitive to even the appearance of a conflict of interest, the  
department said Foley ``should recuse himself from official 
activities involving the institute and Sumitomo Bank, unless 
properly authorized'' by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley became ambassador to Japan in October 1997 after 30 years  
in the House, where he served as speaker from 1989 until his defeat 
in the 1994 elections. During most of Foley's tenure as a Democrat 
from Washington state, Mrs. Foley was his unpaid chief of staff. 
She gained considerable behind-the-scenes influence among 
then-controlling Democrats when her husband became a party leader. 
</P>
<P>
	She tried to stay out of the limelight, but made headlines when  
she was forced to testify before a federal grand jury in 1992 
during an investigation of scandals at the House Post Office. She 
was neither a subject nor a target of that investigation, according 
to the U.S. attorney at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But out of the limelight, Mrs. Foley had much to do with hiring  
and firing of staff, and remodeling much of the House side of the 
Capitol -- a task that brought criticism for perceived excesses, 
including marble floors in elevators. 
</P>
<P>
	After Democrats took considerable heat when it became known that  
the old House bank was covering overdrafts for lawmakers, Mrs. 
Foley quietly presented a list of members who were overdrawing 
their accounts to Republican leaders -- a warning that both parties 
could be hurt by the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department official said the agency ``reviewed  
carefully'' her new job, pointing out she was a private citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a family-friendly employer, the department sympathetically  
reviews requests for employment by family members of its employees 
... in their areas of professional experience,'' the department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under department regulations ... the spouse of a ...  
department employee may accept outside employment in a foreign 
country unless such employment would violate any law of such 
country, could require a waiver of diplomatic immunity deemed 
unacceptably broad by the chief of mission, or could otherwise 
damage the interests of the United States as determined by the 
chief of mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief of mission normally is the ambassador, but in this  
case, department officials in Washington made the determination 
that her employment ``merited approval.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several conditions were established: Mrs. Foley's name cannot  
appear on any institute materials or reports that are distributed 
outside of the institute; the institute should not use her name to 
publicize its work, to raise funds or to attract new clients; and 
Mrs. Foley should not use her access to the embassy or to other 
State Department resources to further the interests of the 
institute, Sumitomo Bank or the bank's clients.

<HEADLINE> RJR Profit Skids 54 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s underlying profit  
skidded 54 percent in the first quarter due to tobacco lawsuit 
settlement expenses and the fallout from last year's steep price 
hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the nation's second-biggest tobacco company, led by  
its Camel and Winston brands, said it lost ground in the U.S. 
cigarette market even as industry leader Philip Morris Cos. Inc. 
gained. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were below Wall Street's expectations but RJR shares  
rose 43 3/4 cents to $26.18 3/4 in trading Thursday on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Before one-time charges, RJR earned $83 million, or 24 cents a  
share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with $179 
million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Those earnings fell short of the 28 cents a share that analysts  
surveyed by First Call had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 7 percent to $4.22 billion from $3.95 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Counting one-time items, RJR reported net income of $76 million,  
or 22 cents a share, in the quarter in contrast to a loss of $20 
million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 total reflected $15 million in pretax expenses for  
restructuring its 80.6-percent owned Nabisco Foods business, 
cutting net income by 2 cents a share. The 1998 figures included a 
$312 million pretax charge for the costs of settling a tobacco 
lawsuit with the state of Minnesota, reducing net income by 62 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic tobacco profits fell 19 percent in the quarter,  
excluding the charge a year ago, even though revenue rose 40 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Its R.J. Reynolds Tobacco division boosted prices by 63 cents a  
pack over the past year, including a 45 cent-a-pack increase after 
last November's legal settlement with 46 states over health costs 
for treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the price hikes helped boost Reynolds cigarette revenue,  
its shipments to wholesalers fell 14 percent compared with a 10 
percent drop for the overall industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds estimated its share of the retail market fell nearly a  
full percentage point to 24.57 percent in the quarter. Philip 
Morris said earlier this week its retail market share rose 1.6 
points to 53.7 percent in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Promotional costs increased as Reynolds and other tobacco makers  
offered selective discounts to cushion the impact of the price 
hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also depressing Reynolds' tobacco results were $500 million in  
expenses for tobacco litigation settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the November agreement, Reynolds and other tobacco  
makers have agreed to pay $246 billion over 25 years to settle all 
50 states' claims for expenses of treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I believe that Reynolds is standing its ground in an  
extremely competitive domestic marketplace,'' said RJR's chairman 
and chief executive, Steven F. Goldstone. ``We expect industry 
performance to begin to settle down over the next few quarters as 
consumers, retailers and manufacturers adjust to the new pricing 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Its international tobacco business posted a 31 percent decline  
in operating profits as sales fell 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR plans to sell the international tobacco business to Japan  
Tobacco Co. for $7.8 billion in cash by mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	It then plans to spin off its stake in its domestic tobacco  
business to its shareholders. That would leave RJR with its 
controlling stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp., which reported a 35 
percent decline in first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nabisco is showing great progress,'' Goldstone said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Hears About East Timor Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Portugal's foreign minister questioned  
Indonesia's commitment Thursday to ending violence in East Timor 
and granting independence to the former Portuguese territory if it 
rejects wide-ranging autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian military has been accused of arming  
pro-government militias to fight Timorese separatists and disrupt a 
ballot on autonomy, and it is unclear whether a peace agreement 
signed Wednesday will stop the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that Indonesia is going to abide by previous  
compromise, and that diplomacy of Indonesia is not going behind but 
ahead of the commitments of its armed forces,'' Portugal's Jaime 
Gama told reporters as he arrived for U.N.-sponsored talks aimed at 
wrapping up an autonomy package. 
</P>
<P>
	Gama noted that the chief of the Indonesian armed forces, Gen.  
Wiranto, sponsored the peace settlement and recognized that East 
Timor was an international problem. He said the move was important 
because it meant the military was obeying the command of President 
B.J. Habibie. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence has intensified in East Timor since Habibie, in a  
surprise reversal, announced in January that Indonesia would grant 
the Timorese independence if they reject autonomy. Indonesia 
invaded East Timor in 1975 and later annexed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord, signed Wednesday, commits the opposing groups to  
stop all hostilities, intimidation, acts of terror and violence. It 
did not, however, address the issue of disarming the militias and 
separatist rebels, and it was not clear whether they would heed the 
call for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Gama stressed that before the United Nations can go to East  
Timor to organize a ballot, the Indonesian armed forces must 
control the security situation in the territory by ``not backing 
the militias -- and even disarming the militias.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said he expects talks  
Thursday and Friday with Gama and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
to focus on three topics: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The text of the main umbrella agreement that will spell out  
what Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations will do after the 
autonomy vote. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Indonesia's proposed amendments to the 60-point U.N. autonomy  
proposal, which will be an annex to the main agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Arrangements for the United Nations to conduct the ballot,  
including the extent of a U.N. presence in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence activists have demanded a U.N. peacekeeping force  
to control security, but Alatas said, ``I don't think a 
peacekeeping role in the form of troops is in the cards.''

<HEADLINE> Human Ancestor Possibly Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 2.5 million years ago, human-like  
creatures were using stone tools to filet meat beside an African 
lake -- a discovery researchers say provides a new human ancestor 
and also the earliest known use of tools to cut food. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers named the new hominid species ``garhi,'' which  
means surprise in the local language near Bouri, in Ethiopia's Afar 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The new species is descended from the one that produced the  
famous Lucy skeleton in east Africa. It is a candidate for earliest 
human ancestor, the researchers say in an article in Friday's issue 
of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the right place, at the right time, to be the  
ancestor of early (humans), however defined,'' reported the team 
led by Berhane Asfaw of Rift Valley Research Service in Addis 
Ababa, Ethiopia, and Tim White of the University of California at 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	The new species ``could turn out to be the link'' between the  
genus Homo, which includes modern humans -- Homo sapiens -- and its 
predecessor, Australopithecus, White said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so sure is anthropologist Bernard Wood of George Washington  
University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's always good news when people find more fossil  
evidence,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``but ... I don't 
think we can be sure it's an ancestor of later'' humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they've found is what many of us were expecting, that  
there is quite a lot of variety in early hominids ... in this 
particular period,'' Wood said. ``I think it's ironic in some ways 
that it's been called a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tentatively named Australopithecus garhi, the new species had  
large teeth and a projecting face, somewhat similar to the 
well-known fossil Lucy, who lived 3.2 million years ago and was of 
the Australopithecus afarensis species, with apelike upper arms 
that were long relative to her legs. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the more human-like Homo erectus developed, about  
1.7 million years ago, legs were longer and more human, and 
forearms had shortened. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the relationship between arm and leg bones from a  
second individual found near the new skull, garhi was between the 
two, with long, human-like legs but not yet having shortened 
forearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The skull was from a male, with a small brain case and a  
protruding jaw. The individual whose arm and leg bones were found 
would have been about 4-feet-10, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	An antelope jaw and other animal bones found near the garhi  
skeleton show cut marks from tools, perhaps the earliest evidence 
of human tool use in butchering animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden this is a bipedal primate with a difference,''  
White said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have the clearest evidence these very early hominids  
were butchering mammals and were knowledgeable about the (marrow) 
within the bones, a highly valuable food resource,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of the tools and the bones together ``doesn't prove  
that the individual was the one who held the stone tool, but it's 
pretty strong evidence,'' he went on. 
</P>
<P>
	The marks show the flesh was cut from the bones and the bones  
were broken at both ends, indicating an effort to extract the 
marrow, an important new food for hominids, according to a second 
paper by a team led by White, the late Jean de Heinzelin of the 
Royal Belgian Institute of Science and J. Desmond Clark, also at 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found only a few sharpened stones around the  
bones and speculated that because they were hard to come by in the 
area, the ancient hunters took care of their tools. By contrast, 
sharp stones are plentiful 60 miles away at Gona, and that area is 
littered with discarded tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently a desert, 2.5 million years ago the region where the  
bones were found was a broad, shallow lake surrounded by grassland, 
the scientists reported. It was not clear, however, whether garhi 
hunted the animals that came to the lake or merely took advantage 
of dead animals found there.

<HEADLINE> Sheiks Shoot for Derby in Novel Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum remembers the  
reaction when he and other members of the royal family of Dubai 
formed Godolphin Racing and began training horses in the emirate. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started Godolphin, my friends and advisers asked me,  
`What are you going to feed them, sand?''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynics think the Maktoums will be eating crow after racing  
Worldly Manner and Aljabr in the Kentucky Derby. Both colts are 
going into the grueling 1 1/4-mile Derby without having had an 
official race this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very interesting, and it will add flavor to the Derby,''  
trainer Bob Baffert said in January after the Maktoums' plans 
became known. He also joked, ``If it works, we'll be spending the 
winter in Dubai next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Worldly Manner victory in the Derby on May 1 at Churchill  
Downs would be decidedly not funny to Baffert, who will try to win 
the race for an unprecedented third straight time with General 
Challenge or Prime Timber, the 1-2 finishers in the Santa Anita 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner was trained by Baffert when he won three of four  
starts in the United States as a 2-year-old. In his last race, he 
won the seven-furlong Del Mar Futurity on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the colt was sold to Godolphin for $5 million by John and  
Betty Mabee, who bred him and who also own General Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner and Aljabr, who won twice in Britain and once in  
France in his only starts last year, arrived at Keeneland in 
Lexington on Monday. They were to be in quarantine for 48 hours 
before coming to Louisville for the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 21, Worldly Manner beat Aljabr in a 1 1/8-mile trial race  
in Dubai. At that time it was announced Worldly Manner would go to 
the Derby off that test, but that Aljabr would have another trial, 
which he won on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Boosting the argument of those, who think too much is being  
asked of the Worldly Manner and Aljabr were the performances of 
Prado's Landing in the March 21 trial and in the 1 1/8-mile Blue Grass 
Stakes April 10 at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	Prado's Landing, who finished 7 lengths behind Worldly Manner,  
was to be a measuring stick against the likes of Menifee, Cat Thief 
and Vicar in the Blue Grass. He finished last in the eight-horse 
Blue Grass, beaten 23 1/4 lengths by winner Menifee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really hoping that he would run 1, 2, 3,'' said  
Michael Osborne, a representative of Godolphin. ``If he had, we 
would have been coming with a whole lot more confidence. It just 
didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cynics would be wise, however, not to laugh to loudly at the  
Maktoums novel way of going after the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, their Lammtarra, who raced once as a  
2-year-old, wintered in Dubai and then made his 3-year-old debut by 
winning the incredibly tough English Derby. In his only two starts 
before being retired to breeding he won the prestigious King George 
VI and Queen Elizabeth in England and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe 
in France. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maktoums have put fantastic sums of money into racing, won  
major events all over the world and in four years have established 
the Dubai World Cup at first-class Nad el-Sheba Racecourse as a 
major international stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	They play to win.

<HEADLINE> American Indian Museum Design Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal Commission of Fine Arts on  
Wednesday rejected a revised design for the proposed National 
Museum of the American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian Institution museum had been scheduled to open in  
late 2002 on the National Mall between the National Air and Space 
Museum and the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Carter Brown, the fine arts commission's chairman, said the  
revised design ``does not come up to the standard we had previously 
approved'' in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The original design for the $110 million building was primarily  
the work of Douglas Cardinal, a Canadian architect with Indian 
ancestry. Cardinal, however, lost his status as the lead architect 
a year ago in a contract dispute between the Smithsonian and the 
former prime architectural contractor for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian then turned completion of the design over to its  
own staff and another team of outside architects. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version ``lacks the sculptural quality'' and ``so much  
of the spirit'' of the original design, fine arts commission member 
Carolyn Brody told The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithsonian spokesman David Umansky said the institution took  
the commission's comments to heart and will come back with a design 
that will meet its approval. Umansky told the newspaper the 
Smithsonian still intends to break ground on the project Sept. 28.

<HEADLINE> NATO Expansion Taking Back Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders had planned to celebrate the 50th  
anniversary of the alliance by welcoming three new members and 
considering the addition of several others. The focus was supposed 
to be about playing peacemaker, not policeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo changed that agenda.  
</P>
<P>
	The idea of expanding NATO now sits on the sidelines as world  
leaders debate how to end the bloodshed in Yugoslavia. The newest 
members of the alliance understand that. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is not only a defensive alliance but also a community, a  
community of common value,'' said Bronislaw Geremek, foreign 
minister of Poland. ``And human rights are becoming more and more 
part of international law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were to take the  
spotlight today at their formal NATO induction during ceremonies in 
the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Several nations would like soon to join them.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are fully aware we can't survive alone,'' said Boris Frlec,  
foreign minister of Slovenia, one of several Central and Eastern 
European nations that yearns to join NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Though linked to the alliance through its Partnership for Peace,  
Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Lithuania, Estonia and 
Latvia still lack full membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are continuing our endeavors to convince NATO we are  
reliable, dependable, trustworthy and capable allies,'' Frlec said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said this week that the  
summit would ``confirm our readiness to face the future with new 
members and new capabilities, prepared for new missions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But little more is promised to the countries that want to join  
the alliance: The summit is expected to keep the path clear for 
future expansion without saying which countries might be added or 
when. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had planned a summit that focused a bit on the past and a  
great deal on the future. That will still be very central to the 
summit's agenda, but now it's necessary to have it focus intensely 
on the present as well,'' said Sandy Berger, the national security 
adviser, as last-minute changes were being made to the summit 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The present is the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, which  
has been supported by all NATO members and at least accepted by 
most members of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before today's anniversary commemoration ceremonies, NATO  
heads of state were meeting to discuss the airstrikes aimed at 
stopping Yugoslav repression in Serbia's Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo action has thrust NATO into a new role of fighting  
abuse against people within a nonmember state -- something that 
encourages some prospective members. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also enhances Russia's strong opposition both to the  
alliance bombing of Yugoslavia and to its expansion eastward. 
Russia is boycotting the summit because of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Success would bring about NATO expansion because prospective  
members would see it as proof the alliance offers effective 
protection against aggression, said Janusz Bugajski, an analyst 
with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failure would bring into question the whole purpose of NATO in  
eastern Europe, including the Balkans,'' Bugajski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance formed after World War II to counter the emerging  
power of the Soviet Union requires its new members to meet 
standards of democracy, economic freedom and military preparedness. 
Ten European members, the United States and Canada signed the 
original pact. Greece and Turkey joined in 1952, Germany in 1955 
and Spain in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Marion Expected To Exit UNLV for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Shawn Marion's basketball career at UNLV will  
likely end after just one season. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion has scheduled a news conference for Friday, at which he  
is expected to announce he will submit his name for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Marion told reporters he intended to stay in school.  
But after checking with several NBA teams and player personnel 
directors in the last couple of weeks, Marion learned that he was a 
potential lottery pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Bayno said he would support Marion leaving if he was  
going to be a lottery pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``His decision has always been based on where he's going to go  
in the draft,'' Bayno said. ``He's getting a strong indication that 
he's a lottery pick. If that's true, he has to go (pro).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 junior, who had been a star at Vincennes (Ind.)  
University prior to transferring to UNLV, led the Rebels in scoring 
(18.7), rebounding (9.3), blocked shots, free-throw percentage and 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he can taste the money and he can taste the NBA,''  
Bayno said. ``He and I talked the other day and I want what's best 
for him and his family. Hopefully, he'll go between eight and 13.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bayno said the NCAA's pending investigation of the UNLV program  
was not a factor in Marion's decision.

<HEADLINE>  Officer's Report Praised Teen Gunmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Dylan Klebold was ``a bright young man  
who has a great deal of potential.'' Eric Harris was ``intelligent 
enough to achieve lofty goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So reads a report written less than three months ago by a court  
officer assessing the future of the two gunmen who killed and 
wounded dozens of students Tuesday at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, were caught breaking into a van  
last year and allowed to complete a juvenile-court diversion 
program to clear their records. They finished in February with 
flying colors, convincing a diversion officer that they had 
promising futures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in  
life. He is intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he 
stays on task and remains motivated,'' the officer said in 
documents released by Jefferson County District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the documents was provided to The Associated Press by  
KCNC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer, whose name was blacked out by court officials,  
wrote that Dylan ``is a bright young man who has a great deal of 
potential. If he is able to tap his potential and become 
self-motivated he should do well in life. Dylan has earned the 
right for an early termination....He is intelligent enough to make 
any dream a reality but he needs to understand hard work is part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' received anger-management counseling, which he enjoyed,  
the officer wrote. Both teens also completed 45 hours of community 
service, received individual counseling and wrote an apology 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as they reassured the court of their rehabilitation,  
the two teens were causing concern among some of their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Klebold and Harris made several class-project videos  
foreshadowing their spasm of violence, classmates say. 
</P>
<P>
	In one video, ``they had their friends pretend to be the jocks,  
and they pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' high school 
junior Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a little upset they couldn't show their video to the  
whole school. But there were guns in every scene of the video, so 
you can't show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hadn't yet determined whether such a  
video was made, and the teacher who taught the class refused to 
comment. But another student said the pair's video projects were 
uniformly disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always were the same kind of videos,'' said Eric Veik,  
16. ``They always wore trench coats. They always wanted to be the 
intimidators, the good guys out to get the bad guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At school, the pair were known as members of a group of outcasts  
who called themselves the ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' for the long black 
coats they wore, regardless of the season. Klebold and Harris 
openly admired Hitler, wore German crosses to school, and played 
violent video games for hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbing thing, to some, is that Klebold and Harris came  
from respected, middle-class families. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and Susan Klebold lived in a home worth nearly $400,000,  
a modernistic cedar-and-glass structure with matching guest house 
tucked between two huge stone formations on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold's father, Thomas, 52, a retired geophysicist who  
consulted with companies exploring gas and oil, now runs a mortgage 
management business from his home. His mother, 50, has worked for 
the Colorado community-college system for years, helping disabled 
students gain access to education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all scratching our heads right now,'' said Michael  
Briand, who knows Ms. Klebold from his work as a 
community-development consultant at Arapahoe Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the elder Klebold is known as a liberal, in favor of gun  
control. Ms. Klebold is a sensitive listener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly  
normal,'' Briand said. ``They did everything right. But somehow the 
pain and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't 
reach it. This has got to be a pervasive thing in our society if it 
can reach this far, into families like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y., where  
his father, Wayne Harris, was an Air Force pilot. In Littleton, the 
elder Harris worked for a flight-safety business; his wife, 
Katherine, worked for a catering business, according to the 
juvenile-court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Wayne and Katherine were quiet, sometimes waving  
across the fence while in the yard but making little effort to 
socialize. Their tidy, two-story home on a quiet cul-de-sac is 
assessed at $184,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Former neighbors in Plattsburgh remember a solid, middle-class  
family with a likable young son. They were shocked to learn that 
Eric Harris had shot up a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mouth just dropped,'' former classmate Kyle Ross said. ``He  
was a typical kid. He didn't seem anything like what is portrayed 
on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The families were avoiding reporters, but both issued statements  
expressing sympathy for the victims, and Klebold's family wondered 
what went wrong: ``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling 
to understand why this happened.''

<HEADLINE> Philips Electronics' Profit Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Royal Philips Electronics's profit  
fell 34 percent in the first quarter, but still beat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips shares rose sharply on the news, rising 4.6 percent in  
early trading on the Amsterdam exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The electronics conglomerate earned 469 million euros, or $497  
million, in the first three months of the year, down from 708 
million euros a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales dropped to 6.84 billion euros, or $7.2 billion, from 7.06  
billion euros in the same period last year. All Philips' figures 
for 1988 were adjusted to reflect the sale of its entertainment 
unit PolyGram to Seagram Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips posted a profit of 73 million euros, or $77.4 million,  
from normal business operations at its flagship consumer products 
division which lost 43 million euros a year ago. Analysts had 
expected a break-even performance at best. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were also bolstered by a gain of 180 million euros,  
or $191 million, from the sale of a components unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips said the results reflected a ``significant reduction''  
in the losses incurred consumer communications products where 
``activities have been more focused'' following the dissolution in 
late 1988 of a joint venture with U.S. group Lucent Technologies 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are encouraged by the results of the first quarter, which  
we see as an important step in securing our goal of double-digit 
growth in earnings from continuing operations for 1999,'' Philips 
said in a statement.

<HEADLINE>  Hot-Hitting D'backs Go on the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Much was made of the Arizona Diamondbacks'  
pitching potential after their off-season free-agent spending 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody said much about offense.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet led by a resurgent Matt Williams, the Diamondbacks are  
smacking the ball with the best of them in the early season. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona is third in the NL in batting with a .280 average and  
the Diamondbacks are the runaway leaders in the majors in home runs 
with 30. The pitching, too, has lived up to expectations. Arizona 
is third in the league with a 3.68 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 1-5 start on the road, the Diamondbacks went 8-2 in a  
homestand against Los Angeles, San Francisco and Philadelphia. 
They've won four in a row heading into their longest road trip of 
the season, with stops in San Diego, Houston, Milwaukee and 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in their young history, the Diamondbacks have  
a winning record, two heady games above .500, and the catalyst has 
been Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	He leads the majors in multihit games with nine. He's batting a  
team-leading .357 with five homers, seven doubles and 15 RBIs. At 
33, he's off to one of the best starts of his long career. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing a five-year, $45 million contract extension  
following his trade from Cleveland, Williams seemed uncomfortable 
as one of the few recognizable players on a struggling expansion 
team last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit .267 and managed just 71 RBIs while being bothered by  
nagging injuries most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of pride. He cares,'' manager Buck Showalter  
said. ``He takes on the needs of the team. There's no way he could 
have supplied everything this club needed last year, even though he 
tried. I think it's help having some guys come in here to share the 
load. He seems a lot more relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the off-season, Williams got married. He worked out  
rigorously, and watched as the Diamondbacks brought in pitchers 
Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre, Armando Reynoso and Greg Swindell, 
along with centerfielder Steve Finley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks got Luis Gonzalez in a trade with Detroit for  
Karim Garcia, and brought in Tony Womack in a deal for a minor 
leaguer and a player yet to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, whose three-run homer off Curt Schilling was the  
difference in Arizona's 4-2 victory over Philadelphia Wednesday 
night, says he's just trying to keep it simple at the plate, and he 
downplays the significance of the arrival of the other veteran 
players in his hot start. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you walk to the plate, it's you and the pitcher, and when  
he releases it, it's simply you and the baseball,'' Williams said. 
``You try to put a good swing on a good pitch. That's as deep as 
I'm going to go with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is far from alone when it comes to Arizona offense  
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, looking like a steal from Detroit, is hitting .346  
with six home runs. Jay Bell has rebounded from last year's sub-par 
season and is hitting .299 with five homers. He was the NL's player 
of the week last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Gilkey, after refusing to restructure his contract to be  
traded for Womack, is hitting .333 with four homers in part-time 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt's been awesome,'' Stottlemyre said. ``Obviously he's  
always been a great defensive player. He's had a great approach all 
spring. Him, Jay Bell, Gonzo (Gonzalez), everybody. The approach 
and the professionalism that guys have had since day one of spring 
training has been awesome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a tough first week that kind of tested the character of  
the ball club, and everybody kept coming to the ballpark with the 
same approach, try to play the game right and play hard. We've had 
a nice home stretch and we're going to be bouncing around the 
country the next couple of weeks. There are some new challenges 
coming up.''

<HEADLINE>  Officer's Report Praised Teen Gunmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Dylan Klebold was ``a bright young man  
who has a great deal of potential.'' Eric Harris was ``intelligent 
enough to achieve lofty goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So reads a report written less than three months ago by a court  
officer assessing the future of the two gunmen who killed and 
wounded dozens of students Tuesday at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, were caught breaking into a van  
last year and allowed to complete a juvenile-court diversion 
program to clear their records. They finished in February with 
flying colors, convincing a diversion officer that they had 
promising futures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is a very bright young man who is likely to succeed in  
life. He is intelligent enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he 
stays on task and remains motivated,'' the officer said in 
documents released by Jefferson County District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the documents was provided to The Associated Press by  
KCNC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer, whose name was blacked out by court officials,  
wrote that Dylan ``is a bright young man who has a great deal of 
potential. If he is able to tap his potential and become 
self-motivated he should do well in life. Dylan has earned the 
right for an early termination....He is intelligent enough to make 
any dream a reality but he needs to understand hard work is part of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' received anger-management counseling, which he enjoyed,  
the officer wrote. Both teens also completed 45 hours of community 
service, received individual counseling and wrote an apology 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as they reassured the court of their rehabilitation,  
the two teens were causing concern among some of their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Klebold and Harris made several class-project videos  
foreshadowing their spasm of violence, classmates say. 
</P>
<P>
	In one video, ``they had their friends pretend to be the jocks,  
and they pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' high school 
junior Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a little upset they couldn't show their video to the  
whole school. But there were guns in every scene of the video, so 
you can't show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hadn't yet determined whether such a  
video was made, and the teacher who taught the class refused to 
comment. But another student said the pair's video projects were 
uniformly disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always were the same kind of videos,'' said Eric Veik,  
16. ``They always wore trench coats. They always wanted to be the 
intimidators, the good guys out to get the bad guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At school, the pair were known as members of a group of outcasts  
who called themselves the ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' for the long black 
coats they wore, regardless of the season. Klebold and Harris 
openly admired Hitler, wore German crosses to school, and played 
violent video games for hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbing thing, to some, is that Klebold and Harris came  
from respected, middle-class families. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and Susan Klebold lived in a home worth nearly $400,000,  
a modernistic cedar-and-glass structure with matching guest house 
tucked between two huge stone formations on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold's father, Thomas, 52, a retired geophysicist who  
consulted with companies exploring gas and oil, now runs a mortgage 
management business from his home. His mother, 50, has worked for 
the Colorado community-college system for years, helping disabled 
students gain access to education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all scratching our heads right now,'' said Michael  
Briand, who knows Ms. Klebold from his work as a 
community-development consultant at Arapahoe Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the elder Klebold is known as a liberal, in favor of gun  
control. Ms. Klebold is a sensitive listener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly  
normal,'' Briand said. ``They did everything right. But somehow the 
pain and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't 
reach it. This has got to be a pervasive thing in our society if it 
can reach this far, into families like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y., where  
his father, Wayne Harris, was an Air Force pilot. In Littleton, the 
elder Harris worked for a flight-safety business; his wife, 
Katherine, worked for a catering business, according to the 
juvenile-court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Wayne and Katherine were quiet, sometimes waving  
across the fence while in the yard but making little effort to 
socialize. Their tidy, two-story home on a quiet cul-de-sac is 
assessed at $184,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Former neighbors in Plattsburgh remember a solid, middle-class  
family with a likable young son. They were shocked to learn that 
Eric Harris had shot up a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mouth just dropped,'' former classmate Kyle Ross said. ``He  
was a typical kid. He didn't seem anything like what is portrayed 
on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The families were avoiding reporters, but both issued statements  
expressing sympathy for the victims, and Klebold's family wondered 
what went wrong: ``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling 
to understand why this happened.''

<HEADLINE> Cox Buying Media General For $1.4B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Cox Communications Inc., a leading cable  
television and telecommunications provider, said Thursday it will 
purchase Media General cable systems serving northern Virginia in a 
$1.4 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Cox serves 450,000 customers in southeastern  
Virginia and Roanoke for such services as cable television, high 
speed Internet access and long distance telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Media General officials said consolidation in the cable industry  
was making it more difficult to work as a single-system operator. 
The deal will affect 260,000 Media General cable customers in 
Fairfax and Fredericksburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Robbins said the  
deal will allow the company to add another large metropolitan area 
to its growing roster of markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a high-growth area with great demographics that  
indicate demand is ripe for telecommunication services,'' Robbins 
said. ``Entering this market allows us to further our strategy of 
operating large systems in metropolitan areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Media General Chairman and CEO J. Stewart Bryan III said Media  
General concluded that ``a company like Cox could best maximize the 
growth potential of our cable operations and provide good ongoing 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan said the sale will allow Richmond-based Media General to  
focus on newspapers and broadcast stations in the southeast. The 
proceeds of the sale will likely be used to purchase additional 
television stations and newspapers, paying down debt and starting a 
share repurchase program. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale will take several months to complete, after which Media  
General will continue to operate a cable news and information 
channel in Fairfax County. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still must be approved by the Federal Communications  
Commission.

<HEADLINE> 'Dollarization' Seen As Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Any nation thinking about adopting the U.S.  
dollar as its own currency should realize that the move won't be a 
cure for all economic woes, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
and a top Clinton administratin official told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers agreed  
that there were economic benefits to be gained from such a move, 
both for the foreign nation and for the United States, but they 
cautioned that there were pitfalls as well if countries don't 
undertake the necessary economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no substitute for sound policies,'' Greenspan said.  
``I don't care what type of (currency) regime you have, if you try 
to create something out of nothing, you will end up with nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both officials testified before two Senate Banking  
subcommittees, who wanted to hear the administration and Fed views 
on proposals under active consideration in Latin America. Argentina 
is actively studying the possibility of dropping its currency in 
favor of the dollar, a process known as ``dollarization,'' and 
Mexico and other Latin American nations have expressed some 
interest in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said he saw many benefits for Latin  
American countries, a region where many nations have been forced to 
endure dramatic devaluations of their currencies, triggering 
rampant inflation and wiping out the savings of millions of 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dollarization offers a way out of this cycle of devaluation  
and economic contraction,'' Mack said. It would give emerging 
markets long-term price stability, which is a key ingredient to 
rising standards of living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers said, ``To adopt another country's currency as one's  
own is a momentous decision for any country and will need to be 
considered with a very careful eye to the potential benefits and 
costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States does not have the power to block a  
nation from taking this course, Summers said the administration 
hopes that any country considering it would engage in extensive 
consultations with U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	If Argentina or other countries went ahead with adopting the  
dollar, Summers said the United States could expect to benefit from 
greater trade links since U.S. exporters would not have to be 
concerned about sudden changes in exchange rates hurting their 
sales prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers said there also would be downside risks for the  
United States, particularly if a Latin American country was 
experiencing economic hard times and politicians decided to shift 
blame away from their own policies as the cause and instead blamed 
U.S. monetary authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest drawback to ``dollarization'' is the control a  
country loses over using its own monetary policy, increases or 
decreases in interest rates, to change economic conditions, 
lowering rates during slow times or raising rates if growth is too 
rapid and inflation becomes a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of dollarization is just one of a number of proposals  
being actively studied at present as developing countries and the 
industrialized world search for ways to prevent future Asian-style 
currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Thursday outlined a package  
of reforms the administration will be pushing at a day-long meeting 
next Monday of finance ministers of the world's seven richest 
industrial countries followed by two days of discussions at the 
spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	One key item the administration is hoping to win approval for is  
creation of a new loan window at the IMF that would provide credit 
to countries following sound policies to ward off financial 
turmoil. The IMF procedure during the currency crisis that struck 
Asia in 1997, Russia in 1998 and Brazil in January was to wait 
until investors had rushed for the exits before offering rescue 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is expected to also push for Japan, which has  
been struggling with its worst recession in 50 years, and Europe, 
where growth has unexpectedly slowed in recent months, to do more 
to accelerate economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The worry is that developing countries struggling to emerge from  
their own recessions need strong growth in Europe and Japan to 
supply markets for their goods. The administration is also 
sensitive to rising protectionist pressures in the United States 
from record-high trade deficits.

<HEADLINE> List Details Birds in Jeopardy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Baltimore Oriole is the state bird of  
Maryland and the mascot for a major league baseball team -- and it's 
one of a number of bird species that are dwindling in number, 
according to the National Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservation group marked Earth Day on Thursday by releasing  
a state-by-state series of ``WatchLists'' identifying at-risk 
birds, or birds that are not yet threatened or endangered but 
should be carefully watched. 
</P>
<P>
	Included on the lists are the California Quail and the  
Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, the state birds of California and 
Oklahoma. The Baltimore Oriole is listed for several states, 
especially in New England, but not in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general goal is to keep birds that are showing sings of  
trouble -- but are still relatively common -- to keep them common,'' 
said Vincent Muehter, Audubon's associate director of conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 other birds are highlighted, including the  
Red-headed Woodpecker and the Trumpeter Swan, which are both 
at-risk in several states. Lists for birds in Alaska, Hawaii and 
Oregon were not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
	The lists, available on the Audubon Web site, are an offshoot of  
the Partners in Flight WatchList, which calls attention to birds 
before they require federal listing as threatened or endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
	Habitat loss and damage are the primary causes for decreasing  
bird populations. Pesticide use and feral cats also are a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have and early heads-up and early warning system, to  
identify birds in trouble, we can help eliminate the expensive, 
last-ditch efforts to protect these birds,'' Muehter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local governments, conservation groups and even concerned  
citizens can use the lists to make sure the birds don't become 
threatened or endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we can begin to think, `Here are the species that are  
beginning to show signs of trouble, can we design a policy or 
program that will help protect these species?''' said Dr. Charles 
Duncan, conservation ornithologist with the Nature Conservancy's 
Wings of the Americas program. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the data is already available, the Audubon Society has  
broken it down to make it easier to analyze and use on the local 
level, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to get more organizations and members of the general  
public involved in the effort to save these birds at the local 
level, Muehter said. 
</P>
<P>
	People can help by getting involved in Audubon's programs to  
count birds and identify habitats, or even cultivating a home 
garden or landscaping in a way to attract birds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But protecting the places where birds live is the key.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we're looking for a single place to best focus our energies  
and dollars the area will be toward habitat protection,'' Muehter 
said. ``It's the most efficient way to help WatchList birds.'' 
</P>

	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA and Deutsche Telekom AG have  
agreed on one of the biggest corporate marriages ever, a deal that 
would create the world's second-largest telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia accepted Deutsche Telecom's offer that valued the  
Italian company at about $82 billion at Wednesday's closing prices 
after receiving assurances that the new company would not fall 
under the control of the German government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that this will be the first step in the  
creation of Europe's first telecommunications powerhouse,'' Telecom 
Italia chief executive Franco Bernabe told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would create Europe's largest phone company -- one big  
enough to compete with overseas giants like AT&AMP;T Corp. of the 
United States and British Telecommunications PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies must now win over shareholders and regulatory  
authorities in the United States and the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom chief executive Ron Sommer said the partners  
were trying to create a truly pan-European company worthy of a new 
era symbolized by the euro, the common currency shared by 11 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our operation is very much in line with the integration  
process of Europe,'' he said at a joint news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined entity, which has not yet been given a name, would  
have revenues of $62.8 billion and an operating profit of $13.9 
billion, based on 1998 figures. It would have more than 100 million 
customers, mostly in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company would be run out of joint headquarters in  
Bonn and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, each share of Deutsche Telekom would be  
exchanged for three ordinary voting shares of Telecom Italia stock, 
valuing each share in the Italian company at $12.75 as of 
Wednesday's closing share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Telecom Italia's savings shares would be exchanged  
at a rate of 5.61 for each share of Deutsche Telekom. The deal also 
provides that the newly formed company will assume Telecom Italia's 
debts of approximately $8.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement would give Deutsche Telekom about 56 percent of  
the new company, with Telecom Italia controlling the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger agreement was prompted by Telecom Italia's effort to  
avoid a hostile takeover bid from its smaller Italian rival 
Olivetti SpA. Olivetti has offered $12.19 for each share of Telecom 
Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners expect the merger to save them more than $635  
million in the first year alone, with savings increasing in ensuing 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe and Sommer, who will be joint chief executives and  
chairmen, refused to say how many jobs would be cut if the merger 
is completed. The combined company would have 304,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our vision is a vision of growth. It is not a vision of  
job-cutting,'' Sommer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company would rank second in the world in terms of  
revenues after Japanese telecommunications giant NTT, which posted 
sales last year of $69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom had a market capitalization of about $105  
billion while Telecom Italia was worth about $67 billion, based on 
Wednesday's closing share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In value, the merger would rival the biggest merger to date --  
the pending deal between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., which was 
worth about $82 billion as of late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe and Sommer are pinning their hopes for global success on  
the growth potential for cellular phones and the Internet, and for 
expansion into new markets -- especially the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer refused to confirm whether Deutsche Telekom was planning  
a much-rumored takeover of Sprint Corp., the No. 3 U.S. 
long-distance phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe made it clear, however, that such a takeover bid was not  
impossible. ``The United States will be the next area of 
expansion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two formerly state-controlled companies struck their deal  
after the German government assured the Italian Treasury that it 
would not use its voting rights in Deutsche Telekom to dominate the 
merged business. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government owns about 72 percent of Deutsche Telekom,  
but that will drop to 66 percent when the company issues new shares 
this summer. The government's share would decrease to about 40 
percent under terms of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia.

<HEADLINE>  Bomb Found in High School Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two gunmen in the Columbine High  
massacre were planning to blow up their school and probably had 
help from others, investigators said Thursday after discovering a 
powerful bomb in the kitchen that had been built from a propane 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage, but they  
were going to destroy the school,'' Sheriff John Stone said. ``They 
were going to burn the school up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the 20-pound propane tank heightened suspicions  
that the two killers had help from other people, either with 
building the 32 bombs discovered so far in the school, its environs 
and the killers' homes, or getting them into the high school. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier report said there were two bombs in the kitchen, but  
investigators may have been misled because there was a gasoline can 
next to the one bomb, a sheriff's official said. Investigators 
still believed the gunmen may have had help. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a feeling from our investigators that the chances are  
very, very good that we have more than two people involved,'' 
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN reported that a note left by one of the gunmen was a suicide  
note that indicated the two teen-agers acted alone. ``This is the 
way we want to go out,'' the note said, according to CNN, which 
cited unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he had no details on a note that was found at one of  
the gunmen's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with sawed-off  
shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol and homemade bombs 
stuffed with nails and shotgun shells, killed 12 students and one 
teacher Tuesday before taking their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombs found Thursday used a propane tank similar to those on  
backyard barbecue grills. Nails and BBs had been taped to the tank 
to create shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty pounds of propane can create quite an extensive amount  
of damage,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas said: ``No one saw them carry it  
into the school and people did see them enter. So we have to 
explore how that device got into the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had already been looking into the possibility of  
additional suspects because of the amount of ammunition and 
explosives left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's drawing suspicion out here that they would have time to  
put as much ordnance in that school as they did without some 
help,'' the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people remained hospitalized, eight in critical or  
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, crews used bomb-sniffing dogs as they carefully  
picked through thousands of backpacks, briefcases and boxes strewn 
across the carpets, classrooms and hallways. Investigators are also 
working to trace the weapons to determine how the teen-agers got 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the heavily damaged school, officers began collecting  
hundreds of pieces of evidence, including carpet, fragments of 
windows, ceiling tiles and walls and shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very big crime scene and so much evidence to  
catalog, it will take days to collect it,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite intermittent, heavy snow, dozens of people left  
bouquets, stuffed animals, cards and balloons in the school colors 
of blue and silver at a makeshift memorial in a park near the 
school. The mementos were piled 2 feet deep by early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools in the  
district reopened Thursday amid tight security. Officers and school 
staff members plan ``sweeps'' and greater security at entrances and 
exits, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said proms and graduations will go on as scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's prom took place earlier this month, and graduation  
is scheduled for early May, though officials did not say whether 
that will go on as scheduled. Students will finish out the year at 
other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack inspired an apparent copycat act by teen-agers on  
Wednesday, although there were no weapons involved. Four teens were 
charged with trespassing in Colorado Springs after arriving at 
school in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	Trench coats like the ones worn by the two gunmen have been  
banned in Denver and two other Colorado districts since the attack 
for fear they could be used to hide weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said that Harris and Klebold were part of an outcast  
group called the Trenchcoat Mafia and that they wore black and 
spoke German to each other. They believe the gunmen timed the 
attack for Adolf Hitler's birthday.

<HEADLINE> Army Helicopter Crash Kills One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- A Black Hawk helicopter with 11 people  
aboard crashed today during a training mission at Fort Campbell. At 
least one person died, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there are some fatalities,'' said Col. John Smith, an  
Army spokesman at the Pentagon. He did not know how many. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in  
Nashville, Tenn., confirmed one crash victim dead at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others were in critical condition at Vanderbilt, spokesman  
Wayne Wood said. Others were being treated at Blanchfield Army 
Community Hospital at Fort Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	The UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crashed about 7 a.m. on the  
sprawling Army post, Capt. Truitt Cockrell said at Fort Campbell. 
He did not specify how many aboard were injured or died. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Hawk is a light transport helicopter that is the  
primary helicopter for air assault, air cavalry and aeromedical 
evacuations units. Each helicopter can transport an 11-man squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Campbell, headquarters for the 101st Airborne Division,  
straddles the Kentucky-Tennessee border about 200 miles southwest 
of Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1996, two Black Hawks collided in flight, killing six  
soldiers. A heavily-edited report the Army issued seven months 
after the crash said the air crews didn't coordinate well enough -- 
or warn each other that they had lost sight of the second 
helicopter -- to avoid the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	That crash was captured on videotape by a civilian.  
</P>
<P>
	Three months earlier, a MH-47E Chinook from Fort Campbell  
crashed in a western Kentucky field, killing five people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Reconstructing the Columbine Horror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDITORS' NOTE -- The following account reconstructs the Tuesday  
rampage at Columbine High School, where 15 people died. It is based	
on interviews with and material from authorities and students.	
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Her favorite lunchtime meal was ready --  
``my only meal,'' jokes Sarah DeBoer. So, nachos in hand, she 
headed toward the commons area of the Columbine High School 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a sunny Tuesday morning, maybe 60 degrees, only 17 school  
days before graduation, and a spring mentality was afoot -- the kind 
that says summer is on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, two disaffected young men knew something their  
classmates didn't. Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris had endgame in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. DeBoer, who knew the pair in passing, had talked to them  
Friday. True, they liked to bluster about guns and vengeance and 
Adolf Hitler. But they seemed -- for them, at least -- fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Upstairs in the school library, four dozen students were  
studying their way through the lunch period. Nearby, Dave Sanders, 
a popular instructor and coach, was teaching a class. Down the 
hall, Stephanie Williams, 16, a junior, was in the choir room 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at about 11:15 a.m., a sound from outside:  
pop-pop-pop-BANG. 
</P>
<P>
	In the cafeteria, they thought it was a lunchtime prank.  
Whatever it was, it was getting closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. DeBoer, a 16-year-old sophomore, hit the floor with her  
lunch companions. As realization washed over her, she uttered one 
thing. Whether it was aloud or just to herself, she doesn't quite 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that I'm going to die.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In moments of chaos and hours of confusion, memories can cloud.  
But, through myriad interviews and briefings, an intelligible if 
still imprecise portrait emerges of what unfolded behind a suburban 
school's pale brown walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Just after lunch period begins, two young men in black trench  
coats open fire in the parking lot. Senior Wade Frank, 18, outside 
in the parking lot next to a picnic area, hears popping sounds and 
sees a girl lying against a curb, shot in the leg. As he watches, 
another youth is shot in the back and falls forward. Then one 
gunman throws a bomb into the parking lot and heads inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just casually walking. He wasn't in any hurry,'' says  
Frank.` 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Denny Rowe, 15, is outside having lunch with friends.  
``These guys opened fire on everything that looked human,'' says 
Rowe. Bullets are bouncing everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``One boy was running and suddenly his ankle just puffed up in  
blood,'' says sophomore Don Arnold, 16. ``A girl was running and 
her head popped open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the gunmen walk into the school, two students lie dead  
outside. Still shooting, the two walk to the cafeteria, where food 
server Karen Nielsen hears someone yell, ``Get down!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, are heavily armed -- an assault  
rifle, sawed-off shotguns, handguns. In the cafeteria, one removes 
his trench coat to reveal home-made grenades. He tosses a pipe 
bomb. Gunshots echo. Students fall. One gets up to run and others 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Word spreads: The ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' has gone nuts. Many of  
the 900 students in the building duck into closets and bathrooms, 
under tables and chairs. A couple call 911 with cellular phones. 
Dozens flee the building and hide in brush around the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Nick Foss, 18, and a friend push two teachers, a cook and  
another woman into a bathroom. ``I heard people praying for their 
husbands and their children,'' says Foss. The attackers bang on 
doors, yelling: ``We know you're in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Brackley, 15, is in the gym when an administrator herds  
kids into the equipment room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit my knees and prayed,'' Ms. Brackley says. They stay for  
15 minutes before the administrator directs them outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Gardner, the Jefferson County sheriff's deputy assigned to  
the school full-time, hears shots and spots one of the gunmen in a 
first-floor hallway. He radios for backup and returns fire as 
bullets ricochet off lockers. Within minutes, seven officers arrive 
and begin pulling students, including a few shooting victims, from 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
	In the choir room, above the commons, Ms. Williams and her  
classmates hear the sounds. Someone comes to the door and, with a 
thumb-forefinger gesture, gives them a warning: gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Her teacher tells everyone to sit. But in moments, the school's  
two-level auditorium next door seems a safer place, so some go; 
then, after about 10 minutes, they run into the main hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group I was in headed straight for the door. He was  
shooting at us,'' Ms. Williams says. ``All we knew was to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they flee, a door behind them explodes in gunfire.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. DeBoer, separated from her friend who had run into the  
weight room, lies on the cafeteria floor until she hears a car 
explode outside. Then she runs into the auditorium and lies down 
between seats. 
</P>
<P>
	There she stays for some time. Fellow students -- 15, maybe 20 --  
cry softly. Teachers warn them to be silent. In the distance, they 
hear sharp reports and dull explosions. Finally, a janitor enters 
and tells them: Go! They run, and gunfire follows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned and I saw Dylan was the one who turned and shot at  
me,'' Sarah says. ``He didn't know it was me; we were just running 
out of the auditorium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen head upstairs toward the library.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``All jocks stand up! We're going to kill every one of you,''  
one gunman yells in the library. 
</P>
<P>
	Student Aaron Cohn, a ballplayer, is spared because a girl leaps  
onto his back while he lies on the floor, covering the baseball 
slogan on his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were laughing after they shot,'' Cohn says. ``It was like  
they were having the time of their life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students are slain at their desks, one with pencil still in  
hand. The gunmen play ``peek-a-boo'' with others, finding them 
cowering under desks and opening fire. Isaiah Shoels, who is black 
and has tangled with the gunmen before, is one of those to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Says one assailant: ``Oh, my God. Look at this black kid's  
brain. Awesome, man!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some kids play dead. By the time it is over, 12 aren't playing.  
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris leave behind shattered windows, bloody floors  
and a quiet unlike any the library has ever heard. Elsewhere 
upstairs, Sanders, the teacher, has been shot twice in the chest 
but manages to get students down a hallway away from danger. He 
stumbles into a science room, bleeding and coughing blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, the first SWAT team is on the scene 20 minutes after  
the first 911 calls, joining the sheriff's deputies. It finds 
several explosive devices around the school and treads cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had initial people there right away, but we couldn't get  
in,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone says. ``We were way 
outgunned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 minutes after the shooting begins, at noon, ambulances  
take the first wounded students -- the ones who managed to run 
outside -- to hospitals. Bomb teams, fire trucks, more SWAT units 
and paramedics arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Foss and other students manage to crawl into a space  
between the ceiling and acoustic tiles. Foss falls through a tile, 
crashing onto the floor of the teacher's lounge. He runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kammi Vest, 18, hides in the choir-room closet with up to 60  
other students. Others try to crawl through heating vents to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	In the science room, Sanders is dying. Students cover the  
47-year-old teacher with their shirts and a blanket and keep him 
talking. But his pulse slows and he grows cold. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots are heard until almost 12:30. About that time, in the  
library, Klebold and Harris turn their guns on themselves, though 
no one will be sure of this for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	As 12:30 passes, after no shots echo for several minutes, SWAT  
teams begin sweeping the building room by room. It is, quite 
literally, a minefield: Dropped backpacks are everywhere, each a 
potential bomb. In the coming days bombs will turn up in various 
shapes and sizes. They include one large bomb hidden in the 
school's kitchen and fashioned from a 20-pound propane tank.	   At about 2:30, SWAT teams begin freeing those in hiding. In 
small groups, hands behind their heads, they run from the school to 
a holding area. They are frisked, questioned, offered medical care 
and bused to Leawood Elementary School to be reunited with parents. 
</P>
<P>
	By now, the world is seeing it all on TV. Escaped students cling  
to each other. Tears flow freely for some; for others, it will take 
time. Even the tough guys, the ones with the backward baseball caps 
and the baggy camo pants, cry. 
</P>

	NATO Knocks Serb TV Off the Air  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO struck the headquarters of  
Serbia's most important television network early Friday, knocking 
it off the air. The alliance sent a missile into the side of 
Serbian state television's downtown headquarters that collapsed its 
top two floors, according to reporters on the scene. The official 
state Tanjug news agency said there were injuries inside the studio 
but gave no details. Ambulances rushed to the scene and reporters 
saw about a dozen injured taken away. NATO has long complained that 
Serbian television was a legitimate military target because it was 
spreading ``propaganda'' about the alliance air campaign.

	Kosovo To Dominate NATO Summit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders toned down this weekend's  
celebration of the alliance's 50th birthday and pledged their 
summit would focus on tougher steps -- possibly including ground 
troops -- to halt the bloodshed in Kosovo. With presidents and prime 
ministers of 19 NATO nations and 23 partner countries arriving in 
the capital, President Clinton declared: ``Our alliance is strongly 
united today.'' Clinton also reacted cautiously to a pre-summit 
overture from Belgrade. Former Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin said Milosevic had accepted the idea of a 
U.N.-controlled ``international presence'' in Kosovo. It was 
unclear whether such a force would be armed.

	Bomb Found in High School Kitchen  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The discovery of a 20-pound propane tank  
in the Columbine High School kitchen heightened suspicions that the 
two killers in Tuesday's massacre had help from other people. 
Authorities said Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, were 
planning to blow up their school. Also today, Jefferson County 
District Court released a report written less than three months ago 
as part of a juvenile-court program that assessed Klebold and 
Harris. It said: Dylan Klebold was ``a bright young man who has a 
great deal of potential.'' Eric Harris was ``intelligent enough to 
achieve lofty goals.'' The two were caught breaking into a van last 
year and were allowed to complete a diversion program to clear 
their records.

	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- An Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed  
at Fort Campbell, killing seven people and injuring the other four 
aboard. The UH-60L helicopter, used primarily for air assault, air 
cavalry and medical evacuation units, went down in a rural training 
area about 7 a.m., the Army said. No cause was given for the crash. 
The soldiers were practicing getting either on or off the 
helicopter when it crashed, probably from a fairly low height.

	U.S. To Keep Sample of Smallpox  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerns that a new smallpox vaccine might be  
needed to combat a future terrorist threat led President Clinton to 
reject appeals from scores of nations to destroy one of the last 
caches of the deadly virus. The United States and Russia are the 
only two nations with known smallpox stocks, but the administration 
fears the virus could have fallen into other hands, raising the 
threat of bioterrorism. Smallpox is highly contagious and kills 
about 20 percent of those afflicted.

lake -- a discovery researchers say provides a new candidate for the 
earliest human ancestor and also the earliest known use of tools to 
cut food. The researchers named the new hominid species ``garhi,''

<HEADLINE> Pilot's Lawyer Argues Against Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Attorneys for a Marine pilot whose jet  
clipped an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people, argued 
Thursday for dismissal of charges alleging he destroyed a videotape 
shot during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby did not intend to obstruct justice, but to  
protect himself out of fear that Italians' hostility over the crash 
put his life in jeopardy, Ashby's attorney, Maj. Bill Weber, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Squadron members were so afraid for their safety because of  
the hatred that they took their names off the hootches because they 
were afraid that Capt. Ashby would be killed and they would get 
caught in a crossfire,'' Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, who was acquitted by a court-martial jury of manslaughter  
charges, still faces obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Weber asked the judge to order prosecutors to prove there was an  
actual criminal investigation after the accident and that Ashby's 
actions obstructed it. The judge was expected to rule on the 
motions Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Weber also argued that if the case goes to trial, Ashby's fellow  
crew members should be ordered to testify in person. A Marine air 
group commander said it would be difficult to summon the air crew 
members, now flying sorties over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very heavily tasked over there right now,'' said Col.  
Mitchell Triplett, commander of Marine Air Group 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's EA-6B Prowler clipped the gondola cable as the jet  
streaked through an Italian mountain valley on Feb. 3, 1998. The 
gondola plummeted 370 feet into the valley, killing everyone 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., pleaded guilty to the obstruction charges Ashby now faces, 
and a judge recommended his dismissal from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the jet hit the cable, Schweitzer shot the mountain  
scenery with a video camera, according to earlier testimony. Ashby, 
32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., said he gave the video to Schweitzer, 
who said he threw the tape in a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Ashby faces dismissal from the Marines or up to 10  
years in prison.

<HEADLINE> New Madrid Fault Isn't Threatening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of major new earthquakes on the New  
Madrid fault along the Mississippi River has been overestimated, 
according to researchers studying the source of devastating tremors 
nearly two centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of great quakes in 1811-12, centered near New Madrid,  
Mo., shook the region from present day St. Louis to Memphis, Tenn., 
and beyond, reportedly causing the Mississippi to run backward for 
a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor tremors continue to occur and scientists have been  
concerned that a repeat of the powerful earlier quakes could cause 
devastation in the modern cities that have grown in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	But that threat may not be as bad as thought, according to a  
report in Friday's issue of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly gathered data ``imply that 1811-1812-size earthquakes are  
either much smaller or far less frequent than previously assumed,'' 
reports the team of scientists led by Seth Stein of Northwestern 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``In either case, it seems that the hazard from great  
earthquakes in the New Madrid zone has been significantly 
overestimated,'' the study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, scientists have estimated the magnitude of the  
1811-12 quakes at 8, with 5 to 10 yards of horizontal ground 
movement at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein's team used both satellite and ground-based measurements  
to check current movement along the New Madrid fault, and 
calculated it to be between zero and 2 millimeters per year. Two 
millimeters is bit less than a tenth of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
	Geological motions are very constant over time, Stein explained  
in a telephone interview. The very low motion along the fault, he 
said, indicates as much as a 14,000-year period between magnitude 8 
quakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most plausible interpretation of our data is that the  
(1811-12) quakes were probably magnitude 7 instead of 8. That's the 
simplest explanation and what we think is most likely,'' said 
Stein, whose research was supported financially by the university 
consortium UNAVCO. 
</P>
<P>
	A magnitude 8 quake, capable of tremendous damage, is 10 times  
more powerful than a 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Stein noted that quakes in the eastern part of the United States  
are felt over larger areas than western ones because of the more 
rigid rock in the East. That may have led to overestimation of the 
early quakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the conclusions were challenged by Arch Johnston, a  
seismologist at the University of Memphis and expert on the New 
Madrid fault, who contended that the Northwestern team understated 
the uncertainty in their measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	Actual movement along the plate could be as much as 10  
millimeters a year, Johnston said, which would indicate a major 
quake could occur every 400 to 600 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very certain about our uncertainty,'' responded Andrew  
Newman, a graduate student who was part of Stein's team. He said 
the 2 millimeter movement estimate is ``at the 95 percent 
confidence level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We disagree with Arch,'' added Stein.  
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also asserted that because the danger has been  
overestimated, changes should be considered in the National Seismic 
Hazard Maps for the New Madrid area. 
</P>
<P>
	That suggestion is ``premature and actually irresponsible,''  
Johnston contended, noting that the seismic hazard maps are used 
when building codes are being developed to set safe construction 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stein stood by his calculations, contending the danger  
ratings of current seismic hazard maps seem very unlikely in light 
of current understanding.

<HEADLINE>  Muhammad Ali Backs Boxing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He uttered not a word, but Muhammad Ali's  
presence at a Senate hearing Thursday spoke volumes about the state 
of professional boxing and lent support to Sen. John McCain's 
efforts to clean up the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion, who suffers from Parkinson's  
syndrome and has trouble speaking, told the Senate Commerce 
Committee through longtime friend Howard Bingham that the Lennox 
Lewis-Evander Holyfield heavyweight draw in New York last month was 
the ``lowest point'' for a sport beset with problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ali has become increasingly upset about the scandals that have  
occurred in professional boxing,'' Bingham said as Ali gazed 
intently at committee members from a witness table. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali is particularly interested in the parts of McCain's boxing  
reform bill that would stop exploitation of boxers by promoters. 
One provision would prohibit ``coercive option'' contracts that 
prevent fighters from controlling their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona Republican and 2000 presidential aspirant,  
told Ali: ``Your support of this legislation is absolutely vital to 
our chances of passing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the disputed fight, the three judges scored it a draw even  
though most boxing observers believe Lewis clearly had beaten the 
champion. The fight is under investigation by the Manhattan 
district attorney's office and the New York state Athletic 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill would establish new standards for sanctioning  
organizations that rank fighters; create new financial disclosure 
requirements for promoters and event organizers; and require that 
state boxing commissions be informed when charges, costs and fees 
are taken from a boxer's purse. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who attended the Lewis-Holyfield fight, said the sport  
has too few ethical boundaries and a ranking system, controlled by 
promoters, that ``defies all reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When honest and open competition is inhibited, it is the  
boxers who suffer most,'' McCain said. ``But millions of 
ticket-buying fans in America are also hurt by monopolistic 
practices in boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former boxing referee Mills Lane, a retired Nevada judge who now  
has his TV court show, said boxing's credibility suffers because 
sanctioning bodies -- the IBF, WBA and WBC -- play too large a role 
in which judges and referees work the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subtle pressures are there and nobody can tell me  
they're not,'' Lane told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walter Stone, counsel to the International Boxing  
Federation, said fight organizers are working to address the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a new IBF rule says the No. 1 ranking cannot simply  
be taken over by a boxer who moves up just because of losses by 
fighters rated ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., expressed concern the McCain bill might  
unfairly target certain promoters and invite legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bill must address multiyear broadcast contracts in  
which contenders stay under a network's control in return for a 
shot at the champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question when it comes to revenues, the broadcast  
industry packs the biggest wallop,'' said Reid, whose state is the 
site for many championship fights. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is likely to move the bill through the Commerce Committee  
later this year. An identical measure last year passed the Senate 
but went nowhere in the House.

<HEADLINE> Technology Advances Key to Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, R.I. (AP) -- In the increasingly high-tech sport of  
America's Cup sailing, the brainpower of techno-geeks may be more 
important than the derring-do of sailors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a sailboat race. It is a technology battle between  
nations,'' said boat builder Eric Goetz, who is working on the New 
York Yacht Club's boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetz and other members of the yacht club's Young America  
syndicate discussed their progress during a news conference 
Thursday here at the Hall Spars warehouse, where the group's masts 
are being designed. 
</P>
<P>
	The syndicate is pinning its hopes on technological advances as  
it prepares for the America's Cup in 2000. It is spending $40 
million and has assembled leading experts in hull, keel, mast and 
sail design. 
</P>
<P>
	A chart listing the various experts working on the Young America  
boats reads like a design team for a NASA rocket, with individuals 
assigned to ``experimental analysis,'' ``velocity prediction'' and 
``computational fluid dynamics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the team tested its experimental boat designs at  
the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Bethesda, Md., where the Navy 
tests its vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the technology is secret, and photographers were not  
allowed to enter a portion of the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	All the boat experts assembled said the 2000 boats will  
represent a giant bound forward in technology and design. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been astounded by the developments,'' said Goetz, who  
has worked on eight America's Cup boats. 
</P>
<P>
	If Young America qualifies to race against New Zealand and wins,  
it would bring the Cup races back to Newport, where they were held 
for 132 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yacht Club, which has racing headquarters in  
Newport, lost the Cup to Australia 16 years ago, ending its 
132-year domination of sailing's most prestigious event. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Conner and the San Diego Yacht Club brought the Cup back  
to the United States by beating Australia. The Cup remained in San 
Diego until 1995, when New Zealand took it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is to win for America,'' said Marshall, who  
believes Young America has a big head start over many other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The syndicate includes yacht clubs in Portland, Maine;  
Annapolis, Md.; St. Petersburg, Fla.; Chicago; Detroit and Fort 
Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, a series of challenge races will begin to determine  
which team will face New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Young America will face 14 teams from 10 countries, including  
entries from Hong Kong, Switzerland, Australia, Spain, Japan, 
England, Russia, France and Italy. San Diego and San Francisco also 
are competing.

<HEADLINE>  Bomb Found in High School Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two gunmen in the Columbine High  
massacre were planning to blow up their school and probably had 
help from others, investigators said Thursday after discovering a 
powerful bomb in the kitchen that had been built from a propane 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage, but they  
were going to destroy the school,'' Sheriff John Stone said. ``They 
were going to burn the school up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the 20-pound propane tank heightened suspicions  
that the two killers had help from other people, either with 
building the 32 bombs discovered so far in the school, its environs 
and the killers' homes, or getting them into the high school. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier report said there were two bombs in the kitchen, but  
investigators may have been misled because there was a gasoline can 
next to the one bomb, a sheriff's official said. Investigators 
still believed the gunmen may have had help. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a feeling from our investigators that the chances are  
very, very good that we have more than two people involved,'' 
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN reported that a note left by one of the gunmen was a suicide  
note that indicated the two teen-agers acted alone. ``This is the 
way we want to go out,'' the note said, according to CNN, which 
cited unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he had no details on a note that was found at one of  
the gunmen's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with sawed-off  
shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol and homemade bombs 
stuffed with nails and shotgun shells, killed 12 students and one 
teacher Tuesday before taking their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombs found Thursday used a propane tank similar to those on  
backyard barbecue grills. Nails and BBs had been taped to the tank 
to create shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty pounds of propane can create quite an extensive amount  
of damage,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas said: ``No one saw them carry it  
into the school and people did see them enter. So we have to 
explore how that device got into the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had already been looking into the possibility of  
additional suspects because of the amount of ammunition and 
explosives left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's drawing suspicion out here that they would have time to  
put as much ordnance in that school as they did without some 
help,'' the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people remained hospitalized, eight in critical or  
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, crews used bomb-sniffing dogs as they carefully  
picked through thousands of backpacks, briefcases and boxes strewn 
across the carpets, classrooms and hallways. Investigators are also 
working to trace the weapons to determine how the teen-agers got 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the heavily damaged school, officers began collecting  
hundreds of pieces of evidence, including carpet, fragments of 
windows, ceiling tiles and walls and shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very big crime scene and so much evidence to  
catalog, it will take days to collect it,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite intermittent, heavy snow, dozens of people left  
bouquets, stuffed animals, cards and balloons in the school colors 
of blue and silver at a makeshift memorial in a park near the 
school. The mementos were piled 2 feet deep by early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools in the  
district reopened Thursday amid tight security. Officers and school 
staff members plan ``sweeps'' and greater security at entrances and 
exits, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said proms and graduations will go on as scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's prom took place earlier this month, and graduation  
is scheduled for early May, though officials did not say whether 
that will go on as scheduled. Students will finish out the year at 
other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack inspired an apparent copycat act by teen-agers on  
Wednesday, although there were no weapons involved. Four teens were 
charged with trespassing in Colorado Springs after arriving at 
school in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	Trench coats like the ones worn by the two gunmen have been  
banned in Denver and two other Colorado districts since the attack 
for fear they could be used to hide weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said that Harris and Klebold were part of an outcast  
group called the Trenchcoat Mafia and that they wore black and 
spoke German to each other. They believe the gunmen timed the 
attack for Adolf Hitler's birthday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominates Military Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton nominated Lt. Gen. James  
Jones to be commandant of the Marine Corps and Gen. Eric Shinseki 
to be chief of staff of the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	If confirmed by Congress, Jones would be promoted to four-star  
rank and replace the retiring Gen. Charles Krulak on June 30. 
Shinseki, already with four stars, would take over for Gen. Dennis 
Reimer on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Krulak and Reimer will have completed their appointed four  
years as chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 55, is a decorated Vietnam veteran who has been Defense  
Secretary William Cohen's senior military assistant since Cohen 
took office in early 1997. Widely respected in the Marines, he 
became friends with Cohen while serving in the Marine Corps office 
of legislative affairs and Cohen was a Republican member of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is a native of Kansas City, Mo., but spent his formative  
years in France. He returned to the United States to attend the 
Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, where he received 
a bachelor of science degree in 1966. He was commissioned a second 
lieutenant in the Marines in January 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his decorations: the Silver Star Medal and a Bronze Star  
Medal with combat ``V'' for valor. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki, a 33-year Army veteran, is the vice chief of staff,  
the No. 2 position in the Army. His career includes 10 years in 
Europe, including a stint as commanding general of U.S. Army-Europe 
in 1997-98 while also commanded the NATO-led peacekeeping force in 
Bosnia until last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki, 56, was born in Lihue on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.  
A graduate of West Point, he also holds a master's degree in 
English literature from Duke University. Among his military 
decorations: a Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' for valor and two oak 
leaf clusters, and a Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
	As chiefs of the Marines and Army, Jones and Shinseki would be  
members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The other members are Air 
Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan, Chief of Naval Operations 
Adm. Jay Johnson, and the joint chiefs chairman, Gen. Henry Shelton 
of the Army.

<HEADLINE> Mary Rockefeller Dies at 91 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mary Clark Rockefeller, a prominent figure in  
the education of nurses and the former first lady of New York 
state, died at her Manhattan home. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rockefeller, the former Mary Todhunter Clark, died  
Wednesday. She married the future governor of New York, Nelson A. 
Rockefeller, in 1930 and went on to several volunteer posts in the 
field of nurses' education. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, the New York County Registered Nurses honored her for  
``27 years of outstanding achievement on behalf of the nursing 
profession and the health care of the American people.'' Twelve 
years later, she was given a distinguished service award for work 
on the National League of Nursing's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the 1950s, Mrs. Rockefeller also served on the Defense  
Advisory Committee on Women in the Services and the National 
Advisory Health Council. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Mrs. Rockefeller was perhaps best known as the wife of  
the former governor. The couple separated in 1961 and divorced the 
following year, following Rockefeller's successful 1958 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Their divorce, and Rockefeller's remarriage in 1963, is thought  
by many political commentators to have weakened the governor's 
chances at winning the Republican presidential nomination in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller, who served as governor until 1973 and was vice  
president from 1974 to 1977 under Gerald Ford, also failed in 1960 
and 1968 bids for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rockefeller, described as witty and intelligent by John D.  
Rockefeller biographer Ron Chernow, was raised in Bala-Cynwd, Pa., 
and studied at Foxcroft in Middleburg, Va., and the Sorbonne in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by two sons, two daughters, 15 grandchildren, 23  
great-grandchildren and two brothers.

<HEADLINE> Advice on How To Curb Kid's Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Turf battles and cliques are common  
enough in America's high schools. So are teen-agers who rebel 
through the clothes they wear or hobbies they choose, whether 
collecting World War II weapons or playing Dungeons and Dragons 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Telling the difference between teen-age angst and deadly intent  
can seem impossible. But counselors, educators and students have a 
common message on how to try. 
</P>
<P>
	``You must pay attention,'' said Margaret Walsh, principal at  
Minnie Howard School in this Washington suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	When a 14-year-old ninth-grader spent a lot of time thumbing  
through the military weapons catalog he brought to school each day, 
Walsh wasted no time in taking him aside to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to know the kid. We didn't accuse him,'' said Walsh,  
and the boy went on to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who survived the deadly attack at Columbine High School  
in Littleton, Colo., this week say the ignored rage of a dozen 
outcast students led to the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no single answer,'' said Doug Robinson, program  
director of the Center for the Prevention of School Violence, in 
Raleigh, N.C. ``You've got to look at all the warning signs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Minnie Howard school, guidance counselors work with teachers  
to watch for signs of trouble: mood swings, changes in dress, new 
groups of friends, skipping school, failing classes, unusual 
interests, signs of abuse, or hatred of another group. 
</P>
<P>
	A student's record speaks volumes about potential problems, says  
Kenneth Firling, the head counselor at the 750-student school: A's 
turn into D's; he's dropped band after three years; she was absent 
40 days one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet you nickels to doughnuts if I'm having problems with  
a student, I can go back and see where he got suspended in Mrs. 
Williams' second-grade class,'' Firling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore is going further, ordering local  
school superintendents to report gang activity and potentially 
dangerous students to local police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Evansville, Ind., school board last June started requiring  
students to report acts or threats of violence by classmates or 
face suspension, expulsion or even jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Granite City, Ill., schools keep profiles on potentially  
violent students. This week they began considering a ban on capes 
and trench coats, clothing worn by the two shooters in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The angriest children are not necessarily the loudest, said  
Helen Smith, a forensic psychologist who works with violent 
juveniles in Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you see a kid who is quiet and withdrawn, but has a bad  
temper ... they are the ones who could blow more easily,'' Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firling, a counselor for 30 years, says it is wrong to assume  
children who seem strange are the most troubled. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always been an avant-garde crowd ... torn jeans, all  
kinds of beads, now they're coloring their hair with Jello,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Saenza, president of the National Mental Health  
Association, said violence could be avoided if schools had time to 
assess children, a place to refer them and adequate health coverage 
to offer. In most places, counselors are stretched thin. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes students are the first to see the signs.  
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, a 16-year-old junior at Columbine who had shared a  
computer lab with one suspect, Eric Harris, said Harris made his 
own video at school in which he bragged about some new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Busse, a former school official in Le Sueur, Minn., owes  
her life to heeding student warnings. Last school year, she called 
police after hearing that a 16-year-old junior planned to bring an 
assault rifle and 130 rounds of ammunition to Le Sueur-Henderson 
High school. He had a list of victims; Busse was among them. The 
student, tried as an adult, is serving 13 years in prison for 
shooting the police officer who cornered him in a restroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we didn't have any specifics, we put a plan into  
place,'' said Busse, now a special education official in New Ulm, 
Minn. ``If we expect students to end their code of silence, we need 
to give them our time and our attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many schools use an anonymous tip service, where students can  
phone in, or drop in a secured box any tip, such as a student with 
a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Adults also need to listen to students, especially when they say  
``something big is going to happen,'' says Myrna Shure, 
developmental psychology professor for 30 years at MCP-Hahnemann 
University in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just saying to a child `It's safe to talk to me' is very  
critical,'' Shure said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons says he'll go on  
preaching, though now he'll do it behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the church leader who prosecutors say traded the Good  
Book for a bank book serves a sentence for theft and racketeering, 
the National Baptist Convention USA that he once headed struggles 
to find a new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to work on healing our hurts and unify ourselves,''  
said the Rev. Harry Blake, a Shreveport, La., pastor who wants to 
succeed Lyons as president of the nation's largest black 
denomination. For Blake, who is one of eight candidates, the 
challenge is to move forward without looking back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not campaigning against Henry Lyons; I'm campaigning for  
Harry Blake. I'm campaigning on a message of hope,'' said Blake. 
``With hope, you forget the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 27, Lyons was convicted in state court of racketeering  
and grand theft for fleecing $4 million from companies trying to 
tap into the lucrative convention membership and for pocketing 
thousands of dollars entrusted to him for rebuilding burned 
churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, Lyons went into federal court and admitted  
fraud and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life now starts a new chapter,'' he said after resigning to  
begin serving a 5 1/2-year prison sentence at the Marion Correctional 
Institution in Ocala. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Mamiya, a professor of religion and African studies at  
Vassar College, said many were disillusioned by Lyons' criminal, 
personal and adulterous misdeeds, which he denied right up to the 
time of his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a shock,'' said Mamiya, an authority on black  
Protestants. ``... The convention will be divided for a while, but 
a kind of regional division.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At its annual meeting in September, Mamiya expects moves to  
unify the convention and overcome the taint. 
</P>
<P>
	For a candidate to become Lyons' successor, Mamiya said, he  
must: 
</P>
<P>
	--Show an unblemished moral character without a hint of any kind  
of scandal; and 
</P>
<P>
	--Cut into the powerful Southern base, winning pastors from the  
South to his side. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of this will have to be hashed out on the floor of the  
convention and behind the scenes,'' Mamiya said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all so different for Lyons in 1994, when he became  
president of the convention, realizing his lifelong dream. At age 
11, he said, his pastor told him he would hold the job one day. As 
a pastor himself, Lyons traveled from city to city preaching in 
revival tents, rural churches and urban centers, building support. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, he took the helm of the organization. Then he traded it  
all away. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, things began to unravel for Lyons after his wife set  
fire to a home he co-owned with another woman. The blaze did minor 
damage. But it ignited the state and federal probes of her husband, 
and of two female convention officials who pleaded guilty to 
federal charges in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	For two years Lyons steadfastly denied swindling companies and  
using the money to finance a lavish lifestyle of mistresses, luxury 
cars, high-style homes and expensive jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	Six jurors said otherwise.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel God has a purpose for me,'' the 57-year-old minister  
said last month after admitting to a federal judge that he failed 
to pay taxes on $1.3 million in income, defrauded a bank and made 
false statements to a financial institution and federal housing 
officials. He also said he would continue to preach, even in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal with prosecutors, Lyons pleaded guilty to five  
charges. Forty-nine other counts were dismissed, including 
extortion, money laundering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the federal agreement, Lyons forfeited his assets --  
except the house he shared with his wife. He must repay victims and 
pay the Internal Revenue Service taxes, interest and penalties for 
failing to report taxable income in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	While his demeanor in court was composed and resigned, his lips  
quivered and he choked back tears when announcing his resignation 
as convention president. 
</P>
<P>
	Leadership passed to the Rev. S.C. Cureton of Mauldin, S.C., who  
under convention bylaws will finish Lyons' term. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know our convention needs much healing,'' Cureton, 68, said  
outside Tampa's Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church, where Lyons 
served as pastor for 27 years. It was there that convention board 
members met in emergency session to discuss Lyons' status following 
his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	A few leaders said privately they want to reduce the power of  
the president, who until now has conducted convention business with 
little accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our credibility is shot,'' read a statement circulated to  
board members by the Rev. Warren H. Stewart Sr. of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. E.V. Hill of Los Angeles emerged as heir apparent after  
board members gave him a vote of confidence for the fall election. 
</P>
<P>
	Accepting Lyons' resignation, the convention board voted to  
continue his $100,000 a year salary for five years to aid his 
family, but Lyons said it was too much and the issue went to the 
finance committee for further study. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lyons acknowledged his failings. ``The things that  
tempted Christ -- fame, power, wealth -- those things tempted me,'' 
he said. ``He stood up to the test. I didn't. And for that I must 
take what's coming to me.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Makes $58B Bid For MediaOne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a deal that would make the nation's largest  
telecommunications company also its No. 1 cable TV operator, AT&AMP;T 
Corp. offered $58 billion Thursday for MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	In attempting to buy the nation's fourth-largest cable  
television company, AT&AMP;T aims to thwart a merger agreement that the 
No. 3 cable operator, Comcast Corp., and MediaOne reached two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said its rival bid, a combination of cash and stock,  
exceeded the value of the Comcast deal by 17 percent. The offer is 
26 percent above MediaOne's current market value, AT&AMP;T said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which completed its acquisition of cable company  
Tele-Communications Inc. last month, now has 12.5 million cable 
subscribers. MediaOne has 5 million. Time Warner, currently the 
largest, has 12.6 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a surprise,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent  
industry analyst in Atlanta. ``Since AT&AMP;T decided that cable was 
the pathway of choice in the home, they need as much cable as they 
can get their hands on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the kind of gutsy move that AT&AMP;T needed to make to  
prepare for the competition of the future,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne is a spin-off of the U S West regional phone company,  
which decided in late 1997 to get out of the cable TV business. 
AT&AMP;T said the deal would expand its cable TV coverage in several 
key cities including Boston, Atlanta, Richmond, Va., and Los 
Angeles, giving it entry into 18 of the top 20 U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has been in the market for cable TV companies because it  
plans to use the cable systems to deliver a combination of local 
and long-distance phone service, high-speed Internet access and 
interactive entertainment to millions of U.S. homes. Other cable 
companies have been merging to make them more competitive in 
offering the same package. 
</P>
<P>
	If AT&AMP;T's bid succeeds, it would reach more than 40 percent of  
U.S. cable households, estimated Gary Arlen, president of Arlen 
Communications Inc. in Bethesda, Md. ``It's a deal that could 
transform the telecom industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That estimate includes cable companies that AT&AMP;T would own  
outright, along with partial ownerships and joint ventures. Most 
importantly, MediaOne owns 25 percent of Time Warner Entertainment, 
which controls Time Warner's cable business. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of AT&AMP;T's strategy is to break into the lucrative local  
phone business by offering that service via cable TV lines. The 
company has sought to offer local service by leasing telephone 
lines from the regional Baby Bells, but has stumbled in those 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Fowler, a spokeswoman for Denver-based MediaOne, said the  
AT&AMP;T proposal is under review and ``We have nothing to add at this 
time.'' Comcast, based in Philadelphia, had no immediate response 
to the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael Armstrong said in a statement,  
``Americans have been waiting for someone to run another wire to 
their homes to give them a choice in local phone service and 
deliver the advanced services they expect in a competitive 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will give far more American consumers a choice among  
local phone companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said in a conference call with reporters that the deal  
will also diversify AT&AMP;T's businesses. Consumer long-distance, 
which currently represents 45 percent to 50 percent of revenues 
would fall to about 15 percent in the next four to five years, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T officials said they do not expect the deal to have any  
problems meeting regulatory approval and analysts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	The counteroffer was made by Armstrong in a letter Thursday to  
Charles Lillis, chairman and chief executive of MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said the deal would save it $175 million to $200 million in  
the first year of operations. While there will be some work force 
reductions, AT&AMP;T officials wouldn't specify their scope. 
</P>
<P>
	The company acknowledged the cost of the deal would cut its  
profits by about 30 cents per share in the first full year after 
completion, but it said profits would rise after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the profit reduction would be due to the issuance of an  
additional 626 million shares to help pay for the deal, along with 
the cost of borrowing money. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T earned $6.4 billion, or $2.38 per share in 1998, on revenue  
of $53.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has structured the deal so that if its share price drops as  
much as 10 percent, the amount paid MediaOne shareholders would not 
decline. That could cost AT&AMP;T as much as $3.5 billion more, 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T would also assume $4.5 billion in MediaOne debt and other  
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T announced its rival bid after the close of financial  
markets Thursday. Shares of AT&AMP;T fell 25 cents to $56.75 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, and dropped further to $55 in after-hours 
trading. Investors, which bid MediaOne up $2.56 1/4 to $69.50 in 
regular trading on the NYSE, pushed the stock up to $79.25 in 
after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Comcast rose to $2.56 1/4 to $67.62 1/2 in regular trading  
on the Nasdaq Stock Market, then rose to $71 in after-hours 
trading.

<HEADLINE> NATO Anniversary Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``I saw his hair!'' Robert Denning, a high  
schooler from Connecticut, said after he saw President Clinton's 
motorcade speed toward the White House for a meeting with NATO 
Secretary General Javier Solana. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was awesome,'' said his classmate, Nick Ogden.  
</P>
<P>
	As tourist attractions go, shiny black limousines had it all  
over museums on Thursday as the capital gussied up to welcome world 
leaders for NATO's 50th anniversary. All day long, motorcades 
ferried dignitaries from more than 40 countries from airports to 
hotels to meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	When Denning and his friends from Country Day School in  
Greenwich, Conn., heard that Clinton's motorcade was near, they 
took their chances. Instead of heading to another museum, they 
waited on a sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, they had seen a three-car VIP caravan. So  
when policemen on motorcycles, their sirens blaring, rounded a 
street corner, the students figured it was just another NATO 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never thought the president would come,'' Denning said.  
``That was so cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign dignitaries -- arriving for the summit in half-hour  
intervals at nearby Andrews Air Force Base -- were greeted in a 
succession of modest, makeshift welcome ceremonies on the tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the number of arrivals, official greeters were kept  
to a minimum. David Pryor Jr., the deputy chief of protocol, and 
Col. Rob Taylor, the director of protocol, helped shepherd the 
various leaders from a short receiving line, down a red carpet and 
into their respective motorcades for the trip to downtown 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's blue-and-white flag was prominently displayed at the  
Alamo Flags store down the street from where world leaders are 
staging their 50th anniversary summit. Price: $49.95. There were 
few takers. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-age shoppers were more interested in Confederate flags,  
often a symbol of rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad,'' said manager Mohammad Ismail.  
</P>
<P>
	A NATO organizing group snatched up all 144 tiny NATO flags in  
stock, he said, and he has sold a few of the larger ones during the 
past week or so. But even with thousands of dignitaries and members 
of the media in town for the summit, the large NATO banners aren't 
exactly flying out the door. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here for nine years and I haven't sold one in five  
years,'' Ismail said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Tight security for the NATO summit will force Hien Nguyen to  
close his T-shirt stand near the White House for three days. 
Blocked streets, no traffic. No traffic, no sales. No sales, no 
reason to arrange for the production of NATO souvenir shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we wanted them, it's too late to order them,'' Nguyen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That hasn't prevented Nguyen and other vendors along the street  
from spending spare time thinking up T-shirt slogans for NATO 
memorabilia they won't be selling. 
</P>
<P>
	A shirt that says: ``Milosevic the Martyr'' for Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic comes to mind, says Sadiq Safi, a 
Washington vendor for more than a decade. But he tactfully 
dismisses that idea for more diplomatic ones: ``The war is for 
peace in the region'' and ``Join the NATO for the stability and 
peace of the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's on a roll. Drawing an imaginary circle on his tummy, Safi  
envisions a ring of flags from all 19 NATO countries and the 
message: ``NATO Keep the Peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting NATO foreign leaders will get white-gloved treatment --  
right down to the people who help them get out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Six to eight members of military honor guards will be on hand  
every day to open the doors of limousines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We use military door openers for the motorcades. They wear  
white gloves and they're trained,'' explained Maj. Craig Greene, 
who is helping plan ceremonies for the NATO anniversary gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained to open car doors?  
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, the job is not as easy as it looks.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are security locks on the doors and so you have to be  
trained on how to open the doors,'' Greene said. ``It can be an 
awkward moment getting a leader out of the car.''

<HEADLINE> Youth Smoking Prevention Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In their pursuit of billion-dollar settlements with the tobacco  
industry, states repeatedly used one of their most powerful 
weapons: children. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys general and legislators accused Big Tobacco of  
marketing to teens. Scientists testified that the younger a person 
begins smoking, the harder it is to quit. Anti-tobacco forces used 
images of children lighting up in commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that the states have won the settlements and money is  
beginning to pour in, some legislators are asking a controversial 
question: Are anti-smoking programs aimed at youth such a wise 
investment? 
</P>
<P>
	Key lawmakers in Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Texas and  
Washington state want to either reduce spending on youth-related 
tobacco programs or keep tight purse strings on any new ones. 
They're unconvinced, they say, that education programs and 
advertising have any effect on young smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never looked behind the numbers. We don't know for sure  
that kids can be convinced,'' said Texas state Sen. Bill Ratliff, 
head of the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Legislature is debating two plans -- one that would  
have $10 million to $20 million of the $1.8 billion Texas will get 
over the next two years go toward anti-smoking programs, and 
another that would allot $40 million to $50 million. Ratliff said 
the settlement money should go toward health matters, not into the 
general revenue pot, but he is skeptical of the effectiveness of 
smoking prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate is intense in Massachusetts and Florida, whose youth  
programs that are regularly held up as national models for reducing 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida lawmakers agreed this week to reduce the $70 million  
budget of the state's year-old ``Truth'' advertising campaign, 
credited with drastically reducing teen smoking, to $45 million. 
Lawmakers noted that $11 million went unspent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush and the Senate had proposed spending about $61  
million for the program, while the House wanted to reduce it to $30 
million -- after initially balking at giving anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Debby Sanderson said that the program shouldn't be  
eliminated but that she isn't sure how effective it is. And, she 
said, the ads are in questionable taste: One features a flabby man 
in a bikini, smoking. Another shows a tobacco executive in hell. 
</P>
<P>
	She said there are other health-related programs that need  
money, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci came under fire earlier this  
year when he proposed adding no settlement money to the state's 
tobacco control program budget except for $500,000 to study whether 
it works. He also proposed diverting $4 million in cigarette tax 
revenue from smoking prevention to a program that has firefighters 
give safety lessons in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-tobacco advocates said lawmakers are questioning the  
effectiveness of these prevention programs to justify diverting 
tobacco dollars to their pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's simply impossible to study the existing data and conclude  
that well-run programs don't work,'' said Matthew Myers of the 
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minnesota, $202 million of the $6.1 billion settlement is  
earmarked for prevention, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield is kicking 
in $350 million. House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty said the 
settlement money should instead go toward health-related tax relief 
until there's proof that the prevention programs work. 
</P>
<P>
	Key fiscal leaders in Washington state agree. While Gov. Gary  
Locke wants to spend $150 million of the settlement on smoking 
prevention, House lawmakers argue that the money would be better 
spent on public health care. They say Washington already spends 
$2.5 million a year on prevention programs aimed mostly at youth.

<HEADLINE> La. Teen Charged in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTLANDVILLE, La. (AP) -- Shots rang out near a middle school  
Thursday and a 14-year-old girl was hit in the cheek by a boy who 
said he was aiming for someone he argued with earlier, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 14-year-old boy was charged with attempted murder for  
allegedly opening fire on a middle school in suburban Baton Rouge, 
said Lt. Darrell Oneal, spokesman for the East Baton Rouge Parish 
Sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen and an alleged accomplice, also 14, were arrested hours  
after the shots were fired from a park 100 yards away from 
Scotlandville Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	One .22-caliber bullet hit a 14-year-old female student in the  
cheek as she passed between buildings. She was treated at a 
hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged gunman told police he was not aiming for her but for  
a nearby male student whom he had argued with, Oneal said. 
Investigators said the teens told them the shooting was not related 
to Tuesday's deadly school rampage in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers ushered nearby students into classrooms when the  
gunfire began at noon, and kept them there until 2 p.m., school 
officials said. There was ``not great panic,'' school district 
spokesman Julie Madere said.

<HEADLINE> Telecoms Plan Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Having just agreed to form Europe's biggest  
telecommunications company, Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom are 
making no secret of their next goal -- to expand across the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The two firms announced a long-anticipated agreement Thursday to  
merge in an $80 billion deal that ranks as one of the largest 
corporate unions of all time. They would form a giant phone company 
with more than 100 million customers in Europe, Latin America and 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	But their vision extends further.  
</P>
<P>
	``The United States will be the next area of expansion,''  
Telecom Italia chief executive Franco Bernabe said at a joint news 
conference with his Deutsche Telekom counterpart. They did not 
offer specific targets for their push into the lucrative U.S. 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia hope to form a pan-European  
phone company that can compete with giants like AT&AMP;T Corp. of the 
United States and British Telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the adoption by 11 European countries of the  
euro, a common regional currency, has made it easier for the two 
former national phone monopolies to finally break their old, 
stay-at-home habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our operation is very much in line with the integration  
process of Europe,'' Deutsche Telekom chief executive Ron Sommer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom also has a 10 percent stake in Sprint Corp.,  
the No. 3 U.S. long-distance phone company. Sommer sits on Sprint's 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer refused to comment when asked whether Deutsche Telekom  
was planning a much-rumored takeover of Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sprint's Kansas City, Mo. headquarters, spokesman Bill White  
said the company isn't looking for a merger partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we have the size, scale and scope to compete both  
in the national and international marketplace,'' he said, adding: 
``Of course we have a fiduciary responsibility if an offer would 
come in that was more than we believe we could earn over the long 
term for our shareholders, we would have to listen to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Melloul, an analyst with Argus Research Corp. in New York,  
said it's unclear whether the new company would have the resources 
to try to swallow Sprint, but he said the pressure to expand is 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategically speaking, it's a requirement for them to be  
present here in the U.S. market. Given their global ambitions, 
there is no way they can get around that,'' Melloul said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, which has not yet been given a name, would have  
revenues of $62.7 billion and an operating profit of about $14 
billion based on 1998 figures. It would rank as the world's 
second-biggest telecommunications firm in terms of revenues after 
Japanese telephone behemoth NTT, which had revenues last year of 
$69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which would give Deutsche Telekom about 56 percent of  
the new company, was prompted by Telecom Italia's effort to avoid a 
hostile takeover bid from its smaller Italian rival Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would be run out of joint headquarters in Bonn  
and Rome, with Bernabe and Sommer working as joint chief executives 
and chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts have expressed doubts about the  
commercial logic of the merger, but Bernabe and Sommer pressed the 
case for growth. ``To get global reach, we need to expand,'' 
Bernabe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom has a strong network in Europe, while Telecom  
Italia has major operations in Latin America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, the new company would assume $8.6  
billion in Telecom Italia debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies must still win over shareholders and  
regulatory authorities in the United States and the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners expect the merger to save more than $635 million in  
the first year alone, with savings increasing in ensuing years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe and Sommer refused to say how many jobs would be cut if  
the deal is completed. The combined company would have 304,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has already met with some resistance. In Paris, France  
Telecom said Thursday it would violate Deutsche Telekom's 
undertakings with the French company. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have reciprocal 2 percent  
shareholdings and representatives each other's boards.

<HEADLINE> Many Tell Shooting Story on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- TV reporters didn't have to go far to find teen  
survivors of the Colorado school shooting willing to talk about 
their experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students who had been in Columbine High School were eager  
to discuss the attack and flocked to the cameras. Their interviews 
dominated Wednesday's near-constant cable news coverage of the 
massacre and turned television into a public grief counseling 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the most compelling part of the story,'' said John  
Moody, Fox News Channel vice president of news. ``Every time I see 
a new person, I want to hear their stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the potential to cross the line between information and  
exploitation, news executives said they were trying to be sensitive 
and not bother people who wanted to keep their trauma private. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the shooting even ended on Tuesday, one student used a  
cell phone to call Denver's KUSA-TV from the school to describe 
what was going on. The conversation was aired live by the station 
and picked up by CNN and MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that the student could alert the gunmen to his  
whereabouts, MSNBC cut away from the conversation and KUSA-TV urged 
other students not to call. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, most interview subjects had come back to the  
school, and many approached reporters, said Erik Sorenson, MSNBC's 
vice president and general manager. One student got up after just a 
few hours of sleep and drove down to where reporters were camped 
out to share his story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some kids on last night who could have co-anchored our  
coverage, they were so media-savvy,'' Sorenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	One girl, Katie Crona, likened the sound of screams to ``people  
going downhill on a roller-coaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine junior Steve Nason explained on MSNBC how he and some  
of his classmates crowded into an office to escape the gunmen, 
barricading the door with file cabinets and desks. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after, Nason spoke of the media attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a trip,'' he said. ``It's unbelievable. None of us had  
any idea how national this was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A psychologist said talking about the experience often helps  
people involved in tragedies avoid suffering from post-traumatic 
stress syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though it's not the primary point of what the media is doing,  
it's probably helping these kids,'' said Cynthia Last, director of 
the Anxiety Treatment Center at Nova Southeastern University in 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	She said, however, that reporters should stay away from students  
who didn't want to speak and should keep their questions general. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to interview a person in his or her teens  
who appears to be stable,'' Fox's Moody said. ``I wouldn't go over 
there and grab someone who is choking on tears or appears to be 
catching their breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's breaking coverage gave a big boost to the news  
networks. Fox News Channel, for example, had its highest 24-hour 
rating since its launch in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Many networks scrambled their plans to react to the tragedy. An  
MTV documentary about warning signs of teen-age violence was moved 
up from next week to Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon took time out from filming a kids-oriented special  
about Kosovo to update a ``Kids and Guns'' special. It was 
scheduled to air today.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Up 145.76 at 10,727.18 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A strong profit report from IBM gave investors  
the signal to buy technology stocks again on Thursday, pushing the 
Dow Jones industrial average to yet another new high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow climbed 145.76, or by 1.4 percent, to 10,727.18, moving  
well past Wednesday's new closing high of 10,581.42 and posting its 
10th record close in 14 sessions. The Dow is now up nearly 17 
percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher as Monday's fierce  
selloff in technology shares became a distant memory. The Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 22.71 at 1,358.83, just eclipsing the 
previous closing high of 1,358.63, which was set April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index rose 72.53 to 2,561.61.  
</P>
<P>
	IBM led the Dow higher, advancing 22 5/8 to 194 1/2 and pushing other  
technology stocks higher. After the market closed Wednesday, IBM 
reported first-quarter earnings of $1.55 a share, decisively 
beating year-ago results of $1.06 and analysts' estimates of $1.41. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's results reassured investors who have been nervously  
shuttling between technology issues and more conservative blue-chip 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's rally began at 4:01 p.m. yesterday,'' said Ed Laux,  
lead stock trader at ABN Amro/The Chicago Corp., ``when IBM's 
earnings came out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Johnson, First Albany Corp.'s market strategist, said IBM's  
earnings, which included strong results overseas, also signaled 
that the world economy is recovering after a nearly two-year-long 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``IBM seems to have put to rest all of the worries about the  
tech sector of the U.S. economy and about personal computers in 
particular,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell on Thursday, but stocks did not follow -- an  
apparent return, Johnson said, to the classic market tenet that a 
growing economy is good for the stock market although it can push 
interest rates higher and bond prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was off $10.31 per $1,000 value late  
in the day, pushing its yield, which moves opposite the price, up 
to just under 5.60 percent from 5.53 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares led the broad advance in the stock market.  
Dell rose 3 7/16 to 41 7/8, and Intel climbed 3 1/16 to 61 1/2, both in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In the telecommunications sector, Lucent Technologies rose 2 5/8 to  
61 3/4 on better-than-expected earnings. But GTE eased 1/16 to 66 
13/16, and Bell Atlantic fell 5/8 to 57 7/8, after those companies just 
met forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks rose, despite a drop in Chevron's first-quarter  
profits, as oil prices continued to rise. Crude oil contracts for 
June delivery rose 26 cents to a 16-month high of $18.18 a barrel 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Chevron's shares advanced 2 1/8 
to 98 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were so upbeat about the economy that even  
transportation stocks, which often fall when oil prices rise, moved 
higher. The Dow Jones transportation average rose 53.46, or 1.5 
percent, to 3,609.92. UAL added 1 5/8 to 83.

<P>
	``A stronger economy means more people are in the airline  
seats,'' Laux said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shares of companies that are highly sensitive to changes in  
the economy were lower after making a brief appearance earlier this 
week and last week on investors' buy lists. Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing sank 2 11/16 to 79 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks, which tend to do better in a shrinking economy,  
lost ground as well. McDonald's shares fell 11/16 to 44 11/16, 
after the company's first-quarter earnings matched analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-7 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume totaled a heavy 
1.13 billion shares, up from Wednesday.

<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 7.26 to 640.97, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 7.79 to 758.38. Both hit record 
highs.

<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.27 to 428.84.  
</P>
<P>
	In foreign stock markets, the Nikkei index in Tokyo gained 1.04  
percent as investors there also bought technology shares. In 
Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt advanced 1.08 percent, also on 
active buying of technology shares. The FT-SE 100 index in London 
fell 0.71 percent, and the CAC index in Paris closed flat.

<HEADLINE> Germany Reports on Colo.-Nazi Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- The news that the Colorado school shooters  
dabbled in Nazi symbols struck a chord Thursday in a nation still 
trying to come to grips with its past. A German tabloid headline 
called them ``Hitler's murderous children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The killers lived in Nazi madness,'' screamed Bild, Germany's  
most-read daily, across a front page juxtaposing photos of Hitler 
and the two teen-age gunmen. ``Their bloodbath was intended as 
homage to the dictator's 110th birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Decades later, Adolf Hitler, that horrible dictator, is still  
causing suffering and death,'' Bild said. 
</P>
<P>
	Express, a Cologne daily, likened the shooters to ``sinister  
Gestapo men'' because they wore black trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	In a country always uneasy about its own neo-Nazi problems,  
several German newspapers ran columns with experts trying to 
explain the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They chose Adolf Hitler because he is the most famous symbol  
of horror, of blind destruction,'' Express quoted psychologist Arnd 
Stein as saying. ``They were messed up, not Nazis out of 
conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most commentators, however, said the real problem was Americans'  
refusal to tighten gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latest murders, like the tormenting series of previous  
ones, could have been avoided if the United States were an unarmed 
society,'' the liberal Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper said in an 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that country has decided to arm itself privately to the  
teeth with pistols and other weapons -- with the absurd ideological 
justification that the owning of a weapon is a right of freedom.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Approves Coaches' Payment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- The NCAA approved a $54.5 million  
plan Wednesday to pay coaches whose earnings were illegally 
restricted, leading to the largest judgment levied against the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The major powers, who employed most of the coaches affected,  
will pay about $200,000 each. The smaller schools will be assessed 
about $80,000 each even though some never had a restricted earnings 
coach but voted for the rule and share in the wealth produced by 
the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The payment plan stems from a class action suit representing  
about 2,000-3,000 assistant coaches whose salaries were capped at 
$16,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is designed to head off a ruinous fight between the big  
and small schools among the 310 members in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
	It received final approval by the NCAA's board of directors and  
executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very workable solution, even though there will be  
schools both large and small that may have preferred a different 
formula,'' said Graham Spanier, chairman of the NCAA board. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the president at Penn State, I would like to have paid  
less. But as members of the board, we have to look at the big 
picture, and we agreed that this is a solution that will work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches will still have to wait for their money.  
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to have the money distributed within six to eight  
months, assuming the court approves the settlement and plan of 
distribution,'' said Lori Schultz, one of the coaches' lead 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we know the total number of coaches who submit a claim,  
we cannot estimate the amount each coach will receive or to what 
extent they will receive payment in addition to their actual loss 
of income.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money will come from future funds schools get from  
the CBS contract for the men's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches will be paid according to their sport, school and  
coaching tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA board also looked at the freshman eligibility standards  
that were found illegal by a federal judge in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The board hopes to have new Proposition 16 standards in place  
after its August meeting, board chairman Graham Spanier said. The 
rules remain in place under a court stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The standardized entrance tests were found to be discriminatory.  
The NCAA is trying to change its requirements, with less emphasis 
on the tests.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Marilu Henner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Actress Marilu Henner certainly looks the part  
of celebrity spokeswoman for a new diet and exercise book. 
</P>
<P>
	She's 46, but looks much younger. Her figure is fabulous and her  
skin looks flawless. She daintily eats grilled salmon on a bed of 
lettuce while sipping bottled water at an elegant hotel restaurant. 
She's stopped for lunch between appearances on TV talk shows to 
promote her new book. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ms. Henner leaves the restaurant, a group of well-dressed  
women stop her and tell her just how great she looks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Henner isn't playing a role. She lives the life she  
promotes in ``The 30-Day Total Health Makeover'' (Regan Books, 
$30), and has been living that way for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first book, ``Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover,'' was a  
best seller. But what touched Ms. Henner -- and prompted her to 
write the follow-up -- was the response she got from readers who 
stopped her on the street and sent her e-mail via her Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``People asked me over and over again, 'How do you actually live  
day to day?' The first book was filled with a lot of information, 
but this book actually lays out a 30-day plan, with recipes, tips 
and the tricks I use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ms. Henner stresses, her book is more than a diet book.  
It is a cookbook, a beauty book and a get-your-life-organized book. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will definitely lose weight and change their bodies.  
But I not only want to clear the junk from their bodies, I want to 
clear the junk from their lives. I try to look at the whole 
picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henner tackled the book with an enthusiasm reflected in the  
detail, even down to what she keeps in her kitchen pantry. She 
combines nutritional and dietary information with very personal 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Readers are urged to give up dairy products, meat, sugar and  
processed foods, and to group foods by category -- proteins for one 
meal and starch for another. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Were you always conscious of your health?  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henner: When I first started 'Taxi,' I was smoking and  
eating meat. But my parents both died in their 50s. My dad died of 
a heart attack at 52, and my mom died of arthritis complications at 
58. When I was watching her die in the hospital, I could see that 
her body was still trying to rally. I decided then that if she 
died, she would not die in vain. I said to myself, 'If her body is 
trying to make sense of all these tubes and tests, imagine what the 
body could do if you did all the right things for it?' After she 
died, I realized it's not about the teen-age dieting anymore, it's 
not about my weight, it's about my health. If I've been dealt this 
genetic hand, I better figure something out. 
</P>
<P>
	2. How can you follow your plan when you are traveling?  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henner: Twenty years ago when I started this, it was a lot  
harder. There weren't any health food stores, and the idea of 
ordering just fish and anything to eat without dairy products was 
unheard of. But the world has really grown up a lot when it comes 
to healthy eating. Most places have on their menus great pieces of 
grilled fish and great pasta dishes that don't necessarily have 
cheese or cream. I can go to really hot, popular restaurants and 
order off the menu and not have to make a substitution. We know too 
much about how we're supposed to be eating. 
</P>
<P>
	3. What about exercise?  
</P>
<P>
	For exercise, I'll jump around my hotel room if I have to. I'll  
have a Walkman on and just dance around the room, pretending I'm at 
a wedding or something. And, you can always walk. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Do you ever feel like you are missing out on something  
because of the strict dietary rules you've set for yourself? 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henner: I'm someone who has always liked food and that  
hasn't changed at all. I like sitting in a restaurant, I like 
volume. But I feel so good, I don't want to go off of the program. 
If someone said the world was going to end tomorrow, I wouldn't go 
out and eat a pizza. I'm only depriving myself of my bad habits and 
bad health. I'm depriving myself of waking up in the morning and 
not knowing what to wear because I'm too fat to fit into my 
clothing. I'm depriving myself of not feeling my best. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Was it difficult opening yourself, your family and your home  
to a book that shares your daily life -- even going inside your 
pantries and closets? (She is married to Robert Lieberman and is 
the mother of Nicholas, 4, and Joseph, 3.) 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henner: I had my baby on national television. I don't think  
there are any privacy issues left. My second child was born on 
'We're Having a Baby,' a show about women going through pregnancy. 
When my water broke, I called my doctor and the documentary film 
guy. We had a camera in the car on the way to the hospital. When I 
got to the hospital, the doctor wasn't there yet. But you see me in 
the documentary saying, 'Oh my God, the baby's here.' The nurse 
throws me on the table, two pushes and this baby comes flying out 
of me. I did the documentary because I thought if I could take some 
of the myth and mystery out of giving birth, they wouldn't be so 
fearful. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IBM Earnings Jump 42 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM easily beat Wall Street expectations for its  
first-quarter earnings, recording strong revenue in almost every 
sector as it notched a 42 increase in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were expecting a strong quarter, but they beat our bullish  
expectations,'' said John Jones, an analyst with Salomon Smith 
Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three months ended March 31, International Business  
Machines Corp. earned $1.47 billion, or $1.55 a share, compared to 
earnings of $1.04 billion, or $1.06 a share, in the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted earnings of  
$1.41 a share for the Armonk, N.Y.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenue rose 15 percent to $20.3 billion from  
$17.6 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While IBM officials credited software and service revenue for 60  
percent of their gross profit, the computer giant's report had 
strength across the board, and throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardware sales rose 17 percent to $8.6 billion, with PC sales  
rising 50 percent to $3.6 billion. Server performance was mixed, 
though IBM noted strong sales for its System/390 server. 
</P>
<P>
	Software sales for both IBM and non-IBM platforms rose 10  
percent to $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from business services, through which IBM installs and  
runs corporate computers, rose 19 percent to $7.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Louis Gerstner said in a statement  
that the results -- which set first-quarter records for earnings per 
share, revenue and net income -- were a ``direct reflection of the 
power of the strategies we have put in place over the last few 
years.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Rocket Fails To Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The launch countdown went all the  
way down to zero, but Boeing's new Delta III rocket never lifted 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket remained on the pad after failing to ignite late  
Thursday. It was the fourth time in two weeks that Boeing tried to 
launch the rocket with an Orion broadcasting satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	``3-2-1, zero. Plus-1. Plus-2. And we had a hang fire or a  
misfire,'' the launch commentator announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the core stage of the rocket nor the strap-on boosters  
fired. The small steering engines also never ignited. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Witzling, a Boeing vice president, said the computer system  
failed to send engine commands. The company will try again early 
next week to launch the rocket if the problem can be solved 
quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're learning the system, the limits in the system,'' he  
said. ``But we're very confident in the design itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Delta III made its debut last August, it blew up 71  
seconds after liftoff. The $225 million disaster cost Boeing 
millions more for the investigation that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerospace engineers who took part in the investigation concluded  
that the computer software guidelines for the new Delta III were 
wrong. The guidelines were changed for Thursday's launch attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials said they did everything they could to prevent  
another failure, double-checking and triple-checking the entire 
rocket system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III is key to Boeing's plan to grab more of the launch  
market. The rocket is designed to carry twice as much payload as 
the smaller Delta II.

<HEADLINE> New Study Questions `Gay Gene' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Canadian scientists are questioning whether a  
gene inherited from mothers influences men's sexual orientation in 
a study that attacks U.S. researchers' hunt for a ``gay gene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists still can't explain what determines a person's sexual  
orientation, although many studies have suggested that it is 
biology and not choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The first such evidence came in 1991, when researchers  
discovered that identical twins of gay men were much more likely to 
also be gay than were fraternal twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Then National Cancer Institute geneticist Dean Hamer made  
headlines in 1993 by suggesting that one such gene resides in a 
region of the X chromosome, one of the microscopic structures that 
carry genes. Men inherit that chromosome from their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hamer never identified the gene itself, his research  
suggested its location by finding that 33 of 40 pairs of gay 
brothers shared certain genetic ``markers'' that heterosexual 
brothers didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a report to be published in Friday's journal Science,  
Canadian scientists said they tried to reproduce Hamer's study and 
found no link. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurologist George Rice of the University of Western Ontario  
studied gay brothers from 48 families and said they were no more 
likely to share X-linked genetic patterns than would be determined 
by chance. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean genes don't influence homosexuality, Rice  
said, just that scientists should hunt elsewhere. ``We are still 
looking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamer vehemently defended his research, saying other scientists  
have found evidence supporting it. ``This study doesn't disprove 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamer said Rice may have diluted chances of finding an X-linked  
gene by studying families with homosexuality mostly on the father's 
side instead of the mother's. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said he didn't single out families -- and that excluding  
those that concerned Hamer wouldn't affect the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice's report ``certainly does decrease the likelihood'' of an  
X-linked gene, but isn't proof, said J. Michael Bailey of 
Northwestern University, who did the first gay twin research. He 
called for a larger study to settle the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would bet a million dollars that there are going to be  
biological factors involved in sexual orientation. I am certainly 
less sure that it's genes,'' he added, noting that hormones or 
other factors may be the answer.

<HEADLINE> Dancers Show Breasts, Fine Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A night club charged with letting  
dancers show too much skin had a $600 fine dropped after employees 
showed some of the evidence to a state panel. 
</P>
<P>
	One dancer slipped her dress off her shoulders and another  
lifted her sweater to show members of the state Alcoholic Beverage 
Control Commission that their pasties conformed to state laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission agents cited Regina's in October, saying club dancers  
had exposed their nipples. 
</P>
<P>
	During Wednesday's hearing, Ken Mourton, owner of Regina's House  
of Dolls of Fayetteville, asked board members if the dancers could 
show them exactly how much of their bodies they exposed during 
their act. 
</P>
<P>
	After the viewing, the all-male board voted 5-0 to drop the fine  
and six-month probation term for the club. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope for the sake of our agents, we can concentrate on  
things that are truly dangerous to society,'' said commission 
chairman Ron Fuller.

<HEADLINE> NATO Dignitaries Arrive in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- No pomp, no ceremony, just a  
low-key airport greeting and a motorcade into downtown Washington 
awaited the leaders of NATO as they arrived one by one for the 
alliance's 50th anniversary summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign dignitaries -- landing in half-hour intervals -- were  
greeted Thursday afternoon and evening in a succession of welcoming 
ceremonies at the base that is home to President Clinton's plane, 
Air Force One. The 50-foot red carpets were duly rolled out each 
time, but only after members of a U.S. military guard scurried to 
sweep and vacuum them between arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegations of presidents and prime ministers then took  
varying routes into the nation's capital, a portent of traffic 
congestion to come. Today, major downtown streets were to be closed 
to allow motorcades access to the heart of the city, where the 
summit events are being held. Federal workers and the city's 
schoolchildren had the day off to try to minimize gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
	At Andrews, a 21-member military honor guard marched in  
procession to line both sides of the red carpet as the foreign 
leaders descended in a steady stream from their VIP planes, large 
and small. 
</P>
<P>
	Azerbaijan's president, Geidar Aliev, flew in a plane bearing  
two tiny flags on its nose -- one from his nation and one from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the visiting heads of state, such as Turkish President  
Suleyman Demirel and his wife, courted a small crowd of diplomatic 
welcomers, bearing flowers to mark the occasion. Demirel lifted his 
hat in a salute to the reporters watching his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	The air base welcome was just the beginning. Throughout the  
weekend-long meeting, foreign leaders will get white-gloved 
treatment -- right down to the people who help them get out of their 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Six to eight members of military honor guards will be on hand  
every day to open the doors of limousines. Apparently, the job is 
not as easy as it looks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are security locks on the doors and so you have to be  
trained on how to open the doors,'' said Maj. Craig Greene, who is 
helping plan the NATO ceremonies. ``It can be an awkward moment 
getting a leader out of the car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the gathering, originally intended as a round of festivities  
to celebrate NATO's 50th anniversary, was recast into a more somber 
event as the alliance confronted the crisis in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Even plans for dancing were scuttled at one dinner for  
dignitaries and members of Congress on Thursday night at the 
spacious, soaring National Building Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, much eating and drinking was still at hand.  
President Clinton was holding a White House dinner tonight for the 
19 NATO member nations and Secretary-General Javier Solana. Other 
visiting leaders were heading to parties at the State Department or 
the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	And reporters had their turn Thursday night: More than 3,200  
were invited to the Ronald Reagan Building for food and Dixieland 
music.

<HEADLINE>  Two Bombs Found in H.S. Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two gunmen in the Columbine High  
massacre were planning to blow up their school and probably had 
help from others, investigators said Thursday after discovering two 
powerful bombs in the kitchen that had been built from propane 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage, but they  
were going to destroy the school,'' Sheriff John Stone said. ``They 
were going to burn the school up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the two 20-pound propane tanks heightened  
suspicions that the two killers had help from other people, either 
with building the 32 bombs discovered so far or getting them into 
the high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a feeling from our investigators that the chances are  
very, very good that we have more than two people involved,'' 
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN reported that a note left by one of the gunmen was a suicide  
note that indicated the two teen-agers acted alone. ``This is the 
way we want to go out,'' the note said, according to CNN, which 
cited unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he had no details on a note that was found at one of  
the gunmen's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with sawed-off  
shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol and homemade bombs 
stuffed with nails and shotgun shells, killed 12 students and one 
teacher Tuesday before taking their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bombs found Thursday used propane tanks similar to those  
on backyard barbecue grills. Nails and BBs had been taped to the 
tanks to create shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty pounds of propane can create quite an extensive amount  
of damage,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas said: ``No one saw them carry it  
into the school and people did see them enter. So we have to 
explore how that device got into the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had already been looking into the possibility of  
additional suspects because of the amount of ammunition and 
explosives left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's drawing suspicion out here that they would have time to  
put as much ordnance in that school as they did without some 
help,'' the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people remained hospitalized, eight in critical or  
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, crews used bomb-sniffing dogs as they carefully  
picked through thousands of backpacks, briefcases and boxes strewn 
across the carpets, classrooms and hallways. Investigators are also 
working to trace the weapons to determine how the teen-agers got 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the heavily damaged school, officers began collecting  
hundreds of pieces of evidence, including carpet, fragments of 
windows, ceiling tiles and walls and shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very big crime scene and so much evidence to  
catalog, it will take days to collect it,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite intermittent, heavy snow, dozens of people left  
bouquets, stuffed animals, cards and balloons in the school colors 
of blue and silver at a makeshift memorial in a park near the 
school. The mementos were piled 2 feet deep by early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools in the  
district reopened Thursday amid tight security. Officers and school 
staff members plan ``sweeps'' and greater security at entrances and 
exits, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said proms and graduations will go on as scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's prom took place earlier this month, and graduation  
is scheduled for early May, though officials did not say whether 
that will go on as scheduled. Students will finish out the year at 
other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack inspired an apparent copycat act by teen-agers on  
Wednesday, although there were no weapons involved. Four teens were 
charged with trespassing in Colorado Springs after arriving at 
school in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	Trench coats like the ones worn by the two gunmen have been  
banned in Denver and two other Colorado districts since the attack 
for fear they could be used to hide weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said that Harris and Klebold were part of an outcast  
group called the Trenchcoat Mafia and that they wore black and 
spoke German to each other. They believe the gunmen timed the 
attack for Adolf Hitler's birthday.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Give New Tips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thursday was Earth Day. So what should people  
do to help the environment? Not necessarily what they have been 
told, according to a new guide to a greener world. 
</P>
<P>
	The word from two environmentalists is not fret over whether to  
use plastic or paper bags, cloth or disposal diapers, or those 
convenient disposable plastic foam cups and plates that caused such 
a stir a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact is not all that much anyway, say the authors of ``The  
Consumer Guide to Effective Environmental Choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer to a better environment, argue Warren Leon and  
Michael Brower, lies elsewhere: what you eat, what you drive and 
the kind of house you buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some consumer decisions, like whether to choose paper or  
plastic grocery bags, are insignificant,'' says Leon, deputy 
director of the Union of Concerned Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to reduce harm to the environment, say Leon and  
physicist Brower, is to focus on food consumption patterns, 
transportation and where people live. 
</P>
<P>
	``Driving less and buying a cleaner car are the best things  
people can do for the environment,'' Brower says. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the top priorities, according to the guide, is to eat  
less red meat and poultry and more grains and vegetables. In fact, 
they say, people should eat less and recycle more. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors say household meat and poultry consumption is  
responsible for about one-quarter of the threat to natural 
ecosystems and wildlife. Meat and poultry operations consume large 
amounts of water, pollute waters with animal runoff and use land 
inefficiently, according to the guide. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon and Brower also say it is important to choose carefully  
when buying a home so that it is near public transportation, 
reducing the need to drive, and has efficient lighting, heating and 
cooling. 
</P>
<P>
	The advice is not likely to set well with the growing number of  
people buying sport utility vehicles and minivans, which generally 
are not as fuel efficient or clean-burning as other vehicles. Nor 
is the guidance pleasing the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Calorie for calorie, producing meat uses far less energy than  
producing fruits or vegetables,'' said Ann Soli, a spokesman for 
the beef association. 
</P>
<P>
	``And people love to see big open spaces and cattle grazing. The  
alternative if we want to get rid of ranches is going to be 
shopping malls and track houses.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Economy Still in Woods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's government said Friday the worst of the  
nation's economic slump was over, but urged the central bank to 
take further precautions until the economy has clearly moved toward 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report assessing the progress of economic policies, the  
Economic Planning Agency said Japan has ``escaped the risk of a 
deflationary spiral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bank of Japan should continue supplying ample liquidity  
to the money markets until it is clear that the economy is back on 
the path to a self-sustaining recovery, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also noted that growing unemployment remained a problem amid  
ongoing corporate restructuring and increasing pressure to get rid 
of excess capital stock. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA chief Taichi Sakaiya said at a news conference that the  
government does not plan to carry out ``aggressive'' fiscal 
spending on public works for the current fiscal year. But 
additional steps may be taken to address the deteriorating labor 
market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While domestic demand remains weak, there are signs of  
improvement in the public mindset, while economic deterioration is 
slowing to a halt, the EPA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said an emergency loan guarantee program has helped  
small companies and the number of corporate bankruptcies has 
decreased sharply. Sales of condominiums reached their highest 
level in the Tokyo area in March, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that disbursements for public works spending are  
progressing smoothly. The government will continue to approach 
economic policy ``in a flexible and responsive manner,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of February, nearly 80 percent of $201 billion  
allocated in two stimulus packages has been disbursed, the report 
said. On a contract basis, a little more than $25 billion of the 
second package remained to be spent at the end of February, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Japan's large banks have almost finished cleaning up their  
bad debts, the EPA said. The government plans to provide them with 
supplementary funds to broaden the debt guarantee system as needed, 
the agency added, without specifying how much more money would be 
injected into the program.

<HEADLINE> Track and Field Launches Pro League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In an effort to showcase its abundance of  
stars, such as Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene, track and field 
launched its first outdoor professional league Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The league, called the Track &AMP; Field Association,will debut June  
6 with the TFA ProChampionshipks at the Mitchell Athletic Complex 
in Uniondale, N.Y. -- the site of last year's Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe track and field is the sleeping giant of sports,''  
Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200-meter and 400-meter gold medalist, 
said during a press conference in conjunction with the Penn Relays, 
where he will compete Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fan base is untapped and this endeavor will tap into that  
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second attempt at a professional track and field  
league in the United States. The first, the International Track 
Association, was conducted during the mid-1970s before failing, 
even though it featured such renowned athletes as Jim Ryun, Kip 
Keino, Lee Evans, Ben Jipcho and Brian Oldfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to offer the athletes what they asked for, a  
chance to compete in the United States, an opportunity to be on 
television and a chance to make money,'' U.S. Track &AMP; Field 
executive director Craig Masback said. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 6 meet, the only one scheduled for this year, will be  
comprised of 15 events. For men, there will be the 100 meters, 200, 
mile, 3,000, 110 hurdles, high jump, pole vault and shot put. For 
women, the events will be the 100, 800, mile, 100 hurdles, high 
jump, pole vault and triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet, with a finals-only format of eight competitors in each  
event, will be televised live by ESPN, from 1-3 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to streamline track in a fan-friendly format,''  
said Brian Vandenberg, CEO of the new league. 
</P>
<P>
	He said prize money would be awarded for this year's meet, and  
the circuit would be expanded next year, running from April-June, 
prior to the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes will be mostly Americans, with some foreigners  
added. Vandenberg said the athletes have signed multiyear 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have about 100 athletes signed, with the focus on the top  
performers in the world,'' Vandenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful idea,'' said Greene, the 1997 world champion  
in the men's 100. ``We'll be able to compete more and give the fans 
more of a chance to see us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Women's sprinter Inger Miller agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to showcase our talents in the United States, an  
opportunity to run in a circuit at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league follows the introduction of USATF's Golden Spike Tour  
indoor circuit this year, consisting of four nationally televised 
meets.

<HEADLINE>  U.S., NATO May Consider Ground Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and British officials said today it is  
prudent, after four weeks of airstrikes, to consider whether NATO's 
military policy in Yugoslavia should be reversed to allow the 
deployment of ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has asked Army Gen. Wesley  
Clark, supreme commander of NATO forces in Europe, to update the 
military assessment made in October that the Yugoslavia campaign 
should be limited to the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will make all the assessments necessary to make sure we  
succeed,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said after meeting 
with congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	At a State Department news conference with Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, ``We 
want the military to be ready for contingencies and to make sure 
that they're ready for all options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``But that doesn't mean to say the policy is  
changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials used the word ``prudent'' when  
discussing the decision to update the military assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not favor the employment of ground forces in a hostile  
environment,'' Albright said. But she added, ``I think it is 
inappropriate to rule anything out and we have not done so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said the reassessment would take  
into account new facts on the ground, including the buildup of 
Serbs forces in the past few months inside the Serbian province of 
Kosovo; the expulsion of up to 1 million ethnic Albanians from 
their homes; and the effects of NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The review would explore both what a NATO peacekeeping force  
would look like if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agrees to 
halt fighting Kosovar Albanians and what it would take to send 
ground forces into Yugoslavia and Kosovo ``in a nonpermissive 
environment,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Secretary-General Solana's feeling that given the changes  
on the ground in the last couple of months, it's just prudent to 
look at those plans and see where they stand,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no NATO consensus, however, to put together any detailed  
military planning for a ground invasion, Bacon said, which could 
take from 75,000 to 200,000 troops, according to the earlier 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO attacked one of Milosevic's homes in Belgrade late  
Wednesday because the two-story house contained elements of a 
command-and-control center and a military bunker, Bacon said. He 
disputed any notion the allies are trying to kill Milosevic or his 
family and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not targeting President Milosevic or the Serb people,''  
Bacon said. ``We are targeting the military and the military 
infrastructure that supports the instruments of oppression in 
Kosovo. ... We are going against the nervous system used to control 
the military forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO flew 324 sorties Wednesday night, bringing the total to  
9,300 since Operation Allied Force began March 24, the Pentagon 
said. Defense officials estimated half of Serb aircraft have been 
destroyed and 10 percent to 20 percent of their tanks and armored 
personnel carriers. Nearly one-third of the Serbs' top air defense 
batteries also have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen told a House Appropriations  
subcommittee Wednesday that NATO is not considering a ground 
assault, although plans could be updated ``very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The topic of ground troops is certain to dominate the agenda of  
the 50th anniversary NATO summit, which goes through the weekend. 
Blair and Clinton discussed the issue Wednesday night at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both leaders agreed that our common position has not  
changed,'' National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said 
afterwards. ``There is no intention to introduce ground troops into 
a nonpermissible environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon, meanwhile, awarded a $41 million contract to  
Boeing Co. to convert 95 nuclear-armed cruise missiles to the 
nonnuclear version that B-52 bombers have been launching at 
Yugoslavia. The work is scheduled to be finished by Nov. 30. The 
Air Force inventory of conventionally armed cruise missiles has 
been depleted by the heavy use against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Before flying to Washington, Blair told the House of Commons  
that sending ground troops ahead of a peace deal remained an 
option. Milosevic would not be able to prevent ground troops from 
being deployed, Blair said, though he added that an invasion 
against full-strength Yugoslav forces would pose ``formidable'' 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the United States  
had not asked for a reassessment of the airstrike strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``We believe that if the military command  
believes that this is the right way to go and that it would be 
prudent for them to update, then it's certainly something we'd 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials long have insisted that only an air  
campaign is envisioned against Yugoslav troops. But 25 days of air 
bombardment appear not to have stemmed Milosevic's aggression 
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province of the dominant 
Yugoslav republic of Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore announced Wednesday that 20,000 Kosovar  
Albanian refugees would resettle temporarily in the United States. 
Gore said the effort would focus on ``those with close family ties 
in America and those who are vulnerable, and we will have them here 
until they are able to return home safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House deputy chief of staff Maria Echaveste said officials  
would try to match refugees with relatives or sponsors after the 
refugees arrived at two or three ports along the East Coast. 
``We're going to be focusing on family reunification,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the political front, the House International Relations  
Committee today put off until Tuesday a vote on a resolution by 
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., to invoke the War Powers Act and 
demand that U.S. forces on duty in and around the Balkans be 
brought home. GOP leaders said the measure likely would have won 
committee approval today -- providing a major embarrassment for the 
president as NATO leaders gathered.

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoffs Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Steve Yzerman was the MVP of the NHL playoffs a year ago, and it  
looks like he's serious about winning the award again. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman scored three goals as the defending Stanley Cup champion  
Detroit Red Wings beat the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 5-3 Wednesday night 
in the opener of their Western Conference series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's Stevie,'' teammate Brendan Shanahan said of the Red  
Wings' captain. ``It's not about speeches or anything like that. He 
goes out and does it on the ice. That's why he's the leader he 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings are seeking to become the first team to win three  
straight Stanley Cups since the New York Islanders won four from 
1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty good start,'' Red Wings defenseman Chris  
Chelios said after the game at Joe Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	In other playoff openers Wednesday night, Dallas edged Edmonton  
and Buffalo beat Ottawa by 2-1 scores. The San Jose-Colorado game 
was postponed because of the shooting deaths at a suburban high 
school outside of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs continue tonight with Philadelphia at Toronto,  
Pittsburgh at New Jersey, Boston at Carolina and St. Louis at 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman's first goal tied the game 1-1 at 11:06 of the first  
period. His second came 31 seconds into the second period, and he 
completed his hat trick and clinched the game with 1:18 left.

	``He's an unbelievable player,'' Anaheim's Paul Kariya said.  
``He's always been a tremendous scorer but now he plays that well 
on both ends of the ice. He sees the game as well as anyone in the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wendel Clark added a goal and an assist and Doug Brown also  
scored for Detroit. Kariya had a goal and two assists for Anaheim 
and Marty McInnis and Teemu Selanne also scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert was injured midway through the game  
when Shanahan, driving to the net, was hit hard by Ducks defenseman 
Ruslan Salei and sent flying. The Ducks said after the game that 
Hebert's injury is not serious, and he will be able to play in Game 
2 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Stars 2, Oilers 1    	
</P>
<P>
	At Dallas, Guy Carbonneau scored with 6:53 to play as the  
heavily favored Stars rallied to defeat Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbonneau beat Tommy Salo with a wrist shot for his 35th career  
playoff goal. The shot spoiled an otherwise fine performance by 
Salo, who made 29 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Rem Murray gave Edmonton a 1-0 lead in the second period before  
the Stars tied it on a goal by Jere Lehtinen 13 seconds into the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas goalie Ed Belfour only had to make 12 saves for the  
victory on his 34th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience when the playoffs comes around is very important,''  
said Carbonneau, appearing in his 16th playoffs. ``This was a big 
win. We came out and took their momentum away in the third 
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
                        *Sabres 2, Senators 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Dominik Hasek's 40 saves led Buffalo to victory at Ottawa.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Peca scored in the first period and Curtis Brown in the  
second for the Sabres, who were outshot 41-15, but relied on Hasek 
and made the most of their chances against Senators goalie Ron 
Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Redden scored for the Senators, the series favorites who  
finished second in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew Hasek would be a big factor,'' Redden said. ``We just  
have to find a way to beat him. We've scored on him before. I don't 
think we were frustrated. We have to keep playing the same way. 
We'll get goals.''

<HEADLINE>  Two Bombs Found in H.S. Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two gunmen in the Columbine High  
massacre were planning to blow up their school and probably had 
help from others, investigators said Thursday after discovering two 
powerful bombs in the kitchen that had been built from propane 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage, but they  
were going to destroy the school,'' Sheriff John Stone said. ``They 
were going to burn the school up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the two 20-pound propane tanks heightened  
suspicions that the two killers had help from other people, either 
with building the 32 bombs discovered so far or getting them into 
the high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a feeling from our investigators that the chances are  
very, very good that we have more than two people involved,'' 
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN reported that a note left by one of the gunmen was a suicide  
note that indicated the two teen-agers acted alone. ``This is the 
way we want to go out,'' the note said, according to CNN, which 
cited unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he had no details on a note that was found at one of  
the gunmen's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with sawed-off  
shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol and homemade bombs 
stuffed with nails and shotgun shells, killed 12 students and one 
teacher Tuesday before taking their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bombs found Thursday used propane tanks similar to those  
on backyard barbecue grills. Nails and BBs had been taped to the 
tanks to create shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty pounds of propane can create quite an extensive amount  
of damage,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Dave Thomas said: ``No one saw them carry it  
into the school and people did see them enter. So we have to 
explore how that device got into the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had already been looking into the possibility of  
additional suspects because of the amount of ammunition and 
explosives left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's drawing suspicion out here that they would have time to  
put as much ordnance in that school as they did without some 
help,'' the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people remained hospitalized, eight in critical or  
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, crews used bomb-sniffing dogs as they carefully  
picked through thousands of backpacks, briefcases and boxes strewn 
across the carpets, classrooms and hallways. Investigators are also 
working to trace the weapons to determine how the teen-agers got 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the heavily damaged school, officers began collecting  
hundreds of pieces of evidence, including carpet, fragments of 
windows, ceiling tiles and walls and shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very big crime scene and so much evidence to  
catalog, it will take days to collect it,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite intermittent, heavy snow, dozens of people left  
bouquets, stuffed animals, cards and balloons in the school colors 
of blue and silver at a makeshift memorial in a park near the 
school. The mementos were piled 2 feet deep by early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine will be closed indefinitely. Other schools in the  
district reopened Thursday amid tight security. Officers and school 
staff members plan ``sweeps'' and greater security at entrances and 
exits, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said proms and graduations will go on as scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's prom took place earlier this month, and graduation  
is scheduled for early May, though officials did not say whether 
that will go on as scheduled. Students will finish out the year at 
other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack inspired an apparent copycat act by teen-agers on  
Wednesday, although there were no weapons involved. Four teens were 
charged with trespassing in Colorado Springs after arriving at 
school in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	Trench coats like the ones worn by the two gunmen have been  
banned in Denver and two other Colorado districts since the attack 
for fear they could be used to hide weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said that Harris and Klebold were part of an outcast  
group called the Trenchcoat Mafia and that they wore black and 
spoke German to each other. They believe the gunmen timed the 
attack for Adolf Hitler's birthday.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Refugees from Guatemala's civil war  
returned to their homeland from Mexico on Thursday, marking the 
final chapter of an international effort to resettle them. 
</P>
<P>
	United Nations officials called the return of 294 Guatemalans a  
successful example of resettlement efforts. With Thursday's return, 
a total of 41,633 Guatemalans have been helped home. 
</P>
<P>
	About 13,000 Guatemalan refugees remain in 60 camps in the  
southern Mexican state Chiapas. They will either return 
individually or stay in Mexico under a nationalization program 
offered by that country. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees were welcomed with religious services and music  
Thursday in the town square of Coatepeque, 125 miles west of 
Guatemala. They are the last group to be resettled under a 
U.N.-supervised program in which the Guatemalan government offered 
them low-interest loans to buy farmland. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Guatemalans fled to Mexico and the United  
States beginning in 1981 amid violence from the country's civil 
war.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Striking bus drivers blocked streets and  
many businesses closed their doors Thursday in Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
largest city, in a one-day strike against the government's economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the businesses in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest  
of Quito, closed to protest President Jamil Mahuad's proposal to 
raise taxes to reduce the small South American nation's $1.2 
billion budget deficit. Bus drivers blocked roads with their 
vehicles to protest the planned gasoline price increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal workers demanding a greater share of the nation's  
budget for cities also joined the strike, placing city trucks and 
construction equipment across roads to strengthen the blockades. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was largely peaceful. Guayaquil police reported  
arresting 25 striking drivers for causing disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight months in office, Mahuad has faced two national strikes  
and repeated street protests as he tries to reform Ecuador's 
bankrupt economy and drag it from its worst economic crisis in 
decades.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Nicaraguan troops surrounded Managua's  
Sandino International Airport on Thursday to stop reported plans by 
student protesters to seize the facility and press their demands 
for higher funding for public universities. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came one day after a 21-year-old law student killed by  
a rubber bullet fired by police Tuesday was buried in an emotional 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officials have warned protesters they might begin using  
regular ammunition if demonstrators continue to attack public 
buildings and police lines with rocks and mortars. 
</P>
<P>
	Students backed by the leftist Sandinista party have been  
demonstrating for three weeks to demand that the center-right 
government of Arnoldo Aleman increase budgets for universities. The 
students barricaded access roads to the airport Tuesday and some 
said they planned to seize it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of police officers and students have been injured in the  
clashes, and 70 protesters have been arrested since the 
disturbances began.

	CHILANGUERA, El Salvador (AP) -- U.S. army reserve members  
started work Thursday on a joint project with the Salvadoran army 
to rebuild bridges and public facilities destroyed by Hurricane 
Mitch in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The 350 reservists -- mainly from the 81st regional support  
command based in Birmingham, Ala., but including reserve members 
from 15 other states -- will work for the next four months 
rebuilding highways, bridges, roads, schools and health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	At a ceremony in this hamlet 100 miles southeast of San  
Salvador, U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson said the projects are 
aimed at ``preventing another disaster like the one that occurred 
during the recent hurricane.'' 
</P>

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Indians clad in loincloths and smeared  
with warpaint on Thursday protested President Hugo Chavez's failure 
to halt gold mining in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, a former coup leader who took office in February,  
promised during his campaign to reverse a 1997 decree that 
legalized gold and diamond mining in the pristine Imataca rain 
forest in southeast Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jose Luis Gonzalez, a leader of the Pemon tribe, said Chavez  
has approved mining projects, including one at Las Cristinas, the 
site of what is believed to be one of the largest gold deposits in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 Indians protested outside Congress Thursday, including  
two Yanomamis who walked into Congress to present legislators with 
a letter outlining their complaints. The Yanomamis are one of the 
last Stone Age tribes on earth, though their culture has been hurt 
in recent years by contact with modernity.

<HEADLINE> Boston Changes Live TV Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston TV stations have pledged to run no live  
pictures of SWAT teams, no live footage of escaping victims and no 
cell phone interviews of the sort seen and heard during the 
murderous attack at Colorado's Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact between the broadcasters and police is among the  
country's first in this age of ratings-driven television. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary regulations were developed months ago, before  
Tuesday's massacre in Littleton, Colo., heightened the debate over 
the impact of instant news coverage of dramatic and dangerous 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, the Sun-Times kept the Littleton killings off its  
front page for a second day Thursday, running the story inside on 
pages 2 through 6. The tabloid's editor, Nigel Wade, said 
front-page coverage might traumatize children and lead to copycat 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Society of Professional Journalists and the American  
Society of Newspaper Editors said Thursday it knows of no other 
newspapers deliberately leaving the story off Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's seven TV stations and several local radio broadcasters  
pledged to abide by the ``Partnership Agreement for Responsible 
Broadcasting,'' which sets coverage guidelines during hostage 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact, which pertains to events in Massachusetts, does not  
absolutely prohibit live coverage and carries no penalty if broken. 
Nor does it govern whether local stations air video feed coming in 
from outside the state, such as the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Its goal is to protect those involved in local hostage  
situations rather than to protect viewers from unfolding tragedies 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just about who wins the coverage. It's not about  
ratings and competition,'' Candy Altman, vice president and news 
director at Boston's WCVB-TV, an ABC affiliate, said Thursday. 
``It's about giving the public the information they really need to 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar pacts were made last year among broadcasters in  
Portland, Ore., and Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston agreement limits stations to one pool camera on the  
ground and one helicopter pool in any hostage incident deemed 
``critical'' by Boston, Brookline or Massachusetts State Police. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement began to take shape after a televised  
hostage-taking in Tampa last May. The suspect holed up in a gas 
station after fatally shooting three police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A reporter was talking about SWAT teams going in the back  
door, and you just wanted to go, `Oh, my God, she just got 
potentially five officers killed,''' said Sgt. Detective Margot 
Hill, the Boston police media director who helped develop the 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Tuesday's live footage of a bloodied Columbine High  
student dangling from a window might have endangered the teen-ager 
and his SWAT team rescuers by showing their precise location to the 
attackers, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the pledge, police will give Boston stations  
better locations to set up pool cameras and more frequent updates. 
But sensitive footage cannot be shown until the situation has been 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Harper, a journalism professor at Ithaca College in  
New York and a former ABC bureau chief, said the problem with 
voluntary guidelines is that it's only a matter of time before 
somebody breaks them. 
</P>
<P>
	Patti Dennis, vice president of news at KUSA-TV, the NBC  
affiliate in Denver, said she held back from showing SWAT teams 
converging on Columbine High, fearful the killers might be watching 
television from within the building. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she felt the station erred in broadcasting a cell  
phone interview with a student trapped in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the news media shouldn't be blamed for doing their job,  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to say it's your fault for covering it and it's your  
fault (the shooters) did it in the first place,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominates Military Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton nominated Lt. Gen. James  
Jones to be commandant of the Marine Corps and Gen. Eric Shinseki 
to be chief of staff of the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	If confirmed by Congress, Jones would be promoted to four-star  
rank and replace the retiring Gen. Charles Krulak on June 30. 
Shinseki, already with four stars, would take over for Gen. Dennis 
Reimer on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Krulak and Reimer will have completed their appointed four  
years as chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 55, is a decorated Vietnam veteran who has been Defense  
Secretary William Cohen's senior military assistant since Cohen 
took office in early 1997. Widely respected in the Marines, he 
became friends with Cohen while serving in the Marine Corps office 
of legislative affairs and Cohen was a Republican member of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is a native of Kansas City, Mo., but spent his formative  
years in France. He returned to the United States to attend the 
Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, where he received 
a bachelor of science degree in 1966. He was commissioned a second 
lieutenant in the Marines in January 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his decorations: the Silver Star Medal and a Bronze Star  
Medal with combat ``V'' for valor. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki, a 33-year Army veteran, is the vice chief of staff,  
the No. 2 position in the Army. His career includes 10 years in 
Europe, including a stint as commanding general of U.S. Army-Europe 
in 1997-98 while also commanded the NATO-led peacekeeping force in 
Bosnia until last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinseki, 56, was born in Lihue on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.  
A graduate of West Point, he also holds a master's degree in 
English literature from Duke University. Among his military 
decorations: a Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' for valor and two oak 
leaf clusters, and a Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
	As chiefs of the Marines and Army, Jones and Shinseki would be  
members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The other members are Air 
Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan, Chief of Naval Operations 
Adm. Jay Johnson, and the joint chiefs chairman, Gen. Henry Shelton 
of the Army.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Maggette Considers NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke freshman Corey Maggette reportedly is  
weighing a jump to the NBA, which would make him the third Blue 
Devils player this spring to leave school early for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Elton Brand and Will Avery already have announced they are  
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette recently visited his former school, Fenwick High in Oak  
Park, Ill., and students and teachers asked him whether he would 
return to Duke or bolt to the NBA, The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh 
reported. Fenwick coach John Quinn said Maggette responded: ``I 
don't know yet,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette and his parents, who could not be reached for comment,  
were believed to have been in Durham last weekend to discuss 
Maggette's draft status with Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said in a radio interview Tuesday night that he does  
not know what Maggette's plans are. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> National TV Turnoff Week Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The government has some advice for kids: Turn  
off the TV and go outside and play. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher has thrown his support to National  
TV Turnoff Week, a usually little-noticed yearly effort to wean 
people of excessive tube watching. This year's TV Turnoff Week 
began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher, worried about an epidemic of obesity, said it would  
help to get up off the couch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the most sedentary generation of young people in  
American history,'' he said. ``Reducing the amount of television 
our children watch is one way to encourage more healthful 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through some schools, Satcher is distributing a ``prescription  
for less TV'' and urging parents to tape it in front of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor's prescription: ``Go bicycling, play soccer, jump  
rope, fly a kite, dance, start a garden, wash the dog, swim laps, 
clean your room, do gymnastics, throw a Frisbee, walk around the 
block, learn to rollerskate, build a fort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher's endorsement was a pleasant surprise to TV-Free  
America, the Washington advocacy group that has spearheaded 
National TV Turnoff Week for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government had never been involved before Satcher  
and Shirley Watkins, the undersecretary of agriculture for food, 
nutrition and consumer services, asked if they could endorse the 
effort, said Henry Labalme, executive director of TV-Free America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real watershed to have someone of Dr. Satcher's stature  
and influence and authority make the statement that Americans 
really need to cut back on their tube time for health reasons,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labalme estimated that 6 million people have pledged through  
schools, libraries and religious groups to go without TV for the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	His group says TV increases obesity, stifles creativity and  
shortens attention spans among young people. Nielsen Media Research 
estimated the average American TV viewer watched four hours and 
nine minutes of TV each day in March. 
</P>
<P>
	TV networks have never noticed a falloff in viewers during past  
TV Turnoff weeks, said David Poltrack, chief researcher at CBS. In 
fact, during some of the weeks, viewership has actually been above 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that doesn't discriminate and says that for a period  
of time you should watch no television is basically 
self-defeating,'' Poltrack said. ``There's no justification with 
all the good quality programming on television to call for a 
blanket boycott.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An executive with the popular childrens' cable network  
Nickelodeon said she supports the surgeon general's effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon occasionally runs a public service announcement  
called ``Actual Reality,'' encouraging children to experience life 
instead of watching televised versions of it, said Cyma Zarghami, 
Nick's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said it wasn't fair to blame Nick for sedentary kids.  
Studies show kids watch about the same amount of TV as they have 
for the past several years, Zarghami said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we're here as a great alternative for kids,'' she  
said. ``If we weren't here, they wouldn't necessarily be outside 
playing sports.''

                       *Godfrey H.P. Anderson    	
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Godfrey H.P. Anderson, a World War II  
correspondent for The Associated Press who was taken prisoner in 
North Africa, died Tuesday of a stroke. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who was born in London, worked for the AP for 38  
years. He worked as a writer and photo editor for the AP in his 
native country and later served as head of the news cooperative's 
photo bureau in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to serve as a war correspondent in Ethiopia, Egypt,  
Palestine, Syria and France and chief of bureau in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	His duty was interrupted for 3 1/2 years when he was taken prisoner  
in 1941 by German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's forces in Libya and 
held prisoner in German camps in Libya, Italy and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson transferred to the AP's Dallas office in 1970, after  
his wife was offered a job with the Dallas Times Herald. He became 
a U.S. citizen two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Nadeane Walker Anderson, he is survived  
by a son and daughter. 

</P>
<P>
                           *William Bowen    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Former state Sen. William Bowen, a  
champion of civil rights who later sponsored a law giving 
minorities more state contracts, died on Thursday of cancer. He was 
70. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving the Legislature in 1995, the Democrat spent  
nearly 25 years in the Ohio Senate -- believed to be the longest 
term served in the body by a black. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowen was known for sponsoring ``set aside'' legislation  
requiring that some state contracts go to minority-owned businesses 
and for work on tax incentives in high unemployment areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowen was also president of the Cincinnati NAACP from 1958-64,  
where he helped blacks win jobs at private companies and in the 
police department. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the House in 1966 and became the third-ranking  
Democratic leader. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, he was appointed to the Senate. He was elected to the  
seat the same year, later becoming chairman and ranking minority 
member of the Senate Finance Committee. He left the Senate in 
January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite successes on the local and state level, he was defeated  
in two runs for the 1st District U.S. House seat, in 1976 and 1994.

                             *Tom Davis    	
</P>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Tom Davis, founder of Piedmont  
Airlines, died Thursday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis founded Piedmont Aviation, which first sold  
single-propeller planes to private pilots in the 1940s and then 
became one of the country's biggest airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Piedmont completed a merge with US Airways in 1989, when  
Piedmont had about 21,500 employees and annual revenues of $2.5 
billion. After the merger, Davis served as director emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was captivated by aviation at an early age. While in high  
school, he was spending his allowance on flying lessons at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Piedmont's first commercial flight took off on Feb. 20, 1948.  
Davis was on board as the plane taxied onto the runway in 
Wilmington, N.C., and made several stops before terminating in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	After his retirement in 1983, he continued to fly until 1998.

</P>
<P>
	JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Frank J. Pasquerilla, chairman and CEO of  
Crown American Realty Trust, died Wednesday at age 72. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Pasquerilla was on Forbes Magazine's list of the 400  
wealthiest Americans. With his estimated $350 million fortune, he 
was one of 15 Pennsylvanians on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	He shared his wealth, providing a performing arts center for the  
University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown and a $1 million toward 
creation of a heritage discovery center for the city. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Pasquerilla paid the air fare for a 10-year-old  
Bosnian boy, Nebojsa Pisaric, and his mother, Dragica, to go to 
Johnstown so the boy could be treated for his lone failing kidney. 
</P>
<P>
	Crown American Realty owns, operates and develops regional  
shopping malls in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, New 
Jersey, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia. The company 
currently operates 27 malls.

                       *Mary Clark Rockefeller    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mary Clark Rockefeller, a prominent figure in  
the education of nurses and the former first lady of New York 
state, died Wednesday. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rockefeller, the former Mary Todhunter Clark, married  
Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1930 and held several volunteer posts in 
the nurses' education field. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, the New York County Registered Nurses honored her for  
``27 years of outstanding achievement on behalf of the nursing 
profession and the health care of the American people.'' Twelve 
years later, she was given a distinguished service award for work 
on the National League of Nursing's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the 1950s, she also served on the Defense Advisory  
Committee on Women in the Services and the National Advisory Health 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rockefeller was best known as the wife of Rockefeller, who  
was elected governor in 1958. Their divorce in 1962, and 
Rockefeller's remarriage in 1963, was thought by many to have 
weakened his chances for winning the Republican presidential 
nomination in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller, who served as governor until 1973 and was vice  
president from 1974 to 1977 under Gerald Ford, also failed in 1960 
and 1968 bids for the nomination.

                          *Gian-Carlo Rota    	
</P>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Gian-Carlo Rota, a Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology mathematician and philosopher, died Monday 
of heart failure at age 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Rota, who began teaching at MIT in 1959, was the only school  
faculty member ever to hold the title of professor of mathematics 
and philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rota is credited with transforming his specialty area,  
combinatorics, from an insignificant field to one of the most 
important areas of mathematics, said Richard Stanley, an MIT math 
professor and former student of Rota's. 
</P>
<P>
	Rota was the author of seven books, founding editor of three  
journals and the recipient of numerous prizes and honorary degrees. 
He published close to 200 papers in mathematics or philosophy, and 
more than 500 short book reviews.

                           *Su Shueh-lin    	
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Su Shueh-lin, an eminent writer and  
veteran of China's 1919 May Fourth Movement for free expression, 
died Wednesday of complications from a lung infection. She was 104. 
</P>
<P>
	In a career spanning 70 years, Su produced more than 50  
published works, including collections of essays, classical Chinese 
poetry, novels and literary criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Her works had a deep impact on generations of leaders and  
political reformers. Cheng Kung University, where she taught until 
retiring 30 years ago, published a 15-volume collection of her 
life's work and memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Su became caught up in the movement for political, social and  
cultural freedom in May 1919 while a student at Beijing's Women's 
Normal College. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by academics such as Hu Shih, the intellectual revolution  
resulted in Chinese being written for the first time in the 
vernacular, junking the complex, classical style. 
</P>
<P>
	After studying in France, Su returned to teach at various  
universities around China. In the 1930s, she produced her best 
known and most influential works: a novel, ``Thorn Heart,'' and a 
collection of essays, ``Green Sky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recurrent theme in her writing was criticism of communism and  
the intrusion of politics into art and literature. In 1949, Su fled 
to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists ahead of the takeover 
of the mainland by Mao Tse-tung's communists. She returned to 
mainland China only once, last year.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Wins Hoop Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Zalgiris Kaunas, led by American guards  
Anthony Bowie and Tyus Edney, upset defending champion Kinder 
Bologna 82-74 on Thursday to become the first Lithuanian team to 
win the Euroleague title. 
</P>
<P>
	Zalgiris held off a late Kinder rally to win the most  
prestigious club tournament in Europe in its first season in the 
Euroleague. 
</P>
<P>
	In the match for third place, Olympiakos Piraeus beat TeamSystem  
Bologna 74-63. 
</P>
<P>
	Zalgiris took control with its quick transition game and some  
tremendous shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie, who has played for a number of NBA teams, led the  
Lithuanians to a 45-30 halftime lead, shooting 57 percent before 
intermission. They also hit all five 3-point shots, two apiece by 
Bowie and Mindaugas Zukauskas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder shot only 29 percent from the field and made only two of  
eight 3-pointers. Edney, the diminutive point guard from UCLA who 
played for the Sacramento kings, hit a 3-pointer and two 2-pointers 
in the second half to help open a 17-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie finished with 17 points and Edney, voted the MVP of the  
final, had 14.

<HEADLINE> `Civil War' Not Very Involving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Plunk it down in the middle of a historical  
theme park -- in the ``conflict'' pavilion, perhaps -- and ``The 
Civil War'' would be right at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Frank Wildhorn musical chronicling America's bloodiest  
moment suffers from a curious case of the shallows. Despite its 
weighty and emotional subject matter, there is not much involvement 
here, no matter how hard its talented, ballad-belting cast works. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's because ``The Civil War,'' which opened Thursday at  
Broadway's St. James Theater, is a pop song cycle using the War 
Between the States as a backdrop. The show moves relentlessly from 
number to number without any narrative to link it together. As a 
result, it never builds, despite the grim announcement of battle 
names and mounting casualties that periodically are projected on a 
scrim. 
</P>
<P>
	The musical doesn't let the audience learn anything about the  
characters who are singing their hearts out on stage. They are 
types rather than real people. 
</P>
<P>
	You know director Jerry Zaks and his design team are trying for  
something significant right from the beginning of the show. The 
action is artily framed by several large Corinthian columns in 
various stages of decay. The Union is clearly in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The sad stories, compiled by composer Wildhorn and his  
co-authors Gregory Boyd and Jack Murphy, are obvious choices. Army 
commanders -- one for the Blue, the other for the Gray -- eagerly 
lead their troops into battle early in the war. Four weary years 
later, their enthusiasm shattered, they long for an end to the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, the creators give us a parade of people who may have  
names in the theater program but no real life on stage. There is 
the young soldier, destined to be shot by his brother. The wife 
pining for her husband, who inevitably won't be coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening's showiest moments -- not to mention the best songs --  
belong to the slaves. There are some stirring voices here, 
particularly Michel Bell, whose huge bass fills the St. James with 
ease. His sterling sounds are matched by the lovely Cheryl Freeman, 
particularly in one of Wildhorn's more distinctive melodies, 
``River Jordan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the opportunistic camp followers, particularly  
one greedy fellow played with considerable sneer by Leo Burmester. 
But then he has had experience. Burmester portrayed a similar 
rapscallion -- to greater effect -- in ``Les Miserables.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet most of the other performers don't manage to make much of an  
impression beyond getting the job done. They are anonymously 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildhorn, who also composed the music for ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' and  
``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' writes pop songs that play better on CD 
or the radio than on stage. In fact, many are deliberately 
anti-theatrical, expressing emotion or defining character in such 
general terms that they can be inserted into any show. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening's two most affecting moments are not anything  
Wildhorn and company have created. One is the reading of a letter 
written by Abraham Lincoln to a Massachusetts mother who lost five 
sons in the war. The second, at the end of the show, is a cavalcade 
of photographs of real people who took part in the conflict. Both 
instances give a humanity and a sense of emotion to a paper-thin 
musical that is more tableau than theater.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 127.72 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose for the third straight session  
today, as IBM's strong profit report lifted technology shares and 
sent the Dow Jones industrial average further into record 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 127.72 at 10,709.14,  
moving well past Wednesday's new closing high of 10,581.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 15.97 at 1,352.09, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 62.21 at 2,551.29. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM led the Dow, advancing 25 1/2 at 197 3/8 and pushing other  
technology stocks higher as well. After the market closed on 
Wednesday, IBM reported first-quarter earnings of $1.55 a share, 
decisively beating year-ago results of $1.06 and analysts' 
estimates of $1.41. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's results reassured investors who have been nervously  
shuttling between technology issues and more conservative blue-chip 
issues. Today's rally began at 4:01 p.m. Wednesday, said Ed Laux, 
lead stock trader at ABN Amro/The Chicago Corp., ``when IBM's 
earnings came out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell was up 3 1/8 at 41 9/16 and Intel was up 2 11/16 at 61 1/8.  
</P>
<P>
	Other big companies had positive earnings reports, but their  
stock prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron and McDonald's, both Dow components, met analysts'  
forecasts of their first quarter earnings. Shares of Chevron, which 
has struggled with low oil prices, were up 1/2 at 96 7/8 but McDonald's 
were down 7/8 at 44 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent Technologies was up 2 7/8 at 62, GTE fell 13/16 to 66 1/16  
and Bell Atlantic slipped 1 5/16 to 57 3/16. All either met or 
exceeded forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 749.19 million 
shares, up from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 4.56 at 638.27, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 4.11 at 754.70.

<HEADLINE> Pristina Described As a `Dead City' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Hiding behind drawn blinds, huddling in  
dank basements, listening to the daily thunder of NATO bombardment, 
Kosovo Albanians who have stayed behind in Pristina describe a 
daily life dominated by both terror and tedium. 
</P>
<P>
	A ghost town, they say, has replaced the small but vibrant  
provincial capital they knew before the start of the allied bombing 
campaign and the massive Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians the 
NATO airstrikes were meant to stave off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a dead city,'' said Tolga, an ethnic Albanian who  
stayed behind with his wife and 1-year-old son, speaking by 
telephone from Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stay indoors. We watch TV. We listen to the air-raid  
sirens. It's just like being in jail,'' he said, speaking on 
condition his last name not be used for fear of reprisals from the 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliable figures are impossible to come by, but by refugee  
accounts and Western estimates, perhaps two-thirds of Pristina's 
prewar population of 250,000 -- predominantly ethnic Albanians -- has 
fled or been driven out. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb military installations in Kosovo, many of them in and  
around Pristina, have been prime targets during the monthlong NATO 
campaign. The capital has been hammered by almost round-the-clock 
strikes that have destroyed the provincial airport and wrecked 
large areas in the city center. Dozens of missiles slammed into the 
area on Thursday afternoon alone, according to media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb-controlled TV footage from the capital has shown scenes of  
blasted buildings, some with dead bodies visible in the rubble. The 
Serbs do not disclose damage to military targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pristina tradesman Zymer Zeqiri and his wife Lule, who is eight  
months pregnant, spent the past month -- almost the entire bombing 
campaign to date -- living in a cramped basement room with their 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't pick it as a bomb shelter; it was their only refuge  
after being ordered by Serb police to leave their comfortable 
apartment upstairs. The family failed in one attempt to get across 
the border, but finally managed to make it out Wednesday, arriving 
at Macedonia's Brazda refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were afraid all the time in Pristina,'' said Zeqiri, 32. He  
stayed off the streets because, he said, there was no telling what 
would happen to a fighting-age ethnic Albanian man who encountered 
Serb paramilitary men. 
</P>
<P>
	Lule Zeqiri did the shopping, slipping out every few days for  
bread and hurrying home again. She tried to go to the main hospital 
for prenatal care, but was turned away. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, 'Why are you here? You don't belong in this city  
any more,''' she recounted, her belly protruding beneath a pair of 
blue overalls. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's building was close to the bus station, which has  
been hit repeatedly. But the enormous explosions, though 
frightening, heartened them, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know NATO is our only chance,'' Zeqiri said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Zeqiris left almost everything behind when they fled,  
arriving at Brazda with only a few bundles and knapsacks tied with 
twine. 
</P>
<P>
	Those ethnic Albanians who have remained behind in Pristina have  
different reasons for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Some hoped to watch over homes and property; others, like the  
Zeqiris, were turned back at the border when they tried to get out. 
Some had family members too young or too old or too frail for the 
trek out; others came from mixed families and believed Serb 
relatives could shelter them.

	Hafik Toverllani, 29, left the city two weeks ago. He, his wife  
and their 2-year-old daughter stayed on for five days with a friend 
after being driven from their home in an affluent neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	At their own house and their temporary refuge, they stayed  
inside with blinds drawn and ate mainly canned food -- ``nice things 
like pate, which was funny in a way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks in hiding, it was a shock to emerge and see the  
destruction of familiar landmarks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we could hear bombardment very close by, it was  
strange to see the shops and cafes where I always used to go 
destroyed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like others, however, he expressed no qualms about the bombing.  
``We'll rebuild,'' he said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all ethnic Albanians remaining in the city have had their  
telephone service cut, but Tolga has stayed in contact with the 
outside world through a Serb friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we can't go outside or do anything,'' he said in a  
telephone interview from the friend's house. ``Maybe we'll have a 
chance to get out of here, but I wonder where we could go. It's 
very hard to picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tolga said he had heard the Serb police and paramilitary forces  
were too busy elsewhere these days to make house-to-house sweeps in 
the capital. He could only hope it was true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I can't be sure of this,'' he said. ``I'll only  
know if I hear a knock on the door.''

<HEADLINE> Galaxy's Coach Zambrano Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Galaxy replaced coach  
Octavio Zambrano with UCLA coach Sigi Schmid on Thursday after the 
defending MLS Western Conference champions fell to fifth place with 
three goals in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed a change and absolutely believe Sigi is going to  
take us to the next level,'' Galaxy president Tim Leiweke said . 
``Our players were minus a little bit of a spark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt also is coach of the U.S. Under-20 team, eliminated in  
the second round last weekend at the FIFA World Youth Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Ralph Perez will serve as interim coach for  
Saturday night's game against San Jose, and Schmid will make his 
debut May 1 at New York/New Jersey in a matchup against Bora 
Milutinovic. Schmid was an assistant coach for the 1994 U.S. World 
Cup team under Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, 46, received a three-year contract. The Torrance,  
Calif., resident joins the Galaxy after 19 seasons coaching the 
Bruins, guiding them to a 322-63-33 record and the 1985, 1990 and 
1997 NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles had a 24-8 record in 1998, Zambrano's only full  
season as coach, equaling the three-year old league's record for 
victories and scoring a record 85 goals. The team was swept by 
eventual-champion Chicago in the Western Conference final.

<HEADLINE> Janvrin Wins 10th Decathalon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Make it an even 10 for Kip Janvrin in  
the Drake Relays. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong finish lifted Janvrin to his 10th decathlon  
championship in the Drake Relays on Thursday. He won the final four 
events -- the discus, pole vault, javelin and 1,500 meters -- to 
finish with 7,819 points, the fourth-highest total in the world 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 championships are the most by any athlete in the Drake  
Relays. Janvrin, 33, who trailed after six events, won his first 
Drake decathlon as a junior at Simpson College in 1987 and has won 
it the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four or five years ago I kept thinking, well, maybe I could  
get to 10,'' said Janvrin, a track coach at Central Missouri. 
``I've been so lucky to be healthy and be able to get through all 
of these events and be able to stay in good shape as I get older. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I feel very fortunate that I've been able to come back  
every year and do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kamau Sullivan, who is training under Janvrin, was second with  
7,263 points and Montana State's Stevie Keller was third with 
7,168. 
</P>
<P>
	Wichita State's Mellanee Welty came from behind to win the  
heptathlon with 5,185 points. Kathrine Nielsen of Illinois State 
was second with 5,076. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan led Janvrin by nine points after the first day and  
increased his lead to 47 by winning the opening event Thursday, the 
110-meter hurdles. But Janvrin moved into the lead with a throw of 
133 feet, 6 inches in the discus and continued to build it through 
the rest of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to my personal bests, everything was down,'' Janvrin  
said. ``But I realize I'm at a point in my career where personal 
bests aren't going to happen anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran a solid hurdles, had a pretty average discus, a decent  
pole vault, a good javelin and felt real comfortable in the 
1,500,'' he said. ``So, yeah, I'm pleased with today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as pleasing for Janvrin in the cool, damp weather was  
Sullivan's performance. Although he's 29, Sullivan has been a 
decathlete for only four years and has improved markedly in the 
year he has been working with Janvrin. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gives me special pleasure because that makes me feel, and  
hopefully makes him feel, that I'm doing a good job as coach for 
him,'' Janvrin said. ``If he doesn't make progress, then I'd feel 
I'm doing something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have him realize that we must be doing some things right  
now because he's performing well will hopefully reinforce what 
we're doing and make him work harder to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welty, the 1998 Missouri Valley Conference champion in the  
heptathlon, took the lead in the next-to-last event with a throw of 
120-1 in the javelin. She had trailed Alcorn State's Millicent 
Sylvan by 102 points going into that event, but Sylvan threw only 
75-4 and fell out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't throw as well as I wanted to,'' Welty said.  
``I wanted to throw about 125. But I threw pretty well. I was 
pleased just to get it because my first two javelins weren't very 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvan won the first event of the day, the long jump, and  
finished third overall with 4,694 points. Valparaiso's Karie 
Dahlgren won the final event, the 800. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping to long jump a little farther,'' said Welty,  
whose point total was the best of her career. ``That was kind of 
disappointing. I couldn't hit the board. Other than that, I was 
hoping to run the 800 a little faster, but I won so I guess I can't 
really complain.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sharply Higher; Dow Up 77.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher Thursday as IBM's  
stronger-than-expected profit report lifted technology shares and 
sent the Dow Jones industrial average further into record high 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 77.04 at 10,658.46,  
moving well past Wednesday's closing high of 10,581.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 10.88 to 1,347.00, and the Nasdaq composite 
index rose 51.55 to 2,540.63. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market closed on Wednesday, Dow component IBM reported  
first-quarter earnings of $1.55 a share, decisively beating 
year-ago results of $1.06 and analysts' estimates of $1.41. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's results reassured a market that, while rising, has been  
nervously shuttling between technology issues and more conservative 
blue-chip issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's trading, IBM shot up 24 to 195 7/8, a gain of nearly 14  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron and McDonald's, two other Dow components, met analysts  
forecasts, for their first quarter earnings. Chevron was down 1 
1/16 to 95 1/16 and McDonald's was up 3/8 to 45 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 134.3 million shares, 
up from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 3.20 at 636.91, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 4.60 to 755.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.6 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 down 0.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Italian-German Telecom Deal OKd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA and Deutsche Telekom AG have  
agreed on one of the biggest corporate marriages ever, a deal that 
would create the world's second-largest telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia accepted Deutsche Telecom's offer that valued the  
Italian company at about $82 billion at Wednesday's closing prices 
after receiving assurances that the new company would not fall 
under the control of the German government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that this will be the first step in the  
creation of Europe's first telecommunications powerhouse,'' Telecom 
Italia chief executive Franco Bernabe told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would create Europe's largest phone company -- one big  
enough to compete with overseas giants like AT&AMP;T Corp. of the 
United States and British Telecommunications PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies must now win over shareholders and regulatory  
authorities in the United States and the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom chief executive Ron Sommer said the partners  
were trying to create a truly pan-European company worthy of a new 
era symbolized by the euro, the common currency shared by 11 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our operation is very much in line with the integration  
process of Europe,'' he said at a joint news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined entity, which has not yet been given a name, would  
have revenues of $62.8 billion and an operating profit of $13.9 
billion, based on 1998 figures. It would have more than 100 million 
customers, mostly in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company would be run out of joint headquarters in  
Bonn and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, each share of Deutsche Telekom would be  
exchanged for three ordinary voting shares of Telecom Italia stock, 
valuing each share in the Italian company at $12.75 as of 
Wednesday's closing share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Telecom Italia's savings shares would be exchanged  
at a rate of 5.61 for each share of Deutsche Telekom. The deal also 
provides that the newly formed company will assume Telecom Italia's 
debts of approximately $8.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement would give Deutsche Telekom about 56 percent of  
the new company, with Telecom Italia controlling the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger agreement was prompted by Telecom Italia's effort to  
avoid a hostile takeover bid from its smaller Italian rival 
Olivetti SpA. Olivetti has offered $12.19 for each share of Telecom 
Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners expect the merger to save them more than $635  
million in the first year alone, with savings increasing in ensuing 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe and Sommer, who will be joint chief executives and  
chairmen, refused to say how many jobs would be cut if the merger 
is completed. The combined company would have 304,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our vision is a vision of growth. It is not a vision of  
job-cutting,'' Sommer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company would rank second in the world in terms of  
revenues after Japanese telecommunications giant NTT, which posted 
sales last year of $69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom had a market capitalization of about $105  
billion while Telecom Italia was worth about $67 billion, based on 
Wednesday's closing share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In value, the merger would rival the biggest merger to date --  
the pending deal between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., which was 
worth about $82 billion as of late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe and Sommer are pinning their hopes for global success on  
the growth potential for cellular phones and the Internet, and for 
expansion into new markets -- especially the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer refused to confirm whether Deutsche Telekom was planning  
a much-rumored takeover of Sprint Corp., the No. 3 U.S. 
long-distance phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe made it clear, however, that such a takeover bid was not  
impossible. ``The United States will be the next area of 
expansion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two formerly state-controlled companies struck their deal  
after the German government assured the Italian Treasury that it 
would not use its voting rights in Deutsche Telekom to dominate the 
merged business. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government owns about 72 percent of Deutsche Telekom,  
but that will drop to 66 percent when the company issues new shares 
this summer. The government's share would decrease to about 40 
percent under terms of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia.

<HEADLINE> Kovalev Misses 1st Devils Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Forward Alexei Kovalev missed the  
opening game of the Pittsburgh Penguins' first-round playoff series 
with the New Jersey Devils on Thursday night because of a sprained 
right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Kovalev, whose 23 goals were third on the team, was hurt in  
Sunday's regular-season finale against the New York Rangers in a 
freakish play. His stick got stuck in the boards at Madison Square 
Garden late in the third period and his wrist was bent when he was 
pushed from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried it Wednesday and wasn't able to shoot and wasn't able  
to pass and every time I get a pass from somebody else, it's so 
painful,'' Kovalev said. ``It was way better today and I'm really 
happy about that. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I can't stick-handle fast, I can only do it in slow  
motion,'' he added. ``I can't shoot with a quick release.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kovalev expects to play on Saturday in Game 2 of the best-of-7  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquired from the Rangers on Nov. 25, Kovalev had 20 goals and  
26 assists in 63 games with Pittsburgh. He had three goals and four 
assists in 14 games with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 44 career playoff games, Kovalev has 16 goals and 23 assists.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- After agreeing to a merger that would form the  
world's second largest telecommunications company, Telecom Italia 
SpA and Deutsche Telekom AG must now win over shareholders and 
regulatory authorities to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Telecom Italia formally accepted a proposal  
Wednesday to merge with Deutsche Telekom, after receiving 
reassurances the new company would not fall under the control of 
the German government. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, worth about $79 billion, could be the biggest merger  
in history, creating Europe's largest telecommunications company to 
compete with overseas giants like AT&AMP;T of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, each share of Deutsche Telekom will be exchanged  
for three ordinary voting shares of Telecom Italia stock, valuing 
each share in the Italian company at $12.28. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Telecom Italia's savings shares will be exchanged  
at a rate of 5.61 for each share of Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement would give Deutsche Telekom about 57 percent of

<P>
	The merger agreement was prompted by Telecom Italia's effort to  
avoid a hostile takeover bid from its smaller Italian rival 
Olivetti SpA. Olivetti has offered $12.19 for each share of Telecom 
Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia's share price was trading at $10.59 early today  
in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal between the two state-controlled companies came after  
the German government advised the Italian Treasury that it would 
not use its voting rights to dominate the merged business. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's board approved the merger in principle Tuesday, but  
was awaiting clarification on how the German government would 
reduce its controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Finance Ministry, the majority shareholder in Deutsche  
Telekom, wrote to Telecom Italia Wednesday to allay concerns that a 
merger would amount to a takeover by the German government of 
Italy's flagship phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (German) government's philosophy is not to interfere with  
management decisions'' of privatized companies, ministry spokesman 
Torsten Albig told reporters in Bonn. ``We believe this creates a 
basis for further negotiations between the two companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With combined revenues of about $63 billion and a market value  
of nearly $200 billion, the merged company would rank second in the 
world after Japanese telecommunications giant NTT, which posted 
sales last year of $69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about  
$117 billion while Telecom Italia is worth about $77 billion. A 
merger of the two could exceed the value of the pending deal 
between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., which was worth about $85 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	However the companies must still gain approval for the deal from  
antitrust authorities in the European Union and the United States. 
Shareholder approval is also uncertain.

	Steel Imports Up After Reductions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- March shipments of foreign steel increased 25  
percent after four consecutive months of reductions, the Commerce 
Department reported today. Nevertheless, Commerce Secretary William 
M. Daley declared that the Clinton administration's policy on 
combating steel imports was working, an indication officials would 
not seek stronger trade sanctions soon against Japan and other 
steel-producing countries. The one-month increase could help boost 
support in the Senate for quotas on foreign shipments. Last month, 
the House overwhelmingly passed a quota bill despite the threat of 
a presidential veto.

supplies for President Slobodan Milosevic's war machine and 
factories, officials said today. The EU is appealing to Cyprus and 
11 eastern European nations due to join the economic bloc to back 
the embargo. Final approval will come at an EU foreign ministers 
meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, and the ban is to be in place by 
Wednesday, said EU spokesman Nigel Gardner. The EU, however, 
planned to make special aid available to Montenegro, whose 
government has distanced itself from Serbia's policy on Kosovo.

	Pirated Movies Turn Up on Web  
</P>
<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- The same technology that allows for  
the spread of bootlegged music over the Internet is now threatening 
the movie industry. Film filchers have begun distributing illegal 
copies of hot flicks like ``The Matrix'' using a data format 
similar to the so-called MP3 files that are being used to spread 
free music across cyberspace. While the data files containing 
full-length movies are too big for the average home computer user 
to conveniently download, it works using high-speed hookups. The

	MONTREAL (AP) -- Abitibi-Consolidated Inc., the world's No. 1  
newsprint producer, announced a restructuring that includes 
eliminating up to 1,300 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force. The

	U.S. Says APEC Should Act on Y2K  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Time for talking about the Y2K problem has run  
out in the Asia-Pacific region and leaders must begin seeking 
solutions, the top U.S. millennium bug troubleshooter said today. 
The warning by John Koskinen, head of the President's Council on 
Year 2000 Conversion, came a day after the Clinton administration 
predicted the greatest threat to America from the Year 2000 glitch 
could come from computer failures overseas. In its latest report on 
preparing for the Y2K problem, the White House has said failures 
are all but certain in some foreign countries because of their late 
efforts to fix systems.

	'Dollarization' Seen As Risky  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If several Latin American countries decide to  
adopt the U.S. dollar as their own currency, American exporters 
would stand to benefit although there would also be risks to the 
U.S. economy, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told 
Congress today. Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
appeared before a Senate Banking subcommittee to discuss the 
economic impact of ``dollarization.'' Both Greenspan and Summers 
emphasized that dollarization would work only if a nation were 
willing to pursue economic reform in all areas. Argentina is 
actively considering taking this approach and several other Latin 
America countries, including Mexico, have expressed interest.

	RJR Profit Skids 54 Percent

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s underlying profit  
skidded 54 percent in the first quarter due to tobacco lawsuit 
settlement expenses and the fallout from last year's steep price 
hikes. The owner of the nation's second-biggest tobacco company, 
led by its Camel and Winston brands, said it lost ground in the 
U.S. cigarette market even as industry leader Philip Morris Cos. 
Inc. gained. The results were below Wall Street's expectations. 
Before one-time charges, RJR earned $83 million, or 24 cents a 
share, in the three months ended March 3. RJR shares were up 7/16 
at 26 3/16.

29 cents a share, from $362.2 million, or 26 cents a share, in the 
comparable period a year earlier. The results met the expectations 
of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. Systemwide sales -- which 
include business at franchised restaurants as well as company-owned 
outlets -- rose 8 percent to $8.8 billion from $8.18 billion. 
McDonald's own revenues also rose 8 percent, to $3.03 billion from 
$2.8 billion. McDonald's stock was down 11/16 at 44 11/16.

<HEADLINE> Harper's Bazaar Fashion Editor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Liz Tilberis first used her drive and talent to  
become a leader in fashion publishing. When illness struck six 
years ago, she turned the same energy toward fighting ovarian 
cancer, for herself and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilberis died of the disease Wednesday at age 51.  
</P>
<P>
	Tilberis, who spent 22 years at British Vogue before becoming  
editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar in 1992, was admitted Friday to 
Mount Sinai Medical Center, where she died, said Harper's spokesman 
Paul Luthringer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous loss. She was a very enthusiastic and brave  
person,'' said the designer Oscar de la Renta, a longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``She really turned around the magazine,'' de la Renta said.  
``The most extraordinary thing, though, is how she used her illness 
to raise awareness and give hope to thousands of people inflicted 
with that disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tilberis was diagnosed in 1993. She became president of the  
Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Inc. in 1997 and spoke out about the 
disease at every opportunity -- in interviews, in her magazine and 
in a 1998 memoir, ``No Time To Die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was to be honored in June with the Humanitarian Award from  
the Council of Fashion Designers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview last May, Tilberis described ``the great wake-up  
call'' her cancer gave her. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can live in the fashion world and go to fashion shows and  
have your picture taken,'' she said. ``But there's an important 
balance with what really goes on in life, which is sickness and 
suffering and people dying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Shirehampton, England, Tilberis joined Harper's Bazaar  
in 1992, the year the Hearst Magazines publication marked its 125th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilberis began her career in 1970 at British Vogue, rising  
quickly to executive fashion editor, editor in chief and finally 
director of Conde Nast Publications in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilberis was nominated in 1994 and 1995 for the National  
Magazine Award for excellence in photography and design. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilberis -- who despised bright colors and floral prints and  
primarily wore black, gray or white -- quipped that the benefits of 
her cancer were a becoming, closely cropped hairdo and the loss of 
30 pounds from her petite 5-foot-7 frame. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Klein described her as ``always cheerful and the essence  
of grace, dignity and courage -- a fighter to the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include her husband, artist Andrew Tilberis, and their  
sons, Christopher, 14, and Robert, 17. Funeral arrangements were 
incomplete.

<HEADLINE> US Women Beat China 2-1 in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Tisha Venturini scored the game-winning goal  
in the 92nd minute as the U.S. national women's team beat China 2-1 
Thursday night in an exhibition game leading up to this summer's 
Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm set up the game-winner by taking a pass down the left  
side of the field and firing a crossing shot from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball popped out of Han Wenxia's hands and Venturini slid in  
after a 30-yard sprint to knock in into the net. She had only 
entered the game two minutes earlier as the substitute for Kristine 
Lilly, the top U.S. scorer this season. 
</P>
<P>
	China had tied the game at 1-1 in the 59th minute when Sun Wen  
looped a direct free kick into the lower left corner from 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Akers' penalty shot gave the United States a 1-0 lead  
in the 20th minute, but the United States could have scored even 
more as it dominated the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm set up that goal too, drawing the penalty when she raced  
through China's defense to take a pass and charged the goalie. Wen 
Lirong tripped her before she could take a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States avenged its only loss of the year, 2-1 to  
China in the Algarve Cup final March 20 in Portugal. China had not 
beaten the U.S. since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States beat China 2-1 in 1996 to win the first-ever  
Olympic gold medal in women's soccer.

<HEADLINE> Hot-Hitting D'backs Go on the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Much was made of the Arizona Diamondbacks'  
pitching potential after their off-season free-agent spending 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody said much about offense.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet led by a resurgent Matt Williams, the Diamondbacks are  
smacking the ball with the best of them in the early season. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona is third in the NL in batting with a .280 average and  
the Diamondbacks are the runaway leaders in the majors in home runs 
with 30. The pitching, too, has lived up to expectations. Arizona 
is third in the league with a 3.68 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 1-5 start on the road, the Diamondbacks went 8-2 in a  
homestand against Los Angeles, San Francisco and Philadelphia. 
They've won four in a row heading into their longest road trip of 
the season, with stops in San Diego, Houston, Milwaukee and 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in their young history, the Diamondbacks have  
a winning record, two heady games above .500, and the catalyst has 
been Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	He leads the majors in multihit games with nine. He's batting a  
team-leading .357 with five homers, seven doubles and 15 RBIs. At 
33, he's off to one of the best starts of his long career. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing a five-year, $45 million contract extension  
following his trade from Cleveland, Williams seemed uncomfortable 
as one of the few recognizable players on a struggling expansion 
team last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit .267 and managed just 71 RBIs while being bothered by  
nagging injuries most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of pride. He cares,'' manager Buck Showalter  
said. ``He takes on the needs of the team. There's no way he could 
have supplied everything this club needed last year, even though he 
tried. I think it's help having some guys come in here to share the 
load. He seems a lot more relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the off-season, Williams got married. He worked out  
rigorously, and watched as the Diamondbacks brought in pitchers 
Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre, Armando Reynoso and Greg Swindell, 
along with centerfielder Steve Finley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks got Luis Gonzalez in a trade with Detroit for  
Karim Garcia, and brought in Tony Womack in a deal for a minor 
leaguer and a player yet to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, whose three-run homer off Curt Schilling was the  
difference in Arizona's 4-2 victory over Philadelphia Wednesday 
night, says he's just trying to keep it simple at the plate, and he 
downplays the significance of the arrival of the other veteran 
players in his hot start. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you walk to the plate, it's you and the pitcher, and when  
he releases it, it's simply you and the baseball,'' Williams said. 
``You try to put a good swing on a good pitch. That's as deep as 
I'm going to go with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is far from alone when it comes to Arizona offense  
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, looking like a steal from Detroit, is hitting .346  
with six home runs. Jay Bell has rebounded from last year's sub-par 
season and is hitting .299 with five homers. He was the NL's player 
of the week last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Gilkey, after refusing to restructure his contract to be  
traded for Womack, is hitting .333 with four homers in part-time 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt's been awesome,'' Stottlemyre said. ``Obviously he's  
always been a great defensive player. He's had a great approach all 
spring. Him, Jay Bell, Gonzo (Gonzalez), everybody. The approach 
and the professionalism that guys have had since day one of spring 
training has been awesome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a tough first week that kind of tested the character of  
the ball club, and everybody kept coming to the ballpark with the 
same approach, try to play the game right and play hard. We've had 
a nice home stretch and we're going to be bouncing around the 
country the next couple of weeks. There are some new challenges 
coming up.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical Earnings Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co. reported its  
first-quarter earnings fell nearly 22 percent as sales were pinched 
by overseas economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Thursday it earned $329 million, or $1.47 per  
share, down from $421 million, or $1.77 per share, in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Chemical's results beat the $1.31 expected by analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Dow fell 93 3/4 cents a  
share to $112.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported sales of $4.42 billion, down 9 percent from  
$4.83 billion a year ago. Sales volume rose 2 percent but was 
offset by an 11 percent price drop, which means Dow Chemical sold 
more products but at a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many U.S. manufacturers, the company's business has been  
affected by the economic problems in Asia, Latin America, Russia 
and other parts of the world. The financial problems overseas have 
depressed demand for products including chemicals, and forced 
companies to lower their prices.

<HEADLINE> Cooke Withdraws Redskins Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Team president John Kent Cooke unexpectedly  
withdrew his bid for the Washington Redskins on Thursday, and The 
Associated Press has learned that the team's trustees are close to 
a making a deal to sell the team to communications executive Daniel 
Snyder for $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke, apparently ending his dream of owning the team his father  
owned, pulled out with a statement indicative of his ongoing 
frustration with the trustees overseeing his father's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week I presented a greatly increased offer ... for the  
Washington Redskins and Jack Kent Cooke Stadium,'' Cooke said. 
``The executors failed to act on my offer and today I have 
withdrawn it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to be used merely to increase the bids of others,  
since it is well known that I have always wanted to keep the 
Redskins in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees have essentially ignored Cooke's latest offer,  
which he said was higher than the $680 million bid he made last 
fall, and have chosen instead to negotiate directly with Snyder, 
according to sources close to the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was a partner with New York estate developer Howard  
Milstein in an $800 million offer that in January was named the 
winner in a round of bidding conducted by the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milstein withdrew the bid earlier this month when it became  
apparent that NFL owners would not approve it. The owners said 
Milstein was using too much borrowed money to finance the purchase, 
and there were also concerns about the type of owner he would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, head of Bethesda, Md.-based Snyder Communications, did  
have ready cash behind his bid and was well received by some NFL 
owners. He has since assembled his own group that includes 
publishing executives Mort Zuckerman and Fred Drasner to match the 
$800 million offer he originally made with Milstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources told the AP that a deal with Snyder could be  
completed within 10 days and presented to the owners at the May 
25-26 league meetings in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	League officials refused to comment, but commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue indicated Saturday that the matter could be resolved in 
``an expedited schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``(It's possible) we would present something at our league  
meeting in May, if not before,'' Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kent Cooke died April 6, 1997. Rather than leave the  
Redskins to his son, he instructed that the Redskins be sold and 
the process used to establish a scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the trustees declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Inner City Companies Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An Internet service provider, a computer  
peripheral manufacturer and a digital photographic services company 
are among the fastest growing companies based in core cities in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural ``Inner City 100'' list was announced Thursday  
night at a dinner sponsored by Inc. Magazine and the Initiative for 
a Competitive Inner City, a nonprofit group that promotes business 
development in inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope this inaugural Inner City 100 list will prove to be a  
milestone in raising national awareness of the tremendous potential 
for business development in America's inner cities,'' said Michael 
Porter, a Harvard Business School professor who heads ICIC. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the top companies was Shore.Net, a Lynn, Mass.-based  
Internet service provider catering to small businesses that also 
hosts Web sites. It's had an 8,500 percent growth rate over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no disadvantage to being in the inner city,'' said  
Shore.Net's CEO, Lowell Gray, 38, in an interview beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the rest of America really understands this,''  
he said. ``I think that the people of America would be really happy 
to know this and would be encouraged that there's a possibility to 
improving our society and quality of life going into the 21st 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these businesses serve businesses that are  
downtown,'' said George Gendron, editor-in-chief of Inc. ``Most of 
them are serving a national market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive officers cited proximity to customers, low land  
costs and available labor as the top three competitive advantages 
of locating a business in the core city. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're starting to see a business renaissance that may be the  
equivalent of the urban renaissance,'' said Gendron, referring to 
the 1980s phenomenon that saw adults who grew up in the suburbs 
move to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked No. 1 was Indianapolis-based Pac-Van, which leases and  
sells vans, trailers and mobile offices. The company has locations 
in 17 different cities around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Gendron said typical of the successful inner city company is  
Chicago-based Fatigues, a $30 million apparel company. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatigues, like many inner city companies, is owned by a  
husband-and-wife team and housed in a rehabbed industrial building, 
Gendron said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a kind of urban chic, corporate chic to all of this,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Research into what made inner-city companies tick showed no  
correlation between government programs and business success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Empowerment zones or enterprise zones, it seems as if they  
don't make much difference,'' Gendron said. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for the list, a company had to have 51 percent of its  
operations in inner-city areas, sales of at least $1 million in 
1997, a five-year operating sales history that includes an increase 
in 1997 over 1996, and 10 or more employees.

                           *Ralph J. Perk    	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Former Mayor Ralph J. Perk, whose borrowing to  
balance the budget came to symbolize a city in decline, died 
Wednesday of cancer. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Perk, a Republican who was popular in Cleveland's traditionally  
Democratic ethnic neighborhoods, was mayor from 1972 to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The former city councilman and county auditor was defeated for  
re-election in 1977, one year before Cleveland became the first 
major U.S. city since the Depression to default on its financial 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	The city, its manufacturing base hurt by the recession in the  
1970s, borrowed almost $130 million to pay its bills during Perk's 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Perk, who had been elected on an anti-tax platform, cut the  
hours and pay of city employees 10 percent to balance the budget. 
City clerks, trash collectors and non-teaching school employees all

</P>
<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Actor and bandleader Charles  
``Buddy'' Rogers, star of the first film to win the best-picture 
Oscar and husband of screen legend Mary Pickford, died Wednesday. 
He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers made his screen debut in 1926 with Paramount's  
``Fascinating Youth.'' A year later, as the silent-movie era waned, 
Rogers starred in ``Wings,'' which took Hollywood's top honor at 
the first Academy Awards ceremony in May 1929. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers married Miss Pickford in 1936, after her marriage to  
fellow superstar Douglas Fairbanks fell apart. She died in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Pickford ended her film career after only a handful of  
talking films, but Rogers remained active on screen through the 
'30s and early '40s. 
</P>
<P>
	He had roles in films such as ``Young Eagles,'' ``This Way  
Please'' and ``Mexican Spitfire's Baby,'' earning the nickname 
``America's Boyfriend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When television became popular, he became a regular on the  
``Cavalcade of Bands'' on the Dumont network in 1951.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mary Clark Rockefeller, a prominent figure in  
the education of nurses and the former first lady of New York 
state, died Wednesday. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rockefeller, the former Mary Todhunter Clark, married  
Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1930 and held several volunteer posts in 
the field of nurses' education. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, the New York County Registered Nurses honored her for  
``27 years of outstanding achievement on behalf of the nursing 
profession and the health care of the American people.'' Twelve 
years later, she was given a distinguished service award for work 
on the National League of Nursing's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the 1950s, Mrs. Rockefeller also served on the Defense  
Advisory Committee on Women in the Services and the National 
Advisory Health Council. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Mrs. Rockefeller was perhaps best known as the wife of  
Rockefeller, who was elected governor in 1958. Their divorce in 
1962, and Rockefeller's remarriage in 1963, was thought by many to 
have weakened his chances for winning the Republican presidential 
nomination in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller, who served as governor until 1973 and was vice  
president from 1974 to 1977 under Gerald Ford, also failed in 1960 
and 1968 bids for the nomination.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Liz Tilberis, a fashion editor who used her  
public platform at Harper's Bazaar to raise awareness of ovarian 
cancer, died Wednesday of the disease. She was 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tilberis, editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar after a long  
career at British Vogue, was diagnosed with cancer in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped raise money for a cure as president of the Ovarian  
Cancer Research Fund and described her battle with the disease last 
year in a memoir, ``No Time to Die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tilberis joined Harper's in 1992. She introduced more art  
features and high-quality fashion journalism, and brought on board 
internationally renowned fashion photographers Patrick DeMarchelier 
and Peter Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tilberis began her career at British Vogue in 1970, rising  
through the ranks to become executive fashion editor, editor in 
chief and finally director of Conde Nast Publications in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include her husband, Andrew Tilberis, and two sons.

</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Lucille Vore, who starred as ``Baby Lucille''  
in the original ``Our Gang'' comedy films, died April 8. She was 
82. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Vore was discovered at age 4 by a movie director as she  
daintily removed a pair of white gloves while riding on the San 
Diego Trolley. In 1920, she won the ``Our Gang'' role after she was 
chosen over 400 little girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed ``Baby Lucille,'' Ms. Vore was the youngest in the ``Our  
Gang'' cast, known for its on-screen mischief and ability to escape 
any serious consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1920s, she appeared in three movies as a stand-in  
for Barbara Stanwyck, but left acting soon after to become a 
registered nurse. In 1970, she starred in a stage production of 
``Little Murders'' at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego.

<HEADLINE> Professor's Invention Wins $500,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A microelectronics pioneer whose early work  
on minuscule transistors helped power the information age won the 
world's single largest award for invention on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Carver Mead, a professor of engineering and applied science at  
the California Institute of Technology, was awarded the $500,000 
Lemelson-MIT prize in a ceremony at the city's Exploratorium 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very surprised,'' Mead said. ``The previous awards were  
all given to people who had one big blockbuster patent. And I don't 
have one of those, so it never occurred to me that I was a 
candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mead's innovations also include a standard amplifying device  
used in microwave communication systems, which people use every day 
when making telephone calls or dialing into the Internet, and a 
hearing aid powered by a digital microchip. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made a video where they interviewed a number of people  
that had those hearing aids, and it makes you cry,'' said Mead, 65. 
``These people are saying, 'This thing has changed my life. I can 
hear my grandchildren now.' That's very satisfying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mead is best known for his work on transistors, a project  
that he began in 1968 on a suggestion from Gordon Moore of 
Integrated Electronics -- later Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moore's Law'' -- that computer chips would continue to double  
in power while remaining the same size and price -- has since become 
a truism in the computer industry. But in 1970, Mead's forecast 
that the transistor could be reduced to .15 microns was 
revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, a human hair is 20 microns in diameter and a  
wavelength of invisible light is half a micron, Mead explained in 
an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to show that we were nowhere near the limits,'' he  
said. ``It was pretty counterculture at the time to take a position 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet his forecast has nearly come true: Today the smallest  
transistor is .18 microns. 
</P>
<P>
	Mead, who lives in Woodside, Calif., said he plans to use the  
prize money to help support companies that have been launched by 
his former students. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was honored with a lifetime  
achievement award. Ms. Kwolek, who lives in Delaware and did not 
attend Thursday's ceremony, developed a fiber that eventually 
became known as Kevlar, best known for its use in bulletproof 
vests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemelson-MIT prize, awarded since 1995, is funded by Jerome  
Lemelson, who earned millions from the nearly 500 patents he was 
awarded for parts used in camcorders, radios, computers and other 
devices. Lemelson died in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners are picked for inventions that succeed commercially,  
improve the quality of life and help strengthen the United States 
competitively.

<HEADLINE> American Express Earnings Up in 1Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Express Co.'s first-quarter earnings  
rose 14 percent on strong revenue growth at its Travel Related 
Services and financial advisers businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial services firm said its earnings totaled $575  
million, or $1.26 a share, up from $520 million, or $1.11 per 
share, in the same quarter in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 figure does not reflect a $138 million charge for  
additions to reserves to cover bad loans at American Express Bank. 
The company also had one-time income of $78 million from the sale 
of First Data Corp.shares and a preferred dividend based on 
earnings from Lehman Brothers stock. 
</P>
<P>
	When those items are included in earnings calculations, American  
Express' income rose 25 percent in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose nearly 12 percent to $4.51 billion from $4.03  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat analysts expectations by a penny, according to  
First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street was satisfied with the company's results, bidding  
American Express stock up $2.31 1/4 to $137.18 3/4 a share on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express said its Travel Related Services division,  
which includes its charge card operations, had a 15 percent 
increase in income, to $363 million from $315 million. The company 
reported charge card customers increased their spending during the 
quarter from year-earlier levels, which offset a general tightening 
of corporate travel and entertainment spending and American 
Express' withdrawal from business with the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express Financial Advisors recorded a 15 percent  
earnings increase, to $214 million from $186 million. The division 
benefited from financial market activity that gave it increased 
fees for asset management. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express Bank, which includes the company's banking and  
travelers check businesses, had a profit of $41 million, compared 
with an $83 million loss a year ago, when the company added to its 
reserves for loan losses. The addition was made because of the 
economic crisis in Asia.

<HEADLINE> GOP Loses Procedural Vote on S.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After losing a key procedural vote Thursday,  
Senate Republicans for now have dropped a key part of their budget 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would have made it more difficult for lawmakers to  
spend government surpluses that come from Social Security taxes, as 
opposed to income taxes, on anything besides shoring up the 
retirement program or reducing the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate GOP leaders had tried a procedural maneuver to override  
Democratic leadership objections to bringing the measure to a vote 
on the Senate floor on Thursday. But the strategy, which would have 
required agreement by 60 senators -- a greater majority than 
Republicans hold -- failed to win even a single Democratic vote. The 
procedural vote failed 54-45, falling six votes short. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders said they would try again to bring the Social  
Security proposal up at an undetermined later date. 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional Democrats strongly object to the legislation.  
The Clinton administration has threatened a veto, saying the 
proposal would hinder the government's day-to-day cash flow without 
actually doing anything to help Social Security out of a financial 
crisis looming after baby boomers retire.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mary Clark Rockefeller, a prominent figure in  
the education of nurses and the former first lady of New York 
state, died at her Manhattan home. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rockefeller, the former Mary Todhunter Clark, died  
Wednesday. She married the future governor of New York, Nelson A. 
Rockefeller, in 1930 and went on to several volunteer posts in the 
field of nurses' education.

<P>
	However, Mrs. Rockefeller was perhaps best known as the wife of  
the former governor. The couple separated in 1961 and divorced the 
following year, following Rockefeller's successful 1958 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Their divorce, and Rockefeller's remarriage in 1963, is thought  
by many political commentators to have weakened the governor's

	Mrs. Rockefeller, described as witty and intelligent by John D.  
Rockefeller biographer Ron Chernow, was raised in Bala-Cynwd, Pa., 
and studied at Foxcroft in Middleburg, Va., and the Sorbonne in 
Paris.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic May Accept U.N. `Presence' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia's top leader will accept  
a U.N.-led force in Kosovo, but only if the bombing stops and NATO 
withdraws troops from his borders, a Russian envoy said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether such an international presence would be  
armed and under what guidelines it would operate. NATO has insisted 
it must lead an armed presence in Kosovo to enforce any peace 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	President Slobodan Milosevic has so far rejected NATO demands to  
withdraw his troops from Kosovo and grant autonomy to the ethnic 
Albanian majority there. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a daylong meeting with Milosevic, former Russian  
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin told reporters the two ``considered 
conditions for the return of the refugees'' and allowing 
international aid agencies into the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``We considered the possibility of an international presence led  
by the U.N. in which Russia would take part. Those are the basic 
principles we agreed upon,'' Chernomyrdin said, according to the 
ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that they also discussed ``the continuation of talks  
about wide autonomy for Kosovo, the possible decrease of Serb 
forces in Kosovo and simultaneous withdrawal of NATO forces from 
the Yugoslav borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two similar peace bids carried out by the Russians ended in  
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 14, the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko,  
said during an appearance here with Milosevic that the Yugoslavs 
would be willing to accept unarmed civilian monitors to be sent to 
Kosovo by the United Nations or by non-NATO countries. NATO and the 
United States never accepted that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov met with  
Milosevic on Mar. 30, but failed to produce a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, asked in Washington to comment, said he had  
not studied the offer but added, ``I suppose that represents some 
step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is true, it is at least the first acknowledgment by Mr.  
Milosevic that a security force is needed there,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was encouraged by news  
that Yugoslavia would accept an international presence in Kosovo 
and ``eagerly awaits the details,'' according to a statement 
through his spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Before departing for Moscow, Chernomyrdin said that what kind of  
international force it will be or from which countries it would be 
assembled had not yet been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin said talks with NATO leadership will be continued  
on Friday, both over the phone and with one of the alliance's 
leaders in Moscow, ITAR-Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Milosevic's office, however, made no mention of  
any international force. It also gave no indication the Yugoslav 
leader had softened his hard-line stance. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Milosevic and Chernomyrdin ``condemned the aggression of  
NATO'' and said it must be stopped immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement added that Yugoslavia and Russia were committed to  
``jointly work for a peaceful resolution of the problems in Kosovo, 
and that can be achieved only through political means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in  
Moscow that the country will keep its nuclear forces on the 
``highest level'' of combat readiness because of the NATO 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	A top official at the military's General Staff, Col. Gen. Valery  
Manilov, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Russia 
may begin supplying weapons to Yugoslavia if NATO sends in ground 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin, however, has insisted that Russia would  
not intervene militarily, despite its anger over NATO's actions. 
And NATO has so far denied plans to send ground troops to 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev has said Russia could beef up combat units because of  
the Kosovo crisis, but it remains unclear whether the government 
will find the cash to do so. The military has been cut back in 
recent years and is short of everything from weapons to food 
because of Russia's economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has been trying to mediate a political settlement for  
Kosovo, though it has yet to offer any concrete suggestions on how 
to implement a peace that would satisfy both Belgrade and NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament, Gennady  
Seleznyov, said Thursday there is growing pressure for Russia to 
send military aid to help Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one advanced Russian anti-aircraft missile system would  
enable the Yugoslav military to shoot down dozens of NATO planes 
and halt the air attacks, Seleznyov claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev reiterated the  
Kremlin's refusal to provide military aid to Yugoslavia.

	Several Killed in Military Crash  
</P>
<P>
	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- A military helicopter crashed today  
during a training mission at Fort Campbell, killing several aboard. 
Army officials said there were 10 to 14 casualties, but said they 
did not know how many were killed. ``We know there are some 
fatalities,'' said Col. John Smith, an Army spokesman at the 
Pentagon. The UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crashed about 7 a.m. on 
the sprawling Army post, said Capt. Truitt Cockrell at Fort 
Campbell. The victims were taken to Blanchfield Army Community 
Hospital on the post, and some were transported to other hospitals,

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Months before they massacred a dozen  
students and a teacher, two high school students made a video 
portraying themselves in trench coats, shooting athletes as they 
walk down their school hallway. The video was made for a class last 
fall. In the video, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebord ``had their 
friends pretend to be the jocks, and they pretended to be the 
gunmen shooting them,'' junior Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky 
Mountain News. ``I saw the video Eric and Dylan made. .... It

	NATO Opens Way for Ground Offensive

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration and NATO leaders have  
opened the way for a ground offensive to be considered by NATO as 
part of a wider assault on Yugoslavia, but for now the allies 
remain firmly behind an airstrike-only strategy, the Pentagon said 
today. ``There has been no decision to give up the air campaign,'' 
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. Bacon said the only movement 
on the ground troop issue has been NATO Secretary-General Javier 
Solana giving the go-ahead for U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, 
commander of NATO forces in Europe, to update an October assessment 
of what it would take for the allies to invade Yugoslavia.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO destroyed one of President

gutted the luxurious mansion, but Yugoslav officials expressed 
outrage. ``NATO committed a criminal act without precedence -- an 
assassination attempt against the president of a sovereign state,'' 
Goran Matic, government minister without portfolio, told reporters. 
NATO called the building a ``presidential command post'' and 
legitimate target. Last December, several of Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein's palaces and a house belonging to Saddam's daughter were 
hit during American and British air attacks.

Vladimir Lenin's birth today by laying wreaths outside the 
mausoleum where his body is on display, but a few of Lenin's 
critics, meanwhile, marked the birthday by blowing up a

	NORTH MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Former Minnesota Vikings great Carl  
Eller was arrested early today after a woman reported that she had 
been sexually assaulted. North Mankato police received the 911 at 
1:55 a.m. and arrested Eller at an undisclosed location, Capt. 
Wayne Hoffman said. He is being held in the Nicollet County Jail. 
Hoffman would not reveal the woman's condition or whether she had 
any prior relationship with Eller. Eller, 57, was a star defensive 
end with the Vikings' ``Purple People Eaters,'' the front four that

<HEADLINE> Colo. Police Defend Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Police on Thursday defended the way they  
responded to the school massacre, insisting they were rescuing 
students within minutes of the first 911 call but had to move 
cautiously because of the danger of bombs and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the possibility of explosives scattered around the  
school and the risk of sparking a bigger gun battle, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to do the best they could,'' said Sgt. Jim  
Parr of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said the first police car  
arrived at Columbine at 11:21 a.m. Tuesday, moments after the 
shooting, to back up Deputy Neil Gardner, who was on duty inside 
the school and had radioed for help. 
</P>
<P>
	A SWAT team entered within 20 minutes of the first 911 call and  
pulled out some students, Davis said. Several other SWAT teams 
didn't appear to enter until about 1 p.m., about a half-hour after 
authorities said the last shots were heard. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense, a response to reporters' questions, comes after  
scattered criticism, some of it from viewers who watched as the 
tragedy unfolded on live TV and saw what they considered to be 
armed officers doing little to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are angry,'' Columbine student Michael Staver  
told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. Staver's teacher, Dave 
Sanders, reportedly lay dying for up to three hours. Sanders was 
the only adult to perish in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Parr responded: ``Do we wish we could have gotten him out  
sooner? Of course we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they had to move cautiously. They said they didn't  
know how many gunmen there were -- or where. Fleeing students had 
dropped scores of backpacks in hallways and the cafeteria, and each 
one could have been a bomb, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we went in and tried to take them and got shot, we would  
only be part of the problem,'' said Donn Kraemer, a member of the 
Lakewood SWAT team. ``We're supposed to bring order to chaos, not 
add to the chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, when officers first arrived, water was pouring from  
ceiling sprinklers and tiles were broken and hanging down. Tables 
and chairs were overturned, and shell casings and exploded pipe 
bombs littered the floors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been, to me, a textbook of how to conduct an  
investigation, how to do it the right way,'' Attorney General Janet 
Reno said Thursday. ``They've just been extraordinary, not just 
that day but in terms of coordination as a follow-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People in the Denver region have generally praised the response.  
But some wonder about what-ifs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been hard to live with if I found out that my  
child could have been helped,'' said Maxine Rohrbough, grandmother 
of Daniel Rohrbough, 15, who died in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know they could have because of the bombs and  
things,'' Mrs. Rohrbough acknowledged. ``If they had rushed too 
much, they may have triggered a greater tragedy. So I can't 
criticize them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others haven't been so hesitant. On Thursday, the Denver Rocky  
Mountain News published two letters -- one from Michigan, another 
from Texas -- that came down hard on police. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher R. Gonzalez of Dearborn Heights, Mich., wondered:  
``Just what were the police doing while the two juvenile gunmen 
spent an hour shooting people?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Police are paid to do a job,'' he wrote. ``Sometimes that  
involves getting shot at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Cecil H. Rigsby of Austin, Texas, upbraided the SWAT teams  
and police for what he called a ``cowardly performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To watch more than 200 heavily armed SWAT team and other  
police officers in body armor, standing around discussing strategy 
while hundreds of children were trapped inside was painful,'' he 
wrote. ``Where were the heroes?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Denver Post editorial praised the SWAT team's courage, saying  
its members ``crept carefully through the bomb-laden school, wary 
of snipers, to find caches of children and lead them to safety 
outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators cautioned against a rush to judgment.  
</P>
<P>
	``The triage, the postmortem of our investigation, will come  
later,'' Parr said.

<HEADLINE> SGI Sells Part of Wis. Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis. (AP) -- A computer company has sold a  
portion of its manufacturing line to a Minnesota company, 
executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Graphics Inc. sold its operations that make integrated  
circuits for supercomputers to Union Semiconductor Technology Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	All but two of the operation's 83 workers will be offered jobs  
with the new company, Thomas Leitzke, an SGI vice president, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI employs 953 workers in Chippewa Falls.  
</P>
<P>
	No sales price was disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	The sale follows a trend in the supercomputing industry of  
companies no longer making all the components for their machines, 
thereby standardizing some of them, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI, based in Mountain View, Calif., also announced that 21  
manufacturing jobs now being done in California are being moved to 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chippewa Falls is going to be the one site where we  
manufacture our high-end system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	SGI manufactures a range of computer equipment, from desktop  
computers and refrigerator-size supercomputers for businesses to 
servers and workstations for commercial use.

<HEADLINE> Investors Can Express Views Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shareholder democracy has gone online. A new  
Web site allows investors to tell companies their views on more 
than 200 shareholder resolutions on such issues as affirmative 
action, job discrimination and labor practices overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	As an alternative to picketing corporate headquarters,  
shareholders can go to an Internet site called the Shareholder 
Activism Center, which describes itself as a financial information 
site for ``socially responsible'' investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, anyone can express their views on shareholder proposals  
using the Web site: they don't have to own shares in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The new project, announced Wednesday, was developed by the  
Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based 
group made up ofsome 200 religious institutional investors. The Web 
site is at www.socialfunds.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers say the project grew out of a successful campaign last  
spring in which more than 2,000 people and groups sent letters to 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, pushing to give 
shareholders a bigger voice in how companies are run. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the SEC reversed its longstanding policy, opening  
the way for shareholder votes on a range of social issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC adopted changes requiring companies to consider a  
variety of proposals from shareholders. Proposals that raise 
``significant social policy matters,'' such as hiring and labor 
policies, are no longer automatically barred from being voted on by 
all company stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also dropped an earlier provision that would have  
made it more difficult for shareholders to resubmit proposals that 
failed to receive certain levels of voting support. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Falk, a former investment manager and a director of the  
Social Investment Forum who established the new Web site, called it 
``an exciting means by which to harness the power of the Web in 
order to give a voice to investors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesman John Heine had no immediate comment on the  
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the Web site, people can express their views on social  
issues to individual companies or a group of companies linked by a 
category of issues. Categories include the environment, corporate 
accountability, health and tobacco, corporate governance and 
executive pay, hiring and employment practices, and global finance. 
</P>
<P>
	The messages sent to companies do not constitute actual proxy  
votes on the shareholder resolutions. The Web site provides 
instructions to shareholders on filing proxy votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Investment Forum was among the 340 groups that  
mounted the lobbying campaign to reverse the SEC's stance on 
shareholder resolutions. The criticsalso included the AFL-CIO and 
other unions, the Episcopal Church, Catholic, Jewish and Baptist 
groups, the National Organization for Women, civil rights groups, 
environmentalists, children's advocates, the YWCA and some 
corporations and financial firms -- such as Burrito Brothers and 
U.S. Trust Co. of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the changes it adopted last year, the SEC reversed  
its policy on a high-profile case involving shareholders' 
unsuccessful attempts to force a vote on hiring practices at 
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc., based in Lebanon, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved a shareholder proposal to bar the restaurant  
company from discriminating against gay job applicants. The company 
refused to include the proposal on its proxy statement for a vote 
by all shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Reversing its policy, the SEC said Cracker Barrel could not  
legitimately exclude the proposal.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Intensifies Yugoslavia Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO brought its firepower closer to  
President Slobodan Milosevic today, destroying one of his Belgrade 
homes in a daring attack that gutted the luxurious mansion and 
littered its yard with debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic and his family were not inside the white, two-story  
house in Belgrade's wealthy Dedinje district at 4 a.m. (10 p.m. EDT 
Wednesday) when the missiles struck, the state-run news agency 
Tanjug reported. NATO says Milosevic spends each night in different 
bunkers in and around Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tree limbs, pieces of concrete, shards of glass and other debris  
carpeted the columned mansion's grounds. Streaks of black soot 
dirtied the white arches where elegant windows once stood, and one 
side had a gaping hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials expressed outrage over what they said was an  
attempt to kill their leader, saying three laser-guided missiles 
blasted Milosevic's bedroom, living room and dining room. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO committed a criminal act without precedence -- an  
assassination attempt against the president of a sovereign state,'' 
Goran Matic, government minister without portfolio, told reporters 
in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO called the building a ``presidential command post'' and  
legitimate target. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the 
airstrike demonstrated the ``increasing allied pressure'' but 
added: ``We're not targeting President Milosevic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav leader's ``military machine is the target and there  
is no other target,'' declared British Armed Forces Minister Doug 
Henderson, who said the house was used as a ``command and control 
facility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The political and military operations in Yugoslavia are very  
tightly intertwined,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said in 
Washington. ``Milosevic himself is not a target. The command and 
control center is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such wording could be important because since President Ford's  
time, U.S. law prohibits assassination attempts on other leaders 
but no mandate exists for hitting facilities -- which may also be a 
leader's residence -- that are considered command and control 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, several of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's  
palaces and a house belonging to Saddam's daughter were hit during 
American and British airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, the U.S. Air Force took out Libyan leader Moammar  
Gadhafi's house in Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on one of the Yugoslav president's two primary  
residences came hours before former Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin arrived in Belgrade to talk with Milosevic about 
resolving the conflict over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, which shares cultural and religious traditions with  
Yugoslavia, fiercely opposes the NATO airstrikes that began March 
24. Chernomyrdin hopes his old ties with Milosevic will help 
produce a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic was shown on television later in a meeting with  
Chernomyrdin that last into the night, smiling as they shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO attack today signaled a new and more personal phase in  
its military campaign against Yugoslavia, coming one day after 
missiles slammed into a Belgrade high-rise that housed Milosevic's 
governing party and a radio and TV station owned by his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The airstrikes aim to force Milosevic to accept a peace plan for  
Kosovo, a province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic, and stop 
atrocities and the forced expulsions of ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon today estimated airstrikes have damaged or  
destroyed half of Serbia's attack aircraft, 10 percent-20 percent 
of Serb tanks and armored personnel vehicles, 30 percent of the 
SA-3 anti-missile batteries and 10 percent-15 percent of the mobile 
SA-6 anti-missile batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	But as world leaders began gathering in Washington for a NATO  
50th anniversary summit, there was no hint of a diplomatic 
breakthrough or an easing of the refugee crisis that has sent more 
than 600,000 ethnic Albanians pouring out of Kosovo since last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief agencies struggled for a fourth straight day to get food,  
water and blankets to thousands of refugees stranded on the border 
with Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	With Serbs dumping ethnic Albanians at the border by the  
trainload and in convoys of thousands, the U.N. refugee agency 
appealed to European nations to speed up promised refugee airlifts. 
</P>
<P>
	While the flow of refugees into Albania has slowed in recent  
days, it has taken in more than 350,000; at least 130,000 more are 
in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied leaders resolved to press ahead with its air campaign at  
the same time there was increasing talk about the use of ground 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said today that ``I think  
it is inappropriate to rule anything out,'' calling it ``prudent'' 
to update NATO plans for that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	But NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said no decision to  
send ground forces into Kosovo would be taken at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategy is clear. It is the air campaign,'' he told  
Associated Press Television News. ``It will continue to be so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that will enable NATO to expand its air campaign,  
Romania's parliament gave the alliance unrestricted access to the 
country's airspace. Bulgaria is expected to take similar action by 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite continuing bad weather, NATO warplanes pounded several  
areas of Yugoslavia, with explosions rattling Belgrade and Novi 
Sad, Yugoslavia's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug also reported heavy bombardments near Pristina, the  
Kosovo capital. British Harriers guided cluster bombs through the 
clouds on Serb military headquarters north of Pristina, RAF Group 
Capt. Glenn Edge said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Serbian media, usually quick to report bombardments,  
remained silent for nearly six hours before reporting the 
``criminal'' bombing of Milosevic's residence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Milosevic house, typically patrolled by guards in light blue  
uniforms, formerly belonged to Yugoslav communist leader Josip Broz 
Tito, whose marble tomb is behind the house. 
</P>
<P>
	In other airstrikes, dense smoke streaked into the sky near the  
Batajnica military airfield north of Belgrade and in Valjevo. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's crackdown that started 14 months ago has killed  
thousands and driven more than one-third of prewar Kosovo's 2 
million ethnic Albanians from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton still opposes using ground troops but Defense  
Secretary William Cohen said NATO had drawn up plans for a possible 
ground offensive last fall that could be used, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the plans required 200,000 NATO ground forces for a  
full invasion of Yugoslavia, or 75,000 for a scaled-back offensive 
that would just involve Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovakia and the Czech Republic, meanwhile, both agreed to let  
NATO use their roads and rails. That enables the United States to 
move troops and equipment from its bases in Germany to Hungary, the 
only NATO member that borders Yugoslavia.

move troops and equipment from its bases in Germany to Hungary, the 
only NATO member that borders Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> 'Dollarization' Seen As Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If several Latin American countries decide to  
adopt the U.S. dollar as their own currency, American exporters 
would stand to benefit although there would also be risks to the 
U.S. economy, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told 
Congress today. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan appeared  
before a Senate Banking subcommittee to discuss the economic impact 
of another nation dropping its own currency in favor of using the 
American dollar, a development known as ``dollarization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Greenspan and Summers emphasized that while dollarization  
offers economic benefits to a country it would work only if a 
nation were willing to pursue economic reform in all areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no substitute for sound policies,'' Greenspan said.  
``I don't care what kind of (monetary) regime you have, if you try 
to create something out of nothing, you will end up with nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina is actively considering taking this approach and  
several other Latin America countries, including Mexico, have 
expressed interest in the idea recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``To adopt another country's currency as one's own is a  
momentous decision for any country and will need to be considered 
with a very careful eye to the potential benefits and costs,'' 
Summers told senators. 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States does not have the power to block a  
nation from taking this course, Summers said the administration 
hopes that any country considering it would engage in extensive 
consultations with U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of President Carlos Menem of Argentina has held  
preliminary talks with Treasury officials. 
</P>
<P>
	If Argentina or other countries go ahead with adopting the  
dollar, Summers said the United States could expect to benefit from 
greater trade links since U.S. exporters would not have to be 
concerned about sudden changes in exchange rates hurting their 
sales prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin America currently accounts for 20 percent of U.S. exports  
although this figure drops to just 7 percent when close neighbor 
Mexico is excluded. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers said there also would be downside risks for the  
United States, particularly if a Latin American country was 
experiencing hard times. Since the country would not be able to use 
its own monetary policy to stimulate growth by lowering interest 
rates, there could be resentment toward the United States because 
the nation would have lost control of its economic destiny and 
pressure on the Federal Reserve to take Latin American troubles 
into account when setting U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	While Summers said the administration did not have a fixed view  
on whether a country should adopt the dollar as its own, Sen. 
Connie Mack, R-Fla., told him and Greenspan that such a choice 
would offer great benefits for developing countries in Latin 
America, a region that has often experienced difficult economic 
times because of sharp devaluations of local currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack said the United States has helped to export democracy to  
Latin America and now it has the chance to ``export price 
stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of dollarization is just one of a number of proposals  
being circulated currently as financial authorities around the 
globe search for ways to prevent future Asian-style currency 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin unveiled a number  
of proposals aimed at continuing reforms of the global financial 
system, hoping to win approval for the ideas at meetings next week 
of finance ministers of the world's seven wealthiest industrial 
countries, discussions that will be held in advance of the annual 
spring meeting of the 182-nation International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said while work on long-term issues was important, a  
critical need remained for Japanese authorities to do everything 
possible to pull Japan out of its worst recession in 50 years. 
Rubin noted that the IMF in its new economic outlook had presented 
a stark forecast that the Japanese economy, the world's second 
largest, will shrink by another 1.4 percent this year after 
contracting 2.8 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is imperatively important for its neighbors and really very  
important for the rest of the world that Japan get back on track,'' 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	To drive that point home, an administration team led by  
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat held daylong discussions 
with Japanese officials on Wednesday seeking breakthroughs in 
regulatory reform in Japan's financial markets and other areas that 
can be announced when Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi meets 
May 3 in Washington with President Clinton.

<HEADLINE>  Two Bombs Found in H.S. Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two outcasts who massacred their  
classmates before killing themselves intended to blow up the 
school, authorities said today after discovering two large propane 
bombs hidden in the school's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery also could provide more evidence of a wider  
conspiracy, Sheriff John Stone said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage, but they  
were going to destroy the school. They were going to burn the 
school up,'' Stone said after the bombs were discovered and removed 
from Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with sawed-off  
shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, pistol and homemade bombs stuffed 
with nails and shotgun shells, killed 12 students and one teacher 
Tuesday before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had already been looking into the possibility of  
additional suspects because of the amount of ammunition and 
explosives left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the bombs, placed inside propane tanks like the kind  
found on backyard barbecues, weighed at least 35 pounds, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's drawing suspicion out here that they would have time to  
put as much ordnance in that school as they did without some 
help,'' Stone said today after meeting with U.S. Attorney General 
Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said a note written by one of the two gunmen was  
found in one of the teens' homes, but authorities refused to 
characterize the note or discuss what it said. They also turned 
their attention to the community, interviewing acquaintances, 
classmates and relatives of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials today said Columbine will be closed  
indefinitely as damage is assessed. Other schools in the district 
reopened today, and officials said proms and graduations would go 
on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's prom took place earlier this month, and graduation  
is scheduled for early May, though officials did not say whether 
that would go on as scheduled. Students here will finish out the 
school year at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The removal of the victims' bodies more than a day after the  
shootings allowed investigators to begin cataloging evidence and 
turn their attention to other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tracing the weapons and individual purchases to  
determine how these young adults obtained these illegal weapons,'' 
Rich Marianos of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the bombs were made from materials that could  
have been bought at most hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Before she left for Colorado on Wednesday, Reno said she wanted  
to talk about how to avert the next school shooting. ``We've got to 
get the guns out of the hands of young people. ... We've got to 
make sure they have the counseling, the support to help them come 
to grips with the anger of their life when it occurs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was already clear, however, that the string of school  
shootings in Kentucky, Oregon and elsewhere will be tough to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's attack inspired a copycat act by teen-agers on  
Wednesday, although there were no weapons involved. Four teens were 
charged with trespassing in Colorado Springs after arriving at a 
school in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspects were mocking yesterday's events,'' a police  
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools in Jefferson County reopened today with tightened  
security, although a spring snowstorm caused some school closings. 
Officers and school staff plan ``sweeps'' and greater security at 
entrances and exits, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trench coats like the ones worn by the two gunmen were banned in  
Denver and two other Colorado school districts because they could 
be used to hide weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, Denver and other communities, grieving parents and  
students gathered for services to remember those killed and to 
offer mutual support. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a cold rain and wind that set in Wednesday night,  
hundreds of friends, classmates and relatives filed past the 
flowers, balloons, poems, prayers and teddy bears that were heaped 
up on the ground in a park near the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students huddled in white blankets given out by aid  
workers. They wept around the car belonging to Rachel Scott, one of 
the dead students. The car was also heaped with flowers and poems 
and prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the small bouquets and large wreaths at the park stood a  
small potted pine with a card addressed to the school's students 
and staff: ``You are all heroes. You are all courageous,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel's brother, Craig, who was in the library when the  
shooting began, said he prayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just ended up laying on the floor,'' he told NBC's  
``Today.'' ``I was praying to God , to give me courage, and to keep 
protection over us. He told me to get out of there. God told me to 
get out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Shoels' son, Isaiah, one of the students who was killed,  
was black and an athlete, two things that made him a special target 
of the shooters, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had two strikes against him,'' Shoels said today.  
</P>
<P>
	The families of the killers issued brief statements that mixed  
apology with grief and, just as among the victims' relatives, an 
inability to comprehend the incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling to understand  
why this happened,'' Klebold's family said. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said Harris and Klebold were part of an outcast group  
called the Trenchcoat Mafia and that they wore black and spoke 
German to each other. They believe their choice of Adolf Hitler's 
birthday for the attack was no coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts from students indicated Harris was a leader, a boy who  
would come to class as if to war, in steel-toed combat boots and a 
German cross, while Klebold was a follower. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessie Boyer Jr., a former friend of Harris, said he was  
surprised Harris criticized ``jocks'' because he had liked sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an upbeat guy, but something changed. He associated  
himself with Nazis, and listened to a techno-Nazi band,'' Boyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris also liked war games with his friends.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was into combat more than anyone else I've ever seen,''  
said Andrew Beard, a fellow student. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators interviewed the parents of the suspects and  
searched their homes. They also were interviewing dozens, if not 
hundreds, of Columbine's 1,800 students. Some were fellow members 
of the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe was complicated by the massive, heavily damaged crime  
scene -- an entire high school and its grounds -- and the need to 
catalog every shell casing, every piece of shrapnel, every damaged 
ceiling tile. They also had to photograph the location of every 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, 14 people remained hospitalized, three in critical  
condition and five in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wondered whether they would be asked to return to the halls  
where their classmates killed and were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think anybody wants to go back in there,'' said  
Susan Dewitt, 17, glancing toward the barricaded school Wednesday 
night. Her voice broke as she spoke. ``Even if they remodel it, 
we'll all know where everything is.''

<HEADLINE> Seven Dead in Army Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- An Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed  
early Thursday at Fort Campbell, killing seven people and injuring 
the other four aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	An Army photo of the crash scene showed the helicopter scattered  
in several large pieces in a wooded area beside a road. 
</P>
<P>
	The UH-60L helicopter went down in a rural training area about 7  
a.m., the Army said. The Black Hawk is the primary helicopter for 
air assault, air cavalry and medical evacuation units. 
</P>
<P>
	One victim died at the Nashville, Tenn., hospital, and two  
others were in critical condition, according to hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The others injured in the crash were being treated at  
Blanchfield Army Community Hospital on Fort Campbell. The Army did 
not immediately release their conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	No cause was given for the crash. The soldiers were practicing  
getting either on or off the helicopter when it crashed, probably 
from a fairly low height. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Hawk broke up after a ``traumatic impact with the  
ground,'' Army spokesman George Heath said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 350 helicopters are kept at Fort Campbell, but no others  
were nearby when the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The base is headquarters for the 101st Airborne Division, the  
Army's only air assault division. It straddles the 
Kentucky-Tennessee line about 200 miles southwest of Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, two Black Hawks collided at Fort Campbell, killing six  
soldiers. In that crash, the Army said the air crews failed to 
coordinate well enough, and one did not warn the other that it had 
lost sight of the second chopper. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months earlier, a MH-47E Chinook from Fort Campbell  
crashed in a western Kentucky field, killing five people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army said the worst crash at Fort Campbell happened in 1988,  
when two helicopters collided in the air and 16 people died.

<HEADLINE> Yes, Plants Can Get Sunburned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Plants may apply a kind of sunscreen when the  
light gets too bright. 
</P>
<P>
	So concludes a new study that tracked how shining excess light  
on part of a shade-loving plant triggered a warning for 
still-shaded leaves to prepare for sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, leaves can get the plant equivalent of a human sunburn.  
</P>
<P>
	All plants need some light to live; it is how they make energy,  
through a process called photosynthesis. But too much light is 
dangerous because it actually slows photosynthesis, allowing the 
accumulation of unstable molecules that damage leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Geneticist Stanislaw Karpinski of the Swedish University of  
Agricultural Sciences set out to determine how plants could protect 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	He exposed one-third of the leaves of Arabidopsis to  
high-intensity light. Arabidopsis is a shade-loving plant with 
petite white flowers that is a favorite study specimen of plant 
geneticists. 
</P>
<P>
	The light triggered a warning system that alerted leaves still  
in the shade to switch on production of antioxidants to protect the 
rest of the plant, Karpinski reports Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Antioxidants are compounds that can target and destroy the  
damaging unstable molecules, in the same way antioxidant vitamins 
help protect humans against tissue damage from molecules called 
free radicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Karpinski theorizes that hydrogen peroxide is the chemical  
messenger the plant used. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very existence of a systemic response to excess light is a  
remarkable finding,'' said British biochemist Christine Foyer, who 
wrote an analysis of the research for Science. 
</P>
<P>
	She urged study of other plants, such as food crops, to see  
they, too, ``develop preemptive sunscreens.''

<HEADLINE> Sears' First-Quarter Profits Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. reported  
Thursday its first-quarter profits jumped 36 percent as its 
credit-card business improved, offsetting weak sales at its auto 
centers and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended March 31, profit from operations rose  
to $146 million, or 38 cents a share, from $109.3 million, or 28 
cents, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat the average estimate of 34 cents a share,  
according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. The company's 
stock fell fell 56 1/4 cents a share to $43.18 3/4 a share in trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell 2.1 percent to $9.04 billion from $9.23 billion  
last year. Sales at stores open at least a year, an industry 
measure of performance, rose 1.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest department store company, based in the  
Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, reported it cut delinquency 
rates and charge-offs in its profitable credit card business. The 
retailer also benefited as it put a credit-collection fiasco behind 
it but suffered a decline in credit-card revenues as the percentage 
of late fees fell. 
</P>
<P>
	While the retailer continues to report strong sales of  
big-ticket items such as refrigerators and electronics, Sears has 
had weak clothing sales recently as it loses business to mid-priced 
competitors such as Kohl's, discount chains like Target and 
specialty stores such as the Gap and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer announced recently that it is undertaking a radical  
makeover of its stores, plans to offer clothing appealing to 
younger audiences and will begin selling items on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we continue to make progress on our retail and services  
initiatives, results do not yet reflect the enormous amount of work 
being done in these businesses,'' said Sears chief executive Arthur 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago quarter, a gain of $23.6 million, or 6 cents a  
share, for accounting changes, resulted in net income of $133 
million, or 34 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears operates about 847 full-line stores and more than 2,100  
specialty stores.

<P>
	BRISTOL, Va. (AP) -- Over the rumble of machinery and shrill  
horns of forklifts, workers call out to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, preacher!''  
</P>
<P>
	``Hi, Brother Carl!''  
</P>
<P>
	Some of them leave the assembly line as Carl Young makes his way  
through the Bristol Compressors plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, is one of the few  
chaplains in the country working full time at a secular company. 
The factory floor is his pulpit. The workers are his congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Young greets each by name with a handshake, high-five or pat on  
the back. He asks one employee about her ailing back, another about 
her daughter's spelling test and a third about his mother, who is 
in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes he stops for a few moments, leaning in to hear a  
worker say he's upset about his divorce or feeling overwhelmed as 
bills pile up. 
</P>
<P>
	Young listens, nods and offers advice.  
</P>
<P>
	``The thing people ask the most is how to have peace when they  
have other problems in their lives,'' he said. ``I listen to them, 
and then we try to find solutions. It's whatever they want to talk 
about, and everything that's said to me is confidential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though a Southern Baptist, Young, 59, calls himself a  
``generic'' chaplain who helps people of all faiths. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 40,000 workplace chaplains across the country,  
but most work part time, according to Marketplace Ministries, a 
nonprofit organization that contracts with companies to provide 
chaplain services. The Dallas-based company has 600 chaplains at 
169 companies in 34 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employee well-being is what it's all about,'' said David  
Crockett, human resources vice president for Bristol Compressors, a 
manufacturer of components for air conditioning and refrigeration 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Young has been working there full time since he was hired in  
January 1998 as part of the company's employee assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any measurable criteria to judge his  
performance,'' Crockett said. ``But he has been well-received by 
employees, and the number of visits continues to increase, which 
tells us he is definitely filling a need for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Lou Thompson, who has worked at the plant 16 years, said  
her co-workers seem more genial and at ease since Young arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Compressors' 2,500 workers can go to Young's office for  
counseling on company time, with no time limits. On their own time, 
they can attend weekday Bible studies and Sunday worship services 
at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The company does not know who sees Young or what they talk about  
but believes he has made a difference. ``There have been a number 
of times that he comforts our people under stressful situations,'' 
Crockett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Moore, an assembly line worker at the plant since 1988,  
tries to see Young every day, if only to shake his hand and hear an 
encouraging word. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has had a hard time coping since his oldest son, who also  
worked at the plant, was killed in a boating accident a few years 
ago. Moore still thinks he sees his son across the room sometimes 
but then remembers that he's gone. That's when he seeks comfort 
from Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really an uplifting thing to know we have somebody to  
turn to,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young has been a pastor since 1969, leading churches in  
Abingdon, Va.; Clyde, Ohio; and LaFollette and Sunbright, Tenn. He 
was between churches in 1997 when he got the call from Bristol 
Compressors. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials received information from Marketplace  
Ministries but decided to hire their own chaplain after 
interviewing several people who had been referred by employees. 
Young quickly accepted the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the CEO of a large corporation tells you that you go and  
you take care of the people, he cares about his employees,'' Young 
said. ``That's how it's been, and that's the way it has to be to 
make this work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Young, being a company chaplain isn't much different from  
being a preacher. He relies on the Bible to help all who seek 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have Church of God, Assembly of God, Methodist, Baptist and  
Presbyterian (employees),'' he said. '' ... One gentleman I spoke 
to recently was Hindu, and we had a nice conversation. I listen to 
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young works from 5 a.m. until 4 p.m. each weekday but often  
keeps going long after that, visiting hospitals and funeral homes. 
On Sundays he leads two worship services in the plant cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Being so busy sometimes is hard on his wife of 42 years, Mary  
Edna, whom he called his ``right arm in the ministry.'' Still, 
Young says he can't think of another job that would be more 
rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy being with people and seeing them happy and seeing  
what God is doing in their lives,'' he says. ``I love what I'm 
doing.''

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Predicts Strong Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The Malaysian government said  
Thursday that the nation's economy could expand 5 percent in the 
year 2000, up sharply from the 1 percent growth forecast for this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But that growth won't be enough to offset the lingering effects  
of the financial crisis that has derailed the Southeast Asian 
nation's plans of achieving developed-country status by the year 
2020, government officials said in their review of the country's 
five-year economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said annual growth averaging 7 percent was needed  
to achieve that status. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take the necessary measures, hopefully to ensure the  
targets will be achieved,'' Raja Zaharaton Raja Zainal Abidin, the 
deputy director-general of Malaysia's Economic Planning Unit, told 
reporters on Wednesday ahead of the official release of the 
391-page report. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad presented the review to  
Parliament on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the financial crisis dashing hopes of private sector-led  
growth, the government revised its original plan, which had 
envisioned that the private sector would spearhead economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	It increased total development expenditures for the five years  
by $23.5 billion from the $17.7 billion originally allocated in the 
1996-2000 plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money will be spent for infrastructure projects,  
which are seen as necessary for stimulating industrial recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	But several planned mega-projects -- such as a 138-mile mountain  
highway linking three hill resorts, an international airport for 
the northern state of Kedah and a 59-mile bridge to Indonesia 
across the Malacca Straits -- will not be revived. 
</P>
<P>
	Raja Zaharaton said the additional government spending will be  
financed by loans from Japan and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The report predicted that construction, crude-oil refining and  
chemicals would recovery strongly next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also expects export-oriented industries, mainly  
electrical and electronics, to recover gradually in tandem with the 
recovery in global demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Malaysia will remain committed to selective  
capital control measures ``until there is a normalization in the 
global financial environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those curbs prohibit offshore trading of the ringgit,  
effectively pegging the Malaysian currency at 3.80 ringgit to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy was crafted to allow Malaysia to pump more liquidity  
into the recession-hit economy while protecting the ringgit from 
speculative attacks.

<HEADLINE>  Two Bombs Found in H.S. Kitchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two outcasts who massacred their  
classmates before killing themselves intended to blow up the 
school, authorities said today after discovering two large propane 
bombs hidden in the school's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery also could provide more evidence of a wider  
conspiracy, Sheriff John Stone said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage, but they  
were going to destroy the school. They were going to burn the 
school up,'' Stone said after the bombs were discovered and removed 
from Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with sawed-off  
shotguns, a semiautomatic rifle, pistol and homemade bombs stuffed 
with nails and shotgun shells, killed 12 students and one teacher 
Tuesday before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had already been looking into the possibility of  
additional suspects because of the amount of ammunition and 
explosives left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the bombs, placed inside propane tanks like the kind  
found on backyard barbecues, weighed at least 35 pounds, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's drawing suspicion out here that they would have time to  
put as much ordnance in that school as they did without some 
help,'' Stone said today after meeting with U.S. Attorney General 
Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said a note written by one of the two gunmen was  
found in one of the teens' homes, but authorities refused to 
characterize the note or discuss what it said. They also turned 
their attention to the community, interviewing acquaintances, 
classmates and relatives of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials today said Columbine will be closed  
indefinitely as damage is assessed. Other schools in the district 
reopened today, and officials said proms and graduations would go 
on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's prom took place earlier this month, and graduation  
is scheduled for early May, though officials did not say whether 
that would go on as scheduled. Students here will finish out the 
school year at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The removal of the victims' bodies more than a day after the  
shootings allowed investigators to begin cataloging evidence and 
turn their attention to other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tracing the weapons and individual purchases to  
determine how these young adults obtained these illegal weapons,'' 
Rich Marianos of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the bombs were made from materials that could  
have been bought at most hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Before she left for Colorado on Wednesday, Reno said she wanted  
to talk about how to avert the next school shooting. ``We've got to 
get the guns out of the hands of young people. ... We've got to 
make sure they have the counseling, the support to help them come 
to grips with the anger of their life when it occurs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was already clear, however, that the string of school  
shootings in Kentucky, Oregon and elsewhere will be tough to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's attack inspired a copycat act by teen-agers on  
Wednesday, although there were no weapons involved. Four teens were 
charged with trespassing in Colorado Springs after arriving at a 
school in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspects were mocking yesterday's events,'' a police  
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools in Jefferson County reopened today with tightened  
security, although a spring snowstorm caused some school closings. 
Officers and school staff plan ``sweeps'' and greater security at 
entrances and exits, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trench coats like the ones worn by the two gunmen were banned in  
Denver and two other Colorado school districts because they could 
be used to hide weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, Denver and other communities, grieving parents and  
students gathered for services to remember those killed and to 
offer mutual support. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a cold rain and wind that set in Wednesday night,  
hundreds of friends, classmates and relatives filed past the 
flowers, balloons, poems, prayers and teddy bears that were heaped 
up on the ground in a park near the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students huddled in white blankets given out by aid  
workers. They wept around the car belonging to Rachel Scott, one of 
the dead students. The car was also heaped with flowers and poems 
and prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the small bouquets and large wreaths at the park stood a  
small potted pine with a card addressed to the school's students 
and staff: ``You are all heroes. You are all courageous,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel's brother, Craig, who was in the library when the  
shooting began, said he prayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just ended up laying on the floor,'' he told NBC's  
``Today.'' ``I was praying to God , to give me courage, and to keep 
protection over us. He told me to get out of there. God told me to 
get out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Shoels' son, Isaiah, one of the students who was killed,  
was black and an athlete, two things that made him a special target 
of the shooters, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had two strikes against him,'' Shoels said today.  
</P>
<P>
	The families of the killers issued brief statements that mixed  
apology with grief and, just as among the victims' relatives, an 
inability to comprehend the incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling to understand  
why this happened,'' Klebold's family said. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said Harris and Klebold were part of an outcast group  
called the Trenchcoat Mafia and that they wore black and spoke 
German to each other. They believe their choice of Adolf Hitler's 
birthday for the attack was no coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts from students indicated Harris was a leader, a boy who  
would come to class as if to war, in steel-toed combat boots and a 
German cross, while Klebold was a follower. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessie Boyer Jr., a former friend of Harris, said he was  
surprised Harris criticized ``jocks'' because he had liked sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an upbeat guy, but something changed. He associated  
himself with Nazis, and listened to a techno-Nazi band,'' Boyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris also liked war games with his friends.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was into combat more than anyone else I've ever seen,''  
said Andrew Beard, a fellow student. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators interviewed the parents of the suspects and  
searched their homes. They also were interviewing dozens, if not 
hundreds, of Columbine's 1,800 students. Some were fellow members 
of the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe was complicated by the massive, heavily damaged crime  
scene -- an entire high school and its grounds -- and the need to 
catalog every shell casing, every piece of shrapnel, every damaged 
ceiling tile. They also had to photograph the location of every 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, 14 people remained hospitalized, three in critical  
condition and five in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wondered whether they would be asked to return to the halls  
where their classmates killed and were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think anybody wants to go back in there,'' said  
Susan Dewitt, 17, glancing toward the barricaded school Wednesday 
night. Her voice broke as she spoke. ``Even if they remodel it, 
we'll all know where everything is.''

<HEADLINE> Online Shopping Security Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There are gaping holes in the security webs  
of more than 100 small Internet retailers, allowing anyone with a 
little computer savvy to obtain shoppers' credit card numbers and 
other personal information, a technician warned. 
</P>
<P>
	The retail sites, and probably hundreds more, incorrectly  
installed ``shopping cart'' software that is used to take customer 
orders, leaving confidential material in files that virtually 
anyone can find with a World Wide Web search engine, said Joe 
Harris, a computer technician at Seattle-based Blarg Online 
Services, an Internet service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are inexperienced Web site developers out there who  
don't know how to set up an online store safely, but they don't 
tell their clients,'' Harris said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said he found the problem while reviewing an online store  
hosted by his service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported today that it managed to download  
more than 100 pages of credit card numbers, travel reservations, 
e-mail and other information from Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the computer programs that are vulnerable include those  
from Order Form, Seaside Enterprises, QuikStore, PDGSoft and 
Mercantec. 
</P>
<P>
	QuikStore said only two of its estimated 700 users have reported  
problems with the shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessarily their fault,'' said Dwight Vietzke, a  
spokesman for QuikStore. ``These are things that fall through the 
cracks.''

<HEADLINE> Florida Wins Women's 3,200 Relay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Tamieka Grizzle couldn't wait to return to  
Franklin Field for the Penn Relays, this time as a member of the 
Florida Gators instead of the Villanova Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so enthusiastic, I couldn't sleep last night,'' Grizzle  
said Thursday, after leading the Gators to their first title in the 
women's 3,200-meter relay since 1986 in 8 minutes, 24.65 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a lot to prove because last year I ran terribly.''  
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Grizzle was running for Villanova. After the season,  
following the dismissal of coach John Marshall in favor of Marcus 
O'Sullivan, Grizzle, now a junior, transferred to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	When Marshall departed, Grizzle said she felt ``deserted'' and  
``devastated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Florida, she felt at home, because her new coach was J.J.  
Clark, brother of Hazel Clark, the Gators' best distance runner. 
Although Grizzle and Clark had been running for different schools 
last year, they had become friendly, at meets like the Penn Relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Now their friendship has blossomed and the Gators have profited.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're always joking around, we get in trouble a lot,'' Grizzle  
said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no levity on the track Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Nona Allen led off Florida's relay and finished with a  
1-meter lead over Brigham Young's Melanie Steere. Then Grizzle 
built the Gators' advantage to 20 meters after 1,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Erin Merten, running third for Florida, was caught on  
the backstretch by Wisconsin's Janet Westphal, but held her off and 
wound up leading by six meters after 2,400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	That was more than enough for Clark, who finished 30 meters  
ahead of the Badgers' Jennie Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was like coming home,'' Grizzle said. ``I didn't want to  
let the home crowd down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grizzle and Clark were very aware they had rooters in the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I heard my high school coach, Dr James Phipps, yelling my  
nickname, Silky,'' Grizzle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark also heard her high school coach, Len Klepack, and her  
current coach and brother, and her older sister, world-class 
half-miler Joetta Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	``My high school coach said, `Hazel, when you get to 200 meters  
(to go), let it all out,' '' she said. ``I just ran conservatively. 
I didn't have to let it all out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BYU finished second at 8:29.60 and Wisconsin was third at  
8:30.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Texas' women's 400-meter relay team of Kim McGruder,  
Nanceen Perry, LaKiesha White and LaKiesha Backus ran the fastest 
qualifying time ever in the Penn Relays, clocking 43.66 in leading 
the way into Friday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	In qualifying for Saturday's women's 1,600 relay, LSU, the 1987  
and 1993 champion, reeled off the fastest time, 3:33.60, while 
Abilene Christian anchor Tracey Barnes uncorked one of the fastest 
quarter-miles in meet history, 50.0, helping her team qualify at 
3:35.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanya Jarrett led a 1-2 Texas finish in the women's 400-meter  
hurdles. Jarrett was timed in 56.67, while Patterson, the 
collegiate leader this season at 56.02 and the early race leader, 
was runner-up at 57.71. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technically, we didn't run a very good race, but we're happy  
we won,'' Jarrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two NCAA champions -- high jumper Erin Aldrich of Texas and long  
jumper Trecia Smith of Pittsburgh -- won their events. Aldrich 
cleared 6 feet, 1 1/2 inches, while Smith leaped 20-8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Other women's field event winners included Kent State's Leslie  
Vidmar in the shot put at 53-10 1/2, Virginia's Ann Crouse in the 
javelin at 177-3, and Wheaton's Kerry Teamey in the pole vault at 
12-0.

<HEADLINE> CBS Pulls `Promised Land' Episode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An episode of the CBS family drama ``Promised  
Land'' due to air tonight was pulled because its plot involved a 
shooting in front of a Denver school, a network spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS executives made the decision to pull the episode after the  
deadly shooting at a high school in Littleton, Colo., a Denver 
suburb, said network spokesman Chris Ender. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like the right thing to do,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The plot dealt with gang violence and a shooting outside the  
school, Ender said. The episode will likely air later this season 
or next. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB network has reportedly made no decision on whether or not  
to air next Tuesday's scheduled episode of ``Buffy the Vampire 
Slayers.'' The plot concerns a fantasy about schoolyard murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox also considered pulling two stories from tonight's ``Fox  
Files'' newsmagazine because of parallels to the Colorado shooting. 
One story, called ``The New Faces of Hate,'' is about a 20-year 
neo-Nazi leader and how he spreads his message on the Internet. 
Another story is about how young people are making homemade bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the story about the neo-Nazi leader, Fox will air a  
message from Catherine Crier to viewers explaining that it 
considered not running it in light of the Colorado massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided that it is better to shed light on hate groups and  
hatemongers before they commit murder,'' Crier will say.

<HEADLINE> Umpire To File Report on Reds Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A report is being filed with the National  
League about an obscenity-laced shouting match between umpires and 
Reds third base coach Ron Oester following Thursday night's game 
with the New York Mets, crew chief Bruce Froemming said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oester got obscene with the first base umpire as we were  
coming off the field,'' Froemming said. ``(Mark) Hirschbeck came 
over to intervene, and Oester got obscene with him. Then he 
followed us underneath and the obscenities continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll file a report tomorrow with (NL president) Leonard  
Coleman, and that will be the end of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oester said he started out by supporting Reds right fielder  
Dmitri Young, who was called out on a checked-swing third strike to 
end the 4-1 loss to the Mets. Young was talking with home plate 
umpire Ed Rapuano when Oester joined in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw Dmitri and him talking back and forth, and I just said,  
`It's not automatic,''' Oester said. ``He said, `I know it's not 
automatic. Get away from me.' Then I got mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oester said Hirschbeck told him, ``Let's go in the back.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Then, when we got back there, he wanted me to take the first  
swing,'' Oester said. ``I'm not that stupid. He called me back 
there, and he wants me to take the first swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hirschbeck remembered the incident differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``He challenged me,'' Hirschbeck said.

<HEADLINE> Well-Known Directors at Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Such well-known directors as David Lynch, Atom  
Egoyan, Jim Jarmusch, Pedro Almodovar, Chen Kaige and Tim Robbins 
will be among those seeking glory at the 52nd annual Cannes Film 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch, the American whose ``Wild at Heart'' won the 1990 Golden  
Palm at Cannes, will be trying again with ``The Straight Story,'' 
one of four American films in the lineup announced Thursday. The 
festival runs from May 12-23. 
</P>
<P>
	Egoyan, the Canadian whose mournful film ``The Sweet Hereafter''  
won the runner-up prize in 1997, is entered with ``Felicia's 
Journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrated Spanish director Almodovar will be showing ``Todo  
Sobre Mi Madre,'' or ``All About My Mother,'' his first time in 
Cannes competition. Jarmusch will be there too, with ``Ghost Dog: 
The Way of the Samurai.'' Robbins will be showing ``The Cradle Will 
Rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another prominent American director, John Sayles, will be at the  
festival with ``Limbo,'' described by organizers as the only big 
studio film among the American entries. 
</P>
<P>
	Chen, whose ``Farewell My Concubine'' shared top prize at the  
festival in 1993, has frequently run into trouble with China's 
government censors. He will be showing ``The Emperor and the 
Assassin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 22 films in competition, organizers announced  
that ``The Barber of Siberia'' by Russian director Nikita 
Mikhalkov, starring Julia Ormond, will open the festival and Oliver 
Parker's ``An Ideal Husband'' with Cate Blanchett, Rupert Everett 
and Minnie Driver will close the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kadosh,'' directed by Amos Gitai, is the first entry from  
Israel in 25 years to be in the lineup. The Iranian entry is ``The 
Tales of Kish'' by Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Abolfaz Djalili and Nasser 
Taghvai. Portugal is represented by ``A Carta,'' directed by Manoel 
de Oliveira.

``No One Writes to the Colonel,'' by Arturo Ripstein; and 
``Moloch'' by Alexander Sokourov, a German-Russian production. 
</P>
<P>
	There will also be special showings sure to grab attention,  
including ``EDtv'' by Ron Howard; ``The Limey'' by Steven 
Soderbergh, also a former Golden Palm winner; and ''My Intimate 
Enemy'' by German director Werner Herzog.

<HEADLINE> Wohlers to Making Next Step Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mark Wohlers' newfound control will be put to  
the test Friday when he faces batters for the first time since 
being traded to the Cincinnati Reds a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, who is on the 15-day disabled list with what the Reds  
have called anxiety disorder, has impressed manager Jack McKeon and 
pitching coach Don Gullett with the way he's been throwing on the 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's throwing great -- better and better every day,'' McKeon  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He credits Gullet with finding a mechanical problem that was  
easily straightened out. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I've seen, he's throwing strikes all the time,''  
McKeon said. ``I think he's got the release point down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullett said that in the three days he's worked with Wohlers,  
``There's no question he's been around the plate and getting 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's better today than he was yesterday and the day before,''  
Gullett said Wednesday. ``He's as excited as I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers' concentration and control were thought to be so shot  
that Atlanta agreed to pay his $5.2 million salary when he was 
traded to the Reds for reliever John Hudek. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no question he had control problems, which he chalked up  
largely to personal situations last year. But if it turns out that 
a simple mechanical adjustment gets him back on track, the trade 
will go down as one of general manager Jim Bowden's best ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of misthrowing the baseball, and there's always  
a reason for that,'' Gullett said. He was looking for Reds players 
to stand in against Wohlers' 95 mph fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to get some volunteers to hit off him  
Friday -- and I underscore volunteers,'' Gullett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers was looking forward to the test.  
</P>
<P>
	``Things felt good yesterday,'' Wohlers said Thursday. ``I've  
had no problems at all today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, 29, has a 31-22 record with 112 saves and a 3.69 ERA in  
386 games. He saved 97 games from 1995-97, setting a Braves record 
with 39 in 1996. He had 33 the following season. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1998, Wohlers pulled a muscle in his side, his wife filed  
for divorce and his mother suffered a heart attack. And he couldn't 
throw a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	He thought he had regained his control this spring. But he  
walked four of the first seven batters he faced in the regular 
season opener, and in his next outing had two walks and an error 
while facing three batters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves wanted to send him to Triple-A Richmond, where he  
rehabbed twice last year, but Wohlers refused, forcing the trade to 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have said all along there was no timetable for Wohlers'  
rehab. They even suggested he may never pitch in the big leagues 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	After his work this week, McKeon and Gullett have reason to be  
optimistic about Wohlers' return and hope to know more Friday about 
the possibility of a quick activation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make that decision based on how he progresses,'' Gullett  
said. ``There's no rush.''

<HEADLINE> Regulators Order PAL To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Ailing Philippine Airlines must  
arrange massive job cuts and find $200 million in new capital by 
June 4 or face closure, a government regulator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Perfecto Yasay, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, said the airline's large work force is one of the main 
reasons why it has had difficulties finding new investors. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL's majority stockholder, Lucio Tan, has pledged to provide  
$100 million in new equity. But Avelino Zapanta, the airline's 
newly appointed president, said Thursday that Tan was still looking 
for the additional $100 million outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta, in his first news conference as president, said Tan has  
put the first $100 million in an escrow account. If no other 
investors emerge, Tan will provide the additional money himself, 
Zapanta said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injection of new capital was demanded by creditors for their  
approval of PAL's rehabilitation plan. The SEC is to decide on June 
4 whether the plan is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL has been unable to repay more than $2.2 billion in debt,  
mainly because of an ill-timed expansion program, labor unrest, and 
Asia's financial crisis. In the past year it has slashed its fleet 
from 54 planes to 22 and its workforce from 13,000 to about 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta said that in the fiscal year that ended March 31, the  
airline again lost money but that more efficient operations have 
started to improve revenues in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making it already,'' Zapanta said. ``But that's not  
enough, because we have a huge indebtedness to settle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta, a former PAL vice president, was appointed president in  
a management reshuffle this week in which Tan also returned as 
chief executive. Tan, who owns 70 percent of the airline, 
relinquished direct management control only a few months ago under 
pressure from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the U.S. Export-Import Bank and a group of  
European credit agencies, owed about two-thirds of the carrier's 
total debt, wrote to the SEC protesting the management changes, 
saying they threatened security and progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta said he planned to meet with the major creditors next  
week to address their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In a radio interview, Yasay said PAL is unlikely to become  
profitable operating 22 aircraft with 8,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those conditions, ``we will have no option at the SEC but  
to close Philippine Airlines and everybody goes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``We have to resolve this long before June 4.  
Otherwise, we'll be left with no option but to order the 
liquidation of PAL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier interview, Yasay said the airline needs to cut its  
workforce to about 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapanta said PAL is negotiating with its unions and would try to  
find positions for laid-off workers at companies related to PAL.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs Juvenile Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- States would get $1.5 billion in federal funds  
over three years to fight juvenile crime in legislation approved 
Thursday by a House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, reviving juvenile justice legislation that failed  
to make it through the last Congress, would provide funds to build 
juvenile detention centers, establish drug and gun courts for young 
people and train law enforcement personnel in preventing and 
controlling juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, introduced by the House Judiciary crime subcommittee  
chairman, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., and backed by the ranking 
Democrat on the panel, Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, was approved 
by a voice vote. The full committee is expected to act on it next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The House in 1997 passed a juvenile crime bill that emphasized  
increased penalties for young offenders, but it failed to win 
Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
	This bill puts more emphasis on prevention measures such as  
information-sharing among law enforcement, schools and social 
service agencies and programs designed to enhance school safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Judiciary Committee staff said action on the bill was scheduled  
before Tuesday's shootings at a Denver-area high school. McCollum 
said the shootings showed ``the federal government has a 
responsibility to help states deal with troubled youths at the 
early stage of delinquency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One requirement for a state to receive a federal grant under the  
program is that it set up a system of penalties that increase in 
severity with each new serious offense by a juvenile.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bond Prices Retreat Again / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices fell Thursday, undercut for  
a second straight day by rising oil prices and a surge in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 1/32  
points, or $10.31 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, rose to just under 5.60 percent 
from 5.53 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds have lost their attraction as stocks have rebounded from  
Monday's steep selloff. On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index both shot up to 
new heights. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time stocks are on a roll, inflation fears are being  
rekindled by a surge in oil prices to a 16-month high on commodity 
markets. If inflation should re-emerge, it would reduce the return 
over the years on fixed-income investments such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Treasury bonds are suffering from competition from  
a flood of bond offerings from corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell between 3/32 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate maturities 
fell between 7/32 point and 15/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, 
a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.15 
from midafternoon Wednesday to a late close of 1,282.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.38 percent as the  
discount rose 0.04 percentage point from Wednesday to 4.27 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.54 percent, as the discount rose 0.03 
percentage point to 4.38 percent. One-year yields were 4.68 percent 
as the discount rose by 0.03 percentage point to 4.47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.56 percent from 4.38 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 123 15/16 from 124 13/32 Wednesday. 
The average yield to maturity rose to 5.25 percent from 5.23 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Wants Top Prosecutor Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Ignoring a strong rebuff from parliament, Boris  
Yeltsin barreled ahead Thursday with his bid to oust Russia's top 
prosecutor, who threatened to challenge the president in court to 
keep his post. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin insisted an order issued earlier this month suspending  
Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov remained in force despite 
parliament's decision Wednesday to keep Skuratov in his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov, who has been investigating alleged Kremlin corruption,  
said he was again barred Thursday from entering his office. He said 
he may appeal Yeltsin's order in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian media and some politicians suggested the decision in  
Skuratov's favor by the upper house of parliament, the Federation 
Council, has tilted the political balance even further against 
Yeltsin and may push him to crack down on his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has long been trying to get rid of Skuratov. The  
Federation Council has now voted twice not to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has argued the prosecutor should be dismissed on moral  
grounds after the release of a videotape showing a man bearing a 
strong resemblance to Skuratov having sex with two women identified 
as prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has suspended Skuratov while investigators check  
whether criminal suspects provided him with the women in the 
videotape on condition that he drop cases against them. 
</P>
<P>
	The business daily Kommersant and other media speculated  
Thursday that Yeltsin may reshuffle the Cabinet and disband the 
Communist-dominated lower house, the State Duma, which is scheduled 
to begin an impeachment debate against him in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential aide told the ITAR-Tass news agency that Yeltsin  
would take unspecified ``harsh steps'' against his opponents and 
would not ``sit and wait'' for the impeachment vote. The aide was 
not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's foes in the Duma dismissed the threats. ``Don't try to  
scare or blackmail us,'' said lower house speaker Gennady 
Seleznyov, a Communist. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said on ORT television  
Thursday that the president wasn't planning to do anything 
unconstitutional, but said ``decisive measures'' were needed toward 
parties or groups ``who seek to destabilize the situation during a 
very serious economic crisis.'' He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin aide Oleg Sysuyev echoed that in an interview on NTV  
television, saying, ``One should neutralize the source of this 
destabilization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin on Thursday dismissed Ruslan Orekhov, his senior legal  
aide who was recently appointed as his liaison with the upper 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	The upper house set up a panel Thursday to look into Skuratov's  
claims of high-level corruption. Yeltsin said through spokesman 
Dmitry Yakushkin that he supported the move but warned lawmakers 
against making the anti-corruption efforts a political issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov's probe has focused on alleged bribe-taking by top  
government officials responsible for awarding large construction 
contracts to the Swiss company Mabetex. Kremlin officials and 
Mabetex have denied any wrongdoing, and no one has been charged.

	Police Investigate Shooting Motive  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- More than a day after one of the  
bloodiest school shootings in U.S. history, all 15 of the dead, 
including the two teen-age gunmen, have been removed from a 
suburban Denver high school. Investigators left the bodies in place 
overnight at Columbine High School so that they could check for 
explosives and record the details of the crime scene. Meanwhile, 
authorities were trying to determine if Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold acted alone or if others were involved. They questioned 
other members of the boys' dark group of outcasts, the ``Trenchcoat 
Mafia.''

	NATO Jets Hit Belgrade Buildings  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO stepped up its attacks around  
Belgrade Thursday, blasting a military airfield north of the 
capital after getting permission from Yugoslavia's neighbors to 
transport troops and equipment over their territories. The latest 
attacks came hours before former Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin was due to meet with President Slobodan Milosevic, in 
Moscow's latest bid to negotiate an end to the NATO air campaign 
against Yugoslavia.

	Cohen Discusses Ground Troops  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials are giving  
the broadest hints yet that a ground offensive might soon be 
considered by NATO as part of a wider assault on Yugoslavia. ``It 
can happen very quickly,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said 
Wednesday about updating plans that NATO has on the shelf for a 
ground attack. Speaking on the eve of NATO's 50th anniversary 
summit here, Cohen told a House subcommittee that while a ground 
assault was not being considered, such a campaign could include 
200,000 or more NATO troops for a full invasion of Yugoslavia or 
75,000 troops for a limited ground operation in the province of 
Kosovo.

the first since President Clinton rejected an offer by Chinese 
Premier Zhu Rongji in Washington two weeks ago that was the 
broadest China has made in 13 years of on-again, off-again talks to 
join the Geneva-based body that sets global trade rules. Clinton 
and Zhu resolved to conclude a deal by June. U.S. diplomats and 
Chinese state-run media saw Cassidy's planned four-day stay in

	New Park Pollution Rules Unveiled

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marking another Earth Day, the Clinton  
administration was announcing new regulations Thursday directing 
that states reduce pollution to bring air in 37 national parks and 
119 federal wilderness areas back to pre-industrial-era quality -- 
though it will take more half a century even under the most 
optimistic schedule. While the rules will give states discretion on 
how to reduce pollution that drifts into the parks from 
miles-distant sources, they will have to show significant air 
quality improvements every 10 years, with a final deadline of 2064. 
The first pollution reduction plans are due in 2003 to 2008, 
depending on the region.

	Everglades Fire Now Burning Out  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- After scorching the Everglades for a week, fires  
that burned 170,000 acres of sawgrass may finally be burning out. 
State forestry officials said Wednesday the flames seem to be 
turning in on themselves. Dry weather is expected to persist 
through the end of the month, said Jim Lushine, a meteorologist 
with the National Weather Service in Miami. Florida has soaked up 
far less rain than usual during its December-through-April dry 
season, prompting state officials to fear a repeat of last summer's 
wildfires, which scorched nearly 500,000 acres and forced 100,000 
people from their homes.

<HEADLINE> NATO Leaders Tone Down Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western leaders are using a commemoration of  
NATO's 50th anniversary to debate the course of the alliance's 
first military action, the bombing of Yugoslavia. ``NATO will see 
this through to the end,'' Secretary-General Javier Solana 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	As presidents and prime ministers of the 19 NATO nations and 23  
partner states prepared to open their three-day summit today with a 
discussion of the conflict, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
offered a new diplomatic overture. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milosevic's offer to accept some form of international force  
in the Serbian province of Kosovo was greeted with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is an offer for a genuine security force, that's the  
first time Mr. Milosevic has ever done that, and that represents, I 
suppose, some step forward,'' President Clinton said Thursday at a 
joint Rose Garden appearance with Solana. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, a Downing Street spokesman said Prime Minister Tony  
Blair and Clinton agreed during a 20-minute phone call that 
Milosevic's reported acceptance fell short of NATO's demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``They both felt that what Milosevic was offering at this stage  
fell well short of what was required to meet NATO's conditions, 
conditions that were set out clearly from the outset and which 
remain the absolute precondition for any resolution,'' said the 
spokesman, speaking only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit-eve overture was relayed from Belgrade by former  
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who said Milosevic 
would accept the idea of a U.N.-controlled ``international 
presence'' in Kosovo if the bombing stops and NATO withdraws troops 
from Yugoslavia's borders. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether such a force would be armed -- something  
the alliance deems essential. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the leaders gathered here under extraordinary security  
precautions, the air campaign against Yugoslavia, now in its fifth 
week, continued. The headquarters of Belgrade's main television 
network was hit, and NATO destroyed one of Milosevic's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the alliance was now targeting Milosevic, Clinton said,  
``No, but we are targeting his command and control facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders planned a morning session on Kosovo with the issue  
of ground troops -- initially ruled out -- now sitting unsteadily on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject is ``not formally on the agenda'' but could be  
discussed by individual members, said a NATO official briefing 
reporters on condition of anonymity. ``Do not expect any decision 
on ground troops at this summit,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials also were pushing for a blockade or embargo on  
oil going into Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO official said the alliance would issue a formal  
declaration today reiterating its demands to Milosevic, and express 
NATO's confidence in the air campaign as the primary instrument for 
degrading Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton bestowed his support on Solana's decision to have NATO  
military leaders update contingency plans, including one for a 
possible ground assault. The president called it ``a wise and 
prudent course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clinton and other western leaders continued to stress  
they believed the conflict could be ended with an intensifying air 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bombing is working, but we need to intensify it and carry  
it on,'' Blair said on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all NATO leaders were comfortable with the progress of the  
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said prolonged bombing of  
Yugoslavia could turn his nation against NATO and the United 
States. While sticking to Greece's official support, Simitis said: 
``The more the war continues, the more difficult the problems will 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders planned an early afternoon gathering to celebrate  
the April 4, 1949, signing of the treaty that established the Cold 
War alliance to confront the Soviet Union in Europe. It was to be 
followed by a reception at the Capitol and a White House dinner. 
The summit concludes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was extremely tight.  
</P>
<P>
	To minimize traffic gridlock for the largest international  
summit in the city's history, thousands of federal employes were 
given the day off. Schools were closed, as well as many businesses 
in a 100-square-block downtown security zone. Even some of the 
Smithsonian museums on the National Mall were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The event had been planned as a jubilant 50th anniversary  
celebration -- and to welcome three newest members, former Warsaw 
Pact nations Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	But the festivities were muted by concern over the conflict in  
Kosovo, where Serb-led Yugoslav forces have forced hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians to flee.

<HEADLINE> Dead-Beats Contribute to Poverty </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Absentee parents who spend time with their  
children are more likely to pay child support, the Census Bureau 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers do not know if the visits make parents more  
likely to pay up or those who pay are more likely to insist on 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, the new statistics, being released today, offer  
support to projects under way across the country that try to 
connect fathers with their children, for both emotional and 
financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	About three-fourths of those who had joint custody or visitation  
agreements made payments in 1995. That compares with just 35 
percent of those without these agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also finds that parents who do not pay support are  
more likely to have children who live in poverty. It spotlights a 
striking problem in the era of welfare reform, where child support 
is supposed to make up some of the money lost when families leave 
the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Census report is based on data from 1995. Since then,  
there have been new efforts to collect more money and collections 
have risen. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem is that many of the fathers of these  
children also are poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have similar if not more barriers (than low-income women)  
to getting work,'' said Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the 
Department of Health and Human Services. ``A lot of them have jail 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the report found that $17.8 billion was paid in support  
in 1995. That's 63 percent of the $28.3 billion that parents said 
they were owed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census report is the nation's only estimate of all child  
support paid and owed across the country. HHS releases similar 
numbers, but those figures only capture parents who pay through the 
government's collection system, explaining why the HHS collection 
numbers for 1995 were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Census report also concluded that just $28.3 billion was  
owed, whereas HHS says nearly $50 billion was due that year. That 
may because parents responding to the Census questionnaire did not 
admit all the support owed from previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings in the Census report include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- In spring 1996, when the survey was conducted, 22.8 million  
children under 21 years lived with 13.7 million parents while their 
other parent lived elsewhere. That's 28 percent of all children 
under 21 living in families. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The vast majority -- 85 percent -- of these custodial parents  
were women. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mothers were more likely to receive child support from  
absentee fathers than fathers were from absentee mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- About seven in 10 custodial parents who were due child support  
got at least a portion of what was owed. The average received was 
$3,732. 
</P>
<P>
	-- About four in 10 got everything they were owed.  
</P>
<P>
	-- About 32 percent of custodial parents who were owed child  
support but did not get anything lived below the poverty line. By 
contrast, about 22 percent of parents who got at least part of what 
they had coming were poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Focusing on custodial mothers, the report found that moms were  
most likely to receive payments if they were wealthier, white, 
educated, older than 30 and divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, 62 percent of poor women received at least some of  
the money, compared with 73 percent of non-poor women. Nearly three 
out of four white women got something; for blacks it was 59 percent 
and for Hispanics, 58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over half of women who had never been married got payments  
versus 73 percent of those who had been divorced.

<HEADLINE> CIA Concludes Chinese Stole Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Through aggressive spying, China obtained  
classified information on a variety of U.S. nuclear weapons, making 
it possible for Beijing to modernize its arsenal in the next few 
years, U.S. intelligence officials told Congress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a long-awaited damage assessment, administration officials  
disclosed for the first time that China gathered classified 
information not just on the W-88 warhead and the neutron bomb but 
on ``several'' modern U.S. warheads -- particularly ``re-entry 
vehicles,'' the nuclear weapons mounted on multiple-warhead 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``China obtained by espionage classified U.S. nuclear weapons  
information that probably accelerated its program to develop future 
nuclear weapons,'' according to a declassified version of the 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the intelligence team said China also gained some valuable  
weapons information in open venues such as public conferences and 
scientific exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who was briefed on the findings Wednesday,  
ordered a review to assess potential vulnerability to espionage 
beyond the U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Measures to protect sensitive nuclear weapons information must  
be constantly scrutinized,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese espionage at U.S. weapons labs developed into a  
political storm for Clinton as Republicans accused his 
administration of being lax in responding to the FBI's initial 
concerns in 1995. The issue followed on the heels of allegations 
that the administration promoted commercial satellite exports that 
allowed Beijing to improve its ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby,  
said the briefing Wednesday made it clear that Chinese spying 
continued into the Clinton administration, something that the 
president in the past has denied knowledge of. 
</P>
<P>
	``It confirms my worst fears,'' Shelby, R-Ala., said of the  
damage assessment. ``We made it easy for the Chinese because of 
weak security at our national labs.... We took too long to find out 
what was going on and we still don't know how deep and wide the 
problem is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, ranking Democrat on the special  
House committee that has examined China espionage issues, said that 
while the report ``demonstrates a terrible intelligence failure'' 
by the United States, the long-term security implications are less 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese still have not yet been able to demonstrate that  
they've taken advantage of it. And only time will tell,'' Dicks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the assessment team's conclusions was that China has not  
yet deployed any weapons based on stolen U.S. technology but may be 
developing them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese nuclear arsenal, estimated at 18 to 20  
single-warhead ICBMs and perhaps 400 single-warhead short- and 
medium-range nuclear missiles, never has rivaled those of the 
United States and Russia. Nor does Beijing appear to have any plans 
to do so, the assessment said. The United States has about 10,000 
nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, China is trying to improve the credibility of its  
nuclear threat by improving its retaliatory capability, according 
to the intelligence assessment. Doing so involves developing 
lighter, more mobile and therefore more survivable warheads, such 
as the W-88, a miniaturized warhead mounted on the eight-warhead 
Trident II submarine-launched missile. China has a no-first-use 
nuclear policy, making survivability of its arsenal a key priority. 
</P>
<P>
	China also is seeking to improve the forces it has arrayed  
against potential regional enemies, according to the assessment 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	China emphatically has denied the espionage charges, saying its  
own scientists achieved improvements in nuclear weapons design. 
</P>
<P>
	The multi-agency assessment team led Robert Walpole, the CIA  
official in charge of strategic and nuclear issues, was overseen by 
an outside panel of experts headed by retired Adm. David Jeremiah. 
</P>
<P>
	China is seeking to close ``significant deficiencies'' in its  
nuclear weapons capability, the assessment found, and ``the Chinese 
almost certainly are using aggressive collection efforts to address 
deficiencies.'' China is likely to adopt the U.S. weapons 
information into its own programs over the next few years, 
according to the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the loss of secrets, ``future Chinese weapons  
will look more like ours,'' said a senior intelligence official 
familiar with the assessment, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1988 Chinese document, obtained by U.S. intelligence, as well  
as close analysis of Chinese weapons tests, touched off a 1995 
investigation of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. 
A Taiwanese-American formerly employed at Los Alamos is under 
investigation in connection with the W-88 case. 
</P>
<P>
	The declassified assessment did not name the several other U.S.  
nuclear warheads about which China obtained ``at least basic design 
information.'' To identify them, said the senior official, would 
provide clues as to how U.S. intelligence learned about the Chinese 
espionage successes and would let Beijing assess the accuracy of 
its stolen information. 
</P>
<P>
	In assessing damage to U.S. national security, the intelligence  
team concluded that by obtaining more U.S. nuclear technology, 
``the Chinese might be less concerned about sharing their older 
technology'' with other countries, posing a proliferation risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jeremiah panel said loss of classified technology may be  
more damaging to the United States now than during the Cold War, 
when substantial weapons research kept the United States ahead of 
competitors.

<HEADLINE> Serial Killer Case Testimony Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Ng's defense closed its case  
with tears from the serial killer's mother and a plea to jurors to 
spare the life of the man convicted of killing 11 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Final arguments were to be delivered today by prosecutors who  
seek the death penalty for Ng, convicted in February of murdering 
six men, three women and two baby boys during a spree of bondage 
and sadism in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Oiping Ng told jurors Wednesday she carries a burden of guilt  
for failing to stop the ferocious beatings her husband inflicted on 
Charles when he was a child. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my husband was hitting Charles so fierce I didn't know  
what to do,'' said Mrs. Ng. ``Maybe we did not know how to teach 
Charles properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have suggested the beatings warped Ng's  
personality and made him vulnerable to authority figures such as 
Leonard Lake, the man who masterminded the killing spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake committed suicide in custody after his arrest in 1985 and  
Ng fled to Canada. The Hong Kong emigre finally went on trial late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng's mother was the final witness before the defense rested in  
the penalty phase of his trial. The jury will have the choice of 
recommending the death penalty or life in prison without 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by a defense attorney how she would feel if her son was  
put to death, Mrs. Ng could barely speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be very sad, of course,'' she sobbed, speaking through a  
Cantonese interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	As she spoke, Ng, 38, sat at the counsel table looking straight  
ahead. His lawyer said later that he cried softly. 
</P>
<P>
	Some jurors also blinked back tears.  
</P>
<P>
	According to testimony, Lake fantasized about capturing and  
subduing young women. Investigators found handcuffs, manacles and 
other bondage gear at his house in Wilseyville, about 150 miles 
east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stand, Ng denied killing anyone and said he didn't know  
Lake planned to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	But jurors watched videotapes made at Lake's house showing him  
and Ng taunting two handcuffed and shackled women, who were never 
seen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can cry and stuff like the rest of them,'' Ng told one  
terrified woman. ``It won't do you no good. We're pretty 
cold-hearted.''

<HEADLINE> Xerox Earnings Rise 14 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp. reported its profits rose 14  
percent in the first quarter, helped by the company's restructuring 
program and productivity and expense controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox reported Thursday it had net income from continuing  
operations of $343 million, or 48 cents per share, compared with 
$301 million, or 42 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company matched expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call Corp., who had predicted earnings of 48 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Xerox fell $1.56 1/4 to  
$58.56 1/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were unchanged at $4.30 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Xerox took a charge of $190 million in the first quarter of 1998  
to cover residual obligations from the sale of three insurance 
units. Including the charge, net income was $111 million in the 
year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	President and CEO Rick Thoman, in a statement, blamed the  
disappointing revenue results on the economic slowdown in Latin 
America, particularly Brazil, and several operational factors in 
the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoman said the company expects revenue growth to improve later  
in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital product revenues grew 28 percent in the quarter and  
represented approximately half of total company revenues. 
Black-and-white light-lens copier revenues declined 24 percent in 
the first quarter as a result of the weakness in Brazil, increased 
pricing pressures and customer transition to digital copiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox is in the midst of a restructuring program aimed at  
cutting costs and making the company more competitive as it moves 
from traditional light-lens copiers to high-tech digital products. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the program was announced a year ago, 6,400 jobs have been  
cut, including 1,000 in the first quarter. The company has said its 
goal is to cut a total of 9,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of its 
worldwide work force.

<HEADLINE> Reconstructing the Columbine Horror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The following account reconstructs the Tuesday rampage at  
Columbine High School, where 15 people died. It is based on	
interviews with and material from authorities and students.	
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Her favorite lunchtime meal was ready --  
``my only meal,'' jokes Sarah DeBoer. So, nachos in hand, she 
headed toward the commons area of the Columbine High School 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a sunny Tuesday morning, maybe 60 degrees, only 17 school  
days before graduation, and a spring mentality was afoot -- the kind 
that says summer is on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, two disaffected young men knew something their  
classmates didn't. Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris had endgame in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. DeBoer, who knew the pair in passing, had talked to them  
Friday. True, they liked to bluster about guns and vengeance and 
Adolf Hitler. But they seemed -- for them, at least -- fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Upstairs in the school library, four dozen students were  
studying their way through the lunch period. Down the hall, Dave 
Sanders, a popular instructor and coach, was teaching a science 
class. Nearby, Stephanie Williams, 16, a junior, was in the choir 
room singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at about 11:15 a.m., a sound from outside:  
pop-pop-pop-BANG. 
</P>
<P>
	In the cafeteria, they thought it was a lunchtime prank.  
Whatever it was, it was getting closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. DeBoer, a 16-year-old sophomore, hit the floor with her  
lunch companions. As realization washed over her, she uttered one 
thing. Whether it was aloud or just to herself, she doesn't quite 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that I'm going to die.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In moments of chaos and hours of confusion, memories can cloud.  
But, through myriad interviews and briefings, an intelligible if 
still imprecise portrait emerges of what unfolded behind a suburban 
school's pale brown walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Just after lunch period begins, two young men in black trench  
coats open fire in the parking lot. Senior Wade Frank, 18, outside 
in the parking lot next to a picnic area, hears popping sounds and 
sees a girl lying against a curb, shot in the leg. As he watches, 
another youth is shot in the back and falls forward. Then one 
gunman throws a bomb into the parking lot and heads inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just casually walking. He wasn't in any hurry,'' says  
Frank.` 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Denny Rowe, 15, is outside having lunch with friends.  
``These guys opened fire on everything that looked human,'' says 
Rowe. Bullets are bouncing everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``One boy was running and suddenly his ankle just puffed up in  
blood,'' says sophomore Don Arnold, 16. ``A girl was running and 
her head popped open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the gunmen walk into the school, two students lie dead  
outside. Still shooting, the two walk to the cafeteria, where food 
server Karen Nielsen hears someone yell, ``Get down!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, are heavily armed -- an assault  
rifle, sawed-off shotguns, handguns. In the cafeteria, one removes 
his trench coat to reveal home-made grenades. He tosses a pipe 
bomb. Gunshots echo. Students fall. One gets up to run and others 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Word spreads: The ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' has gone nuts. Many of  
the 900 students in the building duck into closets and bathrooms, 
under tables and chairs. A couple call 911 with cellular phones. 
Dozens flee the building and hide in brush around the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Nick Foss, 18, and a friend push two teachers, a cook and  
another woman into a bathroom. ``I heard people praying for their 
husbands and their children,'' says Foss. The attackers bang on 
doors, yelling: ``We know you're in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Brackley, 15, is in the gym when an administrator herds  
kids into the equipment room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit my knees and prayed,'' Ms. Brackley says. They stay for  
15 minutes before the administrator directs them outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Gardner, the Jefferson County sheriff's deputy assigned to  
the school full-time, hears shots and spots one of the gunmen in a 
first-floor hallway. He radios for backup and returns fire as 
bullets ricochet off lockers. Within minutes, seven officers arrive 
and begin pulling students, including a few shooting victims, from 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
	In the choir room, above the commons, Ms. Williams and her  
classmates hear the sounds. Someone comes to the door and, with a 
thumb-forefinger gesture, gives them a warning: gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Her teacher tells everyone to sit. But in moments, the school's  
two-level auditorium next door seems a safer place, so some go; 
then, after about 10 minutes, they run into the main hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group I was in headed straight for the door. He was  
shooting at us,'' Ms. Williams says. ``All we knew was to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they flee, a door behind them explodes in gunfire.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. DeBoer, separated from her friend who had run into the  
weight room, lies on the cafeteria floor until she hears a car 
explode outside. Then she runs into the auditorium and lies down 
between seats. 
</P>
<P>
	There she stays for some time. Fellow students -- 15, maybe 20 --  
cry softly. Teachers warn them to be silent. In the distance, they 
hear sharp reports and dull explosions. Finally, a janitor enters 
and tells them: Go! They run, and gunfire follows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned and I saw Dylan was the one who turned and shot at  
me,'' Sarah says. ``He didn't know it was me; we were just running 
out of the auditorium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen head upstairs toward the library.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``All jocks stand up! We're going to kill every one of you,''  
one gunman yells in the library. 
</P>
<P>
	Student Aaron Cohn, a ballplayer, is spared because a girl leaps  
onto his back while he lies on the floor, covering the baseball 
slogan on his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were laughing after they shot,'' Cohn says. ``It was like  
they were having the time of their life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students are slain at their desks, one with pencil still in  
hand. The gunmen play ``peek-a-boo'' with others, finding them 
cowering under desks and opening fire. Isaiah Shoels, who is black 
and has tangled with the gunmen before, is one of those to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Says one assailant: ``Oh, my God. Look at this black kid's  
brain. Awesome, man!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some kids play dead. By the time it is over, 12 aren't playing.  
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris leave behind shattered windows, bloody floors  
and a quiet unlike any the library has ever heard. Elsewhere 
upstairs, Sanders, the teacher, has been shot twice in the chest 
but manages to get students down a hallway away from danger. He 
stumbles into a science room, bleeding and coughing blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, the first SWAT team is on the scene 20 minutes after  
the first 911 calls, joining the sheriff's deputies. It finds 
several explosive devices around the school and treads cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had initial people there right away, but we couldn't get  
in,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone says. ``We were way 
outgunned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 minutes after the shooting begins, at noon, ambulances  
take the first wounded students -- the ones who managed to run 
outside -- to hospitals. Bomb teams, fire trucks, more SWAT units 
and paramedics arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Foss and other students manage to crawl into a space  
between the ceiling and acoustic tiles. Foss falls through a tile, 
crashing onto the floor of the teacher's lounge. He runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kammi Vest, 18, hides in the choir-room closet with up to 60  
other students. Others try to crawl through heating vents to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	In the science room, Sanders is dying. Students cover the  
47-year-old teacher with their shirts and a blanket and keep him 
talking. But his pulse slows and he grows cold. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots are heard until almost 12:30. About that time, in the  
library, Klebold and Harris turn their guns on themselves, though 
no one will be sure of this for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	As 12:30 passes, after no shots echo for several minutes, SWAT  
teams begin sweeping the building room by room. It is, quite 
literally, a minefield: Dropped backpacks are everywhere, each a 
potential bomb. In the coming days bombs will turn up in various 
shapes and sizes. They include two 35-pound propane bombs hidden in 
the school's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 2:30, SWAT teams begin freeing those in hiding. In  
small groups, hands behind their heads, they run from the school to 
a holding area. They are frisked, questioned, offered medical care 
and bused to Leawood Elementary School to be reunited with parents. 
</P>
<P>
	By now, the world is seeing it all on TV. Escaped students cling  
to each other. Tears flow freely for some; for others, it will take 
time. Even the tough guys, the ones with the backward baseball caps 
and the baggy camo pants, cry. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4:30, with the gunmen's bodies found, authorities declare the  
school under control. In goes Dr. Chris Colwell, summoned for a 
medical synopsis. In the sun-dappled, the silent library is the 
worst sight he has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``You walk in there with that hope that there might be somebody  
who's still alive and still salvageable,'' Colwell says. ``It 
didn't take long to see that wasn't the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pronounces them all dead -- 10 students and two alienated  
schoolmates who let their anger consume them. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies will stay there for an entire day, until the known  
bombs are cleared. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	By the following afternoon, nearby Clement Park has become a  
place of mourning. Students and teachers and gawkers,they come to 
commiserate, to speak of faith and perseverance, to see the 
spectacle and talk to the press. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the pilgrims: Ms. DeBoer, wearing her Columbine football  
jersey, and Ms. Williams, accompanied by a friend to comfort her. 
They stand together, yards from the scene of their lives' greatest 
terror, and they try to process the scenes running through their 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday I was so scared,'' Ms. DeBoer says, her voice  
falling. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ruined the school, but I think we should definitely go  
back,'' she says. ``If you don't go back, they'll win.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is up 16 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 7-5 lead over 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 63 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up seven points. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM posted earnings late yesterday that blew away the Wall  
Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	As a component of the Dow, IBM should account for as much as a  
75-point advance for the blue-chip index, when the stock begins 
trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, there are many, many earnings reports for investors  
to decipher today. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as has been the trend, most of the reports have matched or  
beaten expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing to watch for in today's session is the ratio of  
advancing issues to decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday's session featured 19 advancers for every eleven  
decliners, suggesting a broad range of stocks took place in the 
rally.

<HEADLINE> NASD Nixes Philly Exchange Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Stock Exchange is prepared  
to continue operating as one of the last few regional exchanges 
after the parent company of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the 
American Stock Exchange called off a proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of negotiations failed to settle disputes, the  
National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq 
and the Amex, said Thursday that a merger would not be feasible. 
The NASD suggested the two continue discussing possible 
alternatives such as an agreement to share technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia exchange Chairman Meyer ``Sandy'' Frucher has said  
he was talking to ``a whole bunch'' of other potential partners he 
declined to identify. And after upgrading trading technology in 
recent months, he has been marketing the exchange to brokerage 
firms as a viable trading alternative on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our chances of going it on our own are excellent,'' he said  
Thursday. ``Our technology is as competitive as anybody's in the 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rapid growth of electronic trading and ``multilisting'' --  
the ability to trade a security or option on different markets -- 
also mean a regional exchange can thrive, Frucher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Location is going to be irrelevant,'' he said. ``Your ability  
to execute (trades) and make good markets will be what counts and 
we are positioned to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Philadelphia exchange members went to court to challenge  
the merger plan, which would have involved moving some 2,000 jobs 
to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department had requested information about the  
proposed merger, saying it wanted to look into potential antitrust 
concerns. The Chicago Board Options Exchange abandoned a merger 
with the Pacific Stock Exchange this year after similar federal 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the controversy, the Philadelphia exchange may have  
trouble lining up another merger, said Jim Angel, an assistant 
professor of finance at Georgetown University. ``The Philly does 
not have a lot to offer a merger partner at this point except the 
political quagmire it has become,'' Angel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock trading at the Philadelphia exchange has shrunk to about 1  
percent of U.S. trades from nearly 2 percent in 1990. It conducts 
about 11 percent of the nation's trading in options -- contracts to 
buy stocks at specified prices as a way of betting on future price 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional exchanges are fading fast, dwindling from dozens that  
once competed with Wall Street to just five, in Philadelphia, 
Boston, Cincinnati, Chicago and San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Stadium Subsidies Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The house that Ruth built would possibly  
garner a different nickname if it was put up today: the house that 
taxpayers built. 
</P>
<P>
	A study published by a libertarian Washington think tank says  
government subsidies for stadiums, ballparks and arenas for major 
league teams over the past 10 years total more than $5.2 billion, 
while the economic returns have profited team owners more than 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Raymond Keating, in a report issued by the Cato  
Institute, said the evolving trend to make local governments pay 
for their sports teams' venues is becoming the norm, with taxpayers 
ponying up $9 billion of an estimated $13.5 billion expected to be 
spent in the coming years on arenas for Major League Baseball, 
National Basketball Association, National Football League and 
National Hockey League teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Federal, state and local officials have shown themselves more  
than willing to fork over taxpayer dollars to the sports world,'' 
Keating said. ``From the most liberal Democrats to the most 
conservative Republicans, sports pork is a rampant, bipartisan 
effort, and there is no end in sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent examples include Arizona taxpayers' $238 million share of  
the $335 million Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, where baseball's 
Diamondbacks play, and the public outlay of $200 million for the 
$215 million Coors Field built in Denver to host the Colorado 
Rockies, Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City taxpayers are expected to pay similar shares of a  
new stadium for the Mets. And as Yankee owner George Steinbrenner 
ponders moving his team from Yankee Stadium -- built, the nickname 
implies, off the drawing power of Babe Ruth -- New York City Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani ``has made it clear that he is willing to do 
anything to make sure the Yankees remain'' in the city, Keating 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee Stadium, like most sporting arenas built before the  
Depression, was constructed entirely by private funds. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of the actual subsidies, local governments often offer  
teams tax-free bonds and the construction of access roads and 
freeway off-ramps to entice them to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, Keating argues, while pre-construction studies  
sponsored by the team owners and city boosters generally show such 
public gifts to the teams will in turn profit the surrounding 
neighborhoods, they generally ``fail to generate economic growth 
and new jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Elliott Pollack, an economist who looked at the fiscal  
effects of the Diamondbacks' new ballpark in Phoenix, said both the 
stadium's construction and its operation have brought the city, and 
especially its downtown location, new income. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 4,100 jobs were created to support the stadium and the  
increased economic activity in the neighborhoods surrounding it, 
with an economic output of $319 million, Pollack said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moneys that come into downtown Phoenix because of the  
ballpark would not otherwise be there, including people stopping 
for lunch at restaurants that were built because of the ballpark,'' 
said Pollack, whose 1998 study was commissioned by a booster group, 
Downtown Phoenix Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stanley D. Eitzen, a sports sociologist at Colorado State  
University who had not seen Keating's study, said new stadiums 
often simply shift where people spend their leisure money rather 
than spark new spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``There might be a slight benefit ... gas stations and hotels,  
but that doesn't filter down to most of the common people'' paying 
taxes, Eitzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some intangible benefits to spending the money to draw  
a major league team, such as giving a city's populace something to 
root for. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``whenever these new arenas are built, the cost of going to  
those games goes up,'' Eitzen said, adding that it now costs a 
family of four $250 to go to a typical pro football game or hockey 
match, including the price of parking and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a whole metropolitan area hosts these teams, the common  
person finds it harder to go to see that team and has to stay home 
and watch it on television,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Summit Will Address Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Grappling with crisis in the Balkans, NATO  
leaders toned down a celebration of the alliance's 50th birthday 
Thursday and pledged their summit would focus on tougher steps -- 
possibly including ground troops -- to halt the bloodshed in Kosovo. 
President Clinton accused Slobodan Milosevic of ``reckless 
tyranny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the NATO meeting would  
send ``the clearest possible message of will and resolution'' that 
Milosevic will not prevail. Clinton declared: ``Our alliance is 
strongly united today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton conferred at the White House with NATO Secretary-General  
Javier Solana, who a day earlier ordered an update of plans for a 
possible ground invasion of Kosovo. ``It is a wise and prudent 
course,'' the president said of such an update. But he continued to 
say he believes airstrikes will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let there be no doubt NATO will see this through to the end,''  
Solana said in a Rose Garden appearance with the president. ``We 
have the means and we have the will. That will be no doubt the 
message of this Washington summit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reacted cautiously to a pre-summit overture from  
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Milosevic  
had accepted the idea of a U.N.-controlled ``international 
presence'' in Kosovo if the NATO bombing stops and the alliance 
withdraws troops from Yugoslavia's borders. It was unclear whether 
such a force would be armed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is an offer for a genuine security force, that's the  
first time Mr. Milosevic has ever done that and that represents, I 
suppose, some step forward,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	From across Europe, a swarm of VIP jets began delivering  
presidents and prime ministers of 19 NATO nations and 23 partner 
countries to the capital for three days of summitry beginning 
Friday. The meeting originally was planned as a 50th anniversary 
celebration of NATO's founding, but the festivities were recast 
into more serious discussions as the alliance confronted the crisis 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington braced for limousine gridlock and tight restrictions  
in a 100-block downtown security zone, including much of the 
National Mall. City schools were to be closed Friday and thousands 
of federal workers were given the day off. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is ``no doubt the gravest crisis that Europe and NATO  
have faced for many years,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were some cracks in the declarations of unity. Greek Prime  
Minister Costas Simitis said his country supports NATO but would 
never join the military action against Yugoslavia. He cited polls 
showing that more than 90 percent of Greeks oppose the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit opens in the fifth week of airstrikes against  
Yugoslavia, with no sign that bombing has stopped the violence on 
the ground or the forced expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO brought its firepower closer to Milosevic, destroying one  
of his Belgrade homes in an attack that Yugoslav officials 
protested was an attempt to kill their leader. Milosevic was not 
inside the house. Clinton said the home was a command and control 
center, and he denied that the attack was an assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to repair his impeachment-marred record, Clinton is  
counting on the NATO meeting to increase the pressure on Milosevic 
with an oil embargo and a message of unmistakable resolve to stop 
his aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serb forces there have pushed nearly 1.4 million people,  
three-quarters of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, from their homes,'' 
the president said. ``They have killed thousands.'' But he said 
NATO airstrikes were taking a heavy toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Milosevic can accept this outcome or he can watch as NATO  
grinds down his war machine and the Serb people he claims to 
represent face mounting hardship,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stressed the importance of working with Russia after the  
Balkans conflict is resolved. ``Although we have differences on 
Kosovo, the world benefits when we work together,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair met with congressional leaders at the Capitol after  
private talks with Clinton. The prime minister said it was 
essential that NATO ``give the clearest possible message of will 
and resolution that Milosevic and his policies will not prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary, said that NATO  
``cannot tolerate the rebirth of fascism within Europe. And that is 
what we are witnessing at the present time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders came to Washington seeking a new mission for the  
alliance, which was formed a half century ago to prevent a Soviet 
invasion of Europe. With that threat removed, the alliance is 
casting about for a new purpose beyond its traditional collective 
defense against threats to any member. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright pointed to the violence in  
Kosovo as the type of threat NATO will have to confront in the new 
century. The alliance is expected to commit itself to the 
challenges of containing the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and combatting ethnic and minority conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict in Kosovo and Yugoslavia is NATO's first military  
campaign. It won the Cold War struggle with the Soviet Union 
without ever firing a shot.

<HEADLINE>  Stars Shoot For 2nd Win Vs. Oilers / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars and the Edmonton Oilers say Game  
2 of their NHL first-round series will be just as physical as the 
first, a 2-1 win by the Stars that left Guy Carbonneau dripping 
blood on the ice from a gash in his cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more physical the better,'' Oilers coach Ron Low said.  
``If you think this series is going to go more than four games, and 
some people don't, then physical is the way we have to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 included 110 hits and ended with five players receiving  
misconduct penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where people got this idea that we're not a tough  
team or that they can push us around,'' said Stars defenseman Craig 
Ludwig. ``We've played tough against the them before; we played 
tough against Phoenix. We'll play whatever game they want to put 
out on the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carbonneau, who scored the game-winning goal against Edmonton in  
Game 1 of the Western Conference quarterfinals Wednesday night, 
thrives on this time of year, said teammate Mike Modano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He puts everything he has into the playoffs,'' Modano said.  
``He gets a little bit of fire in his eyes. It's the eye of the 
tiger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 39, Carbonneau is the third-oldest player in the NHL -- and he  
led the Stars with seven hits. Another veteran, Ed Belfour, 
celebrated his 34th birthday by stopping 12 of 13 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really hard sometimes to play against these young lads,''  
Carbonneau said. ``Once in a while, we have just got to chip in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oilers goalie Tommy Salo, who was sick before the game, stopped  
29 of 31 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Salo said, ``With a performance like this, and if we  
continue to play like this, we can continue to cause them some 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's game played out before a record crowd of 17,001 at  
Reunion Arena, and by Thursday afternoon only about 100 single 
seats were available for Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	But those in attendance won't see Stars lead defenseman Derian  
Hatcher. Game 2 will be the fourth of a seven-game suspension 
Hatcher is serving for a late-season, jaw-breaking hit on Jeremy 
Roenick of the Phoenix Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ken Hitchcock started Doug Lidster in Hatcher's place  
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Right wing Pat Verbeek also will miss Game 2 with a knee sprain.  
Hitchcock said he expects Verbeek to start skating again this 
weekend and hopes Verbeek will play in the Edmonton series.

<HEADLINE> Dead Children in Texas Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Texas (AP) -- Two toddlers whose slain bodies were  
found earlier in a quiet creek bed were identified Thursday, and a 
search was underway for their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson County sheriff's investigators said all three were  
recognized by workers at an Austin day care center who called 
police after seeing sketches of the children on police fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers said Dominick Logan Cornelius, 2, and Amanda Lee  
Miller, 3 had been brought to the center by their mother, 
23-year-old Tina Marie Cornelius, on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``She may be in danger, but we don't know,'' Capt. Linda Bunte,  
a Williamson County sheriff's detective, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The identities had eluded investigators since the children's  
bodies were found Monday by a couple walking along the creek bed 
near Hutto, 20 miles north of Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said the children died less than a day before  
being discovered. Autopsies revealed the boy suffered a fatal skull 
fracture and the girl was suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives have told detectives they had not seen Ms. Cornelius,  
who works at a strip club, or her children for roughly four days 
before the bodies were found. Bunte said police do not consider her 
a suspect in her children's deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancers at a south Austin strip club where Ms. Cornelius worked  
said she had been employed there for about three weeks. A dancer 
said Ms. Cornelius had said she planned to leave her children with 
friends while she went out of town.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Maggette Considers NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke freshman Corey Maggette reportedly is  
weighing a jump to the NBA, which would make him the third Blue 
Devils player this spring to leave school early for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Elton Brand and Will Avery already have announced they are  
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette recently visited his former school, Fenwick High in Oak  
Park, Ill., and students and teachers asked him whether he would 
return to Duke or bolt to the NBA, The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh 
reported. Fenwick coach John Quinn said Maggette responded: ``I 
don't know yet,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette and his parents, who could not be reached for comment,  
were believed to have been in Durham last weekend to discuss 
Maggette's draft status with Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said in a radio interview Tuesday night that he does  
not know what Maggette's plans are. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, a 6-foot-6 forward, is considered a high first-round  
pick even though he was a reserve at Duke and NBA scouting director 
Marty Blake said dismissively, ``He's had one good game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for underclassmen to send a letter to NBA  
commissioner David Stern declaring for the draft is May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Maggette declares for the draft, he still could play for  
Duke and retain his collegiate eligibility if he doesn't sign with 
an agent and pulls out a week before the June 30 draft.

<HEADLINE> Open Scoring System Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three championship fights makes for an  
attractive card, yet it's the controversial open scoring system 
that could make Saturday's night of boxing at the MCI Center an 
event to remember. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Boxing Association will post scores from the ringside  
judges after each round when Sharmba Mitchell defends his super 
lightweight title against Reggie Green. The other two bouts will 
employ a different type of open scoring, which has not been used in 
any form this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores will be announced after the fourth, eighth and final  
rounds in the World Boxing Council middleweight fight between 
Hassine Cherifi of France and Keith Holmes of Washington. That 
system will also be used when Washington's Mark Johnson meets 
Ratanchai Vorapin for the vacant International Boxing Federation 
junior bantamweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually everyone associated with the sport has an opinion on  
open scoring, which has become fashionable again in the wake of 
last month's questionable draw in the heavyweight unification bout 
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Open scoring advocates, including promoters Don King and Bob  
Arum, insist that open scoring will deaden the cries of ``fix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It will help restore public trust in boxing,'' Arum said.  
</P>
<P>
	Others say open scoring will only create further controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not one good thing that can come out of open  
scoring,'' said promoter Dan Goossen of America Presents. ``We're 
trying to alleviate incompetency and dishonesty, and open scoring 
does neither.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goossen was the only promoter to testify Thursday at a Senate  
committee hearing on the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, a bill 
that would essentially limit restrictive option contracts to one 
year and increase financial disclosures by promoters to state 
boxing commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Goossen is even more adamant about the eradication of opening  
scoring, comparing it to a surveillance tape of a thief robbing a 
convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	``A crime was still committed; now you just have a tape of it.  
If a fight is scored poorly, then the only thing open scoring does 
is depict the crime in progress,'' Goossen said. ``I'm not saying 
there will be `crimes' committed this weekend, but we're not 
accomplishing what we need in this sport -- better officiating at 
ringside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goossen advocates a school for ringside judges and a rating  
system that would allow only the best judges to work championship 
fights. He also suggested that open scoring could taint the fight 
because a boxer with a sizeable point advantage late in the bout 
could simply run from his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things can go wrong. It didn't work then and it won't  
work now,'' said Harold Weston, Green's promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell (44-2, 29 KOs) will be making his second title defense.  
Green (29-2, 14 KOs) is 10-0 since October 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no telling how the fans in Washington might react if  
Green, the local favorite, appears to be dominating the fight but 
is shown trailing after the 10th round. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes (32-2, 21 KOs) will attempt to regain the WBC title he  
lost to Cherifi (26-2-1, 17 KOs) nearly a year ago. The two were 
scheduled to fight in February, but Cherifi withdrew after injuring 
his back.

<HEADLINE> NRA Still Plans Denver Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Rifle Association still plans to  
meet next week in Denver despite the wish of top city officials 
that the group stay away in the aftermath of the Littleton high 
school killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation to our members,'' NRA spokesman Bill  
Powers said Thursday. ``We will be coming to conduct that 
meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the NRA will do only the essential annual business  
required under bylaws of the not-for-profit group at its May 1 
session. On Wednesday, the organization trimmed the conference 
schedule to one day from the three that were planned and canceled 
seminars, luncheons, exhibits and festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	The only sideline event that had been left on the calendar, an  
evening reception for Republican Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, also 
has been canceled, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say whether people in Denver have been taking Mayor  
Wellington Webb's advice and calling the NRA to tell it not to 
come. ``I don't think it's appropriate to respond to the mayor,'' 
Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb asked citizens to put pressure on the nation's largest  
lobbying group for gun owners, saying, ``Everyday people can make a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want them here,'' said Denver City Council President  
Allegra ``Happy'' Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, used sawed-off shotguns,  
a semiautomatic rifle, a pistol and homemade bombs to kill 12 
students and one teacher at the school outside Denver on Tuesday 
before killing themselves.

<HEADLINE> Senators Honored With Courage Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Sens. John McCain and Russell Feingold, who  
crossed party lines to propose campaign finance reform legislation, 
were named Thursday as winners of the John F. Kennedy Profile in 
Courage Award. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Feingold, a Wisconsin  
Democrat, were honored for addressing fund-raising excesses and 
trying to regulate the flow of special interest money to campaigns. 
The McCain-Feingold bill was ultimately defeated last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the 10th Profile in Courage Award and the first to be  
shared by two elected American politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The award, which comes with a $25,000 stipend, is presented to  
elected officials who fight for what they believe is right, despite 
opposition from constituents, interest groups or others. 
</P>
<P>
	It is named for President Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning  
book ``Profiles in Courage.''

	Bombs Found in Colo. School Kitchen  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The two outcasts who massacred their  
classmates before killing themselves intended to blow up the 
school, authorities said today after discovering two large propane 
bombs hidden in the school's kitchen. The discovery also could 
provide more evidence of a wider conspiracy, Sheriff John Stone 
said today. ``These subjects were not only on a killing rampage, 
but they were going to destroy the school. They were going to burn 
the school up,'' Stone said. Each of the bombs weighed at least 35 
pounds.

	BONN, Germany (AP) -- German newspapers reacted with horror today  
to reports that the Colorado school shooters dabbled in Nazi 
symbols and a tabloid headline called them ``Hitler's murderous 
children.'' ``The killers lived in Nazi madness,'' said Bild, 
Germany's most-read daily. ``Their bloodbath was intended as homage 
to the dictator's 110th birthday.'' A Cologne daily, ``Express'' 
likened the shooters to ``sinister Gestapo men'' because they wore 
black trench coats.

	NATO Opens Way for Ground Offensive  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and British officials said today it is  
prudent, after four weeks of airstrikes, to consider whether NATO's 
military policy in Yugoslavia should be reversed to allow the 
deployment of ground troops. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
has asked Army Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme commander of NATO forces 
in Europe, to update the military assessment made in October that 
the Yugoslavia campaign should be limited to the air. ``I think it 
is inappropriate to rule anything out and we have not done so,'' 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said today.

	U.S. Seeking Kosovo Refugee Housing  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials are searching for a military  
base in this country that can temporarily house up to 20,000 
refugees from Kosovo, Justice Department officials said today. 
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told a news conference that an 
earlier decision not to bring any Kosovo refugees here was reversed 
``because we need to relieve the situation in Macedonia.'' More 
than 130,000 refugees have streamed across the border into 
Macedonia during the NATO air attacks on Serbian forces.

	Fla. Issues Smoke Health Advisory

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Fires that scorched 170,000 acres of the Everglades  
may finally be burning down, but the smoke left behind could be 
hazardous and state officials have issued a health advisory. The 
warning by the state Department of Health and Department of 
Environmental Protection warns older people, small children and 
those with respiratory problems to avoid strenuous activity outside 
if there is still smoke in the area. Interstate 75, South Florida's 
main east-west highway known as Alligator Alley, was reopened this 
morning.

	U.N. Says AIDS Outpacing Funding  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Spending by donor countries to combat AIDS in  
developing countries is failing to keep pace with the spread of the 
disease, now infecting nearly 6 million people worldwide each year, 
the United Nations said today. ``It is alarming that AIDS is 
expanding three times faster than the funding to control it,'' said 
Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, the Joint U.N. 
Program on HIV/AIDS. The agency says 95 percent of the people 
living with the HIV virus are in developing countries, most of them 
in Africa.

	MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge today opened the way for Amy  
Fisher's possible parole within days after the Long Island Lolita 
apologized in court to Mary Jo Buttafuoco, the woman she shot in a 
jealous rage. ``What happened to you -- it wasn't your husband's 
fault ... It was my fault and I'm sorry,'' the 24-year-old Ms. 
Fisher said, looking directly at Mrs. Buttafuoco. ``Through faith 
in God I am able to forgive,'' Mrs. Buttafuoco said. ``It did not 
come easily or quickly.'' The Buttafuocos reconciled and now live 
in Los Angeles.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He uttered not a word, but Muhammad Ali's  
presence at a Senate hearing today spoke volumes about the state of 
professional boxing and lent support to Sen. John McCain's efforts 
to clean up the sport. The former heavyweight champion, who suffers 
from Parkinson's syndrome and has trouble speaking, told the Senate 
Commerce Committee through longtime friend Howard Bingham that the 
Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield heavyweight draw last month was the 
``lowest point'' for the sport.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Bush Seeks Gov't Help for Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- With Florida wildfires on pace to sear through more  
than the 500,000 acres burned up last year, Gov. Jeb Bush has asked 
President Clinton to declare an emergency in 67 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush requested that federal funds be made available to the  
counties because the fires that have burned more than 240,000 acres 
this year will likely continue until the state gets much-needed 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of this date last year, only 9,000 acres in Florida had  
burned,'' Bush wrote in the request Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida has soaked up far less rain than usual during its  
December-through-April dry season, prompting state officials to 
fear a repeat of last summer's wildfires, which forced 100,000 
people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service predicted dry weather with no  
significant rainfall through the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames from wildfires weren't a threat Thursday, but officials  
encouraged people with health problems to stay inside because of 
lingering smoke, vehicle emissions, high temperatures and low 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, for people like the elderly, small children and  
people with respiratory and heart problems, it affects them the 
most, and we want to make sure they're safe,'' said Frank Penela, 
spokesman for the state Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest of the fires, a blaze that consumed 170,000 acres in  
the Everglades, was contained Thursday, a week after it began. 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 75, South Florida's main east-west highway known as  
Alligator Alley, was reopened at 10 a.m. Thursday after smoke from 
the fire cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was the largest of at least 2,615 wildfires that have  
burned almost 243,816 acres in Florida this year. Flames left an 
area of blackened sawgrass estimated at 24 miles long and 15 miles 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildfires have damaged or destroyed 140 homes and buildings this  
year, most of them in St. Lucie County, and injured 20 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Everglades fire, two fires in Apalachicola and  
Osceola national forests were burning on Thursday but were 
contained, Efird said.

<HEADLINE> Organ Implanted After Being Trashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VALHALLA, N.Y. (AP) -- The transplant team was just about to put  
the patient under when the operation had to be postponed. The 
healthy new kidney, it seemed, was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone, it turns out, had thrown it in a recycling bin.  
</P>
<P>
	The organ was found there within 90 minutes, and the operation  
went forward. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, two days after the initial surgery, the organ was  
removed because it was ``not working properly,'' Westchester 
Medical Center said in a statement. But Kristine Smith, spokeswoman 
for the state Health Department, said the malfunction had nothing 
to do with the mixup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outcome for the patient depends on a number of factors  
that have nothing to do with this,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Khalid Butt, who performed Thursday's operation, said the  
67-year-old patient ``will be fine.'' Hospital officials refused to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The organ had been in the operating room, on ice, wrapped in  
four layers of plastic inside a polystyrene box, ready to help save 
the life of a victim of kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
	But the operating room had been cleaned and the kidney was gone  
and the minutes were ticking away. A kidney from a cadaver, like 
this one, can be preserved on ice for about 48 hours, and 36 hours 
had already passed. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient, a New York man who spent the last year on dialysis,  
was told there would be a delay. He wasn't told why. ``There was no 
reason to at that point,'' said Carin Grossman, a hospital 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour and a half went by as the hospital was searched.  
Finally, the kidney was found. 
</P>
<P>
	The container ``was thought to be simply an empty corrugated box  
and therefore placed in the recycling receptacle for clean 
cardboard,'' the hospital said. But the box was clearly labeled, 
with ``something like `Organ for Transplant,''' Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the medical center, which leads New York state in the  
number of kidney transplants performed each year, and the Health 
Department are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient's daughter, Gloria Kocal, said she was told her  
father would now return to dialysis treatment. She said he may have 
reservations about undergoing a third operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if my father wants to re-put his name on the list  
after all he went through,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Kidney Foundation said there were more than 11,000  
kidney transplants in the United States in 1997. The United Network 
for Organ Sharing said that at the end of last year, there were 
about 40,000 patients on waiting lists for kidneys.

<HEADLINE> Italian-German Telecom Deal OKd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA and Deutsche Telekom AG have  
agreed on one of the biggest corporate marriages ever, a deal that 
would create the world's second-largest telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia accepted Deutsche Telecom's offer that valued the  
Italian company at about $82 billion at Wednesday's closing prices 
after receiving assurances that the new company would not fall 
under the control of the German government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that this will be the first step in the  
creation of Europe's first telecommunications powerhouse,'' Telecom 
Italia chief executive Franco Bernabe told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would create Europe's largest phone company -- one big  
enough to compete with overseas giants like AT&AMP;T Corp. of the 
United States and British Telecommunications PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies must now win over shareholders and regulatory  
authorities in the United States and the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom chief executive Ron Sommer said the partners  
were trying to create a truly pan-European company worthy of a new 
era symbolized by the euro, the common currency shared by 11 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our operation is very much in line with the integration  
process of Europe,'' he said at a joint news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined entity, which has not yet been given a name, would  
have revenues of $62.8 billion and an operating profit of $13.9 
billion, based on 1998 figures. It would have more than 100 million 
customers, mostly in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company would be run out of joint headquarters in  
Bonn and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, each share of Deutsche Telekom would be  
exchanged for three ordinary voting shares of Telecom Italia stock, 
valuing each share in the Italian company at $12.75 as of 
Wednesday's closing share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Telecom Italia's savings shares would be exchanged  
at a rate of 5.61 for each share of Deutsche Telekom. The deal also 
provides that the newly formed company will assume Telecom Italia's 
debts of approximately $8.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement would give Deutsche Telekom about 56 percent of  
the new company, with Telecom Italia controlling the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger agreement was prompted by Telecom Italia's effort to  
avoid a hostile takeover bid from its smaller Italian rival 
Olivetti SpA. Olivetti has offered $12.19 for each share of Telecom 
Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners expect the merger to save them more than $635  
million in the first year alone, with savings increasing in ensuing 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe and Sommer, who will be joint chief executives and  
chairmen, refused to say how many jobs would be cut if the merger 
is completed. The combined company would have 304,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our vision is a vision of growth. It is not a vision of  
job-cutting,'' Sommer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company would rank second in the world in terms of  
revenues after Japanese telecommunications giant NTT, which posted 
sales last year of $69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom had a market capitalization of about $105  
billion while Telecom Italia was worth about $67 billion, based on 
Wednesday's closing share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In value, the merger would rival the biggest merger to date --  
the pending deal between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., which was 
worth about $82 billion as of late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe and Sommer are pinning their hopes for global success on  
the growth potential for cellular phones and the Internet, and for 
expansion into new markets -- especially the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer refused to confirm whether Deutsche Telekom was planning  
a much-rumored takeover of Sprint Corp., the No. 3 U.S. 
long-distance phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernabe made it clear, however, that such a takeover bid was not  
impossible. ``The United States will be the next area of 
expansion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two formerly state-controlled companies struck their deal  
after the German government assured the Italian Treasury that it 
would not use its voting rights in Deutsche Telekom to dominate the 
merged business. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government owns about 72 percent of Deutsche Telekom,  
but that will drop to 66 percent when the company issues new shares 
this summer. The government's share would decrease to about 40 
percent under terms of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G's 3rd-Quarter Earnings Up 8 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s third-quarter earnings  
increased 8 percent as sales rose in Asia, but Russia's economic 
crisis hurt consumer products giant's business in that region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based company reported Thursday that its earnings  
for the quarter ended March 31 were $1.04 billion, or 72 cents per 
diluted share, compared with $961 million and 65 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide sales totaled $9.2 billion, a 4 percent increase from  
$8.9 billion in the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in North America rose 7 percent in the quarter, boosted by  
the rollout of an array of new products, including the odor remover 
Febreze and Tide with Bleach detergent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in Asia increased by 8 percent, helped by strengthening  
currency exchange rates in Japan and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the region including Europe, the Middle East and  
Africa were flat, impacted by the continuing Russian economic 
crisis and currency devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in Latin America were flat, affected by unfavorable  
exchange rates and stiff pressure in laundry and cleaning product 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of P&AMP;G's fiscal year, earnings totaled  
$3.3 billion, or $2.30 per share, against $3.1 billion and $2.09 a 
year ago. Sales were $28.7 billion, up from $27.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sells about 300 product brands in more than 140  
countries. These brands include Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, 
Pantene Pro-V shampoo, Pringles snack chips and Pampers disposable 
diapers. P&AMP;G employs more than 110,000 employees worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Former AP War Correspondent Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Godfrey H.P. Anderson, a World War II  
correspondent for The Associated Press who was taken prisoner in 
North Africa, has died. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who died Tuesday at Seton Medical Center following a  
stroke, worked for the AP for 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in London, Anderson worked as a writer and photo editor for  
the AP in his native country and later served as head of the news 
cooperative's photo bureau in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to serve as a war correspondent in Ethiopia, Egypt,  
Palestine, Syria and France and chief of bureau in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	His duty was interrupted for 3 1/2 years when he was taken prisoner  
in 1941 by Rommel's forces in Libya and held prisoner in German 
camps in Libya, Italy and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson transferred to the AP's Dallas office in 1970, after  
his wife, a native of Texas, was offered a job with the Dallas 
Times Herald. He became a U.S. citizen two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Nadeane Walker Anderson, he is survived  
by his daughter, Jane Anderson Frederick, and a son, David Godfrey 
Anderson.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Rocket Fails To Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The launch countdown went all the  
way down to zero Thursday night, but Boeing's new Delta III rocket 
did not ignite and remained on the pad. 
</P>
<P>
	``3-2-1, zero. Plus-1. Plus-2. And we had a hang fire or a  
misfire,'' the launch commentator announced. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time in two weeks that Boeing had tried to  
send up the rocket with an Orion broadcasting satellite. Three 
times Thursday night, an alarm halted the countdown at the last 
minute but Boeing resolved those problems and moved on. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the core stage of the rocket nor the strap-on boosters  
fired on command. The small steering engines on the rocket also 
never ignited. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Witzling, a Boeing vice president, said engineers have no  
idea what went wrong. The company will try again early next week to 
launch the rocket if the problem can be solved quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will eventually come together, we're quite sure of that,''  
Witzling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, a Delta III carrying a Galaxy broadcasting  
satellite blew up 71 seconds after liftoff, a $225 million disaster 
that cost Boeing millions more for the investigation that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Aerospace engineers who took part in the investigation concluded  
that the computer software guidelines for the new Delta III were 
wrong. The guidelines were changed for Thursday's launch attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials said they did everything they could to prevent  
another failure, double-checking and triple-checking the entire 
rocket system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III is key to Boeing's plan to grab more of the launch  
market. The rocket is designed to carry twice as much payload as 
the smaller Delta II.

<HEADLINE> RJR Profit Skids 54 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s underlying profit  
skidded 54 percent in the first quarter due to tobacco lawsuit 
settlement expenses and the fallout from last year's steep price 
hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the nation's second-biggest tobacco company, led by  
its Camel and Winston brands, said it lost ground in the U.S. 
cigarette market even as industry leader Philip Morris Cos. Inc. 
gained. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were below Wall Street's expectations but RJR shares  
rose 43 3/4 cents to $26.18 3/4 in trading Thursday on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Before one-time charges, RJR earned $83 million, or 24 cents a  
share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with $179 
million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Those earnings fell short of the 28 cents a share that analysts  
surveyed by First Call had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 7 percent to $4.22 billion from $3.95 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Counting one-time items, RJR reported net income of $76 million,  
or 22 cents a share, in the quarter in contrast to a loss of $20 
million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 total reflected $15 million in pretax expenses for  
restructuring its 80.6-percent owned Nabisco Foods business, 
cutting net income by 2 cents a share. The 1998 figures included a 
$312 million pretax charge for the costs of settling a tobacco 
lawsuit with the state of Minnesota, reducing net income by 62 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic tobacco profits fell 19 percent in the quarter,  
excluding the charge a year ago, even though revenue rose 40 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Its R.J. Reynolds Tobacco division boosted prices by 63 cents a  
pack over the past year, including a 45 cent-a-pack increase after 
last November's legal settlement with 46 states over health costs 
for treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the price hikes helped boost Reynolds cigarette revenue,  
its shipments to wholesalers fell 14 percent compared with a 10 
percent drop for the overall industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds estimated its share of the retail market fell nearly a  
full percentage point to 24.57 percent in the quarter. Philip 
Morris said earlier this week its retail market share rose 1.6 
points to 53.7 percent in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Promotional costs increased as Reynolds and other tobacco makers  
offered selective discounts to cushion the impact of the price 
hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also depressing Reynolds' tobacco results were $500 million in  
expenses for tobacco litigation settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the November agreement, Reynolds and other tobacco  
makers have agreed to pay $246 billion over 25 years to settle all 
50 states' claims for expenses of treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I believe that Reynolds is standing its ground in an  
extremely competitive domestic marketplace,'' said RJR's chairman 
and chief executive, Steven F. Goldstone. ``We expect industry 
performance to begin to settle down over the next few quarters as 
consumers, retailers and manufacturers adjust to the new pricing 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Its international tobacco business posted a 31 percent decline  
in operating profits as sales fell 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR plans to sell the international tobacco business to Japan  
Tobacco Co. for $7.8 billion in cash by mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	It then plans to spin off its stake in its domestic tobacco  
business to its shareholders. That would leave RJR with its 
controlling stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp., which reported a 35 
percent decline in first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nabisco is showing great progress,'' Goldstone said.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Profits Jump 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. reported its first-quarter  
profits rose 11 percent amid strong foreign and domestic sales, an 
increase in restaurant openings and lower operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast-food company said Thursday its income rose to $402.7  
million, or 29 cents a share, from $362.2 million, or 26 cents a 
share, in the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call Corp. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, McDonald's 
shares fell 68 3/4 cents to $44.68 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Systemwide sales -- which include business at franchised  
restaurants as well as company-owned outlets -- rose 8 percent to 
$8.8 billion from $8.18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's own revenues also rose 8 percent, to $3.03 billion  
from $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., reported sales at  
restaurants open at least a year, an industry measure of 
performance, showed positive growth. The company did not disclose 
exact figures, although sales for all domestic restaurants rose 4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have put comparable-store sales in the low single  
digits, calling that a satisfactory performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Feldman, president of the domestic division, said the  
strong sales were the result of popular children's Happy Meal 
promotions that included Winnie the Pooh and Furby toys. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's switch of its 6,500 U.S. and Canadian restaurants  
to just-in-time ordering, now about 50 percent completed, also 
helped lower food and paper costs and increase customer 
satisfaction about taste, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have praised the chain in recent months for moving to  
bring more children -- and their parents -- into its stores despite a 
dearth of new menu offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, McDonald's has introduced only its McFlurry  
sundae and breakfast bagel sandwiches, although it is widely 
testing a hamburger similar to Burger King's Whopper and waffle 
sticks with fillings baked inside. 
</P>
<P>
	James Cantalupo, chief executive of the international business,  
also reported strong results despite hard economic times in Russia 
and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Europe again led our results, in spite of the diminished  
performance in Russia,'' Cantalupo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it expects to save about $100 million  
annually beginning next year as a result of previously-announced 
staff reductions and productivity initiatives at its headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Probe VA Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers expressed concern Wednesday over  
``sloppy'' management by officials at a Los Angeles veterans 
hospital that allowed potentially harmful clinical research to be 
conducted on patients without their proper consent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concerns about informed consent go straight back to the  
awful things that Nazis did to people during the Holocaust and 
called it medical research,'' said Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., who 
chairs the House Veterans Affairs Committee's oversight and 
investigations panel. ``The civilized world vowed that it should 
not happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research problems, along with an overall failure to meet  
federal regulations, prompted federal regulators last month to 
suspend research at the West Los Angeles VA Healthcare Center, the 
nation's largest veterans' hospital. They also spurred an 
investigation into the issue by two House panels -- including the 
one Everett heads -- into whether the problems are widespread among 
VA facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing on the issue Wednesday, lawmakers questioned  
witnesses about other violations that have surfaced since the 
research suspension was imposed. The most serious violations 
involve Dr. Philip Sager, a cardiologist accused of collecting data 
on four patients during heart procedures without obtaining their 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Sager conducted ``moderate to high-risk''  
catheterization research procedures in which probes were inserted 
in the hearts of four patients. One patient had twice refused to 
give his permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Sager was suspended without pay for 10 days. An investigation  
later determined he only served seven days of his suspension, 
although hospital officials told lawmakers Wednesday that Sager 
will finish serving out his discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., who chairs the VA subcommittee on  
health, chastised officials for being slow to learn about Sager's 
behavior and for failing to make sure he had been punished. 
</P>
<P>
	``All down the line, there's a tentative approach here,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Everett questioned why Sager was not fired.  
</P>
<P>
	Dean Norman, the acting chief of staff at the West Los Angeles  
facility, said a panel of doctors had determined that suspension 
was more appropriate than termination for Sager because he had not 
violated practices before and he was a well-known and respected 
cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth W. Kizer, the VA Department's undersecretary for health,  
announced a pair of initiatives that he said will toughen controls 
on medical research. Kizer said the department will create the 
Office of Research Compliance and Assurance, an independent agency 
that will review all VA research efforts. It also will fund an 
outside program to accredit all department research programs, 
particularly those involving human subjects.

<HEADLINE> Drugs Ruled Relevant in Lewis Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A judge says that allegations of illegal drug use  
by Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis can considered as evidence at 
an upcoming malpractice trial stemming from his death. 
</P>
<P>
	His widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, has sued four doctors, accusing  
them of misdiagnosing and mistreating her husband's heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith ruled  
that jurors will only be able to hear specific allegations if 
lawyers for the doctors can prove a connection between Lewis' 
alleged cocaine use and the doctors' failure to diagnose his heart 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed and died in July of 1993 while shooting baskets  
at Brandeis University. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months before his death, the 27-year-old Lewis collapsed  
during a playoff game. A team of New England Baptist Hospital 
doctors diagnosed him with a life-threatening heart ailment, and 
they also warned him that his career was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis transferred to Brigham and Women's Hospital, where a team  
led by Dr. Gilbert Mudge diagnosed him with a less-harmful 
neurological condition, and said chances were good that Lewis could 
play again. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy after Lewis' death revealed a badly damaged heart.  
</P>
<P>
	Mudge testified that 16 days before Lewis died, the basketball  
star acknowledged having used cocaine, but said he had stopped. The 
lack of full disclosure early on made it impossible to make a 
proper diagnosis because Lewis hid his cocaine use, Mudge claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has vehemently denied her husband ever used  
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Lewis' widow asked that any evidence of illicit drug  
use be barred from the trial, scheduled to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers argued the issue was raised ``for the sole purpose  
of trashing'' Lewis' reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fremont-Smith said the issue was admissible.  
</P>
<P>
	``If a person uses cocaine, it can cause structural damage to  
the heart,'' Fremont-Smith said. ``It does become relevant, in my 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Fremont-Smith also turned down another motion by  
Harris-Lewis to stop the defense from bringing up the insurance 
policies the Celtics took out on Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	The policies were collected and Harris-Lewis was paid the  
remainder of Lewis' salary, roughly $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying jurors must decide on the credibility of the evidence,  
the judge said that if Lewis lied on the insurance forms, it would 
prove a ``motive'' why plaintiffs would not want the information to 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Mudge, Drs. Mark A. Creager, Peter L. Friedman  
and John D. Rutherford -- who acted as consultants -- are also named 
in the suit.

<HEADLINE> Gateway Sees Earnings Rise 31 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH SIOUX CITY, S.D. (AP) -- Gateway said strong sales  
domestically and in its Asia-Pacific markets helped the computer 
maker earn $99.6 million in the first quarter, up 31 percent from 
the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings reported Thursday worked out to 62 cents per share,  
topping the 60 cents predicted by analysts surveyed by First Call 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway earned $75.9 million in the same quarter last year, or  
48 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our consumer business has never been stronger, and now we're  
positioned to expand that success into the small and mid-sized 
business arena,'' said Ted Waitt, chairman and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 22 percent to $2.1 billion, compared with  
$1.7 billion a year ago. The company shipped 1.08 million computers 
in the first quarter, up 42 percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased 23 percent in the United States and 65 percent  
in Asia-Pacific, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter results were announced after the markets had  
closed. Shares of Gateway rose $3.93 3/4, or 6 percent, to $69.93 3/4 
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> President Talks to H.S. Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton urged students, parents  
and teachers across the country today to consider whether graphic 
violence on television and the Internet plays a role in tragedies 
such as the killings at a school in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to ask ourselves some pretty hard questions here,''  
Clinton told a group of two dozen pupils at T.C. Williams High 
School. ``What is the role of the larger culture here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's discussion with students and teachers in the  
school's media room was broadcast via cable to millions of students 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has visited T.C. Williams High before to highlight the  
Alexandria school district's emphasis on safety and training 
students in nonviolent conflict resolution. About 1,800 pupils from 
a variety of ethnic and religious backgrounds attend the school. 
</P>
<P>
	While facts continue to trickle out about the motives behind the  
slayings in Colorado, Clinton said he had been struck by reports 
that the two killers felt ostracized by their peers and embraced 
racist views. Clinton urged the students to look beyond their 
differences and emphasize what they all had in common. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, everybody gets `dissed' some time in life,'' Clinton  
said. ``Even the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The T.C. Williams students scheduled a session on conflict  
resolution in the school's media center after two students at 
Columbine High School in Littleton killed 12 classmates, a teacher 
and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The session offered Clinton, wary about visiting Littleton  
because it might disrupt the community's efforts to deal with the 
tragedy, a chance to meet with students and address school safety. 
</P>
<P>
	While he applauded peer-mediation and other conflict resolution  
programs, the president also said the Littleton tragedy should 
prompt Americans to examine the responsibilities of parents, 
students and the violence present every day in the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of you are exposed to much higher levels of violence  
through television, through video games ... you can actually find 
out how to make bombs on the Internet,'' Clinton said. ``Does that 
make a difference? Does it make these things more likely to 
happen?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Channel One cable broadcast, which carried Clinton's session  
with the students, reaches 12,000 schools with 8 million pupils 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned by one student about the ease with which guns can be  
purchased in the United States, Clinton hinted he may be 
considering further legislation to curb access to firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his administration's efforts to get the Brady Law and  
the assault-weapons ban through Congress were ``met with violent 
opposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be part of what we are trying to do,'' Clinton said,  
``to strike a better balance between making it harder for people 
who are violent to get guns and misuse them without interfering'' 
with the constitutional right to bear arms.

<HEADLINE> Who Won National Scholarships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than a million families applied for a  
chance to receive one of 40,000 scholarships to help low-income 
children attend private school, Wall Street financier Theodore 
Forstmann said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners of the Children's Scholarship Fund for students in  
kindergarten through eighth grade were announced at simultaneous 
news conferences here and in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners, chosen by lottery from all 50 states, nearly 3,000  
cities and 22,000 communities, include 3,750 students in Los 
Angeles and 2,500 each in New York and Chicago. Other cities 
included Newark, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New Orleans. The 
numbers reflect the amount of money given by private donors from 
each city. 
</P>
<P>
	Forstmann, who along with John Walton, heir to the Wal-Mart  
fortune, founded the fund in 1998 and helped raise $170 million in 
scholarship monies, said the 1,237,360 applicants represented 
nearly one out of every 30 schoolchildren in America. He said it 
also showed how deeply dissatisfied parents were with the current 
education system. 
</P>
<P>
	The scholarships, ranging from $600 to $1,600 a year for four  
years, were open to qualifying students in both public and private 
schools, but scholarship officials said most came from public 
schools. The scholarships can also be used to cover costs for 
public schools outside a child's assigned district. 
</P>
<P>
	Forstmann, known in the business world for his leveraged buyouts  
of companies including Dr. Pepper, General Instruments and 
Gulfstream Aerospace, enlisted the help of baseball star Sammy 
Sosa, TV personality Oprah Winfrey and poet Maya Angelou to promote 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including Sandra Feldman, president of the American  
Federation of Teachers, say the program undermines the public 
school system and does little to help the poorest students who 
cannot afford an average of $1,000 a year to match the scholarship 
and cover the cost of private tuition. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Lynn, head of Americans United for Separation of Church  
and State, called the scholarship fund ``a bait-and-switch con 
game'' whose real goal is to privatize the public school system. 
``Their much-ballyhooed `scholarship' scheme is merely a step in 
that direction,'' Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were eligible if their family income was just above the  
cutoff for the federal reduced-price lunch program. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakdown showed that most applicants came from New York, the  
nation's largest school system, with 168,184 applicants, followed 
by Chicago with 59,186; Los Angeles with 54,444 and Baltimore with 
46,011.

<HEADLINE> Army Helicopter Crash Kills Several </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- An Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed  
during a training mission Thursday, killing some of the 11 people 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there are some fatalities,'' said Col. John Smith, an  
Army spokesman at the Pentagon. He said he did not know how many. 
</P>
<P>
	The UH-60 helicopter went down at Fort Campbell about 7 a.m.,  
the Army said. An Army photo showed the chopper scattered in 
several large pieces in a wooded area next to a road. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt University Medical Center confirmed one victim died  
at the Nashville, Tenn., hospital, and said two others were in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Hawk is the primary helicopter for air assault, air  
cavalry and medical evacuation units. It can carry an 11-person 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Campbell, headquarters for the 101st Airborne Division,  
straddles the Kentucky-Tennessee line about 200 miles southwest of 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, two Black Hawks collided at Fort Campbell, killing six  
soldiers. The Army said the air crews didn't coordinate well 
enough, and one didn't warn the other that it had lost sight of the 
second chopper. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months earlier, a MH-47E Chinook from Fort Campbell  
crashed in a Kentucky field, killing five people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Israel Critic in State Dept. Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A young Arab-American lawyer who has  
criticized Israel as a torturer of Palestinians and occupier of 
their land has worked as a special assistant for the State 
Department's Near East bureau chief since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a complaint by the Zionist Organization of  
America, the bureau chief, Assistant Secretary of State Martin 
Indyk, told The Associated Press he was aware of Joseph Zogby's 
sympathies for the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believed he could make an important contribution to the work  
of the State Department, and that has proven to be the case,'' 
Indyk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Indyk said, ``There are very few Arab-Americans working in  
the State Department in any area. The Clinton administration is 
committed to a diverse work place, and in that context we do feel 
it is important to have Arab-Americans in the State Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zogby, in his late 20s and a graduate of the University of  
Virginia law school, was hired last summer for a year as one of 
Indyk's two special assistants. ``He has been offered a position to 
continue here, with a promotion, based on his performance here,'' 
Indyk said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment was raised with Indyk at a meeting Thursday in  
New York with the heads of several American Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton A. Klein, national director of the Zionist Organization  
of America, said he had urged Indyk to dismiss Zogby ``given 
Zogby's harsh bias against Israel and U.S. policy in the Mideast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ZOA distributed two articles by Zogby. In one, he accuses  
Israeli security forces of torturing hundreds of Palestinian people 
a year, In the other, marking Israel's 50th anniversary, he calls 
Israel a colonizer and abuser of human rights, likening it to 
America's ``genocidal treatment of the Native Americans and 
enslavement of African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Jewish state is still not free,'' he wrote. ``It occupies  
another people and nation ... the jailer himself is still in 
prison. He feels compelled to keep constant watch over his captive, 
confiscating his land, torturing him, detaining him without charge 
or trial, and rearing hate in his heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biographical notes on a Zogby article for the periodical  
``Washington Report on Middle East Affairs'' say he founded the 
Palestine Peace Project, which brings American lawyers and law 
students to territory under the Palestinian Authority's control to 
volunteer with local legal and human rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein said Zogby still directs the Peace Project and that it  
shares the telephone number of the Arab-American Institute, a 
pro-Arab lobby headed by James Zogby, his father. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Zogby said in an interview that ``Joe represents one  
Arab-American in the bureau. There should be more for there to be 
real diversity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mort Klein's characterization of Joseph's views are wrong,''  
Zogby said. ``If we were all as Mort Klein characterizes us to be, 
this would be an ugly world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further, Zogby said his son wrote ``a thoughtful piece in an  
effort to bridge the gap in perception between the Palestinians and 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said  
Arab-Americans systematically have been excluded from ``input'' 
into U.S. Middle East policy and said Klein's criticism was based 
on out-of-context quotations and Joseph Zogby's ``ethnicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indyk described Joseph Zogby as ``a valued member'' of the Near  
East bureau. ``His performance has been exemplary and fully 
consistent with U.S. foreign policy,'' Indyk said. ``He has my full 
confidence and that of the Department of State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The articles were written before Zogby joined the government and  
represent ``his private views,'' Indyk said. ``What matters is 
whether those who work here support administration policy, and he 
does.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Keep Sample of Smallpox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerns that a new smallpox vaccine might be  
needed to combat a future terrorist threat led President Clinton on 
Thursday to reject appeals from scores of nations to destroy one of 
the last caches of the deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
	World Health Organization officials, who recommended that the  
remaining stores of smallpox be destroyed, were unavailable for 
comment, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Russia are the only two nations with known  
smallpox stocks, but the administration fears the virus could have 
fallen into other hands, raising the threat of bioterrorism. 
Smallpox is highly contagious and kills about 20 percent of those 
afflicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one else is supposed to have it,'' a senior administration  
official said. ``We don't know who else might have it. But the 
virus stores very easily in freezers, so it could be elsewhere. We 
don't know what has happened in the last 20 years ... who might 
still have the virus and may not be telling anyone that they have 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It could re-emerge as a terrorist threat,'' said the official,  
who insisted on anonymity. ``It could re-emerge as an accident from 
a laboratory that doesn't know it has it. It could start spreading 
very quickly from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WHO first recommended in 1996 that the U.S. and Russian  
laboratory caches be destroyed in June. The United States and 
scores of other nations agreed that the stocks should be destroyed. 
But Clinton ordered that the decision be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	The WHO reaffirmed its decision in January after polling its 191  
member states to gauge support for destroying the caches. 
</P>
<P>
	A nine-member committee also recommended that if the stocks were  
not destroyed, the WHO should conduct regular inspections and 
inform member states that release of the virus into the environment 
would be considered ``a crime against humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton concluded that the virus samples must be maintained to  
develop new drugs and vaccines to treat or prevent the disease, 
which was eradicated around the world in 1980 through an 
inoculation effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing Clinton's decision, National Security Council  
spokesman Mike Hammer said, ``The president has decided to seek a 
delay in the destruction of declared smallpox stocks.'' Russia also 
is opposed to their destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Bioterrorism experts have said in recent months they believe the  
virus has been distributed to spots in Russia beyond the known 
laboratories, perhaps in places with less effective security 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
	That information originates with a former high Soviet research  
official, Ken Alibek, who defected to the United States in 1992 and 
testified before Congress last May. Alibek's information has been 
verified by others, according to smallpox experts who spoke at a 
recent bioterrorism conference sponsored by Johns Hopkins 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released last month by experts at the National Academy  
of Science's Institute of Medicine recommended that the surviving 
laboratory specimens of smallpox be kept alive as a safety net in 
case the disease breaks out again. 
</P>
<P>
	The study warned that with much of the world's population no  
longer protected by inoculation against smallpox, the virus could 
pose a serious threat. Most Americans below 30 have never had the 
inoculation, and remaining smallpox vaccination stocks could treat 
only about 6 million people. Even those supplies are deteriorating.

<HEADLINE>  Gunmen's Video Foreshadowed Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Months before the massacre at Columbine  
High, the two killers made a class-project video depicting 
themselves in their trench coats, gunning down athletes in the 
school hallway, a classmate says. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed and wounded dozens of  
students at the school before taking their own lives Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Their spasm of violence was foreshadowed by several videos they  
made last fall for a class, classmates said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one video, ``they had their friends pretend to be the jocks,  
and they pretended to be the gunmen shooting them,'' high school 
junior Chris Reilly told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a little upset they couldn't show their video to the  
whole school. But there were guns in every scene of the video, so 
you can't show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they hadn't yet determined whether such a  
video was made, and the teacher who taught the class refused to 
comment. But another student said the pair's video projects were 
uniformly disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always were the same kind of videos,'' said Eric Veik,  
16. ``They always wore trench coats. They always wanted to be the 
intimidators, the good guys out to get the bad guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At school, the pair were known as members of a group of outcasts  
who called themselves the ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' for the long black 
coats they wore, regardless of the season. Klebold and Harris 
openly admired Hitler, wore German crosses to school, and played 
violent video games for hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbing thing, to some, is that Klebold and Harris came  
from respected, middle-class families. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and Susan Klebold lived in a home worth nearly $400,000,  
a modernistic cedar-and-glass structure with matching guest house 
tucked between two huge stone formations on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold's father, Thomas, 52, a retired geophysicist who  
consulted with companies exploring gas and oil, now runs a mortgage 
management business from his home. His mother, 50, has worked for 
the Colorado community-college system for years, helping disabled 
students gain access to education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all scratching our heads right now,'' said Michael  
Briand, who knows Ms. Klebold from his work as a 
community-development consultant at Arapahoe Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the elder Klebold is known as a liberal, in favor of gun  
control. Ms. Klebold is a sensitive listener. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I can tell, this family was utterly, utterly  
normal,'' Briand said. ``They did everything right. But somehow the 
pain and anger was too deep, and they didn't see it or couldn't 
reach it. This has got to be a pervasive thing in our society if it 
can reach this far, into families like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris moved to Littleton in 1996 from Plattsburgh, N.Y., where  
his father, Wayne Harris, was an Air Force pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, neighbors said, the family appeared quiet. The  
elder Harris, now retired, and his wife, Katherine, would wave 
across the fence while out in the yard but made little effort to 
socialize with neighbors. Their tidy, two-story home on a quiet 
cul-de-sac is assessed at $184,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Former neighbors in Plattsburgh remember a solid, middle-class  
family with a likable young son. They were shocked to learn that 
Eric Harris had shot up a school. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mouth just dropped,'' former classmate Kyle Ross said. ``He  
was a typical kid. He didn't seem anything like what is portrayed 
on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The families were avoiding reporters, but both issued statements  
expressing sympathy for the victims, and Klebold's family wondered 
what went wrong: ``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling 
to understand why this happened.''

<HEADLINE> New, Safer Diabetes Drug Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- A drug that promises to fight diabetes as  
effectively as the controversial medicine Rezulin but causes less 
risk to patients' livers may soon hit the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetics have been frightened by headlines that the popular  
drug Rezulin, the only medicine now available that can resensitize 
their bodies to insulin, also can destroy the liver. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday, advisers to the Food and Drug Administration  
recommended the sale of SmithKline Beecham's Avandia, a drug that 
promises to treat diabetes in the same manner as Rezulin but that 
in studies of more than 4,000 patients has shown no sign of liver 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the advisers stressed that there was no certainty that  
Avandia never would damage diabetics' livers. They urged Avandia 
patients to have intensive liver testing similar to the kind now 
required for Rezulin patients. 
</P>
<P>
	If liver damage is a rare side effect, as it is for Rezulin,  
then it may appear only after hundreds of thousands of diabetics 
have tried Avandia, said FDA panel chairman Dr. Henry Bone of the 
Michigan Bone and Mineral Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this drug is far safer,'' said Dr. Leonard Seef, a  
liver expert from the National Institutes of Health. But he joined 
other panelists in insisting patients get precautionary liver 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin, known chemically as troglitazone, was cheered widely  
when it hit the market in 1997 because it is the only drug sold 
that resensitizes the body to insulin, the underlying cause of Type 
2, or adult-onset, diabetes. Many doctors contend it is invaluable 
for patients who have failed other diabetes therapies. Some 750,000 
Americans now use the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Rezulin hit the market, however, it began causing  
liver failure. FDA officials list 43 Rezulin patients who suffered 
acute liver failure. Of those, 28 died and seven needed liver 
transplants to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA warned that those cases may represent only 10 percent of  
all Rezulin-related liver damage, and the agency's advisers last 
month urged new restrictions on Rezulin sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA is not bound by Thursday's recommendations on Avandia,  
but typically follows the panel's advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor is Avandia the only potentially safer Rezulin competitor;  
the agency also is considering sales of Takeda Pharmaceuticals' 
Actos. But any drug related to Rezulin must bear warnings that call 
for liver tests until doctors are sure the drugs are less risky, 
the FDA panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies, Avandia, known chemically as rosiglitazone,  
significantly lowered blood glucose, particularly when used with 
another popular diabetes drug called metformin. For some reason, it 
worked best in women. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big question was safety. In studies, no one suffered  
jaundice or liver failure -- but neither did any Rezulin patients 
when that drug first was tested. 
</P>
<P>
	To predict liver damage, doctors measure patients' liver  
enzymes. Elevations are a danger signal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rezulin's studies, 2 percent of patients showed significantly  
elevated liver enzymes. But Avandia patients had no difference in 
elevated liver enzymes compared with patients taking a placebo or 
other diabetes medicines, FDA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Why would Avandia be less risky? SmithKline said Avandia  
requires 100 times less drug per dose to treat diabetes, is 
metabolized differently and seems to accumulate far less in the 
liver. 
</P>
<P>
	But Avandia is not without risk, the FDA panel said. It can  
increase cholesterol levels, particularly the so-called bad 
cholesterol or LDL. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetics with high LDL levels probably should not be prescribed  
Avandia, and all patients need cholesterol tests, the panel said. 
Also, the drug seemed to cause weight gain of about 4 pounds to 6 
pounds, a concern because diabetics are supposed to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, animal studies suggested Avandia use in pregnancy  
can be toxic to fetuses.

<HEADLINE> Online Shopping Security Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There are gaping holes in the security webs  
of more than 100 small Internet retailers, allowing anyone with a 
little computer savvy to obtain shoppers' credit card numbers and 
other personal information, a technician warned. 
</P>
<P>
	The retail sites, and probably hundreds more, incorrectly  
installed ``shopping cart'' software that is used to take customer 
orders, leaving confidential material in files that virtually 
anyone can find with a World Wide Web search engine, said Joe 
Harris, a computer technician at Seattle-based Blarg Online 
Services, an Internet service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are inexperienced Web site developers out there who  
don't know how to set up an online store safely, but they don't 
tell their clients,'' Harris said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said he found the problem while reviewing an online store  
hosted by his service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported today that it managed to download  
more than 100 pages of credit card numbers, travel reservations, 
e-mail and other information from Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the computer programs that are vulnerable include those  
from Order Form, Seaside Enterprises, QuikStore, PDGSoft and 
Mercantec. 
</P>
<P>
	QuikStore said only two of its estimated 700 users have reported  
problems with the shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessarily their fault,'' said Dwight Vietzke, a  
spokesman for QuikStore. ``These are things that fall through the 
cracks.''

<HEADLINE> Better Barley Test May Cost Farmers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A test used to gauge the malting quality  
of barley for beer ``has substantial variability,'' and its outcome 
determines whether farmers reap the premium price or a substantial 
discount on their crops, a government report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, examined the consistency of a test kit used in 
most of North Dakota to determine vomitoxin levels in barley. 
</P>
<P>
	Vomitoxin, which can affect the taste of beer, is a byproduct of  
a crop disease known as scab. It has plagued North Dakota's wheat 
and barley crop for the past six years. North Dakota has been the 
nation's leading barley producer for the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market ... is making crucial pricing decisions at  
concentration levels where the (test) kit has substantial 
variability,'' the GAO report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing experts attribute variability to the skills of the  
technicians conducting the tests and stress the importance of 
training, the report said. Two other tests give more accurate and 
consistent results, but complexity and expense of the tests 
preclude using them at commercial testing facilities where farmers 
bring their barley, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the American Malting Barley Council said that only 9  
percent of all Midwestern malting barley had a vomitoxin level that 
fell into the premium price category of 0.5 parts per million or 
less, according to the report. The council is made up of 
Anheuser-Busch, Inc., the Miller Brewing Company, the Coors Brewing 
Company and the Stroh Brewery Company, which together constitute 
about 86 percent of the U.S. beer market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., who asked for the GAO report, said  
the brewing industry has ``exacerbated the problem'' by using its 
economic clout to impose its will on producers. He said the 
industry has ``dramatically injured farmers'' and that testing must 
be standardized. 
</P>

<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- With corn and soybean prices still lagging,  
some Ohio farmers would like to see commercial hemp production 
legalized to give them another way to make money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemp is the non-hallucinogenic cousin of marijuana and can be  
used in cosmetics, beer, plastics and paper, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone thinks you're talking wacky tobacky, and it's not the  
same thing at all,'' said Joe Hertel, a farmer in northwest Ohio's 
Van Wert County. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemp -- used for oil and protein products as well as for fiber --  
is grown in more than 20 countries for a variety of products, 
including salad dressing, face cream, rope and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana and Virginia have urged an end to a federal ban on  
industrial uses of hemp, and the Minnesota Senate last month passed 
a bill aimed at permitting experimental hemp production. The Hawaii 
House has approved a 10-acre test crop. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is little support for legalizing hemp production in  
Ohio among the state's elected leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drug Enforcement Administration and the White House Office  
of National Drug Control Policy have said that permitting hemp 
farming would send the wrong signal to young people. They also 
worry that marijuana farmers could hide their crops with industrial 
hemp plants. Police rely on pictures taken from aircraft to detect 
marijuana fields.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Suspect Ruled Incompetent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man accused of killing two police officers  
in the Capitol last summer is incompetent to stand trial, a federal 
judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the Federal  
Bureau of Prisons to place Russell Eugene Weston Jr., 42, in a 
facility that offers mental health services for a ``reasonable 
period of time, not to exceed four months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan set a conference for Sept. 9 to evaluate Weston's  
treatment and its effect on his competency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russell Eugene Weston Jr. presently suffers from a mental  
disease or defect that renders him incapable of understanding the 
nature and consequences of the proceedings against him,'' Sullivan 
said. The judge also said Weston is unable to aid in his own 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's absolutely correct,'' said Weston's attorney, A.J.  
Kramer. ``You can't have a rational conversation with him about the 
case. He's totally delusional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weston is charged with murdering Capitol Police officers John M.  
Gibson and Jacob J. Chestnut in the Capitol on July 24, 1998. He 
has not entered a plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison officials did not say where Weston would be placed.  
``It's not public information where someone is going until they 
arrive there,'' bureau spokesman Daniel Dunne said, citing security 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau operates five prisons with psychiatric facilities for  
men. Weston probably will end up at the prison in Butner, N.C., 
because that's where the psychiatrist he spoke with in October 
works, law enforcement sources said. Court documents unsealed by 
the judge Thursday showed that psychiatrist, Sally C. Johnson, 
believed Weston was a paranoid schizophrenic and not competent to 
stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He believes that he is the commander in chief of the Armed  
Forces ... in control of time and time reversal, a brilliant 
scientist, and that he had a special relationship with President 
Kennedy,'' Johnson wrote in her evaluation. But she did not rule 
out the possibility that Weston could stand trial after he receives 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had intended to challenge Johnson's competency  
evaluation but, earlier this month, dropped their challenge after 
Weston refused to meet with other doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to have his competency restored by getting him the  
proper treatment,'' said Channing Phillips, a spokesman for the 
U.S. attorney.

<HEADLINE> Israel Lifts Closing on West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel lifted a blanket closure on the West  
Bank and Gaza Strip imposed during the observance of two national 
holidays, the army said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The closure kept thousands of Palestinian laborers from their  
jobs in Israel. It lasted from Monday night, the start of Israel's 
Memorial Day, until Wednesday night, the end of Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel says such closures are security precautions necessary to  
prevent attacks by Palestinian militants. Several attacks have been 
carried out during celebrations, and blockades are now imposed 
during most Israeli holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians argue that such measures cost their fledgling  
economy millions of dollars in lost wages and trade.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Boot Team President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Somebody had to pay for the sorry state of the  
New York Knicks, and the axe fell on team president and general 
manager Ernie Grunfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	With just eight games left in the regular season, coach Jeff Van  
Gundy must now find a way to get the team into the playoffs to have 
any hope of saving his own job. 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization was not on the same page in a lot of  
categories,'' said Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts, 
who will take over the day-to-day running of the club for the rest 
of the regular season. ``I was not going to accept any more 
divisions, people on different pages, people looking like they had 
different agendas. We have one agenda -- to make the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup came on one of the most tumultuous days the  
organization has ever had, with Checketts trying to put out brush 
fires involving Latrell Sprewell, Larry Johnson and Charlie Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts fined Sprewell $25,000 for comments made by his agent,  
Robert Gist, that were highly critical of both Grunfeld and Van 
Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was questioned by Checketts about a published report  
that he exposed himself to a female public relations staffer. 
Johnson denied doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward was told that the locker room was not to be used as a  
pulpit for his beliefs. Ward recently said he is uncomfortable 
dressing in front of female reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But by far the biggest news was the reassigning of Grunfeld,  
whose new role with the team will be as a special consultant. 
Checketts is sending Grunfeld to Germany this weekend to scout the 
European Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I'm disappointed with today's news,'' Grunfeld said.  
``But in sports, as in life, things change. Today it's my turn for 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very proud of the job I've done over the last nine years  
in the Knicks' front office. Over that time we have accumulated the 
fourth-best winning percentage in the league, five straight sellout 
seasons and never once missed the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, the team's 12-year streak of making the  
postseason is in serious jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup comes with the Knicks, with an NBA-high $63 million  
payroll, on a season-high four-game losing streak. At 21-21, they 
are ninth in the Eastern Conference and in danger of missing the 
playoffs for the first time in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts acknowledged a major rift between Grunfeld and Van  
Gundy, who have disagreed over Grunfeld's turnover in player 
personnel -- especially the widely criticized deal that sent Charles 
Oakley to Toronto for Marcus Camby. 
</P>
<P>
	But Checketts also declined to bestow any kind of reassurance on  
Van Gundy, who is now in his fourth season as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization has not functioned well together,'' Checketts  
said. ``With what we've spent on salaries and what we've done as an 
organization, to be a .500 club and in ninth place is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no winners in today's announcement, there's no power  
struggle won by anybody, and no, it's not a show of confidence in 
anybody,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that all of the steps that we have taken as an  
organization were not paying off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of Grunfeld's reassignment came after the team  
held a 2 1/2-hour practice in Purchase, N.Y. Afterward, the players 
were told by Checketts of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought stuff would happen after the season, but I'm not  
necessarily shocked,'' center Chris Dudley said. ``In this 
business, you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing of it is a little ironic,'' said Sprewell, who said  
he was unaware that his agent told the New York Post that Sprewell 
would demand to be traded if the Knicks planned to use him as a 
reserve again next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Daily News reported today that Gist claimed he was  
grossly misquoted and misrepresented in the Post story. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put me on the spot like this is unfair to me and the  
organization. It's unacceptable,'' Sprewell said. ``I've accepted 
my role here and what has happened. I don't see why (Gist) should 
have a problem accepting the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there would be any changes to the starting lineup  
Friday night against Charlotte, Van Gundy said: ``I don't know. 
We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Sprewell was one of several major moves made  
by Grunfeld that have not panned out. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's GM and president since 1996 and a member of the front  
office since 1990, Grunfeld was one of the most aggressive 
executives in the league when it came to making trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The past four seasons have been marked by substantial turnover  
on the roster. Yet each year, the club has been knocked out in the 
second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has played inconsistently all season, losing to teams  
it is supposed to beat and suffering numerous breakdowns in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has been rampant about the futures of Grunfeld and  
Van Gundy, and Checketts' own job security has been brought into 
question, too. The Knicks, along with the New York Rangers of the 
NHL, are owned by Cablevision Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This move today was about allowing me to get the information I  
need to make judgments in the offseason,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	A new team president will be named in the offseason, and it  
would be surprising if former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson is 
not approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy did not comment on Grunfeld's reassignment.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. OK'd Mrs. Foley's Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Providing the U.S. ambassador to Japan stays  
away from matters involving a major Japanese bank, his wife can 
work as a researcher for a think tank affiliated with the bank, the 
State Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Foley, a controversial figure when her husband Thomas  
Foley was speaker of the House, is in compliance with ``all 
relevant State Department regulations regarding employment 
overseas,'' the department said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said it reviewed Mrs. Foley's job plans before  
she began working in October at the Japan Research Institute, an 
affiliate of the large Sumitomo Bank -- in turn part of a huge 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Foley has authorized us to say that she is happy to be  
working,'' the State Department said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensitive to even the appearance of a conflict of interest, the  
department said ambassador Foley ``should recuse himself from 
official activities involving the institute and Sumitomo Bank, 
unless properly authorized'' by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Several conditions also were established for Mrs. Foley: Her  
name cannot appear on any institute materials or reports 
distributed outside the institute; the institute should not use her 
name to publicize its work, to raise funds or to attract new 
clients; and Mrs. Foley should not use her access to the embassy or 
other State Department resources to further the interests of the 
institute, Sumitomo Bank or the bank's clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley became ambassador to Japan in October 1997 after 30 years  
in the House, where he served as speaker from 1989 until his defeat 
in the 1994 elections. During most of Foley's tenure as a Democrat 
from Washington state, Mrs. Foley was his unpaid chief of staff. 
She gained considerable influence among Democrats -- who then 
controlled the House -- when her husband became a party leader. 
</P>
<P>
	She tried to stay out of the limelight, but made headlines when  
she was forced to testify in 1992 before a federal grand jury 
investigating scandals at the House Post Office. She was neither a 
subject nor a target of that investigation, said the U.S. attorney 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Foley had much to do with hiring and firing of Democratic  
staff, and the remodeling of much of the House side of the Capitol 
-- a task that brought criticism for perceived excesses, including 
marble floors in elevators. 
</P>
<P>
	After Democrats took considerable heat when it became known that  
the old House bank was covering overdrafts for lawmakers, Mrs. 
Foley quietly gave Republican leaders a list of members who were 
overdrawing their accounts -- including Republicans -- a warning that 
both parties could be hurt by the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department official said the agency ``reviewed  
carefully'' her new job, pointing out she was a private citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a family-friendly employer, the department sympathetically  
reviews requests for employment by family members of its employees 
... in their areas of professional experience,'' the department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such reviews are normally done by the chief of mission -- the  
ambassador -- but since Mrs. Foley's husband is the ambassador, it 
was done by State officials in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Report: Trade Growth Rate Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The rate of growth in world exports slipped to 3.5  
percent last year, a third of its 1997 level, the World Trade 
Organization said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The continuing bite of the Asian crisis was the main reason for  
the slowdown, but the trend was evident in all major trading 
regions, the WTO study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports from Asia increased by 1 percent, but the region's  
imports were down 8.5 percent, with South Korea seeing a 35 percent 
fall, Indonesia 34 percent and Thailand 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest increases in exports and imports, up to 10 percent,  
were seen in Latin America and some Eastern European countries. In 
North America, exports were up 3 percent while imports rose by 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	World exports grew by 10.5 percent in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, the report predicted world trade expansion could be  
lower still, as the slowdown had not been reversed by the end of 
last year. Increases were expected in the United States, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Japan's gross domestic product continued to shrink in  
the fourth quarter of 1998 and many West European countries 
recorded a weakening in their economic performance, the U.S. 
economy accelerated,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	WTO chief economist Patrick Low said the figures for 1999 would  
be largely dependent on what happened in the United States, which 
is expected to record the highest growth rate among industrial 
countries in 1999 but also runs a high risk of suddenly slowing 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at where the sources of growth are now, they have  
been in the United States,'' said Low, adding that American 
consumers tended not to save money and their spending had boosted 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the indications are that the improved growth  
performance is going to shift towards Asia, but if we see too sharp 
a slowdown in the United States and Western Europe then this will 
definitely threaten to swamp whatever happens in Asia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steep falls in commodity prices last year, including a 30  
percent fall in the price of oil, would also take their toll in 
1999, the report added. 
</P>
<P>
	Low said 1998 was the first time since the war that commodity  
exports had represented less than 20 percent of exports, but many 
developing countries were still very reliant on exports of 
commodities, especially agricultural goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis in Russia and Brazil meant that production  
levels in Eastern Europe and Latin America would stay the same or 
even fall during 1999 year, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Mo Vaughn Homers in First At-Bat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Mo Vaughn, activated from the disabled list  
Thursday night, homered in his first at-bat for the Anaheim Angels 
as a designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Although still not 100 percent, Vaughn said he wanted to give  
the team a lift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to take some pressure off some guys,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He drilled the first pitch he saw from Toronto's Pat Hentgen 451  
feet off the SkyDome restaurant in center field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels, who have eight men on the disabled list, have lost  
four straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been playing as well as we like to, and we haven't  
been getting as much offense,'' Angels cleanup hitter Tim Salmon 
said. ``He's a dominant hitter in the lineup so he will give us a 
lift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn, who signed an $80 million, six-year contract with the  
Angels last November, sprained his left ankle in the first inning 
of his first game with the team on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Angels manager Terry Collins said he expects the 31-year-old  
first baseman would also be used only as a DH on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn has expressed concerns about his mobility.  
</P>
<P>
	``As bad as I don't like to DH, I'm not going to go out and play  
if I can't play the way I'm capable of playing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Vaughn, the Angels optioned infielder Chris  
Pritchett to Class AAA Edmonton.

<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- There have always been a lot of born-again  
Christians in the nation's prisons. Now, inmates are converting to 
more diverse faiths, including Islam, which adherents say is the 
world's fastest-growing religion. 
</P>
<P>
	So those who work with prisoners in Missouri are attending an  
Islamic Center to learn what it means to be a follower of Islam. 
The latest enrollees were 24 jail administrators, staff, guards and 
other corrections employees at prisons and jails in Moberly, 
Fulton, St. Louis and Jefferson City. 
</P>
<P>
	Islamic Center director Mohammed Eldeib told the group that the  
key to eliminating stereotypical attitudes is to understand the 
basics, the foundations and the principles of the religions. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he said it is important for those who deal with Muslim  
prisoners to know their customs so they can help them meet 
religious tenets. Muslims, for example, are required to pray five 
times a day and with a congregation on Friday, their holy day. 
</P>
<P>
	Eldeib said corrections officers who are sympathetic to converts  
will reap benefits in the inmates' behavior. They will see a 
transformation, he said, because the inmate becomes more 
open-minded, more understanding.

 *Billboard ads are 'words of God'    	
</P>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- It's not every day you see a message from  
God. Especially on a billboard. But there it is, overlooking the 
strip mall parking lots: ``Come on over, and bring the kids. -- 
God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nondenominational messages -- irreverent, funny, eye-catching --  
began appearing on billboards in the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., area 
last year, funded by an anonymous donor. 
</P>
<P>
	They now appear in 200 cities in 40 states, on more than $13  
million worth of donated ad space, said Sheila Hays, spokeswoman 
for the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, which has 
adopted the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Smith of Fort Lauderdale, whose ad agency designed the  
campaign, said the donor is a religious person who ``thought if 
people started thinking about God, maybe things would get better 
around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among billboard messages attributed to God:  
</P>
<P>
	``What part of 'Thou shalt not ...' didn't you understand?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's meet at my house Sunday before the game.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I can think of 10 things that ARE carved in stone.''

 *Catholic weekly ends `pray and publish' ads    	
</P>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Catholic Telegraph, the official newspaper  
of the Cincinnati archdiocese, has ended its long-standing practice 
of printing ``thank you'' ads to saints. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly newspaper, in its 168th year, said the ads, which  
cost $30 apiece, were dropped as of April 1 because they appear to 
make promises that cannot be guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``pray and publish'' ads typically give thanks to  
a particular saint for answering a prayer. The prayer is published 
in the ad and others are encouraged to use it. But after the prayer 
is said, the ad maintains it must be published for it to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Telegraph Editor Tricia Hempel said she decided the ads resemble  
chain letters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is to educate, to inform, to encourage dialogue  
and to evangelize,'' Ms. Hempel said. ``I looked at these ads and 
could not see that they fit in with our mission in any way, shape 
or form.''

 *A dog named Mohammed?    	
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Lebanese singer Najwa Karam returned to  
Egypt when officials lifted a ban imposed in the belief that she 
named her dog after Islam's Prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslims consider dogs unclean, and to insult Prophet Mohammed is  
blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian security officials barred Karam from entering Egypt in  
early April, saying she insulted the founder of Islam and 
criticized Egypt. The ban was canceled after she wrote to the 
information minister, asking him to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	A magazine had claimed Karam, a Christian, had named her dog  
after the founder of Islam. She denied the accusation, saying the 
``enemies of success and religion'' were behind it. Still, the 
claim prompted many radio and TV stations to ban her songs.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Decline by 5,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing applications  
for unemployment checks declined last week from a three-month high 
the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	A seasonally adjusted 314,000 unemployed people claimed  
benefits, down from a revised 319,000 the previous week, the Labor 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third consecutive week of claims higher than 300,000  
and followed a nine-week stretch of weekly numbers below that mark, 
the longest since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes  
fluctuations in the volatile data series, rose by 4,750 to an 
11-week high of 306,250. 
</P>
<P>
	But, even with the increase, economists don't foresee more than  
a modest weakening in the strong labor market, which in March 
reduced the nation's unemployment rate to a 29-year low of 4.2 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Self-Employed Get Insurance Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cheaper health care would be available to  
millions of uninsured Americans under legislation aimed at giving 
small companies the same benefits as their Fortune 500 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is designed to let the self-employed and  
small-business owners join together to form health plans, boosting 
their buying power and trimming costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see why my company should be any different from the  
federal government or Ford Motor Corp.,'' said Sallie Buben, who 
owns two Washington, D.C., restaurants and employs about 140 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a small-business owner, I can't afford to give all my  
employees insurance. I lose employees because I can't pay them 
benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of the nation's restaurants are small  
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the nation's 43 million uninsured work in  
small companies or are self-employed, Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo., said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talent, chairman of the House Small Business Committee, and Rep.  
Cal Dooley, D-Calif., the bill's sponsors, envision trade and 
professional associations such as the National Federation of 
Independent Business, American Farm Bureau Federation or the 
National Restaurant Association offering insurance to their 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, small-business owners pay $4,342 per employee for a  
family plan, the NFIB said. The bill's sponsors aim to reduce costs 
to push the figure closer to what Fortune 500 companies pay, an 
estimated $3,521. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would accelerate a law allowing small-business  
owners and the self-employed to deduct the full cost of their 
health insurance by 2003. Under the bill, the current 60 percent 
health insurance deduction would be pushed to 100 percent 
immediately, so the deduction could be claimed on 1999 tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Talent said the measure includes tough new solvency standards  
and other consumer protection provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents have argued that its provisions, which would cost the  
government an estimated $3 billion over five years, are too 
expensive and would require more regulation.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks End Day Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended higher  
today as investors bought high-tech shares following yet another 
rise in New York overnight. The dollar was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 170.86  
points, or 1.04 percent, ending the day at 16,665.88 points. On 
Wednesday, the average lost 202.09 points, or 1.21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.96 yen at late afternoon, up 0.98 yen from  
late in Tokyo on Wednesday and also above its late New York level 
of 119.73 yen overnight. It ranged from 119.63 yen to 120.40 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices advanced as investors  
bought technology stocks, including those of electronics and 
precision machinery manufacturers, following an overnight jump in 
New York stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 132.87  
points, or 1.3 percent, to a new record high of 10,581.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were selling paper and steel issues.  
</P>
<P>
	``Investors took profits on domestic demand-linked shares and  
bought high-technology stocks,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, deputy 
general manager of the equity department at Daiwa Securities SB 
Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors turned cautious ahead of a string of Japanese national  
holidays beginning next week. Japanese financial markets will be 
closed April 29 and May 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 2.68 points, or 0.20 percent, to 1,314.44. The 
TOPIX closed down 17.14 points, or 1.29 percent on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 474.02 million  
shares, down from 492.44 million shares Wednesday. Retreating 
issues outnumbered advancers 645 to 537, with 134 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar strengthened ahead of the  
meeting Monday among finance officials from the Group of Seven 
industrialized nations, traders said. Traders said Japan is 
expected to urge the group to keep the dollar above 120 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight in New York, the dollar rose sharply in reaction to  
the International Monetary Fund's report predicting that Japan's 
economy will shrink more than expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In other major currencies, the euro was traded at 127.74, up  
from 126.30 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the newly selected benchmark No. 212 10-year  
Japanese government bond slipped to 1.485 percent from 1.515 
percent Wednesday, driving its price up to 102.76 yen from 102.50 
yen.

<HEADLINE>  Track and Field Launches Pro League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In an effort to showcase its abundance of  
stars, such as Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene, track and field 
launched its first outdoor professional league Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The league, called the Track &AMP; Field Association,will debut June  
6 with the TFA ProChampionshipks at the Mitchell Athletic Complex 
in Uniondale, N.Y. -- the site of last year's Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe track and field is the sleeping giant of sports,''  
Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200-meter and 400-meter gold medalist, 
said during a press conference in conjunction with the Penn Relays, 
where he will compete Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fan base is untapped and this endeavor will tap into that  
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second attempt at a professional track and field  
league in the United States. The first, the International Track 
Association, was conducted during the mid-1970s before failing, 
even though it featured such renowned athletes as Jim Ryun, Kip 
Keino, Lee Evans, Ben Jipcho and Brian Oldfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to offer the athletes what they asked for, a  
chance to compete in the United States, an opportunity to be on 
television and a chance to make money,'' U.S. Track &AMP; Field 
executive director Craig Masback said. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 6 meet, the only one scheduled for this year, will be  
comprised of 15 events. For men, there will be the 100 meters, 200, 
mile, 3,000, 110 hurdles, high jump, pole vault and shot put. For 
women, the events will be the 100, 800, mile, 100 hurdles, high 
jump, pole vault and triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet, with a finals-only format of eight competitors in each  
event, will be televised live by ESPN, from 1-3 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to streamline track in a fan-friendly format,''  
said Brian Vandenberg, CEO of the new league. 
</P>
<P>
	He said prize money would be awarded for this year's meet, and  
the circuit would be expanded next year, running from April-June, 
prior to the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes will be mostly Americans, with some foreigners  
added. Vandenberg said the athletes have signed multiyear 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have about 100 athletes signed, with the focus on the top  
performers in the world,'' Vandenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful idea,'' said Greene, the 1997 world champion  
in the men's 100. ``We'll be able to compete more and give the fans 
more of a chance to see us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Women's sprinter Inger Miller agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to showcase our talents in the United States, an  
opportunity to run in a circuit at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league follows the introduction of USATF's Golden Spike Tour  
indoor circuit this year, consisting of four nationally televised 
meets.

Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200-meter and 400-meter gold medalist, 
said during a press conference in conjunction with the Penn Relays, 
where he will compete Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fan base is untapped and this endeavor will tap into that  
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second attempt at a professional track and field  
league in the United States. The first, the International Track 
Association, was conducted during the mid-1970s before failing, 
even though it featured such renowned athletes as Jim Ryun, Kip 
Keino, Lee Evans, Ben Jipcho and Brian Oldfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to offer the athletes what they asked for, a  
chance to compete in the United States, an opportunity to be on 
television and a chance to make money,'' U.S. Track &AMP; Field 
executive director Craig Masback said. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 6 meet, the only one scheduled for this year, will be  
comprised of 15 events. For men, there will be the 100 meters, 200, 
mile, 3,000, 110 hurdles, high jump, pole vault and shot put. For 
women, the events will be the 100, 800, mile, 100 hurdles, high 
jump, pole vault and triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet, with a finals-only format of eight competitors in each  
event, will be televised live by ESPN, from 1-3 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to streamline track in a fan-friendly format,''  
said Brian Vandenberg, CEO of the new league. 
</P>
<P>
	He said prize money would be awarded for this year's meet, and  
the circuit would be expanded next year, running from April-June, 
prior to the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes will be mostly Americans, with some foreigners  
added. Vandenberg said the athletes have signed multiyear 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have about 100 athletes signed, with the focus on the top  
performers in the world,'' Vandenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful idea,'' said Greene, the 1997 world champion  
in the men's 100. ``We'll be able to compete more and give the fans 
more of a chance to see us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Women's sprinter Inger Miller agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to showcase our talents in the United States, an  
opportunity to run in a circuit at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league follows the introduction of USATF's Golden Spike Tour  
indoor circuit this year, consisting of four nationally televised 
meets.

<HEADLINE> Dell May Build Plant in Tennessee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Mayor Phil Bredesen says Dell Computer  
Corp. is leaning toward acquiring property near Nashville 
International Airport that would allow it to build a facility 
employing thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are, as of today, in agreement on the big issues,''  
Bredesen told The Tennessean on Wednesday night. ``I feel there's 
an excellent chance we can put something together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exact terms of a contract between Nashville and Dell haven't  
been reached. But according to the proposal, Dell is seeking the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
	-- 140 acres where the old Middle Tennessee Mental Health  
Institute is located. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 490 acres of city-owned land near the airport in exchange for  
a nominal payment. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Another 100 acres through a state grant.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Demolition or removal of all buildings on the property and  
clearance for construction of new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Building permits and other necessary approvals placed on the  
fast-track. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Metro Transit Authority establish new bus routes for workers  
at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell also has requested that Nashville share local sales tax  
revenues that would be generated by the company through sales 
originating at its Davidson County operation. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials had previously said such an agreement wouldn't  
be permitted under state law, but Bredesen said he thinks there may 
be a legal way to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell officials confirmed Davidson County is a leading site for a  
major company expansion that's expected to add at least 3,000 jobs 
to the Nashville economy in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a mutual feeling this could be very good for us,''  
Dell spokesman Peter Scacco said from central Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't know how soon a final deal could be reached.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are keen to get under way with construction immediately,''  
Scacco said. ``The sooner we can get the final details worked out, 
the sooner we can start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Dell announced earlier this month that it was expanding to  
the Middle Tennessee area, it looked at Nashville, but then turned 
its attention to Williamson County and the city of Murfreesboro in 
Rutherford County, about 30 miles southeast of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Bredesen was able to persuade Dell officials to give Nashville a  
second look. He took them on a helicopter tour of the area and 
subsequently engaged in heavy negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early on, they had taken a quick pass through Davidson County,  
then moved on,'' Bredesen said. ``My feeling was Davidson had a lot 
to offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell has a separate commitment on economic incentives from the  
state, the details of which have not been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bill Baxter, commissioner of the state Department of  
Economic and Community Development, said the scope of Dell's 
package is reasonable and will be measured according to the size of 
the company's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, business tax credits will be awarded only as new  
jobs are created. Commitments for new infrastructure, such as roads 
and interstate exits, have also been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, employs 24,000 people in 33  
countries. The company designs, manufactures and customizes 
computer products, and is ranked second in the United States and 
third worldwide among personal computer manufacturers. Dell earned 
$18.2 billion in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell is ranked No. 125 on the Fortune 500 list. In its March 1  
issue, Fortune ranked Dell No. 4 on its Top 10 list of most admired 
U.S. companies.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Surge Higher; Dow Up 96.79 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surged higher Thursday as IBM's strong  
profit report lifted technology shares and sent the Dow Jones 
industrial average further into record high territory. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow was up 96.79 at 10,678.21,  
moving well past Wednesday's closing high of 10,581.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 10.41 to 1,346.53, and the Nasdaq composite 
index rose 40.46 to 2,529.54. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM led the Dow, rising 22 3/4 to 194 5/8, a gain of more than 13  
percent. After the market closed Wednesday, IBM reported 
first-quarter earnings of $1.55 a share, decisively beating 
year-ago results of $1.06 and analysts' estimates of $1.41. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's results reassured investors who have been nervously  
shuttling between technology issues and more conservative blue-chip 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Other big companies had positive earnings reports, but their  
stock prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron and McDonald's, both Dow components, met analysts  
forecasts, for their first quarter earnings. Chevron was down 1 
7/16 to 94 15/16 and McDonald's was up 1/16 to 45 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent Technologies was up 2 3/16 at 61 5/16, GTE fell 1 3/8 to 65 1/2  
and Bell Atlantic slipped 1 11/16 to 56 13/16. All either met or 
exceeded forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 427.8 million shares, 
up from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.50 at 636.21, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.03 to 752.62.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Rodriguez Hurt at Plate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Texas Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez  
sustained a concussion and a bruised left cheekbone Thursday night 
during a collision at home plate with Minnesota's Matt Lawton. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays were negative, and the Rangers said Rodriguez is day to  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to score from second base on Marty Cordova's infield hit  
in the first inning, Lawton lowered his right shoulder and plowed 
into Rodriguez. Lawton's shoulder slammed into the left side of 
Rodriguez's face, and Rodriguez hit the other side of his head on 
umpire Durwood Merrill's leg as he fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez held onto the ball, and Lawton was out to end the  
inning. Rodriguez lay virtually motionless in the dirt for several 
minutes before walking slowly to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg Zaun hit for Rodriguez in the second inning. Lawton  
returned to right field for one inning but was replaced in the 
third because of an injury to his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaining of dizziness, Rodriguez was examined at the  
Metrodome by Twins physician Dr. John Steubs. 
</P>
<P>
	An All-Star each of the last seven seasons, Rodriguez started  
137 games behind the plate in 1998, the most among AL catchers. He 
has won seven straight Gold Gloves, an AL record for catchers.

<HEADLINE> Minority Home Ownership Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's home ownership rate rose to a  
near-record during the first three months of this year and did set 
records for blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, 69.6 million American families, or 66.7 percent,  
owned the houses or apartments where they lived, the Census Bureau 
said Wednesday. That was the highest January-March rate on record 
and up from 66.4 percent in the October-December quarter. The 
highest quarterly rate on record, 66.8 percent, came last 
July-September. Five years ago, it was 64.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For non-Hispanic blacks, the January-March rate was a record  
46.9 percent, up from 46.5 percent in the fourth quarter. For 
Hispanics, it was a record 46.2 percent, up from 45.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate for non-Hispanic whites was 72.8 percent, up from 72.6  
percent in the fourth quarter but just short of the record 73.1 
percent in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation's booming economy is creating more homeowners than  
ever before, and bringing new opportunity to growing numbers of 
Americans,'' said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew 
Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising home ownership rate reflects low interest rates and  
low unemployment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, the rates in the first quarter were 71.2 percent in  
the Midwest, 69.2 percent in the South, 62.7 percent in the 
Northeast and 61 percent in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate in central cities was 50.3 percent and in suburbs, 73.5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By age, the rate was lowest for householders younger than 35 --  
39.4 percent -- and highest for householders aged 55 to 64 -- 81.1 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Albert White Goes for NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INKSTER, Mich. (AP) - Albert White, Missouri's leading scorer  
and rebounder last season, has decided to skip his senior year and 
declare himself eligible for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	White said he was confident of his choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I considered many factors such as my achievements to date, my  
abilities compared to potential players entering this year's draft, 
and my personal situation, having a young daughter to take care 
of,'' White said. ``I believe I am both physically and mentally 
prepared to play professional basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, a 6-5, 235-pound forward, averaged 16.3 points and 8.7  
rebounds per game last season. He was named second-team All-Big 12 
team and led the Tigers to their first appearance in the NCAA 
Tournament since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to leading Missouri in scoring and rebounding, White  
led the team in assists, becoming the first player in school 
history to lead in those three categories. 
</P>
<P>
	White began his college basketball career at Michigan, where he  
was part of a talented trio of freshmen that also included current 
NBA player Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock. 
</P>
<P>
	He transferred to Missouri after his freshman year with the  
Wolverines, and averaged 10.9 points and 4.9 rebounds per game as a 
sophomore at Missouri before improving on those numbers last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	White is the sixth underclassman to declare himself eligible for  
the draft this year. The others are Duke's Elton Brand and William 
Avery, Maryland's Steve Francis, St. John's Ron Artest and 
Georgia's Jumaine Jones. UNLV forward Shawn Marion is also expected 
to add himself to this list soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Underclassmen have until May 16 to declare their eligibility for  
the June 30 draft.
