<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Calls For Drug-Free World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday called for joint efforts of
states worldwide to work for a drug-free world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the Special Session of the
General Assembly on the World Drug Problem, the U.N. chief hoped
the session would be the time for the international community to
find common ground on the establishment of a drug-free world in
the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 world leaders are attending the session that
intends to reduce from 190 million the number of people using
illicit drugs worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed political declaration is the product of hard work
and effort. It is rare for consensus to be reached on substantive
as well as political issues months in advance of a Special
Session," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The groundbreaking Declaration on the Guiding Principles of
Demand Reduction creates a balanced approach which, for the first
time, addresses the responsibility of nations where consumption is
a problem as well as that of nations where production is a
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration on the guilding principles of demand reduction
is intended to help governments set up effective prevention,
treatment and rehabilitation programs.
</P>
<P>
Annan hoped, by the year 2008, that member states will have
made real progress in eliminating or reducing in significant
number the crops of opium poppies, coca and cannabis.
</P>
<P>
"The growing trend in abuse and production of psychotrophic
substance must be reversed," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. International Drug Control Program has risen to the
challenge and shaped a balanced and global strategy to implement
the decisions that will be adopted during the crucial three days,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The new version represents a quantum leap from the piecemeal
and pilot projects of the past three decades," he said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Designated Philippines' Acting President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said Monday that he will designate President-Elect and Vice
President Joseph Estrada as acting president next week for the
first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
Ramos will leave for Paris next week to receive personally the
1997 U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization peace
award.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, the main opposition candidate who won the May 11
presidential polls, will be the acting president during the
absence of Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president and vice president are elected
separately.
</P>
<P>
In the past, when Ramos left for abroad, a committee headed by
the executive secretary used to run the day-to-day operation of
the government and it reported to the president daily or hourly as
the need arose using the latest telecommunications gadgets.
</P>
<P>
Estrada will take oath as the country's 13th president on June
30 when Ramos steps down after serving out a single six-year term.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.N. Seeks Political Backing for Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (xinhua) -- The General Assembly of the
United Nations Monday opened its three-day Special Session on the
World Drugs Problem with the participation of more than 150
states, including 22 heads of state and eight heads of government.
</P>
<P>
The special session, also known as the Drug Summit, will assess
the international drug problem and develop a forward-looking
strategy for the 21st century, centered around the basic principle
of a balanced approach between supply and demand reduction.
</P>
<P>
According to Executive Director of the United Nations Office
for Drug Control and Crime Prevention Pino Arlacchi, the assembly
will focus on six crucial issues: demand reduction; elimination of
illicit crops and alternative development; amphetanime-type
stimulants (ATS); precursor chemicals; money-laundering; and
judicial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The special session will also mark the first time that demand
reduction is assigned the same level of importance as other
components of narcotic control.
</P>
<P>
The assembly is expected to adopt a political declaration by
which member states would commit themselves to significant and
measurable results in reduction of illicit supply and demand for
drugs by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
The political declaration calls for stronger domestic laws and
programs by 2003 to deal with such issues as money-laundering and
synthetic drugs, increased drug prevention among youth, and
enhanced cooperation between nations to catch and prosecute drug
traffickings.
</P>
<P>
A declaration on demand reduction is also scheduled to be
adopted at the special session. It outlines principles to aid
governments to set up new or enhanced demand-reduction programs by
2003.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also contains standards to guide governments in
setting up effective prevention, treatment and rehabilitation
programs and calls for the provision of adequate resources for
such programs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the assembly is expected to adopt a series of
measures to enhance international cooperation to counter the world
drug problem. Those include action plans to combat ATS and their
precursors and to promote international cooperation on the
eradication of illicit drug crops and on alternative development.
Other measures refer to controlling precursors,, promoting
judicial cooperation and countering money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations International Drug Control
Program, annual illicit drug consumption is likely to involve 3 to
4 percent of the world's population. Heroin and cocaine -- the
most dangerous drugs of abuse from the health perspective -- are
abused by 8 million and 13 million people, respectively, but
cannabis is the most widely abused substance with 140 million
consumers.
</P>
<P>
Because drug abuse transverses geographic and socio-economic
boundaries, demand reduction requires links between policy-makers
and population that are susceptible to drug use, as well as the
combined efforts of states, civil society organizations, health
professional and community leaders. Demand reduction must also
address new trends, such as "fashionable" drugs that form part of
a youth subculture.
</P>
<P>
Also during the special session, the assembly will review
adherence to and implementation of international drug control
treaties. Those include, in addition to the 1988 Convention, the
1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs as amended by the 1972
Protocol, and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substance.
</P>
<P>
A number of side events are scheduled to be held in conjunction
with the special session, including symposiums on such topics as:
attacking the profits of crime on money-laundering; children,
youth and drug abuse, drugs and productivity; drug abuse and
HIV/AIDS; and drugs and development.

<HEADLINE> 118 Filipino Fishermen Arrested in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian authorities have seized
12 Philippine-registered boats and arrested some 118 fishermen
caught illegally fishing within Indonesian waters, the Philippine
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reynaldo Martinez, officer in charge of the Department of
Foreign Affairs in the southern Philippines, was quoted as saying
he was informed by the Philippine Consulate in Manado, Indonesia,
of the incident.
</P>
<P>
According to the consulate, the 118 fishermen from General
Santos City in the southern Philippines were apprehended by
Indonesian naval authorities based in the southern Indonesian city
of Bitung.
</P>
<P>
But Martinez did not mention when the arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Filipino fishermen were often apprehended
by the Indonesian authorities for illegal entry or illegal
fishing.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, a group of six Filipino fishermen from
General Santos City were repatriated as part of a move to bring
back some 100 fishermen still languishing in Indonesian jails.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Arrives in Bonn for First Russian-German Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
arrived in Bonn Monday afternoon to attend the first high-level
government consultations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Government ministers including foreign, finance and defense
ministers from both sides will also attend the two-day talks which
are conducted along the lines of regular high-level consultations
Germany holds with some other European countries including France,
Britain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
German officials have said that the consultations, which will
be held once a year in the future, represent a "new quality" of
the German-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said last week that the upcoming talks would focus
on sketching bilateral relations with Germany until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Economic issues, such as the recent financial turmoil in
Russia, are expected to be the main topics to be discussed. News
reports said that Yeltsin may use the visit to appeal to Bonn to
back efforts to secure new Western credits to Russia.
</P>
<P>
German government spokesman Otto Hauser, however, dismissed
speculations that bilateral negotiations would be held on new
German financial aid to Russia. Referring to the ongoing
negotiations between Russia and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), Hauser stressed that Germany would act through multilateral
channels to help Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides would also seek coordination on international
issues, especially the Kosovo conflict, officials said. Germany
has stressed that in case of a Western intervention in the Kosovo
conflict, Russia must also be involved.

NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Five people including two

<HEADLINE> Cohen Orders Inquiry into U.S. Nerve Gas Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen Monday ordered an inquiry into allegations that special U.S.
forces used nerve gas to target American military defectors during
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that would, of course, have violated our
own policy at the time," Cohen said in an interview with CNN,
which with the Time magazine issued the report on the use of nerve
gas.
</P>
<P>
"President Nixon had declared an end to use of any kind of
biological weapons," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon was not aware of any information that could back
up those charges, Cohen said. But, he added that he was asking the
military services, including the Air Force and Army, to search
records for any information that might substantiate the
allegations and "to examine it with the kind of seriousness it
warrants."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that although he was not aware of the matter, "it
doesn't mean that it doesn't exist." He said, "We'll go back and
try to find out as much information as we can."
</P>
<P>
The CNN-Time magazine report said the so-called Operation
Tailwind was approved by the Nixon White House as well as the CIA.
The main source was retired Adm. Thomas Moorer, then chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
The CNN conductor and Time correspondent reported the case
after eight months of investigations.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, former U.S. military officials who
participated in the operation in September 1970 said their job was
to kill defectors from the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The reported use of nerve gas came after Nixon pledged a "no
first use" policy on nerve gas. The U.S. already had signed a
treaty restricting chemical weapons but the Senate had not
ratified it.
</P>
<P>
Melvin Laird, secretary of defense at the time of Operation
Tailwind, told Time that he had no specific recollection of nerve
gas being used but "I do not dispute what Admiral Moorer has to
say on this matter."
</P>
<P>
Moorer is quoted in the magazine as saying the gas was "by and
large available" for high-risk search-and-rescue missions and that
"this is a much bigger operation than you realize."

MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 policemen will be
deployed in some Philippine cities to ensure security during the
celebration of the country's independence from Spain 100 years
ago, a senior police officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General Santiago Alino, chief of the Philippine
National Police (PNP), said these policemen will be dispatched to
main celebration sites across the country on June 12, the

Alino added that security will be strengthened in Manila,

<P>
Alino said the police authorities have so far received no
report on threats to create trouble during the celebrations. But
he said a blue alert will be declared to keep all Metro Manila
policemen on their toes.
</P>
<P>
Alino said the Presidential Security Group, under Brigade
General Jose Calimlim, would protect the heads of state, very
important personalities and guests attending the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
On reports that militant groups may hold separate rallies on
June 12, Alino said: "We are in a democratic country and rallies
are allowed."

Aside from the PNP, the military will also send units to help
maintain peace and order during the centennial affair, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kim Dae-jung Brings New Approach to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung will urge U.S. President Bill Clinton to ease sanctions
against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in their
upcoming talks, expected on Tuesday, as a new approach for
security and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who took office as president on February when his country
was stricken by a financial crisis, will also seek new American
investment for the troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
Kim started his nine-day state visit to the United States last
Saturday. It is his first visit to Washington since his
inauguration, and also the first to meet with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to tell Clinton that it is time to loosen
sanctions, which have hampered Western trade with the DPRK, and
take a fresh approach to reduce tension on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"It would be desirable for the United States to ease its
economic sanctions on North Korea," Kim said in an interview with
the New York Times last week in Seoul. "I think this would be more
effective in effort to get North Korea to open up and liberalize."
</P>
<P>
Kim himself has made conciliatory statements for the relations
between the two Koreans since taking office, which included
suggestions for economic contacts and proposals for an
inter-Korean summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say they are open to the idea, which was brought
up by a South Korean president for the first time.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry has ventured that Clinton
would look forward to Tuesday's meeting with Kim to consult and
exchange views on promoting peace for the peninsula, where 37,000
U.S. troops are stationed.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said that the United States "in
general supports President Kim's policy of encouraging improvement
in North-South dialogue and relations between the DPRK and other
nations, including the United States."
</P>
<P>
Kim said, "I think it is good for the U.S. to ease economic
sanction against North Korea in order to promote U.S.-North Korean
relations step by step."
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. think tanks share Kim's view. The Council on Foreign
Relations, where Kim is to speak Monday, said recently that the
U.S. government needs to move more quickly to expand contacts with
the North.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for a bolder approach," the council said in a
report, compiled by a task force of foreign policy experts who met
with Kim and senior aides in April.
</P>
<P>
President Kim will also deal with economic issues during his
stay in the United States as he sees his visit as a crucial
business trip to boost his country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"I will request U.S. assistance for the revival of the Korean
economy, which is facing a crisis," Kim said before his departure
for the United States. "I will ask American investors and
international financial organizations for maximum assistance."
</P>
<P>
The South Korean economy is in desperate shape, held together
largely by an emergency 57 million dollar bailout from the
International Monetary Fund. Kim has said foreign investment,
especially by U.S. companies, is the key to recovery.
</P>
<P>
"He wants to come back with at least something for the South
Korean people," said You Jong-keun, one of Kim's top advisers.
"Whether it's some concrete investment or some kind of moral
support -- whether it is, he wants to bring something back with
him."
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Kim's visit to the United States is not expected
to result in landmark new agreements, but rather to affirm a
strong relationship and to give Kim a chance to try to rebuild
international confidence in the tattered South Korean economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges to Cut Drug Use by Half in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States aims to
cut American drug use and access by half over the next 10 years,
U.S. President William Clinton said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the anti-drug special session of the United Nations
here Monday morning, the president said that the United States is
committed to defeating drugs and will do its part to make the
anti-drug goal of the world a reality. Year-in and year-out, he
said, the U.S. has provided the largest anti-drug budgets ever in
the country's history.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has long been the largest drug consuming country in
the world.
</P>
<P>
"Americans are spending 37 percent less on drugs today than a
decade ago -- which means 34.1 billion U.S. dollars reinvested in
our society instead of squandered on drugs," he said.
</P>
<P>
America will commit to a five-year, 2 billion U.S. dollar
public-private partnership to teach kids to keep off drugs, he
said. That includes publicity campaigns in forms such as the
exchange of information over the Internet, on the television and
radio and various kinds of researches.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, drug use has dropped 49 percent since
1979. Recent studies show that drug use by American young people
is stabilizing, and in some categories even declining. Over all
cocaine use has dropped 70 percent since 1985. Last year, he
said the U.S. Coast Guard seized more than 100,000 pounds of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president also listed efforts and achievements made by
other nations.
</P>
<P>
"Drugs are every nation's problem," Clinton said. Every nation
must act to fight them. "We must wage this fight around the world

<HEADLINE> Thai Bourse Index Touches 11-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index plunged to an 11-year low of 311.7 points at midday
Monday before recovering 0.67 points to close at 312.37, a
5.79-point drop from last trading day.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the index had not been so low since 1987 and they
blamed the drop on the regional currency woes and the
deterioration of Japanese and Hong Kong economies.
</P>
<P>
Since June, the Japanese yen has kept falling against the U.S.
dollar and fell through 140 against the greenback on Monday,
showing international investors' lack of confidence in the
country's massive economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the yen fluctuation, the Thai baht was trading
at a 13-week low of 43.8 against the dollar on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil in the currency market forced the interest rates to
go up, adding fuel to the fall of the stock prices.
</P>
<P>
Bad news was heard all over the Asian region, as Hong Kong and
Malaysia announced contraction of their economic growth in the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Bangkok, weekend reports about leading finance
company Phatra Thanakit selling 51 percent of its stake to U.S.
investment bank Merrill Lynch triggered a storm of dumping of
finance companies' stocks.
</P>
<P>
Two large commercial banks, Siam Commercial Bank and Krung Thai
Bank, are likely to increase their capital to 30 billion baht (714
million dollars) and 70 billion baht (1.67 billion dollars)
respectively, inflicting another blow to the already poorly
performing stocks of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Investors doubted whether the banks have such a strong money
basis.
</P>
<P>
Fears are rising here that the second wave of the Asian
economic crisis could come even more devastatingly.

<HEADLINE> UK to Strip Hereditary Peers of Voting Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's leader of upper house Lord
Ivor Richard said Monday the right of hereditary peers to vote in
the House of Lords would end soon.
</P>
<P>
Lord Richard told the members of the House of Lords that the
government planned to strip the peers of their rights to sit and
vote as part of its wider reform of the upper house.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of hereditary membership of the second
chamber is not for negotiation," he said in an uncompromising
speech that signaled the end of backstage attempts to negotiate a
compromise with the opposition Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Richard did not give a timetable but the measure is widely
expected to be announced in October at the start of the next
session of parliament.
</P>
<P>
"In a modern Parliament, there really should be no reserved
seats booked generations ago for a privileged few," he added.
</P>
<P>
Richard said the Lords should remain a revising chamber and
keep its present limited powers, but be composed entirely of
appointed life peers. Unlike their hereditary counterparts, life
peers cannot pass on their titles to their children.
</P>
<P>
Taking away the voting rights of some 750 hereditary peers
would be the biggest change in the role of the second chamber
since 1958, when a Conservative government invented life peers.

<HEADLINE> Regional Sanitation Disaster Response Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent societies held its first regional training
exercise on water and sanitation disaster response here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 14-day training exercise has been prompted by problems of
mass population movements and the Red Cross' regional capacity to
act quickly and effectively to avert national disasters, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross Regional Water and Sanitation spokesman Robert
Fraser said that the training exercise is necessary because a lot
of people are being forced into urban settlements where their
health has been affected by poor water and sanitation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Fraser said the strategy of the Red Cross is to encourage the
use of regional human resources. The training exercise is also to
strengthen existing and potential human resources in the southern
African region, he added.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for us to strengthen the Red Cross societies'
capacity to respond to emergencies and provide curative
assistance of safe water and adequate sanitation in the region,"
said Fraser.
</P>
<P>
Water and sanitation interventions have been carried out to
reduce incidences of diseases, improve the quality of life and
reduce the effect to recurrent disasters.
</P>
<P>
The exercise is attended by 25 participants from Angola,
Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, Zambia, Swaziland,
Lesotho and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Funded by Red Cross societies from Britain, Finland, Germany
and Sweden, the exercise will provide a forum for the exchange of
views and experiences and increase national societies' capacity
to identify disaster response teams.
</P>
<P>
A practical exercise on disaster preparedness and responses
will also be part of the whole exercise.

<HEADLINE> Greece Supports Turkey's EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said here Monday that Greece has no intention of
preventing Turkey from being admitted into the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the Balkan Foreign Ministerial Meeting
opening Monday morning in Turkey's largest city of Istanbul,
Pangalos said that Turkey is an European nation and its efforts
for full EU membership should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
"Greece has always supported the European orientation of
Turkey. Greece is opposed to the view that the European Union is
limited by historic or religious traditions," Panglos said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "Today's reality is different. Participation of
Turkey in the European Conference can be a successful first
step."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of undermining Turkey's
efforts for EU membership, but the charge is rejected by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Ankara halted its political dialog with the EU last December
when the EU Luxembourg summit excluded Turkey from the ranks of
candidates for its enlargement process, saying that the European
body made this decision on the basis of "a discriminative
attitude " toward the Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have long been at odds over the Aegean Sea
and the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Regional security, such as the Kosovo issue, and economic
cooperation will be taken up at the two-day foreign ministerial
meeting of the Balkan countries.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Orders Pilots to Return to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government ordered
Monday all the striking pilots of Philippine Airlines (PAL) to end
their three-day-old crippling strike and return to work as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano was quoted by the
Philippine Television as calling on the 620 striking pilots to
report back for work and asking the PAL management to accept these
pilots.
</P>
<P>
But Manolo Aquino, PAL executive vice president, said the PAL
management decided to accept all the striking members of the
Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines (ALPAP) except its
29 leaders.
</P>
<P>
PAL dismissed all the 29 officers of the ALPAP and the other
hundreds of striking union members who refused to abide by a
return-to-work order of PAL Sunday.
</P>
<P>
ALPAP President Sotico Lloren said he has not yet received a
return-to-work order from the labor authorities.
</P>
<P>
Lloren said he will consult his legal counsel about the next
steps the union will take.
</P>
<P>
According to the PAL management, the airline is losing some 150
million pesos (3.8 million U.S. dollars) a day as a result of the
work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
The pilots have been staging the strike in protest of a new
policy by the PAL management to retire pilots who have logged
20,000 flying hours. The pilots condemned the action as unfair and
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
But the PAL management said the policy was already contained in
a collective bargaining agreement signed by the union and the PAL
earlier.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Astronomers Discover New Star Cluster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. astronomers said Monday in
Los Angeles that they have discovered a mysterious cluster of
newly-formed stars.
</P>
<P>
The cluster of stars, far closer to Earth than expected and
accompanied by a giant "brown dwarf" planet, was discovered by
astronomers from the University of California in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The astronomers said they were trying to understand how the
cluster was formed and why it had not been discovered sooner.
</P>
<P>
The stars, only 150 light years away from Earth and called "T
Tauri," are normally formed from a huge cloud of molecular gas,
said Benjamin Zuckerman, a professor of physics and astronomy.
</P>
<P>
"Because the newly discovered stars are in our own backyard, a
giant cloud should easily be seen, but there is no sign of it," he
said. "Stars this young shouldn't have traveled far from their
mother cloud. How it could dissipate so quickly is a really
mystery."
</P>
<P>
U.S. scientists said the cluster of stars was about three times
closer to Earth than the newly formed stars normally studied by
astronomers.

<HEADLINE> 34th OAU Summit Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- African leaders started a
three-day summit meeting Monday morning in an effort to plan
future activities for the promotion of peace and economic
integration in the world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the 34th assembly of heads of state
and government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso expressed deep concern
over the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Calling for the two countries to settle the crisis through
dialogue and all OAU member states to work for peace in Africa,
the Burkinabe President also stressed the need to boost African
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Conflict prevention, management and resolution was also the
key point of the address made by OAU Secretary-General Salim
Ahmed Salim at the opening session of the summit, which attracted
more than 30 heads of state and government across Africa.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim said that there could be no chance for
further economic growth unless African countries united to create
a peaceful and stable situation.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela expressed similar views
in a speech to the session.
</P>
<P>
As at previous OAU summits, President of Palestine, Yasser
Arafat was also invited to the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the stubbon stand of the Isareali government that has
led to a step backward in the peace process, Arafat called for
strong support and assistance from Africa to the just cause and
struggle of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Other key speakers at the opening session include Louise
Frechette, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations
orepresenting his chief Kofi Annan, and Robert Mugabe, President
of Zimbabwe and out-going OAU executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
The meeting then elected a 15-member bureau led by Compaore,
the in-coming chairman of the all-Africa organization.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the session, the African leaders left for the
Ouagadougou International Arts Exhibition Center to inaugurate a
week-long exhibition on new information and communication
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The show, jointly organized by OAU and the African Economic
Community, is said to be the first of its kind in Africa aiming
at publicizing the new technologies to the African people.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Calls for Global Strategy for Fighting Illicit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The international community
must undertake an unprecedented cooperation effort, based on a new
strategy that is global, comprehensive and balanced, Mexican
President Emesto Zedillo stressed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Special Session of the General Assembly of the
United Nations on the World Drug Problem held from June 8 to 9 at
the headquarters of the United Nations, president Zedillo said
drug has become a global problem which demands a global response,
a response assumed by all and shared by all.
</P>
<P>
The president said a global strategy should involve all
countries without exception but also without recrimination, and a
comprehensive one can address all phases of the drug cycle, from
production, sale and trafficking to consumption and its related
crimes.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, efforts to reduce demand must be
significantly strengthened. Demand reduction should be seen as a
public health issue as well as a problem of social behavior and
values, which must be faced with medical, educational, training
and cultural programs," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said there also should be a balanced strategy in
fighting illicit drugs worldwide with the same rights and
obligations, and with respect for the sovereignty of each nation
so that no one can become the judge of others, and no one feels
entitled to violate other countries' laws for the sake of
enforcing its own.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said to this end, the United Nations should facilitate
that each country elaborate a plan of action with concrete and
verifiable targets; that each country adhere to the commitments
agreed upon in this meeting; that each country have adequate
legislation against money laundering and the drug related crimes;
and that the United Nations periodically assesses progress in each
country.

<HEADLINE> China's Efforts in Drug Control Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great
importance to and is very much concerned about the comeback of
drugs in the country and has taken a series of firm
counter-measures.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by Luo Gan, China's state councilor and
chairman of the Chinese delegation to the 20th Special Session of
the U.N. General Assembly, which opened here Monday to discuss the
worldwide drug control strategy.
</P>
<P>
As a country which suffered greatly from the evil of drugs in
history, Luo said, the Chinese government will, as always, pay
attention to and strengthen the drug enforcement, and take a
multi-pronged approach to address the drug issue by legal,
political, administrative, economic, cultural, educational, and
other means.
</P>
<P>
China's National People's Congress has enacted anti-drug laws.
Its government has established a national-level drug control
coordinating agency, he said.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1997, Chinese law enforcement organizations seized
a total of 26 tons of heroin smuggled in from the "Golden
Triangle" area, he said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the first countries in the world to exercise
control over precursor chemicals, China has been implementing
the export license system covering the 22 U.N.-listed controlled
chemicals since 1993 and the import license system since 1996.
From 1991 to 1997, Chinese law enforcement organs seized a total
of 923 tons of precursor chemicals bound for the "Triangle" area
through smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that the Chinese government has always attached
importance to international drug control cooperation, stood for a
joint effort by all countries, and supported and taken active part
in the international fight against drugs. He cited a number of
U.S. activities against drugs China has participated in for the
past years.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, despite world's efforts in drug control, drug
production and trafficking will remain a worldwide problem for a
long time to come. It cannot be fundamentally resolved unless
all nations make concerted efforts and consolidate and develop
international drug control cooperation continuously.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to share responsibilities
and deal with the drug problem in an all-round manner. He also
assured the international organization China's cooperation and
continued contributions to eradicating illegal drugs.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Cut Foreign Missions for Lack of Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has decided
to cut three of its embassies abroad due to lack of fund, but details
have not been revealed.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of its foreign missions will be restructured by
downgrading or reducing size, sources in the Foreign Ministry
were quoted by Monday's East African weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said the measures are aimed at correcting Uganda's
image abroad.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up comes following a financial report which said
Uganda's foreign missions had incurred debts amounting to 4.3
million U.S. Dollars mainly on utilities by June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some embassy buildings are reported to be in a serious state
of disrepair with leaking roofs, sewage blockage and run-down
furniture and upholstery.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of its 26 foreign missions wrote to parliament in 1997,
complaining about their acute shortage of fund which hampered the
daily operations of the agencies.
</P>
<P>
In a faxed message to parliament, Ugandan Ambassador to
France David Kazungu said, "I have made several appeals to Kampala
but have received no reply. Staff are getting demoralized by the
day as they face eviction."
</P>
<P>
To save the country's face and improve efficiency of foreign
missions, a cabinet meeting decided to close three embassies,
downgrade representative offices to some international
organizations and reduce the diplomatic staff.
</P>
<P>
To help the foreign missions through the hard times, a total
amount of 2.5 million Dollars will be provided to them.

CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian and Israeli peace advocates

Peace Movement and Israel's Peace Now movement in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The two movements stressed that Mideast peace should be based
on relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions along with the
land-for-peace formula and the maximum of security for all parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The declaration highlighted the need to launch concerted
efforts in the Middle East to rebuild the region and free it from
threats of war, armament race, tension and poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Comprehensive peace should be aimed at rebuilding a region
free from weapons of mass destruction in order to ensure the
mobilization of economic potentials for the prosperity of its
peoples," said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The two movements addressed an appeal to the peace-loving
forces in Israel, the Arab region and the whole world to support
these principles and pile pressures on the governments concerned
in order to reach peace.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Peace Movement is a group that features a number
of prominent writers and intellectuals. A delegation of Peace Now,
Israel's largest peace group with thousand of members, arrived
here on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The declaration provides a further step towards cooperation
among world peace activists, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
quoted Egyptian peace activist Lotfi el Khouli as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time intellectuals and popular forces
contribute in a public and organized manner to abort the policies
of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and the radical
forces and open the door to a just, balanced and overall peace,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of this unparalleled document is to "guide
peace on the popular, intellectual and cultural levels to override
the stalemate," he said, adding that "our main affliction is to
change the (Israeli) policies and not the government."
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has been gradually grounded to a
standstill since the Likud government taking power two years
ago. International mediation has so far failed to change the
Israeli hard-line policy.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for Peace, Development in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela Monday called on African countries to redouble their
efforts to promote peace and economic development for their
common destiny.
</P>
<P>
As African countries and peoples are bound together with the
common destiny, "none can succeed without the success of the
other," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
The South African President made the remarks at a summit
meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which opened
Monday morning in the capital of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Mandela called for a frank assessment
of the Central Organ for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution Mechanisms set up by OAU.
</P>
<P>
It was particularly so when the "current and most unfortunate
conflict" between Ethiopia and Eritrea has posed a threat to
peace and stability in Africa, he noted.
</P>
<P>
If the central organ is successful, said Mandela, "then we
must seriously address the question of what we need to do to
ensure that the continent truly and collectively takes charge of
its security and stability."
</P>
<P>
In the economic field, Mandela stressed the need to respond
"in practical ways" to the challenge of enhancing cooperation
among African countries.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called for efforts to enhance the effectiveness
of the African Economic Community (AEC) and other sub-regional
economic communities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Africa must, as a matter of emergency, seek closer
relations with important institutions such as the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Such relations will help African countries to settle the
issues of debts, infrastructural development, capacity building
and greater African participation in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the renegotiation of the Lome Convention with
the European Union (EU) is another issue which Africa must handle
"both seriously and with the necessary sense of urgency", Mandela
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Rejects No-Confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Monday rejected a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu over the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The motion, which was presented by the opposition Labor Party,
was defeated by a vote of 38-10 with 1 abstention.
</P>
<P>
Most members of the ruling coalition parties did not take part
in the vote. They complained that the opposition parties have
submitted too many no-confidence motions recently, describing this
as a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, three no-confidence motions against the
government were defeated in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are currently stalemated over
the scope of the further redeployment of Israeli troops in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Labor Knesset whip Elie Goldschmidt noted that Netanyahu
prefers coalition interests to the redeployment, saying Netanyahu
"is making a lot of noise but is not bringing about a redeployment
because he fears for his seat."
</P>
<P>
The right-wing in the ruling Likud coalition has threatened to
topple Netanyahu's government if he hands over more than 9 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, at least 61 members of the 120-seat Knesset
must vote in favor of a no-confidence motion for the prime
minister to step down. The coalition parties occupy 61 seats in
the Knesset.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Improve Reproductive Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A five-day regional conference on
improving the quality of reproductive health started Monday here
with emphasis on guidelines and standards for reproductive
health care.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Kenya,
South Africa, Tanzania, Ghana, Uganda among other countries are
attending the meeting to map out strategies on the issue that is now
acknowledged as critical to the existence of the human species,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The conference was officially opened by Zimbabwean Deputy
Minister of Health and Child Welfare David Parirenyatwa with a
call to focus on improving the quality of health care in a region
with the highest mortality in the world.
</P>
<P>
"To partly resolve the problem there has been a shift in
health programs in the region from family planning programs which
focus on providing contraception to reproductive health programs
that address the multiple reproductive health development needs,"
said Parirenyatwa.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Mhlanga from the department of health in South Africa
said that it is important to have a correct understanding of
reproductive health which lies at the foundation of human
existence.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for qualitative research if high quality care
is to be addressed," said Mhlanga.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls for International Solidarity in Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac Monday called on the international community to take common
responsibility and show solidarity in its fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come, in the face of this world-girdling menace,
to demonstrate our countries' determination," Chirac said at the
20th Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The three-day session opened at U.N. headquarters in New York
early in the day with high-level delegations from some 150
countries being present.
</P>
<P>
"In every corner of the globe, its must be realized that the
United Nations is battle-ready for the fight against drugs," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The French president stressed that the international community
should "counter-attack on every front" of the drug problems,
including the production of illicit substances, the drug trade and
drug profits.
</P>
<P>
He proposed some principles for international anti-drug policy:
</P>
<P>
-- Co-responsibility. Drug elimination cannot be left to a
single category of country, whether it be producer or consumer.
Supply and demand must be reduced simultaneously;
</P>
<P>
-- Solidality. Bilateral and multilateral funding must be
mobilized to help producing countries follow the path of truly
alternative development;
</P>
<P>
-- Firmness. Firmness at home and abroad in the action of the
judiciary, the police and the customs services, while respecting
individual rights. There must be no safe oasis for the syndicates
of crime.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that he expected the U.N. Special Session to give
fresh worldwide impetus to the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The spread of this scourge is alarming. An awakening to this
fact is vital. An all-out offensive must be waged," he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Renews Demand for Marbles's Return From London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday expressed its
dissatisfaction with the damage made to the Parthenon marbles and
once again urged London to return it to Athens.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here Monday, Greek Culture Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said that the reports demolished once and for
all the "baseless and provocative" British argument that the
Pathenon marbles were protected and displayed better in London
than in Athens.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the reports in a Sunday British newspaper
that the Parthenon marbles suffered significant and irrevocable
damage about 69 years ago when British Museum staff tried to
restore the marbles to what was mistakenly thought to be their
original color.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the importance of efforts being made by
the British Committee for the Return of the Friezes, saying that
this reduced even further the number of those who had the temerity
to argue against the return of the Parthenon marbles.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Political Spring party leader Antonis Samaras also
criticized the British government for the damage and called for
the immediate return of the marbles to Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Parthenon marbles, also named Elgin marbles, were removed
from the Parthenon temple in Athens and transported to London in
1803 by British diplomat Lord Elgin.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes Belarus Eviction of Foreign Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. ambassador to Belarus on
Monday criticized Minsk for its decision to evict diplomatic
missions from the Drozdy governmental compound, saying the move
could undermine its international image.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Daniel Speckhard told a press conference in Minsk
that the eviction of diplomatic missions from their premises
against their will constitutes a violation of the Vienna
Convention, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
About 20 diplomatic missions were housed in the Drozdy
compound. The Belarus authorities notified the missions in early
May that work would soon be started to overhaul the compound's
water and sewage systems, which were last repaired about 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The missions were advised to vacate their premises by next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speckhard warned that the Belarussian decision might affect
bilateral economic cooperation, saying Minsk could do the repair
work without evicting the diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Washington would not take retaliatory actions
against the Belarus mission in Washington, although the Vienna
Convention provides such a possibility.
</P>
<P>
Speckhard said the U.S. diplomatic staff are concerned not just
about moving but about the absence of any guarantees that they
will be able to return to their premises after the repairs.
</P>
<P>
The Belarus Foreign Ministry said it proposed that employees of
the diplomatic missions either move to new buildings in central
Minsk and the Krylovo governmental compound, or begin construction
of their own buildings near Minsk.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Reading News on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The percentage of Americans
getting news from the Internet at least once a week more than
tripled in the past two years -- going from 11 million to 36
million news users.
</P>
<P>
Most people use the Internet to supplement, not replace, their
traditional sources of news, according to a new study by Pew
Research Center, an independent opinion research group that
studies attitudes toward press, politics and public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
For those who go online, science, health, finance and
technology are big news draws, said the survey of 3,002 adults.
</P>
<P>
Despite dramatic growth in online news consumption, cable
television's impact remains far greater. Fully 40 percent of
Americans now regularly watch one of the cable news networks,
whose advantage lies in its immediacy. Americans say that they
would turn to cable channels first in the event of a big news
story, whether it concerned politics, health or sports.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 46 percent of Americans only follow
national news when something major is happening, and 63 percent of
the people react the same to international news. Only local news
attracts a large regular audience that is not event driven -- 61
percent of Americans follow it most of the time.
</P>
<P>
While accuracy and timeliness are the news values most
important to consumers, the study found that a large segment of
the news audience wants entertaining and enjoyable news presented
by personalities who deliver it in a caring way.
</P>
<P>
Illustrating how differently the generations are responding to
the information explosion, the polling found that only 33 percent
of Americans ages 18-29 keep up with the news a lot, but 77
percent like having so many information sources. In contrast, 68
percent of seniors like following in the news, but only 52 percent
like all the television news shows, magazines and computer
information services at their disposal today.

<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Abu Dhabi National Co. for Oil declared
Sunday the creation of the first petrochemical firm which is
wholly owned by itself without any foreign participation.
</P>
<P>
The company also said it signed a contract with the joint
venture of "Taknib Pactel" on the implementation of the
engineering works of the second phase of the project for on-shore
gas development.
</P>
<P>
The production capacity of the project will be 280 million
cubic meters of ready-to-use gas per day.
</P>
<P>
The capital of the petrochemical firm and the gas project
exceeds 2 billion U.S. dollars. They are part of the plan being
carried out by the United Arab Emirates for developing the
petrochemical and gas industries with the participation of foreign
firms and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syrian Oil Minister Maher Hosni Jamal said
at the inauguration ceremony of the first international oil and
gas fair on Sunday that Syria had recently signed four contracts
with foreign firms on oil prospection.
</P>
<P>
Syria is still holding negotiations with two Canadian and Dutch
firms on oil prospection deals, the Syrian minister added.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria has signed with Erixon, of Sweden, a contract
on investing 118 million U.S. dollars in installing 1 million new
telephone lines, the Arabic El-Hayat daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is part of the project for installing 1.65
million lines in Syria, will feed the increasing demand for
communication services in urban and rural areas alike. The number
of telephone lines in Syria will be increased from 6.5 to 14 lines
per hundred persons.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, 1.65 million lines as well as three digital
networks for connecting the cities around the country and
expanding the existing international network would be installed.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's Minister of Agriculture Mijhim Kreishah is
expected to pay a visit to Israel soon to remove obstacles placed
by Israel on exporting Jordanian commodities to the
Palestinian-controlled areas, Jordan's official news agency Petra
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khreisha's mission is in line with the agreement which Jordan
and Israel reached last March when Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan paid an official visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been trying to maintain its monopoly over the
Palestinian markets, which absorb 2.7 billion to 4 billion
U.S. dollars worth of Israeli-made products per year, or 95
percent of the annual Palestinian imports. Due to Israel's tight
control, Jordan faces difficulties in exporting its products to
the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Mukhtar Khattab, advisor to Egyptian Public Enterprise
Sector Minister Ateb Mohamed Ebeid, said Sunday that 105 of 314
state-owned companies had been sold under Egypt's privatization
program.
</P>
<P>
According to Khattab, these companies were sold at 8.4 billion
Egyptian pounds (2.48 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
One third of the income was allocated for the implementation
of the early retirement program at these companies as well as
reimbursement of debts due to banks. The other two thirds were
allocated for repaying national debt, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the privatization program includes selling 10
companies every three months.

<HEADLINE> Pursuit for Peace Remains Major Task of Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Monday called on
the African countries and peoples to keep their common and strong
determination to promote understanding and peace.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict which escalated over
the past few days, the secretary-general said that the African
peoples have been daily paying the heavy price of peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 34th OAU Summit which opened here Monday,
Salim said that experiences show that peace is fragile and needs
to be constantly nurtured.
</P>
<P>
"The most recent and poignant case in point is the unfortunate
dispute which erupted between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which besides
being a shocking development, constitutes a major setback," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general, nevertheless, expressed his belief that
the summit will in the end find the most appropriate way of
contributing to easing the tension and promoting a peaceful
solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the African people need and deserve peace
more than anything else, and this quest for peace must be the
commitment of every African.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general attributed the causes of conflicts in
Africa to ethnic divisions and polarization, non-respect for
human rights and the unequitable distribution of resources.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve these conflicts, it is imperative to make
use of the conflict prevention, management and resolution
mechanisms and strengthen them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim expressed the hope that the current summit will mark the
formal adoption and signature of the protocol on the
establishment of an African court on human and peoples' rights
which had been recommended by the just-ended OAU Council of
Ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the on-going global adjustments and the fast
development of new technologies, Salim warned that Africa could
find itself out of the new international environment, if it
failed to adjust to the new realities.
</P>
<P>
He called on African countries to work together within the
framework of the African Economic Community (AEC) which African
leaders have decided to establish to promote the socio-economic
recovery and development of the continent.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Asks for Better Oversight in Human Medical Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Government is asking
for better oversight of human medical tests, finding inadequate
current protections for the hundreds of thousands of people
participating in such research each year, USA Today reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The long-established system for protecting human research
subjects has vulnerabilities that threaten its effectiveness,"
according to reports to be issued this week by the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS), the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The reports "do not claim widespread abuses of human research
subjects." But they "do provide a warning signal of a system that
is in jeopardy" to such a degree that it is now "a serious
national issue."
</P>
<P>
The HHS reports will be presented to a subcommittee of the
Government Reform and Oversight Committee of the House of
Representatives later this week.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the problem is the speed of medical research
and drug companies' race to create new products, according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
Among the concerns are:
</P>
<P>
The number and size of various trials have grown
astronomically, creating a "pressure-cooker atmosphere;"
</P>
<P>
Ethics boards that supervise such trials "review too much, too
quickly;"
</P>
<P>
Competition for research money "can compromise human-subject
protections;"
</P>
<P>
Volunteers don't understand that they are test subjects first,
patients second.

LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General Sani
Abacha died in his sleep in the early hours of Monday in Nigerian
capital Abuja, the official News Agency of Nigeria said late

</P>
<P>
Western Diplomats in Lagos said that it was a heart attack
which caused the death of General Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The office of Abacha was sealed off by the military force,

Monday.
</P>
<P>
As the sole consensus presidential candidate of Nigeria's five

<HEADLINE> E. African Military Chiefs to Review Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chiefs of general staff from
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are expected in Lodwar, northern Kenya
from June 16 as their forces enter the final stage of a joint
training exercise, Kenyan Defense Ministry told Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which involves about 2,000 soldiers from the
three east African countries and 120 U.S. army trainers, started
on June 2 and will end on June 27, said the ministry's spokesman
George Nyakundi.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, code-named Natural Fire'98, is aimed at exposing
the soldiers to future involvement in multinational peacekeeping
operations under the United Nations, said Nyakundi.
</P>
<P>
The troops are at the Moi Barracks in Eldoret of western Kenya
and will proceed to northern Turkana District next week for
another two weeks of field training.
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman said that training focuses on dealing
with a hypothetical state called Somanga, which is troubled and
the forces work to restore order within the perimeters of the
U.N. peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued last week in Eldoret, Kenyan Brigadier
J.M. Kilela said that the move is a landmark in the history of
the region as it is the first ever military exercise to be
undertaken jointly by the defense forces by the three countries.
</P>
<P>
This pre-deployment training is being conducted under the
auspices of the East African Cooperation (EAC), Kilela said,
noting it is a step forward in furthering regional military
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> UK Railway Workers to Strike 11 Days Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of British railway
maintenance workers Monday called two national strikes expected to
last a total of 11 days in a dispute over pay and working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The action would cause "significant disruption" to national
rail services, said the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT).
</P>
<P>
The staff who look after track, signaling and power supplies
plan to stop work from June 19 until June 23 and then again from
June 29 until July 5.
</P>
<P>
The RMT called the strike in a bid to get more pay and fewer
working hours for employees of Railtrack Plc, which operates the
national railway network.
</P>
<P>
RMT chief Jimmy Knapp said engineering firms had asked for too
much in return for too little compensation under plans to
restructure pay and working conditions.

"This is a dispute about fairness.... We are dealing with an

profit from the maintenance companies is 300 million pounds a

<HEADLINE> Uganda To Retrench 10,000 Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's restructuring of
government ministries will lead to laying off of some 10,000
civil servants in the coming financial year.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based East African weekly reported Monday that the
workers to be axed include those who have reached their
retirement age or whose contracts have expired, and those without
adequate academic qualifications and poor performers will also be
on the list.
</P>
<P>
Among the ministries affected are education and sports, local
government, labor and social welfare as well as that of
information which is already defunct. The former planning and
economic development ministry, re-merged with finance in May, and
that of tourism, wildlife and antiquities, are also affected.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education has indicated that it will
retrench at least 6,000 teachers, mostly those recruited for the
universal primary education program.
</P>
<P>
A substantial amount of money is reported to have been
earmarked in the forthcoming budget for the terminal benefits to
the targeted workers.
</P>
<P>
When explaining the overhaul in a May 25 circular, Florence
Mugasha who is in charge of civil service in the President's
Office said that the retrenchment mainly targets administrative
staff, with some ministries set to lose more than half of their
present work force.
</P>
<P>
A number of ministries will share office premises to cut down
on rent, the circular said. Most ministries have been spending
a quarter of their budget on office rent.
</P>
<P>
By July 1997, Uganda's civil service had been reduced to about
180,000 people, down from 320,000 before the government embarked
in a vigorous adjustment program between 1990 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Abacha Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former head of state, Sani
Abacha died in his sleep in the early hour of Monday, in Nigerian
capital Abuja, the official News Agency of Nigeria said, quoting
a statement from the Chief of Defense Staff Abdulsalam Abubakar
made Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed report said Abubakar has resumed leadership of the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
The statement from the chief of staff said Abacha will be
buried later Monday in his hometown in Kano, in northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Before the announcement of the death, the provisional ruling
council, the country's highest decision-making body, met in Abuja
to review the situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to continue at 11:00 p.m. Monday
evening, after the burial ceremony, the Nigerian News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the mood at the State House was that of shock as
most aides and other staff gathered in groups discussing the
development.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, born on Septeber 20, 1943, took over power in November
1993.
</P>
<P>
According to the transition to civil rule program announced in
1995, Abacha is expected to handover power to an elected civilian
government in October this year.
</P>
<P>
In April, five political parties in Nigeria adopted Abacha as
their consensus candidate for the presidential election scheduled
for August 1. but Abacha has been silent on the issue until his
death.
</P>
<P>
Abacha has been reportedly suffering from serious liver
diseases for a long time. Some western diplomats in Lagos said he
died of heart attack.

BAGHDAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Jordan on Monday signed

<P>
MAPUTO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the British
Commonwealth Emeka Anyaoku Monday expressed the hope that local
elections to be held later this month in Mozambique's 33 cities
and towns will "take place in peace and non-violence."
</P>
<P>
"First of all, the relevant state laws should be strictly
complied with," Anyaoku said at a press conference held here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The British Commonwealth has not made formal response to the
boycott of Mozambique's 16 opposition parties of the elections.
But the secretary-general said that the Commonwealth hopes to see
a broad participation in the Mozambican elections.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku said that the Commonwealth has expressed its
willingness to support the general election next year in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mozambique is still a model of peace and
democracy in the world."
</P>
<P>
"The success of elections in 1994, the existence of a
democratic parliament and the reconciliation spirit shown by the
ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party (FRELIM) and the
Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) in the assembly have all
demonstrated that Mozambique is on the right track," said
Anyaoku.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Mozambique starting on June 4, Anyaoku met
President Joaquim Chissano and held talks with RENAMO's leader
Afonso Dhlakama and other political figures.
</P>
<P>
This is Anyaoku's first trip to the southern African country
since Mozambique joined the British Commonwealth in November
1995.

WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed
and six others were injured in an explosion that rocked a grain
elevator in southern Kansas Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen people were still missing or trapped in the
wreckage or on the roof hours after the blast that blew out both
ends of the Debruce Grain Elevator in Haysville at 9:20 a.m.,
according to the Associated Press.

<P>
The explosion may have been started by a spark as grain dust is
extremely explosive, the report quoted local authorities as saying.

By early afternoon, four people were still trapped on the roof
and eight or nine others were believed to be in the wreckage.

WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton has urged
Ethiopia and Eritrea to put an end to their fighting, which
erupted last week, resulting from border disputes, National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the appeal through telephone Sunday when he spoke
to President Nagaso Gidada of Ethiopia and President Isayas
Afewerki of Eritrea. It was the latest U.S. effort to stop the
conflict between the two countries.
</P>

"The president spoke yesterday to urge them to de-escalate the
tension," Berger told reporters traveling to New York with the
president for a United Nations conference. But he gave no detail
of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian warplanes struck the Eritrean capital of Asmara last
Friday and Saturday after the border dispute blew up into a
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 foreigners were evacuated from Asmara by air over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice traveled to both
countries in an unsuccessful attempt to head off the conflict. The
United States has worked out a peace plan with Rwanda, which was

CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab League (AL)
Monday called on the international community to stop Israel from
applying policies that contradict the international will.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is overriding the international community will and the
United Nations Security Council resolutions," AL Assistant
Secretary General Zakarya Ismail said at a meeting of the
AL-U.N. specialized agencies for talks on trade and development.
</P>
<P>
"Israel disclaims all commitments to the signed peace
agreements though it needs peace as much as any Arab country. It
also rejects joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The AL official expressed the hope that influential
international powers would play their role to the full to force
Israel to respect the international legitimacy resolutions through
restoring the occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-Israeli peace process has gradually grounded to a
standstill since the Israeli Likud government took power two years
ago. Israel has rejected a U.S. initiative to break the deadlock
in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hazem al Biblawi, U.N. assistant secretary general
and executive secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for
West Asia, said in his speech that progress in the Middle East
peace process will not be maintained except through regional and
international cooperation among various organizations.
</P>
<P>
Talks on enhancing ties between the 22-member AL and the
U.N. started here Monday. The participants will discuss at their
four-day meeting a number of working papers on Arab economies,
trade liberalization and the Arab free-trade zone.

<HEADLINE> Israel Responsible for Peace Process Deadlock: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- President of Palestine, Yasser
Arafat, Monday morning once again strongly criticised Israel for
placing obstacles and impediments on the road of peace in the
middle east.
</P>
<P>
Israel is fully responsible for the impasse of the peace
process and for the failure of the international efforts,
especially the European, the Russian, the American and the Arab
efforts, Yasser Arafat said
in his address to the 34th summit of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) which opened here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Refusing the offer of a chair and insisting on standing during
his speech, the somewhat tired Palestinian leader listed in the
strongest tone the various ways, means, tactics and plots used by
the Israeli government, such as closures, blockades and
suffocation, in an attempt to paralyze the Palestinian economy
and hinder the process of development and construction which the
Palestinian people began from zero.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these, the Palestinian side still adhered to
peace, he said. "We accepted the American ideas and proposals...
as well as the invitation to Washington, but until now, the
Israeli side still refuses the American proposals," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also urged international community to assist the
Palestinian people in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Making peace in the region is a Palestinian--Israeli--Arab
interest and necessity but it is an international interest and
our peoples attach great hopes and aspirations on this peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his welcome to the Franco-Egyptian call for
convening an international conference that will help to rescue
and get the peace process out from its grave deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"Peace will secure for the Palestinian people to end the
Israeli occupation of their land and holy places, as well as to
regain their national inalienable rights of return, and
self-determination and to establish their independent state with
holy Jerusalem as its capital," he stated.

OUAGADOUGOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- President Blaise Compaore of
Burkina Faso appealed here Monday for Ethiopia and Eritrea to
settle their conflict through dialog.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 34th Assembly of Heads of State
and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Compaore said the continent was saddened by the "fratricidal
conflict" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The armed conflict derived from border dispute has resulted in
the death of about 50 civilians and the injury of 150 others
during mutual air raids.
</P>
<P>
The Burkinabe president urged the leaders in both countries
"to listen to the voice of dialog instead of sabre-rattling."
</P>
<P>
According to him, Africa is also facing numerous and daunting
challenges.
</P>
<P>
"We must arm ourselves with courage, determination and
patience to take them up so as to meet the African people's
expectations and answer their interrogations," he said.
</P>
<P>
African leaders, therefore, should take the responsibility to
face a two-fold challenge -- to contribute to laying solid
foundations for peace and stability and guide and accompany the
dynamics of African economic integration, the Burkinabe president
told the summit.
</P>
<P>
The speech, which has been listed as one of the documents of
the current summit meeting, also requests African countries to
redouble their efforts to solve the social problems concerning
education and health.
</P>
<P>
The in-coming OAU chairman emphasized that it was an urgent
job for Africa to bring into full play its natural and human
resources to escape globalization.

<HEADLINE> High Court Rules Drug Dealers with Guns in Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A federal law adding five years
to the prison sentence of anyone carrying a gun while dealing in
illegal drugs can apply to those who keep a gun locked in a car's
glove compartment or trunk, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision made the law a more potent weapon in Congress' war
on drugs, and could affect thousands of federal cases each year.
</P>
<P>
Drug traffickers arrested while in or near their cars can be
convicted of carrying a gun even if it is not immediately
accessible, the justices ruled in two cases from rural Louisiana
and Boston.
</P>
<P>
"The generally accepted contemporary meaning of the word
'carry' includes the carrying of a firearm in a vehicle," Justice
Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
In an unanimous 1995 decision, the Supreme Court said
Prosecutors cannot invoke the "use" facet of the law unless they
show "active employment of the firearm." Just having a gun nearby
in case of a confrontation is not enough to be in violation of the
use provision, the justices ruled then.
</P>
<P>
But Breyer's opinion for the court said someone does "carry" a
gun when transporting it in his or her car.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and other three justices
dissented. Writing for the four, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said
the court "should leave it to Congress to speak in language that
is clear and definite if the Legislature wishes to impose the
sterner penalty."

KAMPALA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people have been
killed and an equal number of others seriously injured in a
disastrous road accident in which a taxi crashed head-on into a
trailer Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The injured were immediately admitted at Iganga hospital.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at Walugogo valley along the
Jinja-Iganga road during a heavy downpour at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The taxi was reported to be traveling from Iganga to Jinja
when it dashed into the trailer running in the opposite direction
before plunging into a swamp.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has recently blamed the poor
conditions of roads damaged by torrential rains brought by the
El-Nino weather pattern for the sharp rise of road accidents.
</P>
<P>
Taxis in Uganda are mini-buses often overloaded against their
capacities. They are often seen running at high speed along main
and feeder roads across the country, constituting another factor
leading to frequent disastrous road accidents.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are no restrictions whatever in Kampala which
forbid drivers from excessive drinking.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Allows Bank Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has for the first time allowed
the sale of state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian officials stressed that the bank
privatization is not the work of pressure of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian People's Assembly (parliament) Monday approved in
principle a bill regulating contribution of the private sector in
the capital of public sector banks, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The bill says that the private sector may contribute in the
shares of the capital of banks wholly-owned by the state, MENA
said, without saying when the government will offer the banks for
sale.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the parliamentary Economic Committee Abdulla Tayel
said the private sector may not own more than 10 percent of the
shares of state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
"It may hold a higher share temporarily and this should be
rectified in two years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The committee presented the bill in May to privatize the four
national banks, which include the National bank of Egypt, Misr
Bank, Bank of Alexandria and National Investment Bank.
</P>
<P>
The four banks now hold 70 percent of the country's commercial
assets. The share will be brought down to 60 percent before the
end of the year, although actual privatization would be later.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on debates on the bill, Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri said that Egypt's decision is "independent" and
imposed by "nobody in the world, a state or a financial
institution."
</P>
<P>
The letter of intent in 1993 in which the Egyptian government
says it will sell banks by the year 1995 has been canceled. The
two sides signed another letter of intent in November 1996
outlining the country's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Economy Yousef Boutros Ghali Sunday
categorically denied that Egypt's privatization of its banking
sector was a response to IMF pressures.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Egypt "might seek some foreign
experience to develop the banking sector. But Egyptians will be
responsible in the first place for developing this important
sector."
</P>
<P>
The move to privatize the banks and state-held insurance
companies has unleashed a wave of protests in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the privatization scheme warned that selling
national banks would undermine the national economy.
</P>
<P>
But Boutros Ghali told reporters earlier that privatization
would be accompanied by strict government measures to protect
depositors, including Central Bank intervention in case of
problems.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian, Eritrean Catholic Bishops Appeal for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Catholic bishops of Ethiopia
and Eritrea Monday appealed to the Ethiopian and Eritrean
governments to settle their present conflict peacefully and
expeditiously, thus eliminating any danger of war.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here after an extraordinary session, the
bishops noted that they have been deeply saddened by reports of
tensions and the news of armed conflicts between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
They said that the tragic consequences of these tensions may
lead to an all-out war among brothers who share a
common history and tradition.
</P>
<P>
The bishops pointed out that after 30 years of devastating war
and only seven years of peace, recent reports of an armed
conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea have come as a complete
surprise to the world and, above all, to the peoples of both
countries who were beginning to forget the scars of their history
and were fully engaged in building up the economic structures of
their countries.
</P>
<P>
Not only do the present tensions put this economic development
in jeopardy, but an eventual escalation of war will destabilize
the already delicate political balance in the Horn of Africa, the
bishops stressed.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Produces 1 Million Tons of Animal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Vice-Minister of
Agriculture Getachew Teklemedhin said Monday that the country can
produce 1,695,000 tons of animal products and by-products yearly.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a parliament meeting which is discussing a
proclamation providing for the establishment of animal, animal
products and by-products marketing authority, the vice-minister
said Ethiopia has the potential to produce 1,200,000 hides and
skins which are the highest hard currency earners next to coffee.
</P>
<P>
He said the country has not benefited much from its huge
animal resource due to lack of relevant technology, effective
marketing system and sufficient quarantine stations.
</P>
<P>
The new policy of market economy has encouraged more
entrepreneurs to engage in poultry and cattle fattening as well
as animal products and by-products processing industries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The marketing authority will facilitate the marketing
condition for individuals and organizations engaged in animal,
animal products and by-products trade activities, said Getachew
Teklemedhin.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian has the largest population of domestic animals in
Africa with the number of 130 million. Hides and skins are the
second largest hard currency earner next to coffee.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Abacha and His Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's military leader General
Sani Abacha died a sudden death in his sleep in the early hour of
Monday, two month before the presidential election in which he is
the sole candidate.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the long-time rumor that he was suffering serious
liver disease, unconfirmed report said that he died of an heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
Born on September 20, 1943, in Kano State in northern Nigeria,
Abacha went through all the ranks of the armed forces until he
was promoted to a general in October 1990.
</P>
<P>
Abacha was appointed the defense minister in August 1990 by
the then government of General Ibrahim Babangida.
</P>
<P>
He took over power on November 17, 1993 from the interim
government of Earnest Shonekan, a product of the crisis caused by
the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election by the
Babangida government.
</P>
<P>
Chief M.K. Abiola was widely believed to be the winner of that
election, but he was put into jail later by the Abacha government
when he announced himself President of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Abiola's supporters have been demanding his
release, and if possible, the recognition of his winnership.
</P>
<P>
For the annulment of the 1993 election and the execution of
the Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni minority activists on
charges of murder, Abacha's government has been sanctioned by the
West which criticized him for dictatorship and violation of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
In his less than five years of leadership, Abacha has survived
two coup plots, one in March 1995, in which former head of state,
General Olusegun Obasanjo and 40 others were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The other was in December 1997, which saw the fall of the
number two leader, Chief of General Staff Lieutenant-General
Oladipo Diya.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, Abacha announced a three-year transition to
civil rule program, in which he promised to hand over power to an
elected civilian government in October this year.
</P>
<P>
In April, Nigeria's five political parties adopted Abacha as
their sole consensus candidate for the presidential election
scheduled on August 1, which was seen by some pro-democracy
groups as another evidence of Abacha's rigging of the transition
program.
</P>
<P>
Though Abacha has been silent on his candidacy until his
death, the pro-democracy groups said that Abacha is certain to
succeed himself in October.
</P>
<P>
Though he was never spared by the West for alleged
dictatorship and bad records of human rights, there were always
praises for what he has done for Nigeria and the whole sub-region
of west Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, under the leadership of Abacha, has seen solid
achievements in stabilizing its economy. The inflation rate went
down from several hundred percent when he took the leadership to
the current seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Nigerian currency Naira has been stabilized,
and the country's foreign reserve has been increasing steadily in
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The whole economy is on the way of recovery, with a growth
rate of about 3.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Abacha recorded an even greater success in maintaining peace
in the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had since 1990 contributed great political leadership
as well as human and financial resources to the west African
peacekeeping force in Liberia known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
It was due to ECOMOG's efforts that the Liberian civil war was
finally brought to an end in August 1997, with the establishment
of the Charles Taylor government through a peaceful election.
</P>
<P>
It was also due to Nigeria's leadership that ECOMOG intervened
immediately after the coup in neighboring Sierra Leone last May.
Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah were eventually reinstated
in March with the help of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's contribution to regional peace and stability was
recognized Monday at the Organization of African Unity summit now
going on in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, when the leaders observed
a silence for him.
</P>
<P>
With just two months to the presidential election now without
any candidate, the fate of Nigeria is now indeed at stake.
</P>
<P>
As the military force is now consulting over who is to lead
the most populous nation in Africa, it is not known whether they
will allow the transition program to continue on its course or
anything else.
</P>
<P>
In most of its time since independence in October 1967,
Nigeria has been ruled by successive military governments.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens Retaliation Against Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States threatened on
Monday to retaliate against Belarus if the Belarussian authorities
persist in attempts to vacate the U.S. ambassador's residence in
Minsk.
</P>
<P>
"We have urged the government to halt this self-destructive
action and if the government in Belarus makes it impossible for
our ambassador to carry out his responsibilities, we will be
forced to take retaliatory action," said State Department
spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian government indicated that all residences in the
neighborhood area, where the U.S. ambassador's residence is
located, should be vacated by Wednesday, June 10th, to allow the
government to replace utility lines in the area.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, workers from the Belarussian government
welded shut a side gate leading to the residence of the U.S.
ambassador, Daniel Speckard.
</P>
<P>
But the front gate to the residence is still open, though
indications are that road access to the area will be blocked in a
few days, and the ambassador is still in the residence, said Rubin
</P>
<P>
"We and the dozen other countries facing eviction have made
clear that this action by the government of Belarus is a violation
of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. The residence
of an ambassador is inviolable," noted Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"The host government is obligated under the convention to take
all appropriate steps to protect the residence and to make sure
that it is supplied with adequate services," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the Belarussian government's action is also
inconsistent with the lease contract, which will remain valid until
2001.
</P>
<P>
When asked what retaliatory action could be taken, Rubin
replied, "We certainly would have options of our own in the
welding area here in Washington."

<HEADLINE> South Africa Joins Others in Calling for Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Tuesday joined
seven other countries in issuing a declaration calling for
immediate steps to be taken toward international nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was also signed by Ireland, Sweden, New
Zealand, Egypt, Brazil, Mexico and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, announced by South African Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad in Cape Town and also by foreign ministers in
various capitals simultaneously, said the possession of nuclear
weapons poses continued threat to humanity and the recent nuclear
tests by India and Pakistan underscored the predicament.
</P>
<P>
The world could no longer remain complacent at the reluctance
of states which possessed or had the capacity to produce nuclear
weapons to take fundamental steps toward the speedy and total
elimination of these weapons, Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on the five recognized nuclear states,
as well as the three capable of manufacturing nuclear weapons --
India, Pakistan and Israel -- to make this commitment and take
immediate practical steps.
</P>
<P>
For the process to start, India, Pakistan and Israel should
clearly and urgently reverse the pursuit of their respective
nuclear weapons development or deployment plans, and refrain from
any actions that could undermine the international community's
efforts toward nuclear disarmament, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of nuclear arsenals and the development of
requisite verification regimes would require time, but there were
a number of practical steps that these states could and should
take immediately, it said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on the three states, and all other
states who had not yet done so, to adhere to the
non-proliferation treaty and to take the necessary measures
flowing from this adherence.
</P>
<P>
"We likewise call on them to sign and ratify the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty without delay and without conditions,"
the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The permanent representatives of Ireland, South Africa, New
Zealand and Sweden at the United Nations will seek a meeting with
the UN Secretary-General Tuesday to hand over the declaration and
to request its issue as a document of the United Nations.

BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The state leading group for
promoting China's science, technology and education today
approved a development plan initiated by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
The group, led by Premier Zhu Rongji, also drew up an agenda
for implementing the national strategy of "revitalizing the
country with science, technology and education" in the year.
</P>
<P>
The group has been established by the Chinese government to
lead and coordinate the enhancement work for sciences and
technology.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin pledged early this year to support the
CAS plan and encouraged the Chinese researchers to face challenges
of the coming 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"We must work out an overall plan for the development of
science and technology and education in tandem with the growth of
national economy," Premier Zhu said at the group's first meeting,
which was attended by the group's deputy chief and Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing and other members of the group.
</P>
<P>
"The state will financially aid the plan and invest more money
in the science and technology and education endeavor," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the group members decided to hold a national
meeting for boosting the CAS plan throughout the whole
country. The third national work conference for education is also
on the list of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The leading group is determined to guide the development of
science and technology and education while deepening the reform in
the field.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lilan, Minister of Science and Technology, and Chen Zhili,
Minister of Education, separately reported their work at the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Spring Warmest in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's spring this year was the
warmest ever officially recorded in the country, reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature in Canada over the past three months
was more than 3.1 degrees centigrade above normal, making it the
warmest spring the country has experienced since 1948.
</P>
<P>
Canada began to record temperature nationwide 50 years ago when
a network of weather stations was established.
</P>
<P>
The warm spring follows a mild winter as Canada experienced the
effects of a strong El Nino, which is now weakening in the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, the warm spring has been marked by reduced rainfall
and an increased number of forest fires, especially in Alberta and
Ontario provinces.
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the world, this spring was also warmer than
usual. The average global temperature is reported to rise by more
than half a degree in the first five months over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore said on Monday that the past five
months were the warmest in earth's modern history.
</P>
<P>
"This is a reminder once again that global warming is real and
that unless we act we can expect more extreme weather in the years
ahead," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Most scientists believe that the earth's atmosphere is slowly
being warmed as man-made greenhouse gases absorb heat that would
otherwise escape into outer space.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Oil Minister Visits Kuwait on Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Minister of Petroleum Ali
Al-Naimi arrived here Tuesday for a visit aimed at seeking support
for an effort to stabilize the world oil market and raise oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi minister is scheduled to hold talks with his Kuwaiti
counterpart Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah on matters concerning the
tough situation on the international oil markets, Kuwaiti official
news agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naimi's visit is believed to be part of a Gulf tour
designed to rally support for a recent tripartite agreement
involving Riyadh to slash oil output, according to Kuna.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela agreed last Thursday in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to reduce their oil production by
450,000 barrels per day from July 1, a strategy aimed at boosting
oil prices which have dropped to low levels between 12 and 14
U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naimi disclosed Sunday, after a tour to Oman, the United
Arab Emirates and Qatar, that these three countries are ready to
effectively contribute to stabilizing the global oil markets.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, responding positively to the tripartite oil reduction
agreement, said it supports any measure to prompt a rally of oil
prices, but declined to say what action it will take in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council
is scheduled to be held in Riyadh on June 16. World oil producers
reached a deal in Saudi Arabia last March to reduce output by 1.5
million barrels per day in a bid to shore up prices.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Big Banks to Acquire Cash-Strapped Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Tuesday urged big banking institutions to consider acquiring
smaller cash-strapped banks following the closure of another
thrift bank because of insolvency.
</P>
<P>
"We have to see more of the merging or the acquisition by the
bigger banks of the smaller banks which are in difficulties,"
Ramos said in a press briefing in Kawit town, Cavite province.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was reacting to the recent closure order slapped by the
central bank on Commonwealth Savings and Loans Bank.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank is the third thrift bank to be put under the
receivership of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. since the
Asian financial storm hit the country in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' call is in line with the central bank's earlier
statement encouraging bigger banks to consider resolving the
difficulties of needy smaller ones by either merging with them or
acquiring them.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said in an earlier
interview that this development is not expected to shake
confidence in the country's banking system as Commonwealth Bank is
just a small bank.
</P>
<P>
"This is no cause for (concern). It's a very, very small bank.
Besides, probably most of those depositors are insured
depositors," he said.

<HEADLINE> World Airline Profits Hit by Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asian economic crisis is
expected to drag down world airline profits by 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars this year, the International Air Transport
Association (IATA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Airline profits will likely slip to 3.9 billion dollars as
opposed to last year's 5 billion on combined revenues of the
agency's 258-member airlines of 145.7 billion, the Montreal-based
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Global air traffic will grow by 5 percent this year, and the
combined revenues will increase by 2.6 percent to 151.5 billion
dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
The drop in profit was blamed on an expected faster-than-demand
rise of 6 percent in capacity amid the Asian economic crisis,
said IATA Director-General Pierre Jeanniot.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian carriers' 1997 financial performance was,
collectively, probably their worst ever," Jeanniot said, referring
to the economic crisis ripping through Southeast Asia for almost
one year.
</P>
<P>
The Asian airlines will have to move quickly to remove older
aircraft and other inefficiencies hidden by years of strong
growth, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In another big challenge, Jeanniot said airlines will have to
spend about 1.6 billion dollars to solve the millennium year 2000
computer problem.
</P>
<P>
Jeanniot said his agency has undertaken a project to ensure
that the world's airports are ready.

<HEADLINE> Report Urges State Enterprises to Use More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A report issued today recommends
that China encourage money-losing state-owned enterprises to
draw more investment from overseas to make them profitable.
</P>
<P>
The report was written by the prestigious Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences and based on a survey of 180 foreign-invested
state firms in eight big cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Foreign money has been a major factor in renovating state-owned
firms and helping them establish a modern enterprise system, the
report states. "The country should further liberate its minds to
woo foreign investors," it adds.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of overseas-invested projects in Chinese cities
have involved state-owned enterprises, and thousands of state
firms have used foreign money in the 1990s, the report states.
</P>
<P>
The products are better and the efficiency is higher in
foreign-invested firms, which is a result of advanced management
and technology brought by industrialized countries and regions,
the report notes.
</P>
<P>
The report urges that irrational restrictions on attracting
foreign capital be lifted. "If the productivity can be improved,
people's living standards increased, and the country's
comprehensive strength enhanced, no restrictions should be imposed
in this respect," the report states.
</P>
<P>
Two policies should be avoided, according to the report: one is
to let foreign money enter the Chinese market freely; and the
other is to build a shield to block foreign investors in the name
of protecting the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report suggests that channels to attract foreign
investment be widened, and the country should allow companies from
overseas to buy or merge middle- and small-size state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, the state should continue to control key industries
that are vital to the nation, the report states.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, Japan and the United States are the top three
investors in Chinese state enterprises, the report states.

<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme People's Procuratorate
has recently issued a notice, calling on procuratorial bodies at
all levels to tighten their ties with members of the National
People's Congress (NPC) and encourage their supervision.
</P>

</P>
<P>
It says that motions, suggestions and letters submitted by NPC
members will be listed into the agenda of the Superme People's
Procuratorate, which is also responsible for reporting the results
to the NPC members.

them timely, answer questions candidly, and listen to the
opinions modestly, according to the notice.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Urges Pilots to Return to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos on Tuesday
called on the hundreds of striking pilots of Philippine Airlines
(PAL) to return to work and end their four-day-old crippling
strike.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in Kawit town, Cavite province near
Manila, Ramos said the 620-strong pilots union of PAL must comply
with the return-to-work order issued by the Department of Labor
and Employment.
</P>
<P>
Ramos deplored the hardened stances taken by both the striking
pilots and PAL management to the detriment of the riding public
and the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The strike has disrupted flight operations of PAL, stranding
thousands of Filipinos and foreign visitors attending the
celebrations of the Philippines' 100th anniversary of independence
from Spain on June 12.
</P>
<P>
Both the striking union and PAL management hardened their
stances, refusing any compromise despite the mediation of the
Department of Labor and Employment.
</P>
<P>
The Airlines Pilots Association of the Philippines (ALPAP) has
protested PAL's decision to retire pilots who have logged 20,000
hours of flying regardless of age in accordance with a collective
bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
ALPAP said this is unfair because they are deprived of their
security of tenure. But the PAL management said the retirement
policy was already agreed by the ALPAP itself.
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Cresencio Trajano issued a return-to-work order
Monday to all PAL strikers who however have refused to heed the
directive.
</P>
<P>
The pilots vowed to continue their strike "to the bitter end."
</P>
<P>
PAL said the strike has cost the company some 150 million to
200 million pesos (5.1 million U.S. dollars) of losses a day.
</P>
<P>
The strike has crippled PAL with only 20 percent of its planes
operating, flown by pilots who are top officials of PAL.
</P>
<P>
Since the pilots ignored the return-to-work order, PAL
retaliated by firing all the striking ALPAP members.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Ask UNESCO to Inspect Damaged Parthenon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece would ask the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) or the
body's International Council of Museums to set up a committee to
inspect the condition of the Parthenon Marbles damaged by Britain,
a Greek government official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek Culture Minister
Evangelos Venizelos praised British historian William St. Clair
for his courage to bring to light the event.
</P>
<P>
St. Clair said in a book released Sunday that the Parthenon
marbles had suffered significant and irrevocable damage some 60
years ago when British Museum staff tried to restore the friezes
to what was mistakenly thought to be their original color.
</P>
<P>
The marbles, 17 figures and part of a frieze more than 160
yards long, have been housed in the British Museum in London since
the early 19th century, when Lord Elgin, then Britain's ambassador
to the Ottoman Empire, removed them from Athens' ancient Parthenon
Temple atop the Acropolis.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Greece has been strongly demanding the return
of the marbles from London to Athens, but this has never been met
by Britain who has long said that the marbles are protected and
displayed better in London than in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Venizelos stressed that the campaign for the return of the
marbles was Greece's duty, to whom the marbles belong.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he would send a letter Tuesday to his
British counterpart Chris Smith renewing Athens' call for the
return of the marbles.
</P>
<P>
Although he did not reveal the contents of the letter, sources
said that one of Greece's proposals for the return of the marbles
would involve a permanent cooperation on exhibitions between the
British Museum and Greek Museums.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Secretary of State on Sino-U.S. Relations (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State
Alexander M. Haig has urged China and the United States to enhance
 cooperation, while addressing differences through frequent high
level exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"China, as the largest developing country, and the United
States, as the largest developed country, merit a relationship
that is multi-dimensional -- each facet as important as the other
and no one strand held hostage to the other," General Haig said in
a written interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Describing Chinese President Jiang Zemin's trip last October to
the United States as a "triumphant visit," the general said the
visit was a major step in building on the momentum of positive
high level exchanges between the leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Across the full breadth of my country, President Jiang
garnered the admiration and respect of the people with whom he
met," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The visit to China by President Bill Clinton later this month
should contribute to a better appreciation of the true value of a
strong U.S.- China relationship," Haig added.
</P>
<P>
"Most importantly during the Summit meeting in Washington,
D.C. between Presidents Clinton and Jiang, it was reaffirmed that
the interests between our two peoples are converging. We share
interests in regional and international peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
He said it was also important that the U.S. president once
again affirmed that there is but "One China" and that, "we, too,
have an interest in seeing the emergence of a China that is a
great power, stable, open and enjoying peaceful relationships with
like-minded countries worldwide."
</P>
<P>
Since Jiang's visit, there is a growing appreciation among more
Americans that the U.S. administration's policy of "constructive
engagement" with China is a sound policy.
</P>
<P>
By working together, the two countries can make possible new
opportunities for economic growth exceeding that which was
initially contemplated when China's late Chairman Mao Zedong,
Premier Zhou Enlai and former U.S. President Richard Nixon opened
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
Haig was a member of President Nixon's international security
team in the 1970s when Nixon proposed establishing a dialogue with
China.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the significance of a "constructive strategic
partnership," the general said the establishment of such a
partnership is the acknowledgment that the Sino-U.S. relationship
is more than the sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
"The political, economic, and security dimensions combined
confirm the importance of a positive bilateral relationship," Haig
said. "However, when the multiplicity and breadth of U.S.-China
interests are put in context, the relationship takes on a
strategic character."
</P>
<P>
Since the summit last fall, Chinese and American government
agencies have been working to add greater substance to every facet
of their relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With the economic dimension, our financial, monetary and trade
experts have worked to facilitate China becoming an even more active
member of the global market system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly in the defense sector, there has been a multiplicity
of high level exchanges between members of the armed forces of the
two countries, he said. "Through the dialogues, our respective
militaries are working to enhance understanding and promote
cooperation all towards the preservation of peace and stability in
Asia and elsewhere."

<HEADLINE> Electronics Enterprises Need to Expand, Experts Say (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China's electronics and information
technology (IT) enterprises should combine their resources to form
large-scale high-tech companies to compete in its huge potential
market, local experts said.
</P>
<P>
However, an official from the Ministry of Information Industry
(MII) said that, at present, major electronics firms in the
country are spending limited resources on a large number of
duplicated products.
</P>
<P>
For example, major local electronics companies such as HiSense,
Changhong and TCL have recently diversified into manufacturing
personal computers. None of them will be able to snatch a major
share of the Chinese market in the next few years, they said.
</P>
<P>
Legend, the largest PC manufacturer in China, is expected to
account for just 10 percent of the domestic market by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Industrial experts held that since the pre-tax profit rate of
PC manufacturers is as thin as 5 percent, only the largest
companies can survive fierce competition from international IT
giants such as Digital and IBM.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Administration of Radio, Film and
Television (SARFTV) said that, at present, he cannot see any
single company in the country that has adequate resources to
develop and market such high-tech products as digital TV (DTV).
</P>
<P>
Wang Lian, director of the Research Management Department of
SARFTV, said that the Chinese government has spent millions of
yuan in sponsoring the development of the country's first DTV
model. However, he said that the commercialization of this model
will require several times the current investment.

<P>
He said that the government, research institutions and
enterprises have to pool efforts in developing and marketing DTV.
</P>
<P>
Major electronics companies such as Changhong, Panda, West
Lake, Konda, Skyworth and TCL have put hundreds of millions of
yuan into developing their own DTV. However, sources from the
industry said that these companies still lag 15 years behind their
international rivals in terms of technology.
</P>
<P>
Some other electronics companies have already joined hands to
bridge the gap. Haier, one of the most well-known household
electronic appliance firms in the country, has funded a DTV
development project of the Academy of Broadcasting Science.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Chinese government has formulated a
strategic plan of DTV development. It supports central and
provincial TV stations to broadcast digital signals to promote
market demands for DTV. China's DTV market is expected to be worth
200 billion yuan in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the government should adopt flexible policies in
financing, taxation and market regulation to encourage the
expansion of large-scale IT companies that serves as leaders of IT
products in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government given priority to the growth of an integrated
receiver decoder (IRD). The signal converter can enable the
country's 200 million analogue TV sets to receive digital signals.
</P>
<P>
However, only a few companies in China have the capacity to
produce this product at present.

<HEADLINE> SADF Nominates Bangladesh P.M. for Nobel Peace Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina has been nominated by the South Asia Democracy Forum (SADF)
for Nobel Peace Prize for the year 1998 for her contribution to
the cause of peace, the Dhaka-based South Asian News Agency said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The SADF, recognizing Hasina's peace initiatives in the
Chittagong Hill Tracts, more than 200 kilometers southeast of
here, made the nomination recently by a jury of eminent
personalities from the seven member states of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the independent news
agency stated.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation has been conveyed to the Nobel Foundation in
Oslo for consideration, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina has set an example of restoring peace in southeastern
Bangladesh by signing the historic peace agreement with tribal
rebels in December 1997, the SADF was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"With Hasina going ahead with the peace agreement with tribal
rebels, the concept of peaceful existence has found its roots
among different ethnic groups in Bangladesh," the SADF said.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement ended strife in the three hill districts of
Khagrachhari, Bandarban and Rangamati that left about 22,000
civilians dead during two decades of guerrilla warfare, the SADF
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The SADF is based in Dhaka, with branches in India, Pakistan,
Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives, which together with
Bangladesh are all SAARC members.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Boat People Returned to Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of 154 Vietnamese,
including 153 illegal immigrants and one migrant, were returned by
air to Hanoi, Vietnam, on Tuesday, the Hong Kong government
announced.
</P>
<P>
It was the 121st flight under the Orderly Repatriation Program
(ORP) and the group brought to 12,758 the total number repatriated
on ORP flights since October 1991.
</P>
<P>
The returnees comprised 141 men and 13 women. The majority of
them arrived in Hong Kong in 1998, with the remaining in 1988,
1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong closed the last detention center, the High Island
Detention Center, for Vietnamese people just two weeks ago, which
was hailed by a senior Security Bureau official as "a landmark
achievement in the final chapter of the whole Vietnamese boat
people saga."
</P>
<P>
The problem emerged in 1975 and has since then daunted the
densely populated city. When things were at their worst in October
1991, Hong Kong had to accommodate more than 64,300 Vietnamese
people in 14 camps.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has made vigorous efforts to solve the problem. Some
143,500 Vietnamese refugees have been resettled overseas and about
70,000 Vietnamese migrants and illegal immigrants have been
repatriated to their native country. Now the Vietnamese population
in Hong Kong has dropped to some 2,000.

MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Four civilians were killed while 12
others, including two babies, were wounded Monday night in an
explosion in a remote village in a southern Philippine province, a
military report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The military said a group of unidentified armed men lobbed
homemade bombs and strafed houses in the village of Magdaup in
Ipil town, Zamboanga del Sur province, late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Recovered from the site were one unexploded homemade bomb and
several empty shells of M-14 and M-16 rifles, the military said.
</P>
<P>
Elements of the Army's 102nd Infantry Brigade and 33rd Infantry
Battalion have been sent to pursue the attackers.
</P>
<P>
The military said it is unknown whether the attack was
conducted by the Muslim extremist group of Abu Sayyaf which raided
Ipil town in April 1994, killing hundreds of villagers.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf is one of the two remaining Muslim groups still
fighting the government and operating in southern Mindanao. The
other is the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Raise $5.3M Through Privatization in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government is seeking
to raise about 5.3 million U.S. Dollars for the 1998 fiscal year
through its three-year privatization program, Rwanda News Agency
(RNA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government will raise the money for its 1998 budget
through divesting, liquidating and hiring out of state-owned
enterprises under the three-year privatization program of public
sector.
</P>
<P>
RNA quoted Director of Privatization in the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning, Vianney Shumbusho, as saying that
"from 1998 to 2001 government expects to have privatized about 44
public enterprises, sold its shares in six companies and about
five enterprises to have been liquidated."
</P>
<P>
Up to May 29, the Rwandan government earned about three
million U.S. Dollars after the cabinet endorsed the sale of four
parastatals including two hotels and two processing factories,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Among the 44 parastatals to be sold, 25 are agricultural
companies which involves nine tea factories and three coffee
factories. The tea and coffee industries are Rwanda's major
foreign exchange earners.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year (1998-2001) economic reforms program
known as ESAF, the Rwandan government is committed to privatizing
all the state-owned enterprises in a bid to reduce its
expenditure and to increase its revenues through taxation and
sales of parastatals.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1991, the Rwandan government was spending more than
seven million U.S. Dollars annually to support public enterprises
for subsidizing their operations and equipment, grants and
retrospective borrowings.

missing in action (MIA), as saying that Iran has proposed joint
search with Iraq in border regions to locate remains of soldiers
killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
Baqerzadeh said that the proposals were made to Iraqi
officials during talks on Monday, adding that Tehran suggested
Sumar in Iran and Mandali in Iraq as the sites for the second
stage of the joint search operations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries recently sped up their efforts to solve the
issues of prisoners of war (POW) and MIAs. Last month, the two
countries reached an agreement on joint operations to search for
the remains of killed soldiers on both sides of the borders.
</P>
<P>
In April, the two countries swapped 5,584 Iraqi POWs with 319
Iranians. Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said recently
that the cases of 90 percent of Iraqi and Iranian POWs have been
solved and the remaining would be settled in the near future.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Ensure Safety of Nuclear Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to guarantee the
safety of nuclear power plants as its nuclear industry moves into
a hectic year.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official in charge of the nuclear
industry, China will be busy building its nuclear power
projects this year.
</P>
<P>
However, first of all, China will ensure the safe and stable
operation of the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power plants, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country will continue to undertake a number of
nuclear power projects this year, namely, the phase 2 and 3 at
Qinshan, the projects at Ling'ao and Liangyungang.
</P>
<P>
The official urged all nuclear departments to have a greater
sense of responsibility, improve management systems, and enhance
the safety of nuclear materials and facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said the relevant parties have set up a joint meeting system
and a regular coordination meeting system to exclusively research
the construction of nuclear power projects, and solve problems
jointly and quickly.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the country's two functioning
nuclear power plants at Qinshan and Daya Bay have maintained stable
and safe operations. And both of the plants have been refueled and
overhauled a second time. So far, the two plants have generated
nearly 15 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Surveys have found that the amount of waste discharged by
Qinshan and Daya Bay meet government-set standards and have passed
safety checks conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
They posed no harm to the surrounding environment and have
helped build a good image for China's nuclear power industry,
they stressed.

<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Touches All-Time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee became volatile
against the U.S. dollar in early trading Tuesday and dipped to an
all-time low of 42.2 to a dollar in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Mumbai that the
State Bank of India (SBI) had stopped propping up the rupee,
causing the currency to breach the 42 a dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
SBI had continuously supported the rupee since the union
government presented to the parliament its annual budget on June
1, which lacks measures to attract foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The rupee opened at 41.86 a dollar, slightly lower than Monday
when it closed at 41.80 and came under severe pressure thereafter
in the absence of SBI support.
</P>
<P>
A foreign exchange dealer said in Mumbai that the rupee may be
allowed to depreciate to a certain level before possible heavy
intervention to prevent it from having a free-fall.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Official Urges Early Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Sun Zhenyu today called on the international
community to let China join the World Trade Organization (WTO) as
early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on the Asian financial crisis held today
in Beijing, Sun said the Southeast Asian financial crisis has
posed a serious challenge to China's foreign trade. However, he
added, proceeding from the overall situation of stabilizing the
Southeast Asian economy and global economy, the Chinese government
solemnly committed itself to maintaining a stable Renminbi and has
paid a high price for it.
</P>
<P>
"The responsible behavior of China has met with high acclaim
from the international community, and the best return of the
international community to China is to let China join the WTO as
early as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Without the participation of China, the WTO will not be
complete, he noted. Its early entry into the WTO is beneficial for
the country's opening and reform process and its long-term
development, and it is also beneficial for China to contribute
more to the world in the future.
</P>
<P>
Sun analyzed in detail the impact of the financial crisis on
China's foreign trade and explained the measures adopted by the
Chinese government to cope with the challenge and reach its
economic target.
</P>
<P>
"The negative impact of the Southeast Asian financial crisis
cannot be underestimated, and the delayed consequences on China's
foreign trade sector will continue to show for a lengthy time to
come," he said. "China needs two critical conditions to meet these
challenges: one is domestic stability, the other is international
sympathy and support."

<HEADLINE> Eight FMs Call For Nuclear Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from eight
nations Tuesday have requested in an initiative further nuclear
disarmament by the international community to ensure a world free
from nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was signed by foreign ministers from
Sweden, Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The eight countries committed themselves to the process of
continued nuclear de-commissioning to wipe out nuclear weapons
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The eight ministers also called for an international pact to
ban the production of fissionables designed to develop nuclear
weapons. And they advocated a global agreement on guarantees from
states regarding no `first use' or `no threat' with nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
Also in the initiative, the ministers called on India, Pakistan
and Israel for immediate and unconditional entry into the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
India launched five nuclear tests in May and sparked its
neighbor Pakistan to conduct a series of nuclear tests late that
month, which had cast the shadow of a nuclear arms race in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the initiative, Swedish Foreign Minister Lena
Hjelm-Wallen hoped the proposal would inject new political push
for nuclear disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Malawi to Launch Own TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Malawi will by the end of this
year launch its own national television, Minister of Information
Sam Mpasu said in the commercial city of Blantyre Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mpasu was speaking when opening a six-week television
broadcast and production management course funded by United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizations
(UNESCO) in preparation for the national television launch,
reported the Malawi News Agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malawi never had its own television service since its
independence from Britain 34 years ago as the previous
government of Hastings Banda felt Malawians would be exposed to
"alien foreign cultures detrimental to rich Malawian culture."
</P>
<P>
But the television service, labeled by the information
minister as "a necessity for the enhancement of development and
democracy", will by December this year be in place.
</P>
<P>
Mpasu said, " I am happy that negotiations with all key
players are at very advanced stage and all effort is being made
to have actual broadcast start before the end of the year."
</P>
<P>
Part of the consignment of the transmission equipment has
already arrived. What remains is completion of the shipment of
the rest and installation, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The project that started soon after the new government came into
power in 1994 was earmarked for completion by 1996 but delayed
due to "financial constraints and complexity of TV broadcasting."
</P>
<P>
Mpasu, therefore, appealed for donor support for the provision
of some more equipment and training of staff.
</P>
<P>
Some of the technical staff including producers and camera men
have already been trained through attachments to already
existing television stations in neighboring countries like
Namibia and Zimbabwe and in Germany.

JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B. J. Habibie
agreed here Tuesday to appoint seven prominent businessmen as
special envoys to as many regions in the world to restore the
country's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (Kadin) chairman Aburizal Bakrie after meeting with

East, countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
All the seven are successful figures possessing rich experience
in negotiating with foreign businessmen, he said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Kadin officials recently, Habibie expressed
his support for a Kadin plan to send prominent members to foreign
countries to conduct economic or trade campaigns and restore

president's envoys and be given ambassadorial rank, the president
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ADB Sees Africa's Economic Growth Promising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUGODOUGOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank
(ADB) Tuesday gave a promising note for sustainable growth and
development in Africa in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The latest forecasts indicated that gross domestic product
(GDP) growth rate in 1998 and in the medium-term will be around
four to five percent, said ADB President Omar Kabbaj in his
statement delivered to the current summit meeting of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Africa's economic performance
continued on the positive trend, with GDP growth estimated to
have averaged 4.5 percent during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
This compared with an average of less than two percent during
the 1990-95 period, the president told the 34th OAU summit which
is to close Wednesday in the capital city of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth surpassed that of population with close to 40
countries experiencing positive growth in real per capita income
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Only half that number of countries had such growth rates at
the beginning of the decade, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Kabbaj, the on-going policy reforms have
contributed to reducing the overall fiscal deficits, the average
inflation rate, and the current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, overall economic performance remains
vulnerable to adverse external shocks emanating from weaker
international prices for some major primary commodities,
unfavorable weather conditions and civil strife in some
countries.
</P>
<P>
The effects of the external shocks have been mitigated by the
greater resilience associated with the macro-economic reforms
implemented by many countries.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic front, according to the ADB president, growth
should benefit from the deepening of economic reforms and the
ensuing declines in inflation and fiscal deficits, as well as
continuing improvements in the environment for private sector
development.
</P>
<P>
He admitted, however, the difference in the development of
various African countries, saying that it remains true that a
majority of African countries depend on a few agricultural and
mineral products and services.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, African countries cannot afford to be complacent,
more needs to be done to consolidate, sustain and deepen economic
development, especially with respect to reducing absolute
poverty.

<P>
PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Energy Agency (IEA)
said here on Tuesday that the worldwide demand for oil in the
second quarter of this year is expected to drop by 510,000 barrels
per day.
</P>
<P>
In a monthly report, the IEA, which is headquartered in Paris,
said the reason for the drop is the Asian financial crisis and a
weak demand for oil in the 29 member countries of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
On June 4, in response to the weakening demand, the oil
ministers of Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela, all major oil
production countries, decided in Amsterdam to cut production by
450,000 barrels per day beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in March, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) reached an agreement to cut production by 1.245
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have been dropping throughout the world since the

BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union approved 154
new research projects in biotechnology on Tuesday such as gene
therapy, optimization of bioprocesses and environment restoration.
</P>
<P>
The research projects are expected to draw 138 million ECU (153
million U.S. dollars) as funding resources in cutting-edge fields
of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
Most of the research projects are directed at improving human
health by finding new anti-microbials and by controlling the
spread of antibiotic resistance.

<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- African leaders have called on
all member states of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
ensure the harmonization of their industrial development plans
with the alliance for Africa's industrialization in a bid to
promote continental economic integration.
</P>
<P>
At the on-going three-day OAU summit scheduled to close
Wednesday, the leaders Tuesday requested member states to create or
strengthen consultative mechanisms between the government and the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
This should be done with the view to formulating industrial
development policies and strategies in line with the objectives
of their economic and social development plans as well as
programs for regional and sub-regional economic integration and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that OAU member states should also create
favorable conditions to enable the private sectors in Africa to
play a more important role in the industrialization of African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they agreed that member states should restructure
the public sector to enable it to improve its performance,
modernize its management and stimulate competitiveness in order
to be in a position to assist the private sector in its
industrialization endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The leaders at the OAU summit also requested member states to
implement industrial development, cooperation and integration
policies and strategies in Africa at national, sub-regional and
regional levels.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Largest Market for Israeli Communications Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Rapid growth in China's information
industry and a huge demand for high-tech products have turned the
country into the largest market for the major Israeli data
communications business.
</P>
<P>
Reuven Eliaz, spokesman for RAD Data Communications, said
recently that China will, according to the original projection,
assume its present position in 2000 or 2001. "It seems we were
too conservative about the Chinese market," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, RAD's sales in China
reached 9 million U.S. dollars. And its sales this year is
expected to increase by 58 percent compared with the 1997 figure,
1.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Zohar Zisapel, chairman of the board for RAD who
came here recently with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
traditional markets for Israel's communications industry are the
United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year China surpassed Germany as RAD's second
biggest market, accounting for 22 percent of RAD's total sales,
only 1 percent less than the United States.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say that, while RAD is not as well-known as
some competitors in developed countries, its stable performance
and the low price of its products have won Chinese carriers.
</P>
<P>
They say China's communication sector, especially the
telecommunications sector that has the most RAD involvement, is
relative young, and the carriers are very conscious of
cost-efficiency.
</P>
<P>
As part of RAD's further commitment to China, Eliaz announced,
RAD will introduce to China its voice/data communications solution
-- MAXcess products later this month.
</P>
<P>
MAXcess involves technology such as voice compression and frame
relay, and offers simultaneous data, voice and fax services.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of RAD in 1997 was 138 million dollars, 97
percent of which was from overseas sales. The increase over last
year is expected to be 20-to-30 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial added value
reached 168.1 billion yuan in May, rising by eight percent on a
year-on-year basis, according to an economic report released today
by the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The official statistics show that the country realized a total
industrial added value of 776.8 billion yuan in the first five
months this year, a year-on-year increase of 7.9 percent. The
industrial sales ratio in May hit 95.6 percent, almost the same
level as the corresponding period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicates that the industrial added value of
state-owned industry in May reached 76 billion yuan, increasing by
2.5 percent over the same period of last year; that of
collective-owned industry, 43.6 billion yuan, rising by 7.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate of 18 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions in May was higher than in April, with that of
nine provinces including Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin, Jiangsu and Hunan
two percentage points higher than the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Although the industrial output picked up in May, the sales are
not brisk enough because of sluggish domestic and overseas
market. Therefore, it is necessary to stimulate the market demand
and improve the economic efficiency, according to an official of
the State Statistics Bureau.

KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 students were burnt to
death and more were feared to have been abducted when rebels of
Allied Democratic Front (ADF) Monday launched a surprise attack
on the Kichwamba National Technical Institute in Kabarole
District in western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A New Vision report Tuesday quoted survivors as saying that
some 200 to 300 rebels rushed into the school at 5:30 a.m. Monday
and locked student dormitories before setting them ablaze with
petrol.
</P>
<P>
By the time the rebels arrived at the college there were only
10 security personnel, army soldiers who were subsequently
overpowered.
</P>
<P>
Five unidentified civilians were shot dead in one of the worst
rebel attacks in the district.
</P>
<P>
Three out of the seven halls of residence at the college are
reported to be completely gutted by the fire and cries were
heard.
</P>
<P>
"The wailing amid sporadic gunfire could be heard in Kichwamba
trading center," said a terrified resident.
</P>
<P>
The fire kept burning up to late afternoon and the school was
indefinitely closed, said Chemasuet Ndiwa, acting resident
district commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Another report here said the rebels' goal was to abduct all
the students allegedly to bolster their manpower resource.
However, when they met with resistance, the rebels decided to
burn the students.
</P>
<P>
Government forces have intensified operations against ADF
rebels in western mountains recently. As retaliation, the

<HEADLINE> George Bush Says Asian Economy will Recover Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President George Bush
said today that the Asian financial crisis will not last long
and that the Asian economy will soon be revitalized.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on the Asian financial crisis, Bush
described the crisis as "growing pains," and said the Asian
economy will be even stronger after the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
"China's action in dealing with the crisis is responsible and
bold," said the 74-year-old former U.S. president, who is here as
guest of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with
Foreign Countries.
</P>
<P>
China received real recognition both for its active engagement
in providing "tangible assistance" to help regional economies
recover, and for its willingness to make the "tough decision" not
to devalue its currency, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese economy will have a growing impact on
the global economy because of its size and growth rate.
</P>
<P>
He added that China will become fully integrated into
the global economy and, at that time, it will play an even greater
role in terms of politics, economy and security.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China still faces a great challenge on the road
head, he said, and that great skill and considerable political
courage will be required.
</P>
<P>
Bush -- who visited Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong before
he came to China -- told the audience that it is not an Asian
financial crisis, but a crisis which is centered in Asia, and that
its effects are being increasingly felt around the world. "Global
economic interdependence is an undeniable reality," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that it is also a crisis to which governments
and business communities around the world need to respond, not in
Asia's interest, but in their own self-interest.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who has visited China each year since stepping down as
president in 1992, said that the financial system and banking section
problems are a reflection of more profound problems in the broader
economic system, which are more psychological than economic or
financial.
</P>
<P>
He said that the psychology of government leaders and investors
is very important. Political stability will help restore
investors' confidence which is necessary for economic recovery, he
said, and that economic recovery is indispensable to political
stability.
</P>
<P>
Bush said that Chinese leaders deserve a lot of credit for the
implementation of the "one country, two systems" formula.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident of the future of Hong Kong politically and
economically," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Ratify Human Rights Conventions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will ratify a number of
international conventions on human rights, including one against
torture, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will ratify the conventions in stages in the next five
years," he told reporters after meeting President B. J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
The president, he said, is also expected to launch a national
action plan on human rights on June 25 as a follow-up to
agreements reached during the Second World Conference on Human
Rights in Vienna in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under one of these agreements, each country should form an
action plan on human rights, elaborating on how it intends to
implement human rights.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the Indonesian government, in cooperation with the
National Human Rights Commission, has established a committee on
human rights to work on the action plan.
</P>
<P>
He reported to Habibie that everything is ready and the
president agreed to launch the action plan on June 25.
</P>
<P>
The date, June 25, was chosen because it is the same date the
Vienna Declaration was adopted five years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Alatas, Indonesia will first ratify the
international instruments on human rights before disseminating
information and educating people on the concept and principles of
human rights and implementing human rights.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Undecided on Referendum on Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Tuesday that no referendum has been set on the
further Israeli troops pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Israel Radio, Netanyahu said that he was not
yet committed to holding such a referendum in the current
situation.
</P>
<P>
He was convinced that his decision on Israeli troops
redeployment would be supported by a majority of the public and
the Knesset (parliament), Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Some Knesset members have suggested that the prime minister
could bypass the cabinet and presented the withdrawal issue
directly to the public in face of mounting pressure from the
U.S. on one side, and from right-wing members in his coalition on
the other.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the Palestinians are pressing Netanyahu's
government to accept the U.S. proposal to withdraw troops from 13
percent more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But the right-wing members in the coalition, who refuse to
yield even an inch to the Palestinians, threatened to topple
Netanyahu if he went ahead with the pullback.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deeply stranded
due to Israel's intransigence on the redeployment issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu urged the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) to live up to its commitments to the security of Israel in
order that the two sides could reach an agreement on the
redeployment in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting a U.S. business delegation Tuesday, Netanyahu
reiterated that there has been some progress in the negotiations
with the PNA. But he did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Li Lanqing Visits Anti-drug Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- While visiting an anti-drug
exhibition here Monday evening, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
stressed that youngsters should be taught to know the hazard of
drugs and resist drugs on their own.
</P>
<P>
Touring the exhibition halls, Li was told that more than 80
percent of drug takers were youngsters, most of whom got addicted
to drug-taking without knowing the hazard of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Li is also a standing committee member of the central committee
of the Chinese Communist Party. He noted that youngsters are the
future and hope of the nation and should be taught to know the
hazard of drugs and stay away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
He urged various anti-drug departments to take different
educational measures with regard to youngsters of different ages
and make them foster strong anti-drug awareness.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, sponsored by the Ministry of Public Security,
has received strong responses from the masses. Since its opening
on May 29, the exhibition has attracted more than 130,000
visitors.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Boost Unit Trust Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim Tuesday assured the Federation of Malaysian
Unit Trust Managers that the government will consider tax
exemptions and other incentives to boost the unit trust industry.
</P>
<P>
A vibrant unit trust industry would boost the capital market
through injection of liquidity that would prevent the market from
being too vulnerable to the sudden outflow of funds, Anwar, who is
also finance minister, told a seminar on unit trusts here.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed surprise at the unit trust industry's low
contribution to the market capitalization of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange, which now stands at 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to buy the units now to take advantage of
the low prices since they would surely gain from capital
appreciation when the market recovers, assuring that the
government will strive to protect the interests of unit trust
holders.
</P>
<P>
The fall in stock prices since the middle of last year has led
to a decline in the value of unit trusts, to 43 billion ringgit
(about 10.91 billion U.S. dollars) on March 31, 1998, from 56
billion ringgit (about 14.21 billion dollars) at the start of the
regional economic crisis, Anwar noted.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the importance of public confidence in the
country's economic and financial system, saying the government
would take whatever steps to return the country's economic
fundamentals to a firmer footing.
</P>
<P>
He also called for greater professionalism and consolidation in
the management of unit trusts.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Depreciated Yen Deals Blow to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Continued devaluation of the
Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar is expected to deal a heavy
blow to South Korea's crisis-ridden economy.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen broke through the 140 level against the
U.S. dollar Monday while Tokyo wrestled with an economic slump.
</P>
<P>
The yen's slump, it is believed, will last for some
time. Economic analysts here said there is a possibility that the
yen will depreciate to the 160 level late this year if steps are
not taken to strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
As a result, South Korean goods will lose their competitiveness
against Japanese products in the international markets, analysts
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our exporters have already reduced export prices at
the request of buyers, but South Korea can't afford to reduce
prices further simply because of the yen's continued weakness, "
Kim Bee-tai, a researcher with the Institute of the Far-East
Community, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If the yen remains at the 140 level for one year, South Korea
will see a reduction of 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in exports and an
import cut amounting to 400 million dollars, according to the
Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
When and if the yen eventually plunges to the 150 level, the
competitiveness of South Korea's exports will be nearly completely
eroded, said the LG Economic Research Institute when the yen
tumbled to 139.2 against the dollar on May 29.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the yen's depreciation against the U.S. dollar
will begin to show in the next quarter, thus threatening Korea's
trade surplus," said Kim Chang-uh, export director of the Ministry
of Commerce, Industry and Energy.
</P>
<P>
The yen's devaluation makes it difficult for South Korea to
realize its trade surplus target of 25 billion dollars this
year. Statistics show that the country registered a surplus on a
customs clearance basis of 16.1 billion U.S. dollars in the first
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Those hit hardest by the falling yen will include South Korea's
electronics, automobiles, home appliances, and shipping
industries, which are competing fiercely with their Japanese
counterparts in the world markets, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports of much-needed major raw materials, parts
and capital goods, including machinery, steel and chemical goods
will decline sharply.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung has expressed deep concern
over the situation, acknowledging that his country's already
beleaguered economy will be hit hard by a devalued yen.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, this comes at a time when his nation is
preoccupied with raising exports to overcome the ongoing financial
crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans made by
financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> Experts Discuss on Global Warming in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 scientists and
experts from around the world gathered here Tuesday to address the
issue of global warming and its impact on natural environment and
social development.
</P>
<P>
The ninth Global Warming International Conference and
Exposition, co-hosted by Global Warming International Center
(GWIC) of the United States and the Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology, was opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the conference convenes in Asia, which
touches on a broad spectrum of subjects on global warming and its
mitigation.
</P>
<P>
Professor Sinyan Shen, chairman of the GWIC, kicked off the
three-day meeting Tuesday with a keynote presentation on "Global
Warming Science and Policy: Progress 1997-1998". He analyzed the
current greenhouse forcing and its impacts on climatic
instability, with the El Nino as one of the "extreme events".
</P>
<P>
Shen pointed out that the adoption of new technology and sound
management of the world's natural resources is the key to global
warming mitigation.
</P>
<P>
Robert Law, director of Environmental Protection of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, also delivered a keynote
speech Tuesday on the environmental problems in Hong Kong and
measures being put in place to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting will address issues on global and
regional resources conservation and explore management methods
relating to agricultural, forestry, mineral, transportation,
energy and water resources.
</P>
<P>
The GWIC chose Hong Kong as the site of its ninth conference
because Asia is "a region of tremendous importance to the global
economy and the global environment", according to the organizer.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition entitled "A Premier
Respected by His People" opened here on Tuesday in commemoration
of the centenary of the birth of the late Chinese Premier Zhou
Enlai.
</P>
<P>
This is the first exhibition ever held in Hong Kong in honor of
a late Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits attracted a total of 900,000 visitors while they

</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong-based China Cultural City Limited,
the Chinese-language newspaper Ta Kung Pao and the National Museum
of Chinese Modern and Contemporary History, more than 300 exhibits

Beijing's Forbidden City, had been shipped to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, born in Huai'an, Jiangsu Province, in March 1898, died of
cancer in January 1976. As one of the founders of the Chinese
Communist Party, the People's Republic of China and the People's
Liberation Army, Zhou had enjoyed high esteem at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Zhou visited Hong Kong three times during the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
After the closure of the exhibition here on June 14, some of
the exhibits will be moved to Macao for a five-day display
starting on June 18.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Slide on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to slide
on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) lost 11.36 points to close at 1117.21 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shares were weaker at the close of a quiet session Tuesday
compared with that on Monday when STII lost nearly 40 points.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market lost ground amid a flurry of selling by
foreign investors.

<P>
Concerns over the regional currency crisis continued to weaken
sentiment, they noted.

<P>
The total market volume recovered to 113.577 million units,
valued at 253.48 million Singapore dollars (about 148.53 million
U.S. dollars). There were 131 rises against 142 falls while 318
other counters remained unchanged.

cents to end at 4.46 Singapore dollars. TLB Land was up by 22
cents to close at 1.2 Singapore dollars.

On the downside, Creative 50 was the biggest loser as it
declined by 40 cents to end at 28.4 Singapore dollars. C&AMP;C fell by
28 cents to close at 4.48 Singapore dollars. NatBroad was down by
22 cents to finish at 0.78 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition to Mark Centennial of China's Bourgeois Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition to mark the
centennial of the 1898 Reform Movement, a bourgeois democratic
reform in Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), will be held in the Palace
Museum in Beijing from June 11 to September 21, coincidentally the
time of the reform movement 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, 1898, Emperor Guangxu adopted the reform advocation
of bourgeois reformers Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, and announced
the reform policies, in order to save the national crisis that
China would be partitioned by imperialist powers.
</P>
<P>
The reform was carried out for only 103 days until September 21
when Empress Dowager Cixi staged a palace coup d'etat. Emperor
Guangxu was imprisoned, and the reformers were arrested and killed.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 200,000 yuan (24,000 US dollars), the
five-part exhibition will show 77 items of cultural relics, 105
pieces of historical documents and 153 pictures, which give an
overall introduction on China's social conditions, the reform
movement and people's efforts to save the country at that time.
</P>
<P>
Many items on display are original historical archives and
relics, including Emperor Guangxu's edict of reform, as well as
the letter the reformers submitted to the emperor.
</P>
<P>
Qin Guojing, vice-director of the China No. 1 Historical
Archives Museum, said the 1898 Reform Movement was the first
movement of emancipating minds and challenging the feudal system
in China's modern history, noting that although it ended in
failure, the movement pioneered the political reform in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the exhibition is to remind people of the misery
China suffered 100 years ago and to make them carry forward the
patriotism and devotedness of the reformers, Qin said.

TEHRAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- One staff member was killed and five
others wounded in a possibly gas explosion at noon Tuesday in a
hospital in Rasht, Iran's northern province of Gilan, the official
news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Head of the services department of the Totonkaran hospital, who
was not identified, was quoted as saying that two of the injuried
were at critical condition.
</P>
<P>
He said that none of the patients in the hospital or
outpatients were affected by the explosion, who cause has not yet
been determined.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that the blast might have been caused by a leakage of
gas at the heating installations of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Window panes of the hospital and nearby buildings were
shattered by the blast, and the heating installations of the
hospital were completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, a bomb went off at the Islamic Revolution Court
in Tehran, killing three people and injuring a number of
others. Iran's outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO)
claimed responsibility for the blast.
</P>
<P>
The explosion caused condemnation on the MKO, Iran's biggest

<HEADLINE> EU, China to Boost Investment, Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Industrialists and exporters from
European Union countries and China gathered here at a seminar on
Tuesday to discuss ways to boost investment and bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
A total of 250 businessmen from Britain, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Italy, Belgium and China compared notes on the
investment environment and trade issues in China.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission,
told seminar participants that uncertainty is the single biggest
deterrent to foreign investment in the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem is in the way various local,
regional and national public administrations oversee the large
number of rules, conditions and terms which govern commercial
activities.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president of the commission, the executive body of the
15-nation European Union, said that accession to the World Trade
Organization would enhance China's efforts to attract foreign
direct investment as well as boost the country's pace and depth of
domestic economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, the Chinese minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation, told the seminar that the Chinese economy
has maintained a favorable momentum for the past 20 years since
the start of reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The country, the minister said, deepened economic reform,
extended the opening-up process, improved macro-regulations and
managed a `soft landing' while maintaining high growth and low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Shi cited China's stable currency during the financial crisis
in East Asia as both a demonstration of the country's ability to
do so and the contribution it made in stabilizing Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
He promised that China's industrial tariffs would be reduced to
the average level of developing countries by the year 2000 and
would be reduced to 10 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is China's third largest trading
partner. Trade volume last year grew by 8.4 percent to reach 43
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The EU member states now hold 8,352 investment projects in
China with a pledged capital input of 31.47 billion dollars. The
EU is the country's fifth largest investor.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Down Amid Concerns Over Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
deteriorated on Tuesday amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding the
embattled Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark All Ordinaries Index ignored a stronger Wall
Street overnight and gains in Tokyo to fall to its lowest close in
almost four months.
</P>
<P>
It ended 18.9 points softer at 2623.9, just above its February
16 finish of 2621.2.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a disappointing performance in view of the strong
offshore markets," Morgans Stockbroking's Simon Reed said.
</P>
<P>
"Investors continue to be concerned about the state of the
Australian dollar and interest rate implications but most
economists believe there will be no upward movement in domestic
interest rates."
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries had opened a little firmer as the Australian
dollar gyrated in early trade around the time of the Reserve Bank
of Australia's money market position announcement early Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
However, no change to monetary policy saw the local currency
slipping back below the 60 U.S. cent level and the stock market
followed in kind.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Abacha Buried in Kano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Late Nigerian head of state, general
Sani Abacha, who died in the early hours of monday, has been
buried in Kano city, his home town in the northern Nigeria, local
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's body was conveyed to Kano on board a presidential jet
which reportedly arrived at the Kano Airport at about 7:30 p.m.
on Monday with a delegation that includes former chief of defense
staff and now the new Head of State, General Abudusalam Abubakar,
and the minister of the federal capital territory and other top
government officials, security heads and family members and
friends.
</P>
<P>
The remains of Abacha, wrapped in simple white cloth, was
brought out of the plane in a stretcher and moved into a peugeot
ambulence waiting there.
</P>
<P>
A special prayer was held for him at about 8:00 p.m. at the
state race course ground.
</P>
<P>
Abacha was eventually buried at about 8:45 p.m. in his
personal residence on Gidado Road in Kano City, according to
islamic rites.
</P>
<P>
Abacha reportedly died of heart attack at about 3:00 a.m.
Monday in the presidential viall Aso Rock in Abuja. Doctors tried
several hours to save his life but failed.
</P>
<P>
The presidential villa was sealed off by military men in the
earnly morning of Monday. Staff who came to work were ordered
back.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's highest ruling body, the Provisional Ruling
Council (PRC) began an emergency meeting at about 12:00 p.m..
</P>
<P>
At the end of its meeting at about 5:00 p.m., the PRC said in
a statement signed by Abubakar that Abacha died in sleep in the
early morning of that day, without giving exact reasons of the
death.
</P>
<P>
Upon returning from the burial in Kano, the PRC reconvened at
about 11:00 p.m., which ended at about 2:15 a.m. Tuesday morning
with a decision to name Abubakar as the new leader.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar was immediately sworn in by the Chief Justice of the
federation, Justic Mohammed Uwais.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, hitherto a major-general, was promoted to the rank
of a full general at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar has annunced a seven-day national mourning in honor
of Abacha. He will address the nation in due course.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha, 54, took over power in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to the transition to civil rule program announced by
him in 1995, Abacha is expected to handover power to an elected
civilian government in October this year.
</P>
<P>
In April, Nigeria's five political parties adopted Abacha as
their consensus candidate for the presidential election scheduled
for August 1. But Abacha has been silent on the issue until his
death.

<TEXT>
<P>
The German government provided 70 million Deutsche Marks
(about 39 million U.S. Dollars) in the 1997/1998 fiscal year, in
which 35 million Marks (about 19.5 Million Dollars) are for
donation, 20 million (11.2 million Dollars) are for technological
cooperation and 15 million Marks (8.38 million Dollars) are for
financial cooperation, the Noticias daily newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister also revealed that Germany has participated in
many projects in Mozambique, including those in the areas of
mining and energy, transport and telecommunications, public
engineering, housing, education and de-mining.
</P>
<P>
The past bilateral cooperation mostly focused on rehabilitating
projects, Simao said, adding that now it will shift to development
programs such as the rebuilding of a large granary in Maputo
city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Simao expressed the government's hope that Germany
will play a more vigorous role in the international sphere to
help eliminate his country's foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Currently Mozambique's foreign debt stands at 5.7 billion U.S.
Dollars. The international community has pledged to cut 80
percent of it starting from June 1999. Nonetheless, Mozambique
wishes the debt could be completely written off.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Remains Below 60 U.S. Cent Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar continued to
flounder below the 60 U.S. cent level Tuesday despite efforts by
leading Australian ministers to talk it up.
</P>
<P>
After a tide of selling by U.S. hedge funds which knocked the
currency down to 12-year lows in recent sessions, little fresh
selling emerged on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 59.81 U.S. cents at the end of
Asian trading on Tuesday, down from 59.68 U.S. cents on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But after traversing a tight range of 59.63-60.10 U.S. cents in
Sydney, the local dollar was again suffering at 59.61 U.S. cents
as overseas markets opened early Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The unit was still well above its post float low of 57.10 U.S.
cents reached on July 28, 1986.
</P>
<P>
Jon Sutton, a senior manager of corporate foreign exchange with
the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said trading had been a lot
quieter Tuesday than in previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
Further losses had been expected for the local currency on
Tuesday after the large sell-offs in the past few days, with the
fate of the currency remaining in the hands of U.S. hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
"That depends on the resolve of these so-called hedge funds --
if they continue to sell, the Aussie could still make new lows,"
Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers continued to attribute the weakness in the Australian
dollar to lower commodity prices and the fall of the Japanese yen
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The link between the Japanese and Australian currencies is due
to Australia's trade dependence on Japan, which takes around 20
percent of Australia's goods exports.
</P>
<P>
The weakness in the yen reflects Japan's poor growth position
and the difficulties faced by its banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Michael Workman, foreign exchange strategist with the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said any recovery in the
Australian dollar would require some improvement in the Japanese
economy and a stronger Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The conjecture now was whether the Reserve Bank of Australia,
the nation's central bank, will raise interest rates to defend the
currency after reportedly spending around 3 billion Australian
dollars (about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars) in attempts to smooth the
unit's relentless downward drift.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar's weakness continued despite Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer telling New York businessmen
that the domestic economy was in good shape.
</P>
<P>
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello also talked about the
strength of the Australian dollar and stressed the fundamentals of
the Australian economy, including strong growth, low inflation and
a projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the foreign exchange cross rates, the Australian
dollar was buying 84.06 Japanese yen from 83.96 yen and 1.0626
German marks from 1.0629 marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Hu Jintao spoke
highly of both Sino-Romanian bilateral ties and party-to-party
relations between the Communist Party of China and the Romanian
Social Democracy Party (RSDP) here today.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with former Romanian President Ion Iliescu
and the RSDP delegation he is leading, Hu said the CPC has had
close contact with RSDP, and appreciates the latter's friendly
attitude towards China and its correct stance on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Hu is a standing committee member of the Political Bureau of
the CPC Central Committee, and Iliescu, chairman of the RSDP who
currently on a current China tour at the head of a RSDP
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The CPC is willing to continue expanding exchanges and
co-operation with the RSDP and other Romanian parties based on the
four principles guiding party-to-party relations, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to bilateral ties, he noted that the traditional
friendship, which has taken deep roots in the hearts of the people
of both countries, have withstood the test of time despite the
changing international situation.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the Chinese government will, as always, develop
its friendly co-operation with Romania, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu admired the tremendous achievements China has scored in
its reform and opening-up, saying that such development will
benefit not only the Chinese people but also the world's continued
progress. He voiced the conviction that China will surely obtain
its new development goal that has defined at the 15th CPC National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
On Romanian-Chinese Relations, Iliescu added, all major
political parties in Romania stand for a closer relationship
between Romania and China, since this will benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu and his party are visiting China at the invitation of

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Against Any Move to Amend Existing GATT/WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Tuesday any move
to amend the existing GATT/WTO rules should be treated with great
caution and should be rejected in view of the eminent danger of
legitimizing trade instruments to address environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz said Tuesday that there had been proposals to amend current
World Trade Organization (WTO) rules especially Article XX of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 so as to accord
recognition of environment protection as a ground to impede trade.
</P>
<P>
However, Malaysia views that any move to amend the existing
GATT/WTO rules, whether by amplification or making them clearer,
should be treated with great caution and should be rejected in
view of the eminent danger of legitimizing trade instruments to
address environmental problems, she said in a speech at the WTO
Regional Seminar on Trade and Environment here, which was read by
her ministry's parliamentary secretary Ahmad Kamaruzaman Mohd
Baria.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said it was necessary to emphasize that environmental
protection should be pursued in the context of sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated that Malaysia was not oblivious to environmental
protection, saying "in fact Malaysia's active participation in the
relevant regional and international fora on environment
cooperation reflects the country's concern and environmental
protection."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was, however, disappointed that some developed
countries continued to apply environmental policy measures
unilaterally and in a discriminatory manner out of political
expediency rather than by consensus based on objective technical
and economic justification, she said.
</P>
<P>
They would later change the ground rules of trade competition
and reduce competitiveness through added cost loaded on to the
producers or exporters, she said, adding "What is of greater
concern to the trading community including Malaysia is that such
environmental measures are conveniently used as a covert form of
trade protectionism to circumvent the WTO system."

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Accuses Ethiopia for Fresh Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- As African leaders are trying
to find a way to solve the ever escalating crisis between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, the two conflicting sides have not ceased
accusing each other for attacks.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release available here Tuesday morning
which is circulating at the on-going 34th assembly of heads of
state and government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
the Ethiopian army launched a fresh attack on Eritrean positions
in the Zalambesa area, a 400 km triangle which both countries
claim, at around 05:15 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has been stepping up preparations for this attack
since last Thursday when it publicly announced that it has given
orders to the country's armed forces to take action against
Eritrea, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Eritrea said in the
press release.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian attack came only a day after Eritrea renewed
its call at the OAU summit in Ouagadougou, capital of
Burkina Faso, for the cessation of all hostilities and the start
of direct talks in the presence of high level mediators, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
The government of Eritrea describes this fresh attack as
another proof that Ethiopia is bent on war.
</P>
<P>
The press release further said that Ethiopia had unleashed
five attacks in the past two weeks, and virtually imposed a
blockade of Eritrea's air space and port activities by
threatening to attack commercial aircraft entering the country as
well as civilian vessels calling at the Eritrean ports of Assab
and Massawa bordering the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating its call for a cessation of hostilities, the
Eritrean government affirms that it has no option, but to confront
these attacks resolutely in order to defend its sovereignty and
territorial integrity, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict has been top on the agenda both at
the 68th OAU ministers' meeting and the on-going 34th
OAU summit. African ministers and heads of state and government
have all expressed their concern over the conflict and special
sessions have been held one after another concerning the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ever escalating conflict between the two countries
and the ever heated-up diplomatic wars between the two sides
within the conference center here, leaders are working hard to
persuade the two sides to exert the utmost restraint while trying
to find an appropriate solution.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposes Foreign Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic has said that his country was firmly opposed to any form
of foreign military intervention in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, who is here to attend the two-day Balkan Foreign
Ministerial Meeting starting Monday, told Xinhua that the Kosovo
crisis was "an internal issue of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia" and should be kept from foreign influence.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need, no space and no acceptance of foreign
interference in such an internal issue," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that the Kosovo crisis be solved through "political
dialog" between the Serbian government and ethnic Albanians of
Kosovo "within the framework of sovereignty and integrity of
Serbia."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, we do not see the reason of any pressure and
interference (from foreign countries)," he said, adding that
foreign military intervention will not contribute to a solution to
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The tensions in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia, have
heightened since February when bloody clashes erupted between
Serbian police and ethnic Albanians who demand independence from
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and some European countries have indicated that
military operations might be taken into consideration if the
bloodshed in Kosovo continues to escalate.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers from the Balkan countries have exchanged
views on ways of settling the issue, which threatens the security
and stability of the region.

The case was handled by the Federal Security Service and the
Office for Prosecutor-General. Yurkov has been under investigation
and field surveillance since April.

<P>
Tax evasion by enterprises has long been a headache annoying
the Russian authorities. It was reported that only 17 percent of
the country's enterprises fully pay their taxes on time and that
up to 33 percent of the enterprises never pay any taxes.
Government officials' collaboration with owners of enterprises has
exacerbated the situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange closed higher Tuesday on selective buying
interests, particularly on bluechips.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was quite weak in the afternoon session as
dealers said players were concerned about the weakening ringgit
against the U.S. dollar and on fears that Japanese yen would slip
further against the greenback and affect regional markets and
currencies.
</P>
<P>
However, they said the ringgit's recovery to the 3.94 level
from the 4.0 level on profit taking on the greenback lent support
to the equities market and some offshore funds were also seen
taking advantage of the cheaper share prices to bargain hunt for
good stocks.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim Tuesday that the government would consider tax and
other incentives for the unit trust industry also triggered some
buying interests towards the close.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the 100-quality stocks Composite Index rose 7.85
to 505.64, the all-share Emas Index added 1.07 points to 129.53,
the Industrial Index added 0.55 of a point to 988.99 while the
Second Board Index slipped 0.18 of a point to 108.87.
</P>
<P>
Gainers led losers by 317 to 211, 186 counters were unchanged
and 206 counters were untraded.
</P>
<P>
The day's turnover was 84.216 million shares valued at 179.739
million ringgit (about 45.619 million U.S. dollars) against 99.174
million shares valued at 225.305 million ringgit (about 57.184
million U.S. dollars) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The main board turnover eased to 77.732 million shares worth
169.329 million ringgit (about 42.9769 million U.S. dollars) from
Monday's 93.673 million shares valued at 217.093 million ringgit
(about 55.0997 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover rose to 6.484 million shares valued
at 11.411 million ringgit (about 2.8961 million U.S. dollars) from

million U.S. dollars) on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) is undergoing a major shake-up with far-reaching effects
at both corporate head office and its operating divisions.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Daily Mail Tuesday quoted Mines Minister
Siamukayumbu Siamujaye as announcing Monday that as part of ZCCM
privatization process, expatriate staff have had their contracts
terminated at five of the divisions where management has been
restructured.
</P>
<P>
He said the changes at Nchanga, where division general manager
Robert Russell has reportedly been dismissed, are part of the
changes affecting the other divisions like Nkana, Konkola and
Mufulira.
</P>
<P>
Changes will also be made at head office of ZCCM, he said.
</P>
<P>
The contracts of the expatriates have been terminated in the
normal manner and nothing has been abrogated in their contracts,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the company's staff is being rationalized
to prepare it for privatization.
</P>
<P>
On the privatization of Nchanga and Nkana mines, two biggest
ones in the copper-producing country, the minister said that
negotiations for the sale of the two are going on smoothly with
the "prospective buyers" which might include the Kafue Consortium.
</P>
<P>
The government discontinued the negotiations with the Kafue
Consortium in April because of the disagreements over the cost of
the two mines.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is enforcing laws to
make its maritime industry more professional and prepared to face
the challenges ahead, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new Malaysia Shipping Act, to serve as a single uniform law
for the country's entire shipping industry, is in the final stages
of drafting and will replace the current Merchant Shipping
Ordinances passed in 1952 and 1960 with one each for Peninsular
Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak, he said when opening the 4th biennial
International Maritime Conference in Subang near here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 people are attending the two-day conference with the
theme " Maritime Industry: Meeting New &AMP; Changing Demand
Conditions in Asia."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the new Act's objective is to ensure that the
shipping laws of Malaysia are up-to-date and are kept abreast of
international laws and practices.
</P>
<P>
Ling said a new Carriage of Goods by Sea Act was also being
drafted to update the liability regime for sea transport and adopt
the Hague Visby Rules of 1968 to replace the current Hague Rules
of 1924 enacted in 1950.
</P>
<P>
Ling said the International Ship Management (ISM) Code would be
implemented from July 1 this year for bulk carriers and tankers
while for other ships such as container and cargo by 2002.

<P>
(by Zhang Dacheng)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 9 (Xinhua) - The killing of a senior
Tanzanian pilot driving in downtown Dar es Salaam on Monday has
shocked his colleagues, the Public Relations Manager of the Air
Tanzania Corporation (ATC) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ATC Public Relations Manager, Innocent Mungy, said that
Elzeus Rugeyamba Rutazaha, a 45-year-old First Officer of the ATC
Boeing Fleet, was shot and killed while his car stopped at a
traffic light by two robbery suspects armed with a sub-machine
gun and a pistol at about 11:00 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The only passenger in the car, Alex Kapama, a retired army
officer, said that the two strangers smashed the car windows and
shot Rutazaha in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
"They then grabbed our two briefcases and disappeared," said
Kapama, who was treated for minor bruises on the hands in the
Muhimbili Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
He said that earlier on their way to the city center, Rutazaha
stopped at a branch of the National Bank of Commerce (1997)
Limited. "I don't know whether he was withdrawing or depositing
some money."
</P>
<P>
Mungy said the deceased, who had joined the State-own ATC for
15 years with 5,000 flying hours, was off-duty following a flight
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"He is a gentleman. He is very helpful to others. His death
has shocked all of us," said Mungy, adding that he is survived by
a wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
Buka Kibona, the acting Dar es Salaam Regional Police
Commander, confirmed the incident, saying the police were looking
for the unidentified armed persons who disappeared in their own
car soon after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
With a staff of 653, the ATC owns two Boeing 737-200 and two
Forkker Friendship 27. It also rents a Boeing 737-300 from
foreign airlines.

ADDIS ABABA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
said Tuesday that the Eritrean authorities have expelled over
3,000 Ethiopians from Eritrea and detained 530 others.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
said, "Two thousand were herded in different parts of Eritrea,
their belongings confiscated and driven out of the country in the
most inhuman manner."  "One thousand more were evicted
empty-handed from Assab (a eastern city bordering the Red Sea)
alone and 530 others have been detained," it added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry calls on the international community to condemn
"this massive displacement of innocent civilians as a flagrant
violation of human rights."
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia is gravely concerned that the action of the Eritrean
authority is consistent with their objective of inciting
animosity between the peoples of the two countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless pressure is brought to bear on the Eritrean
authorities, they will not desist from committing more atrocities
against civilian Ethiopian citizens residing in Eritrea," said
the ministry in the press release.

<HEADLINE> China's Class For Gifted Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 9 (Xinhua)-- With her child-like smile, Zhang Junni
looks just like any other high school student -- but in just two
months, the 20-year-old girl will graduate with honors from the
Chinese University of Science and Technology and go on to graduate
studies in the United Sates.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is one of 710 students there from across the country,
with higher than average intelligence, whose scores on the
national university entrance exams were as much as a hundred
points higher than admission requirements for the best
universities.
</P>
<P>
They were below the age of 15 when enrolled in the "young
genius class", most of them having skipped several grades during
their grade school years.
</P>
<P>
In the past twenty years, 550 students from this class have
graduated from the university with bachelors degrees, and 72
percent have gone on to grad school at home and abroad. More than
a hundred have already got PhDs and are doing scientific research
or international business.
</P>
<P>
Shi Zhan, who entered the class at 13, made his mark by solving
a difficult mathematics problem during PhD studies abroad, and
now, at the age of 30, is advising PhD students in France.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qing, another gifted child, is now the vice-president of
a big-name securities firm on Wall Street, and one of the few
Chinese who have walked into a senior leadership position in the
financial business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
These young people all have one thing in common: they like to
meet challenges and do pioneering researches.
</P>
<P>
A young botanist, Zhong Yang, is involved in a dozen national
research projects at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The former
member of the young genius class has done work in systematic
cytobiology, using computers.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Moves to Address Computer Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's private sector and
government institutions in the computer industry have already put
up strategies to address the challenges of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Tuesday quoted NCR Computers accounts
manager Jacqueline Mwenya as saying that her company has put up
strategies in place as far back as 1997 to avoid the millennium
bug, which will cause havoc in the computer industry in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
"As a major computer company, we have been in constant touch
with our suppliers. Our clients on the other hand have been
advised on the expectations of the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategies include the replacement of hardware that are
too old with newer machines. We also upgrade machines that are
compliant," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that all non-compliant computers will still be used
in less critical areas such as homes or schools where they can be
used as teaching aids.
</P>
<P>
Comelius Musonda, Director of Commercial Services at Zambia
Telecommunications Corportation (ZAMTEL), said that ZAMTEL has
put up a committee to look into the problem of the year 2000
challenge.
</P>
<P>
"We are a high-tech organization and have already put in place
measures to ensure that all our computers are compliant by the
year 2000. At the moment, our position is encouraging as we have
equipment that is four digits. What remains is to upgrade the
two digits equipment to make it compliant," said Musonda.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a source close to the government as
saying that a national policy document on computers has been put
in place and guidelines will be issued.
</P>
<P>
The sources also revealed that on the global basis, the cost
of upgrading, replacing or redeveloping and retiring
non-compliant equipment will be the range to 600 billion U.S.
Dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's wheat production
surpassed all the previous records with over 1.8 million tons
harvested this year, about 350,000 tons more than that of last
year, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ever highest production of wheat this year was attributed
to the expansion of cultivated acreage, increase in per-acre yield
and favorable weather, the reports quoted official sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
About 70,000 hectares of land was brought under wheat
cultivation this year, which was 14 percent more than that of the
previous year. On the other hand, per hectare-yield increased by
nine percent to 2,265 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is an agriculture-based country with rice as its
major cereal crop.
</P>
<P>
Owing to some incentive measures taken by the government in
recent years, wheat yield increased with national wheat area
expanding rapidly.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's upper house of parliament
enacted Tuesday a government-proposed administrative reform bill
designed to streamline government ministries and agencies.
</P>
<P>
The bill was adopted at a plenary session of the House of
Councillors by a majority backed by the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, the Social Democratic Party and the New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Democratic Party of Japan, the Komei,
the Japanese Communist Party and the Liberal Party were against
the bill high on Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
The more powerful House of Representatives, or the lower house
of parliament, had already approved the measure.
</P>
<P>
The legislation shows a timetable for reorganizing the 22
ministries and agencies into a Cabinet Office plus 12 ministries
and agencies within five years, preferably by January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposes the establishment of the Cabinet Office to
strengthen the cabinet's functions, and defines the major duties
and functions of the 12 new ministries.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that power shall be given to the prime
minister to propose the agendas for cabinet meetings, instead of
the current system with bureaucrats dictating the agendas.
</P>
<P>
Administrative reform is one of the six main reforms proposed
by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Travelers Abroad Grow Slower in 1997, White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A record number of Japanese traveled
abroad in 1997, but the growth fell sharply from the previous
year, said a government white paper on tourism released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual report shows that 16.8 million Japanese went
overseas in 1997, up 110,000, or 0.6 percent, from 1996. In
comparison, the growth had been about 10 percent since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The slower rate of growth was attributed to Japan's sluggish
economy and the depreciation of the yen, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Of the 16.8 million Japanese, 13.7 million went abroad as
tourists for sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
The United States was the most popular destination for Japanese
travelers, which was visited by 5.3 million people, followed by
South Korea (1.6 million), mainland China (one million), and
China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (910,000).
</P>
<P>
The number of foreigners who visited Japan in 1997 was a
record-high of 4.2 million, up 9.9 percent from 1996, the report
said.

<P>
-- The chief of state of Nigeria General Sani Anacha suddenly
died in the early hours of Monday morning -- probably of a heart
attack. The officer, who had fought in the war of Biafra, could
have been the owner of a considerable fortune which was acquired
in little transparent ways.
</P>
<P>
-- Exasperated by the rising of violence in Kosovo, the 15
European Union countries showed firmness on Monday by imposing
economic sanctions against Belgrade and not excluding a military
intervention by the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Air France, which has entered the 10th day of the strike by
its pilots, has already lost one billion francs (1.67 billion U.S.
dollars) due to the strike. This conflict, which resulted from the
errors by the management, proves that Air France is not manageable
while keeping its status as a public enterprise.
</P>
<P>
-- It is this evening that the World Cup will be officially
launched in Paris. From 18 hours, four processions, headed by four
20-meter high giants, will converge on the Concorde Square for a
spectacular night show.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank to Look Into Cash Flow Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
said Tuesday that it will seek the help of the National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI) to look into the cash flow problems of two
banks it ordered to shut down earlier.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes told reporters that the central
bank will ask the NBI to help find out if some officers of the two
banks were involved in securing loans for directors, officers,
stockholders and related interest persons (DOSRI) in excess of
what the central bank allows.
</P>
<P>
The central bank ordered the closure of the Commonwealth
Savings and Loan Bank and Richmond Bank which faced serious cash
flow problems.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has yet to determine whether it is the
excessive DOSRI loans that eventually resulted in the cash flow
problems of the two banks, Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said if the central bank's fact-finding team is able to
establish that there was really mismanagement on the part of the
officers and directors, the central bank has no choice but file
necessary suits against those directly or indirectly involved in
the mess.
</P>
<P>
Under the central bank's rule, DOSRI loans generally should not
exceed the bank's capital funds or 15 percent of the bank's total
loan portfolio, whichever is lower.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that the central bank is recommending some
legislative measures that will impose stiffer sanctions against
officers, directors and stockholders of banks who may have
violated the DOSRI rules of the government.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is monitoring the banking activities of at
least 17 banks which are believed to be experiencing cash flow
problems.
</P>
<P>
However, central bank officials did not attribute these
problems to the lingering effects of the currency crisis in the
region.
</P>
<P>
But they believed that these problems were caused by
mismanagement and excessive DOSRI loans made by some officers,
directors and stockholders of these banks.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Still Attractive to Investors: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia would continue to be
attractive to foreign investors despite the regional economic
turmoil, International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The basic pragmatic policy still prevails and policies
governing equity structure, incentives and costs have been
fine-tuned," she said at a seminar organized by the
Malaysian-Swedish Business Association here.
</P>
<P>
She said the question of track record was also important to see
beyond the current financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said Malaysia had several advantages with regards to
skills, capital and advanced manufacturing technology that could
upgrade manufacturing quality.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign investors are already setting up facilities in
Malaysia as their regional bases to optimize their competitive
advantages, she said.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said her International Trade and Industry Ministry
received 212 applications from January to April this year with
investments valued at 4,027 million ringgit (about 1,000 million
U.S. dollars), of which domestic applications amounted to 1,822.9
million ringgit (452.66 million U.S. dollars) while foreign
applications totaled 2,204.1 million ringgit (547.33 million U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Israeli Economy Remains Sluggish: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite some positive signs,
Israel's economy is still in slowdown, as suggested by reports on
stagnant construction and manufacturing sectors, two key
indicators for the overall performance of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Building-starts in the first quarter of this year plunged by 21
percent to 10,060 apartments compared with 12,680 in the same
period last year, according to figures of the Central Bureau of
Statistics carried by the Jerusalem Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The apartments completed in the first quarter fell to 11,970
units from last quarter's 17,660, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the Construction and Housing Ministry officials as
saying Monday that they predicted only half the land on sale for
housing construction this year would be sold.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Income Tax Commissioner Doron Levy said real estate
deals shrank by 30 percent in the first five months of this year
as against the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Manufacturers Association Monday
reported rising unemployment and declining production in a variety
of industries, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Among those worst hit are food, textiles, footwear, wood and
furniture, machinery production, rubber and plastics, Shuki
Abramovitz, head of the association's economics division said. But
he did not give specific figures.
</P>
<P>
All these reports came days after the Treasury expressed the
hope that recent macroeconomic indicators could suggest a possible
rebound in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production grew at an annualized 7-8 percent in
February and March, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
And there have been signs that the slowdown in investments in
factories and associated equipment is bottoming out.
</P>
<P>
The imports of investment goods rose 2 percent in April
following steady decline since September 1997.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Privatize Public Transport Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt plans to privatize its
inter-city passengers transport companies in July after their
conditions are fully adjusted, the English-language daily Egyptian
Gazette reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the plan Monday, Minister of Public Business Sector
Atef Ebeid, who is in charge of Egypt's privatization program,
played down fears of increasing coach fares after the
privatization.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is not in the best interest of these companies to
raise their fares not only because of competition, but also that
they might drive passengers to use other means of transportations
such as trains," Ebeid was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that his ministry will discuss the pricing issue with
the Ministry of Transport and Communications.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with officials at the
Holding Company for Transport Monday, Ebeid said privatizing
maritime transport companies should not be a cause for concern,
nor should the privative sector's competition be so intimidating.
</P>
<P>
"Public companies must not rely on their monopoly privileges,
but should improve their services to generate profits under a
competitive atmosphere," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made it clear that maritime transport companies
are currently being modernized in preparation for privatization,
affirming that they will not be offered for sale unless the
chances of faltering are reduced to nil.
</P>
<P>
Since its privatization program was kicked off in 1996,
Egyptian government has sold majority stakes in scores of firms,
divested its interest in mobile telephone network and offered
infrastructure and utilities projects to private investors.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the government has offered 105 out of 314
state-owned companies for sale, at the speed of 10 companies every
three months, according to Mukhtar Khattab, advisor to the
minister of the public enterprise.

<HEADLINE> Beirut Voters Secure Sectarian Balance in Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The vote in Beirut in Lebanon's
first local elections in 35 years has secured a balanced
representation of Muslims and Christians in the city council, the
Daily Star newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to electoral results announced by Interior Minister
Michel Al-Murr Monday night, 12 Muslims and 12 Christians were
elected to the 24-member city council on Sunday in the third round
of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri hailed the results as "a
victory for national accord and co-existence," saying that
"national coexistence has proved the strongest."
</P>
<P>
Beirut has become a Sunni Muslim majority city over the years.
Before the elections were held here, Hariri called on his fellow
Sunni Muslim voters to elect Christians in a bid to maintain
religious harmony between the two sects.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war was fought basically because of the
imbalances between the Muslims and Christians in the country.
</P>
<P>
The local elections were slated for the four consecutive
Sundays from May 24, during which members of 646 municipal
councils, 2,401 mayors and 7,662 representatives will be elected.

BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a meeting

that China is ready to make a joint effort with Italy to establish
a long-term and stable Sino-Italian relationship of friendship and
cooperation oriented towards the next century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese government has always treasured
Sino-Italian relations and has worked to improve them and said he
believes that Scalfaro's China visit will help mutual
understanding and promote Sino-Italian relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Italy have ancient civilizations and a long history
of mutual exchanges, and those relations have developed smoothly
with the increase in exchanges of high-level visits and have made
remarkable progress in cooperation in various fields since the two
opened diplomatic ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Italy is a major European country that is playing an
increasingly important role in European and international affairs,
Jiang said, and although China and Italy have different national
conditions, social systems, culture traditions and economic
development, they have no fundamental conflict of interest, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving towards a multi-polarized world and Asia and
Europe are trying to establish a new partnership, so improved
Sino-Italian cooperation not only serves the two nations, it also
is in the interest of world peace, stability and development,"
Jiang said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's arms manufacturer
Denel is to work "exclusively" with British Aerospace (BAe) Australia
in a four-billion Rand (780-million-U.S. dollar) tender bid to replace
Australia's armed reconnaissance helicopters, local media said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
BAe Australia said Monday that deliveries for the contract of up to
40 helicopters for Australia's defense department will begin in 2003.
</P>
<P>
It said it had chosen Denel as a partner because it was impressed
with the Rooivalk helicopter, which had been offered to Malaysia and a
number of potential customers in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Denel's Chief Executive Seshi Chonco said the partnership was a tacit
recognition of the world class standards of the company's technology
and vindicated Denel's attempts aggressively to position the company
toward international strategic equity partnerships.
</P>
<P>
Tony Ennis, BAe Australia's marketing director, said the Rooivalk
was "highly capable" and "efficient" and would be an ideal solution to
the Australian army's requirements.
</P>
<P>
He said helicopters in this category were traditionally designed
for western European conditions. The Rooivalk, in contrast, had been
designed to operate in hot, dusty and coastal tropical conditions.

LOS ANGELES, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Intel, the world's largest
computer chip-maker, introduced Monday the second member of its
Celeron family of central processor unit (CPU).
</P>
<P>
The new CPU chip, serving largely as the brain of personal
computers, or PCs, works at the frequency of 300 MHz, said the
company based in Santa Clara, California.
</P>
<P>
The 300 MHz Celeron is designed to meet the market segment for
PCs priced below 1,200 U.S. dollars, but Intel didn't give
suggested price was for the new chip.
</P>
<P>
The Celeron family, first unveiled last April with a 266 MHz
CPU chip, will replace Intel's latest Pentium series with
multimedia technology known as MMX.
</P>
<P>
Intel said PC makers such as Acer, Compaq, Dell,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Packard Bell, NEC and Sony are developing
systems based on the 300 MHz chip.

LOS ANGELES, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Wells Fargo Co. and Norwest
Corp announced Monday a 34-billion-U.S. dollar merger that would
create a banking powerhouse stretching from California to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Together, the Minneapolis-based Norwest and the San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo would be the nation's seventh-largest
merger overall and the third largest in the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
The combined bank, which will retain Wells Fargo's historic
name and headquarters, would have 191 billion dollars in assets.
</P>
<P>
It will have more branches, more mortgage loans and more
Internet customers than any others in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The new Wells Fargo, said experts, will operate in 21 states
with more than 90,000 employees, about 20 million customers and
more than 5,700 financial service outlets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the merger to save at least 650 million dollars
by the third year of combined operations while 2,130 positions
will be cut in both companies' current headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The merger follows several other huge banking deals.
</P>
<P>
Citicorp announced an 80-billion-dollar merger with Travelers
Group Inc. in April, which was quickly followed by the
60-billion-dollar merger of BankAmerican Corp. and NationsBank

<HEADLINE> Airbus Aims to Increase Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Airbus aims to have half of China's
airline market share, said Rolf Rue, Airbus Industry China's
general manager, in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Airbus is more confident of cooperation with China after the
new government took office last March, said Doug Yuguo, spokesman
for Airbus Industry China. The new government is intensifying
efforts to open wider to the outside world, he said, offering
greater opportunity for the company to develop business in China.
</P>
<P>
Airbus started its China operations in 1985, and has received
orders for 92 aircraft, 47 of which are now operational. In 1997
Airbus delivered 19 planes to China's airlines, an all-time
high. It predicts that by 2014 China will need 1,320 aircraft
valued at 100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Airbus and China Air Equipment Export/Import Corp. set up the
Hua'Ou (China-Europe) Aviation Training and Supporting Center last
year to train Chinese pilots and other crew members.
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 20 multinational aviation equipment companies
have opened businesses in the center and established maintenance
services.
</P>
<P>
Airbus' cooperation with its Chinese counterparts is going
strong. Xi'an and Shenyang aircraft companies as well as Guiyang
Aviation Industrial Group, for example, are manufacturing hatch
doors, emergency exit doors, equipment and tools for ground
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The Euro currency, which will soon be used in 11 European
countries, will make it easier to do business, Rue said.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industry China was opened by multinational space
companies from France, Britain, Germany, and Spain.

<P>
TOKYO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded Tuesday in
Tokyo with the key Nikkei index recovering the 15,500 line, led by
export-oriented issues benefiting from the U.S. dollar's surge to
the 141 Japanese yen level.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese City Protecting Old City Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing, the capital of east
China's Jiangsu Province has a new plan to protect a section of
the city wall with a history of more than 600 years.
</P>
<P>
The 33.676-kilometer-long city wall was built between 1366 and
1386 in the early Ming Dynasty, the longest city wall in the
world. Because of the destruction in flames of war, the remaining
sections of the wall are 21.35 kilometers long.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing has raised more than 350 million yuan (about 42 million
US dollars) in recent years to repair nearly half of the wall, of
which several gates have become scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
The new plan calls for repairing important sections, protecting
environment of nearby areas, and developing tourism. A park will
be built as well over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say the wall is useful for the study of architecture,
ancient warfare, and urban construction.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Writes to South African Soccer Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African national
soccer team, Bafana Bafana, have received a special presidential
seal of encouragement ahead of their World Cup opening match
against France on Friday, The Star daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Coach Philippe Troussier and all 22 players have been sent
individual letters bearing touching words of inspiration from
Bafana Bafana's number one fan: President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will not be able to watch Bafana Bafana in action since
he is attending the Organization of African Unity's annual summit
in Burkina Faso and will then attend an European Union conference
in Cardiff, Wales.
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to give each player a feeling of his presence. He
wrote the letters himself last week," his spokesman Parks
Mankahlana said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The main letter was written on paper with a presidential letter
head, paper normally reserved for correspondence with heads of
states.
</P>
<P>
To captain Lucas Radebe Mandela wrote: "I am particularly proud
of you as captain, and of the South African soccer team."
</P>
<P>
He praised Troussier for the resilience the coach had shown "in
the face of unprecedented pressure."
</P>
<P>
"I am quite impressed with your training methods and the vision
you have outlined for the team," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's words to Alfred Phiri were touching: "There is quite
a difference between Alexandra township where you were born and
Vichy, your camping site for the World Cup. You are representing
the aspirations of the youth, the majority of whom are striving to
pull themselves out of the most squalid condition."
</P>
<P>
The letters were sent to the South African embassy in France on
Friday and were due to be delivered Monday night by ambassador
Barbara Masekela, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Bank Governor Confirms Stability Of Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the People's Bank
of China (PBOC), Dai Xianglong, told a seminar on the Asian
financial crisis here today that the yuan, China's currency, will
remain stable in spite of mounting pressure on the country's
exports caused by the recent devaluation of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the sharp devaluation of the yen had a negative
impact on East Asian finances and economy, and put more pressure
on China's exports and said he hopes that the Japanese government
will take steps to stabilize the yen.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has had a responsible
attitude about the crisis and has offered whatever help it could.
</P>
<P>
China has provided over four billion U.S. dollars through the
International Monetary Fund and other channels to aid countries
hit by the crisis, he said, pointing out that this is a fairly big
sum for China, which is a large developing country with a heavy
foreign debt burden.
</P>
<P>
What is more important, he said, is that the Chinese government
has pledged not to devalue the yuan and to ensure 8 percent growth
this year, which will greatly benefit the Asian economy and
finance.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the East Asian currency crisis did not
have a direct impact on China, its consequences have increased and
East Asian economic adjustments and the devaluation of the yen
have had a negative impact on China's foreign trade and use of
foreign capital, and put greater pressure on China's economic
reforms and restructuring.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the currency crisis, China will continue to open
its financial sector to the outside world and more foreign banks
will be approved for doing business in yuan and more foreign
insurance companies will be allowed to enter China, while yuan and
foreign exchange loans will be increased for foreign-funded
enterprises.

HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean police confirmed that 11

KUNMING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) had provided China with 315
million U.S. dollars in agricultural project loans by the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The projects helped 1.7 million poor farmers live a better life
through farmland reclamation.
</P>
<P>
Through the use of these funds, two counties in Hebei Province
were able to improve 9,000 ha of saline and alkali land and turn
9,000 ha. of arid land into irrigated fields, and build forest
zones and orchards on 5,000 ha. of wasteland. As a result, the
annual income of farmers in 238 villages in the two counties
has doubled.
</P>
<P>
IFAD has provided 5.65 billion U.S. dollars worth of loans for
111 developing countries in the construction of 489 projects, as
well as 200 million U.S. dollars worth of technical aids over the
past two decades. More than 80 percent of these loans have been

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Forest Coming Back A Decade After Conflagration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- About 95 percent of the forest that
was burned in the big fire ten years ago in the Da Xing'an Ling
Mountain Range in northeast China has grown back, according to the
local forestry bureau.
</P>
<P>
Da Xing'an Ling is one of China's important forests but was
heavily destroyed in the 1987 fire, when about 1.24 million
hectares of forest burned.
</P>
<P>
But an afforestation program helped speed up the restoration
process and the local forestry department paid great attention to
scientific management and new techniques that helped the nursery
stock increase 27-fold over methods used before the fire, and a
fire protection network was set up.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of restoration was completed at the end of 1996
and the second phase began in earnest last year, according to Zhu
Lieyun, deputy director of the local forestry bureau.
</P>
<P>
The landscape will be restored to the same level as before the
fire when the second phase is finished, he says.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Major Banks Hit Record Profits in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's five major banks earned
a total of 3.115 billion shekels (about 850 million U.S. dollars)
in profit last year, the Jerusalem Post daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This indicated a combined 43 percent increase for the five
banks compared with the previous year. The five banks are Bank
Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Discount Bank of Israel, Bank United Mizrahi
and Bank First International.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Supervisor of Banks Zeev Abeles was quoted by the daily
as saying that an expansion of activity, rise in operating income
and decline in provisions for doubtful debts have secured the
profit increase.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he said, the increase in revenues from fees for
expanded use of bank services, greater activity in the capital
markets and fee hikes, has all contributed to the profit soar.
</P>
<P>
The banks succeeded in raising the average return on capital to
12 percent last year, the highest in recent years, compared to 8.8
percent in 1996 and 8.4 percent in 1995, he said.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor Mars E. African Economy: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania might
have their plans of industrialization by 2020 frustrated with
large numbers of children engaged in intensive labor.
</P>
<P>
The three eastern African states are now leading the rest of
the world in proportional rate of working children, the East
African Standard newspaper Tuesday quoted latest World Bank data
on global trends of child labor and slavery as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least one out of three children aged between 10-14 years in
the region is in some form of economic activity, mostly in
agriculture, mining, fishing and domestic services, while many
others are in hawking, prostitution and garbage collection, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Researchers Peter Fallon and Zafiris Tzannatos estimated that
there are about eight million working children in the three
states.
</P>
<P>
The child labor rate in the region stands at 33 percent, which
doubles the estimates in southeast Asian countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
Labor experts said that child labor in the three countries is
preventing children from accumulating human capital and skills
necessary for having higher incomes in life.
</P>
<P>
If the matter continues, it will eventually hold economic
growth, accelerate market failures and slow down the
industrialization, the experts warned.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sees Bleak Future of Textile Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The future of Kenya's textile
industry looks bleak following the collapse of Kenya's only
remaining government-owned textile company whose unpaid bills
have run into millions of Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Rift Valley Textile Mills (Rivatex) would have
been sealed last week, had the Kenyan government not moved to place
it in receivership, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By putting the company in receivership, the government plans
to save the assets from being auctioned by creditors through
court action.
</P>
<P>
The decision was supported by the various debenture holders
who have a charge over the assets of the company based in
Eldoret, western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
According to Raphael Masinde who was appointed receiver
manager, the laws on receivership allow the 1,400 workers at the
factory to be re-hired under new terms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Lucas Chepkitony, the immediate former managing
director of the company, said the problems facing local textile
firms could be traced to insufficient raw materials, lack of
markets and the flooding of the local market with sub-standard
imported goods.
</P>
<P>
Many Kenyan farmers had reduced their cotton acreage due to
low prices and insufficient supply of chemicals, he complained,
saying this had reduced the firm's production by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Rivatex depended on cotton from Uganda and Tanzania but there
was a shortage of the commodity in July and August in the two
countries caused by poor harvests after the drought which
directly affected the company," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many textile companies are also facing stiff competition due
to the liberalization of economy which caught many of them
unprepared, the press report commented.
</P>
<P>
The local market has been flooded by imported used clothes
which are sold in open air markets since the economic
liberalization process at the end of 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Other state-owned textile companies that have gone under in
recent years include Kisumu Cotton Mills, Mount Kenya Textile
Company and the Kenya Textile Mills.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Province Tightening Liquor Sale Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, in the
southern part of China, will tighten its controls on liquor sales
through promulgating a new regulation approved by the Provincial
People's Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The regulation allows provincial departments to tighten
controls on liquor manufacturers and to penalize companies or
individuals producing and selling bad alcohol.
</P>
<P>
In Shanxi Province, 26 people died after drinking bad alcohol
earlier this year, prompting the country to pay more attention to
standardizing liquor quality.
</P>
<P>
Many small simple distilleries and illegal sellers in the
province are the major sources of inferior liquor, according to
the Guangdong provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will take effect on August 1, and will require
provincial departments concerned to reinforce controls on alcohol
quality.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Charges on Nuclear Technology Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran has dismissed as a "baseless
claim by the Zionist (Israeli) circles" the allegation that Iran
had asked Pakistan to transfer its nuclear technology, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi in New York Monday
said that Iran basically does not need such programs and has urged
India and Pakistan not to involve themselves in nuclear test
races.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi's remarks came after Israel called the nuclear
devices detonated by the Pakistanis late last month in response to
India's nuclear tests as "Islamic bombs."
</P>
<P>
Iran, among the Islamic countries, has hailed the Pakistani
nuclear explosions as Islamic world's deterrent Israel. The tests
in south Asia triggered serious concern about the proliferation of
nuclear technology in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the real goal of Israeli accusations against
Iran was to justify its dangerous nuclear capability and its ever
growing stock of nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Israeli move was designed to
procrastinate supervision by the International Atomic Energy
Agency of its nuclear installations and the signing of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that the strengthening of the NPT without any
discrimination to include nuclear powers and Israel, is the best
way to guarantee global peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly stressed the need to eventually make South
Asia and the Middle East nuclear-free.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Chief Calls on Nigerians to Maintain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary General
Emeka Anyaoku has appealed to Nigerians to remain calm and reach
a genuine consensus in choosing a successor to General Sani
Abacha who died early monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku, who sent a condolence message to the Abacha family,
Monday told the Zimbabwe News Agency that Nigerians should ensure
that peace prevailed in the oil-producing country of over 104
million people.
</P>
<P>
"I just heard the news of Abacha's death and I wish to convey
my condolences to the members of his family and I have no doubt
that all Nigerians would wish to ensure peace prevail," said
Anyaoku, who is in Harare en route to London from his first
official visit to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, head of state and commander in chief of the Nigerian
armed forces, died at dawn Monday and was buried in his native
town of Kano in accordance with Moslem rites and tradition.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1993, sent his
deputy to jail under a death sentence for plotting an alleged
coup last year.
</P>
<P>
Exiled opponents of the regime in London have already started
calling on Nigeria to hand the presidency over to Moshood Abiola,
the man widely believed to have won a 1993 presidential elections
annulled by the military.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Major-general Abudusalam Abubakar, Nigeria's
chief of defense staff, has been inaugurated as Nigeria's new
leader and the swearing-in took place Tuesday
morning in Nigerian capital.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, 54, died Monday, ending a four-year reign over
Africa's populous country.

SHANGHAI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China's container shipping
business has begun to show signs of a rebound, according to the
Shanghai Shipping Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The index released last week was 1028.15, up 1.3 percent from
May.
</P>
<P>
As currencies were devalued in Asian countries recently, there
was a rapid increase of exports and shipping costs of Chinese
lines going to these countries rose.
</P>
<P>
The costs of shipping to Europe and the United States also rose
to some extent, but even though costs were up, analysts say that
unbalanced trade also ate away at some of the profit, and some
shippers had empty containers on part of the voyage because of
fewer imports.

NANNING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Some businesses that are run by
university grads with a doctorate or master's degree are doing
well in the city of Beihai in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
At one Sino-American pharmaceutical company, for example, 10 of

diseases that cause white blood cell problems.
</P>
<P>
Another of their finds is TPO, which produces blood platelets
and will soon be available on the market.
</P>
<P>
The Beihai Yinhe Electronics Co. Ltd. is another example. It

was established four years ago, and was listed just last April on
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. On the first day of trading, it went
to 71 yuan per share in less than an hour, a record at the stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Superman brand gas heaters are produced by a company where 51.6
percent of the employees are university grads. The heaters have a
good reputation nationwide and a sizeable market share.
</P>
<P>
As the number of scholars becoming entrepreneurs increases,
hi-tech businesses have begun to contribute more to the city's
economic growth, so the city is going to work out more favorable
policies to attract even more intellectuals, according to Mayor
Jin Renshou.

NINGBO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- New breeding methods for the greater
yellow croaker in Xiangshan Bay in China's Zhejiang province are
expected to save this fish from extinction.
</P>
<P>
More than three million greater yellow croakers have been
produced, making this the largest breeding center.
</P>
<P>
The greater yellow croaker has long been popular with the
Chinese for its taste, and in the 1970s, there were 200,000 to
300,000 tons of them harvested, 90 percent of that from the East
China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Then, overfishing in the 1980s sharply brought down their
numbers, so specialists in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces began to
do research on breeding methods in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, they succeeded in finding the proper methods and
extended the use to the East China Sea.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Fined $10,000 by NBA for Bad Behavior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman was fined 10,000
U.S.-dollar by the NBA and probably will be fined by the Chicago
Bulls after missing practice and the mandatory NBA press
conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The tattooed and multihued NBA star, who had tripped to Las
Vegas to seek fun after the Finals Game 1, was seen Monday night
attending a wrestling match in a grand box.
</P>
<P>
He was with World Championship Wrestling president Eric
Bischoff and wrestlers Hulk Hogan.
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Dennis and he did not speak," the Bulls coach
Phil Jackson said. "He said to my assistant trainer he didn't
think he could make it down here in time for the press
conference. I asked him, 'Dennis, what should I say to the press?'
and he hung up on me."
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating at this time, " Scottie Pippen said.
"But you don't want to carry that into the next time, you don't
want to carry that into the next practice. You want the team
chemistry to stay as strong as possible. Especially the situation
we're in, we don't want Dennis taking the focus away from the
team."
</P>
<P>
Rodman dares to do anything. He waltzes in a half-hour later
for home games. He disappears to the locker room early in each
half -- supposedly to keep his muscles warm -- forcing Jackson to
send a trainer to fetch him as he can make a grand entrance.
</P>
<P>
"Dennis is not a normal person in our society, but he's great
in what he does here," said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
Rodman has been acting goofy for years, and the Bulls knew what
they were getting when they signed him three years ago. His latest
one-year contract was designed specifically to make him behave.
</P>
<P>
He has a 4.5 million U.S.-dollar base salary plus another 5.95
million dollars in games-played incentives and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
"With Dennis comes a lot of baggage," Michael Jordan said. "we
just have to carry it and we have to accept it."
</P>
<P>
But as long as Rodman performs well in the next game, the
Bulls perhaps won't do anything to upset him. So, wait and see
what the "worm" behaves on Wednesday night.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Duff &AMP; Phelps Credit Rating
Company (DCR) of the United States has changed the outlook on the
Ratings of India to "negative" from "stable," the Indian Express
daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rating agency revised its outlook on India on account of
the significant fiscal slippage and the potential for balance of
payment deterioration in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
India's long-term foreign currency rating is "triple-B-" and
the long term local currency rating is "triple-B+". DCR said that
it remained concerned about a possible downgrade in the near term.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the budget for 1998-99 and its deficit
target of 5.6 percent of Gross Domestic Product released recently
by the Indian government are inconsistent with DCR's previous
expectations of gradually narrowing fiscal imbalances.
</P>
<P>
Economic sanctions imposed on India following its nuclear tests
in May by the United States and Japan could also negatively affect
India's balance of payments, DCR said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Starts "Long March" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's seven-party opposition
alliance started a two-day "long march" to the country's
southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts Tuesday in protest against the
peace treaty the government signed with the tribals last December.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) started
the march from Paltan Maidan after a rally addressed by party
chief Begum Khaleda Zia, and the Jammat-e-Islami began from Ramna
Square, two hours later than scheduled because of the road
blockade erected by march opponents, according to media reports
here.
</P>
<P>
Party members and supporters from the northern and
south-western districts started arriving in the city Monday
afternoon by buses and other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of clashes between supporters and opponents
of the march in different parts of the country, and the government
has reportedly taken precautionary measures to discourage people
from participation such as requisitioning heavy vehicles and
microbuses in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The opposition termed the long march as a "rehearsal to
safeguard the country's independence and sovereignty," while the
government described it as a program to "destabilize peace" in the
hill tracts, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has fiercely attacked the treaty since it was
signed in December 1997, accusing it of "violating the
Constitution," and "ignoring the interest of the nation." The
treaty was designed to end the decades-long armed conflict in the
Chittagong Hill Tracts.
</P>
<P>
"We also favor peace accord...but the one signed (between the
government and the tribals) contains some unconstitutional
provisions which require amendments," said Khaleda Zia, who is
also leader of the Opposition in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The seven-party alliance includes the BNP, the Jammat-e-Islami,
the Jatiya Party, the Democratic League, the National Democratic
Party, the Progressive Nationalist Party, and the Democratic
Nationalist Alliance.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM: Govt Not to Intervene to Support Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The baht tumbled as the Japanese yen fell to a seven-year low
of below 140 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Since the fall of the baht was in line with the movement of
other regional currencies, the government will let market
mechanisms continue to work, the deputy prime minister was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the yen would not fall too far below 140.
</P>
<P>
Intervention by the government to support the baht would affect
plans to lower interest rates, and would be harmful to businesses
in the long run, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exporters are somewhat cheered by the depreciation
of the baht since it will strengthen the competitiveness of Thai
products.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit Nimla-or, president of the Thai Garment Manufacturers'
Association, said exporters were not worried about the weaker baht
as it would help support the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that he believed the baht would become stable
at this level.

<HEADLINE> Over Half of Indonesia's State Firms Unhealthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 53.8 percent of 160
state-owned companies in Indonesia were considered unhealthy, a
government official said.
</P>
<P>
The state companies booked a combined net profit of 11.83
trillion rupiah (1.18 billion U.S. dollars) last year, compared to
12.70 trillion rupiah (1.26 billion dollars) in 1996, State
Minister for the Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri Abeng told
members of the House of Representatives Monday.
</P>
<P>
The profitability of the companies was very low when compared
to their combined assets of 461.643 trillion rupiah (46.1 billion
dollars) and their total equity of 123.42 trillion rupiah (12.3
billion dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although total assets grew by 2.7 percent (in 1997), the
increase wasn't accompanied by an improved ability to make a
profit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 176 state-owned companies, but only 160 come
under the control of Tanri's office.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Tanri had appointed U.S.-based consultancy
firm Booz, Allen and Hamilton to lead the process of restructuring
the ailing state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
The company, together with the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank and several of the country's leading management
institutions, will submit a restructuring blueprint in September,
including a future privatization agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government plans to privatize 12 state-owned
companies in the 1998-99 fiscal year ending March 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Interest Delays Thai Auction of Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Extensive interest shown by both
domestic and international investors has forced Thailand's
Financial Restructuring Authority (FRA) to delay by one week the
auction of part of the core assets of 56 closed finance companies.
</P>
<P>
The assets to be auctioned are 300,000 hire-purchase loans
worth 46 billion baht (1.07 billion U.S. dollars), the Bangkok
Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The auction, the first of core financial assets of the 56
closed companies, was originally scheduled for June 18, but had to
be postponed to June 25 to give investors more time to study the
information on the assets up for sale, the newspaper quoted FRA
Chairman Amaret Sila-on as saying.
</P>
<P>
For the past three weeks, representatives from local and
foreign financial institutions have been pouring over
documentation and data on the hire-purchase loans, Amaret said.
</P>
<P>
The FRA has to set up five data rooms, opening 24 hours a day,
where investors could review information representing a 10 percent
random sample of the entire loan portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Even though, there is insufficient time to accommodate
investors' demand for access, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that only serious investors participated, the FRA
charged a 200,000 baht (4,650 dollars) non-refundable
administration fee for access to the data room, and a refundable
deposit of 10 billion baht (232.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Binding bids for the seven lots up for sale, together with a 2
percent bid deposit, must be submitted by June 25. The FRA will
evaluate bids and sign contracts within seven days.
</P>
<P>
After the hire-purchase loans are auctioned, the FRA will begin
sales of mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
Amaret said FRA'a main target for the asset auctions is
investors in the United States and Europe, where the FRA will
begin roadshows starting in July.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia: From Financial Crisis to Recession? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- As the Asian financial crisis has
entered its 11 months, more countries in the region are facing the
danger of sliding into recession before their hopes for a quick
recovery began to fade.
</P>
<P>
Economists have described as "worse than expected" the region's
performance in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Malaysia's economy shrank 1.8
percent in the first three months of this year, while the
Philippines' gross domestic product growth slowed down to a
lower-than-expected 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, manufacturing production fell 21 percent in March
from a year earlier. Its exports fell 3.5 percent in March from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Although Singapore registered a strong growth of 5.6 percent in
the first quarter, economists predicted that its economy will slow
down with the deepening of the economic gloom in Malaysia and
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the first quarter performance might bar a
strong rebound in the second quarter, and the full-year figures
will not look better.
</P>
<P>
Some economists predicted that Malaysia, Singapore and Japan
might join Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea in the 1998
recession line-up.
</P>
<P>
As Asian countries try their best to revive economic growth,
the health of the Japanese economy is obviously affecting the
region's recovery process.
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, Japan had been the key driver for
Asia's economies, feeding the satellite industrial machine with
infrastructure, expertise and credit. It was the Japanese yen that
built Asia's industrial machines, pushing Asia's investment-led
economies toward high growth rates that attracted billions of
dollars to the region.
</P>
<P>
But those days are over, as the health of the Japanese economy
is deteriorating with its currency depreciating. In the early
Tuesday morning trading, the Japanese yen reached a new low of 141
to the U.S. dollar, the lowest in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Even if the Japanese government's stimulus package of tax cuts
and public spending would push the annual growth above zero, the
fate of the yen is uncertain, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expressed their fears that a steady slide in the
Japanese yen against the greenback risks catapulting Asia into
another round of currency depreciation.
</P>
<P>
Further weakness of Asian currencies, some of which have
depreciated over 50 to 80 percent since last July, would no doubt
delay the region's recovery prospects and expose some of the
economies to depression.
</P>
<P>
To prevent further depreciation of their currencies, Asian
economies would have to keep their interest rates high. However,
high interest rates and a drying up of credit in turn could mean
that more companies are unable to finance their business and repay
their debts. More closures of companies and banks would follow.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with far less money coming into the region than being
pulled out, the burden of reviving growth falls on the Asian
countries' own external finances.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, imports into Thailand, Indonesia, the
Philippines and South Korea fell by about 30 percent from a year
ago. Since most of these countries' exports rely heavily on
imported materials and components, the declines indicate that the
long-awaited export boom that would lead to a recovery remains a
distant hope.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, export growth slowed sharply to 9.8 percent
in April from a year earlier, the lowest year-on-year increase in
nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
All these factors point to gloomy prospects for the Asian
economies which might possibly lead to recession later this year,
experts said.

<HEADLINE> More Modern Agriculture For Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese farmers are changing
their traditional methods of farming and turn to science and
technology instead.
</P>
<P>
In Henan Province, central China, many farmers are finding that
the old methods just don't work as well as before. The lack of
access to market information cost them dearly in marketing their
products, according to Gao Xi, who invented a way to plant a
mixture of wheat, corn, and vegetables and get 6 times the output
on a piece of land each year.
</P>
<P>
Modern agriculture is focusing on commercialization, and badly
needs scientific research, according to Dr. Sun Baozhong, of the
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, who helped bring the idea
of modern agriculture to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Sun and his team got farmers to sign contracts to take care of
the cattle for 200,000 yuan annually and taught them how to raise
cattle at lower cost, and how to sell the beef at a higher price.
</P>
<P>
In the past, it was natural for farmers to rely heavily on
experience in their farm work, but most are now turning to
technology and market knowledge for better harvests, which is
greatly helping agricultural development, keeping costs down, and
profits up.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Opposed to Military Role in Anti-Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will submit a proposal to
the United Nations General Assembly insisting on police rather
than military intervention in anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will be submitted by Carlos Tablante, the
Venezuelan minister of state and president of the National
Anti-Drug Commission.
</P>
<P>
The three-day U.N. General Assembly special session opened in
New York on Monday and it has been called to adopt a global
strategy on combating drugs.
</P>
<P>
Tablante said he did not intend to start a conflict with the
United States, but he considered the strategies oriented to a
multi-national military alliance ignored the integral nature of
the worldwide drug problem.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that his country supports the creation of a
multi-national criminal investigation police and the establishment
of a supra-national criminal court.
</P>
<P>
Tablante also said he will propose other topics to be discussed
at the three-day meeting such as "precursory chemicals."
</P>
<P>
"The First-World countries should assume their social
responsibility without pretending that their precursory chemicals
move into the international market under nobody's control," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Other topics he mentioned included money laundering and
narcotic and psychotropic abuse.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stealth Fighters Back from Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has withdrawn
12 F-117a stealth fighters which were deployed in Kuwait last
November in a military build-up against Iraq over the weapons
inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
The stealth fighters were flown home to Holloman Air Force Base
in New Mexico last Saturday and Sunday, said Pentagon spokesman
Marine Corps Major Bryan Salas.
</P>
<P>
The United States had already pulled back eight B-52 bombers
and an aircraft carrier from the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reduction of its military presence was made after the
Clinton administration decided that tension in the region had
subsided after Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions on weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen, however, said late last month
that the reduction did not "represent a change in our willingness,
our ability, to carry out any mission in the region."
</P>
<P>
"There's a great deal of firepower remaining and a lot of
prepositioned equipment and the ability to augment the size of
that force within about 48 hours," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned warplanes that have been flown home would remain on
the alert in the United States and could be returned to the area
in a new emergency.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Import Activities Drop Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's import activities had
dropped by more than 80 percent over the last few months, due to
the refusal of most Indonesian letters of credit by foreign banks,
press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the regional monetary crisis hit Indonesia and shook the
banking sector last July, most letters of credit issued by local
banks have been turned down by overseas banks, according to
Amirudin Saud, chairman of the Indonesian Importers Association.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Amirudin said, most local banks, which are suffering
from a liquidity crisis, require importers to pay up-front the
full amount of the letters of credit they want to open.
</P>
<P>
Latest official data showed total imports declined by 35.2
percent in March to 2.37 billion dollars compared to those in the
same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, the country's imports
reached 7.2 billion dollars. Last year, Indonesia's imports
totaled 41.67 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the remaining import activities now are based on the
trust built from long-term relationships between buyers and their
foreign partners, which allow transactions without letters of
credit," Amirudin said.
</P>
<P>
Commodities which are still being imported include chemical
materials, textiles and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Importers unable to continue their activities have simply
deposited their funds at local banks to earn high interests for
meeting a payroll of their workers, he added.

MEXICO CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- Heavy rains and strong winds destroyed a total
of 300,000 banana plants last Saturday in Panama's Atlantic

Company Adrian Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- The Costa Rican Oil Refinery (RECOPE) has spent 45
million U.S. dollars on import of modern petroleum refinery
equipment.
</P>
<P>
With the installation of these equipment, the RECOPE will be
able to increase its petroleum production to 25,000 barrels per
day from 15,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the company has to import 18,000 barrels of refined

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sets Conditions for Improving Ties with Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
reacted to the death of Nigeria's leader Sani Abacha by saying
that it linked its improvement of relations between the two
countries to Nigeria's genuine transition to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
"A genuine transition to civilian rule would enable the U.S.
to strengthen and deepen its ties to Nigeria, to the mutual
benefit of both our nations," State Department spokesman James
Rubin said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that Nigeria's new leadership will continue and
make credible the transition program currently in place,
culminating in inauguration of a freely elected civilian
government on October 1," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, 54, who died of a heart attack on Monday, came to power
in 1993 after the military canceled a presidential election in
mid-count.
</P>
<P>
he had been expected to transform himself into an elected
civilian president in a election planned for August 1.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said in New York that the
U.S. government "is interested in seeing a freely and
democratically elected civilian government" after Abacha's death.

<HEADLINE> China's One-Child Policy Helping The Life Insurance Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- According to an insurance
salesperson in China's Henan Province, the most populous province
in China, "It's easier to talk a family into buying children's
insurance than any other insurance policy."
</P>
<P>
He learned this interesting fact from his work at the Henan
branch of the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), one of
China's leading life insurance companies, and that parents are
likely to spend more on their children than on themselves. This is
because most families now only have one child.
</P>
<P>
A young couple, for example, bought their baby girl life
insurance and marriage insurance (based on a legal marriage age of
20 for girls and 22 for boys), which cost them more than 4,000
yuan annually, compared to the two retirement policies they spent
1,000 yuan a year on for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the 18 million students in Henan, from
primary school to university, are covered by accident insurance
from PICC's Henan branch.
</P>
<P>
Life insurance accounts for 52.3 percent of the company's
premiums of 1.7 billion yuan in 1997, an unprecedented 106 percent
increase from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the brisk life insurance business, however,
medical insurance is far from popular. PICC's Henan branch's
medical insurance accounted for only 2 policies per 1,000 last
year, and 48 million yuan in premiums.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinwei, the director of the company's medical insurance
department, explains that its medical insurance lacks
variety. However, a recent company poll also showed that 27.25
percent of the surveyed hope to have medical insurance. It shows
that there is a huge market potential for us to tap, Zhang added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's GDP Up 4.6 Percent in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's gross domestic product
(GDP) registered a 4.6 percent increase in the 1997-98 fiscal year
ended March, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The productive sector rose by 4.3 percent, the services sector
by 7.4 percent and the trade sector by 3.2 percent respectively as
compared with the 1996-97 fiscal year, said a current official
report of Myanmar's financial, economic and social conditions
issued by the Ministry of National Planning and Economic
Development.
</P>
<P>
Of the productive sector, agriculture, which is the mainstay of
the country's economy accounting for 35 percent of the total GDP,
increased by 2.9 percent, lower than the set target of 6.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the low GDP growth of 4.6 percent, which
is lower than the set target of 6.4 percent, to flash floods and
drought during the fiscal year in some areas which resulted in
less production of main crops, less production of
agriculture-related manufacturing sector and drop in trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The value of exports in the fiscal year amounted to about one
billion U.S. dollars, while the imports stood at 2.2 billion
dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 1997-98 fiscal year was the second year of Myanmar's
current Five-Year Plan (1996-97 to 2000-01), the average annual
growth target of which was set at 6 percent. The first year of the
plan, which is the 1996-97, achieved a 5.8 percent growth in GDP.
</P>
<P>
The last Four-Year Plan (1992-93 to 1995-96) saw an average
annual growth rate of 7.3 percent compared with the original
target of 5.6 percent, mainly due to the growth achieved by the
agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998-99 fiscal year which began in April, the country's
GDP is set to increase at 6.2 percent, of which agriculture is set
to rise at 5 percent, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Private Sector Owes 29b U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian private sector's foreign
debt due this fiscal year ending March 31, 1999 totals 29.2
billion U.S. dollars, a government official was quoted by press
reports Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's external corporate debt stood at 20 billion U.S.
dollars and the non-trade liabilities of commercial banks at 9.2
billion U.S. dollars, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance
and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita told reporters after meeting
President B.J. Habibie here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ginanjar, along with Director General of Financial Institutions
Glenn Yusuf, Bank Indonesia Director Dono Iskandar and Indonesian
debt settlement team chairman Radius Prawiro, met with Habibie to
report about an agreement with creditors to restructure the
country's mounting private foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and its creditor banks agreed in Frankfurt, Germany,
last week on a program relating to private corporate debt,
external credits to the Indonesian banking system and trade
finance.
</P>
<P>
"Hence, last week's agreement to reschedule the foreign debts
for up to eight years, including three years of grace period,
would be quite a relief," Ginandjar said.
</P>
<P>
"If we (our companies) have to repay entirely these 30 billion
U.S. dollars debts, it would be quite a pressure on our balance of
payments because that amount is more than twice as large as our
foreign exchange reserves," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dono predicted that the rupiah would start to strengthen when
the program becomes operational on August 1 as demand for U.S.
dollars should drop.
</P>
<P>
"The current (dollars-rupiah) exchange rate is still too high
because demand for dollars and other foreign exchange are still
increasing due to our huge debts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah slid against the U.S. dollar again Monday, closing
at 11,750 against the greenback, compared to Friday's close of
11,500.

PANAMA CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Panama banana exports will drop
by 10 million boxes (each weighing 18.14 kilograms) due to strike,
drought and restrictions on the quota imposed by the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Espino, director of the National Banana Commission,
said that the multi-national banana company Puerto Armuelle was
the worst affected with a loss of 60 million U.S. dollars
predicted this year.
</P>
<P>
The company planned to export 34 million boxes of bananas this
year, but lowered its forecast to 24 million boxes after workers
in the sector held a 57-day strike, resulting in the lay-offs of
257 workers.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the company earned 266 million dollars from the sale
of the fruit, the country's main export.

<HEADLINE> Well-preserved Ancient Kiln Discovered In Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A 4,000-year-old kiln has been
unearthed at Yuanqu County in north China's Shanxi Province with a
number of pieces of pottery, the third to be found.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say that this kiln is the best-preserved one of that
period. It is 3 meters tall and has three parts: the fire chamber,
a tunnel, and a firing room.
</P>
<P>
Below the fire chamber, scholars found an air vent and some mud
blocks serving as baffles, revealing what people of the New Stone
Age knew about controlling the fire in pottery making.
</P>
<P>
A work ground was found nearby, with a small road leading to
the kiln, and some footprints on the road can still be seen
clearly, the scholars report, explaining that they helped
craftsmen see where to walk to keep from slipping while carrying
the pottery.
</P>
<P>
There were many pots, tripods, and cauldrons inside the kiln,
decorated with quite simple designs.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say the three kilns give a better picture of pottery
making in prehistoric times and provide materials with which to
study New Stone Age culture.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Ten sites in a 24-square-kilometer
area near the city of Ruijin along the banks of the Shazhou River
in China's Jiangxi Province have sunk since last November, causing
a wall to collapse and cracks to appear in at least 30 buildings.
</P>
<P>
Ruijin was one of China's revolutionary bases in the early
1930s, and many old buildings in the city are under state
protection as cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Some cracks in the buildings are 10 cm. wide, putting buildings
and houses in danger of collapsing, according to the local geology
department.
</P>
<P>
They say the subsidence is the result of excessive use of
underground water for agriculture and aquaculture. The local
government has taken steps to control the use of subsurface water
and is doing further studies of the area.

<HEADLINE> Peru Calls for Contributions to Its Anti-Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Peru has called on
international donors to earmark part of debt service as anti-drug
funds for the eradication of drug crops.
</P>
<P>
For that purpose, Peru is inviting friendly countries to attend
a donors roundtable meeting in October, President Alberto Fujimori
told the U.N. special session on drugs here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be held under the auspices of the
Inter-American Development Bank and the Inter-American Commission
for Drug Abuse Control, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the drug crop producing countries are restricted by
debt service commitments entailed by high-level external debts.
</P>
<P>
"This is why we believe that developed countries should make
every effort to support us and to avoid breakdowns in the process
that will generate more frustration and poverty and recreate the
conditions for a revival of drug trafficking," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said Peru's acreage under illicit coca has been
reduced from 120,000 hectares in 1990 to 60,000 hectares now and
that there is a drop in the number of rural families tied to the
coca economy.

<HEADLINE> 16 Killed in Philippine Army, Rebels Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen Muslim rebels and three
Philippine soldiers had been killed in intense fighting over the
weekend in a southern Philippine province, the Philippine Daily
Inquirer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a military report, the newspaper said soldiers backed by
helicopter gunships overran late Friday a remote jungle camp of
the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), triggering
fighting that lasted until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Col. Reynaldo Alcasid, head of the Army brigade that launched
the operation, was quoted as saying the raid on Camp Salman in
Tungawan town, southern Zamboanga del Sur, was in retaliation for
crimes allegedly perpetrated by splinter MILF members.
</P>
<P>
"It was our response to a string of highway robberies,
extortion, cattle rustling and intimidation on civilians blamed on
these breakaway factions," Alcasid said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway group from the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) which signed a peace treaty with the
government in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The group refused to be included in the peace treaty but have
been negotiating with the government since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which has fought for a separate Islamic state in
Mindanao, is currently the strongest anti-government force in the
country, with an estimated membership of more than 12,000.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Farmers Getting Rid Of Sickles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Because of the greater mechanization,
of agriculture, 80 percent of the farmers in China's Anhui
Province will no longer be using sickles, the traditionally
indispensable tool used in harvesting wheat.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has over 2 million hectares of wheat to harvest this
summer, 1.6 million hectares of which is expected to be done by
machine.
</P>
<P>
The province has one of the highest mechanization levels in
China, and large harvesters from rice-growing areas in other
provinces are in Anhui to help with the harvest.
</P>
<P>
This method can save farmers from buying every type of
machinery, much of which can lay idle in the off season.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung Monday urged the United States to ease its sanctions
against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and to
reduce tension on the divided Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"It would be desirable for the United States to ease its
economic sanctions on North Korea," Kim said at a luncheon hosted
by the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
</P>
<P>
Kim arrived in New York last Saturday en route to Washington
for his first state visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since his inauguration in February, Kim has pursued a policy of
engagement with DPRK, lifting restrictions to allow expanded
business cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan at
U.N. headquarters in New York, Kim also said that his government
advocated gradual improvement of relations with DPRK, a South
Korean spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the right time to improve relations between North and
South Korea," Kim told Annan.

<HEADLINE> UNCEF Links Drug Campaign to Children's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bellamy said while the statistics presented by the UN
International Drug Control Programme(UNDCP) are shocking,"they
do not illustrate the extent to which drug trafficking and abuse
threaten children -- along with their families, their
communities and ultimately the countries in which they live."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the real impact of drugs on child rights is far
more insidious and widespread than the media's images of drugged
child soldiers, glu-sniffing street children and babies born
with an addition to crack cocaine, Bellamy argued.
</P>
<P>
Ballemy said the main violators of children's rights are the
easily-obtained, legal substances of tobacco and alcohol,
particularly when there is no check on their promotion through
advertising aimed at children and young people around the world.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy applauded efforts to reduce demand for drugs as a
major element in any global strategy, adding "We believe that
the success of demand-reduction activities will hinge on how
effective they are integrated within the context of all other
programmes that address child rights to health and development."
</P>
<P>
She added that demand-reduction efforts must address the
reality of young people's lives, the interrelatedness
of the problem that confront them: problem like poverty,
underdevelopment, illiteracy, gender discrimination and poor
access to basic services.

<HEADLINE> Columbian President Tells of Drugs Scourge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Columbian President Ernesto
Samper Pizano said here on Monday that the scourge of drugs can
only be compared to "one of the seven Biblical plagues".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.N. special session on drugs, he said drugs
have in the past 20 years brought sufferings to his countrymen by
perturbing once a peaceful country.
</P>
<P>
"The cursed drug money penetrated the economy, suddenly took
over honest business, contaminated politics and corrupted
values," he said.
</P>
<P>
"More than 3,000 policemen fell victim to terrorism", he said,
adding that "drug money became a source for funding for the
various forms of violence that we are fighting against today".
</P>
<P>
He said Columbia has to spend one billion U.S. dollars a year
to combat drug trafficking, a sum equivalent to 21 percent of the
cost to provide education for Columbian children.
</P>
<P>
Summing up his country's success in the fight, he said Columbia
has in recent years eradicated 60 percent out of the total coca
crops eradicated in the world and 36 percent out of the poppy
crops eradicated worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"We dismantled the two largest drug cartels, Medellin and Cali,
and we have more than 9,000 drug traffickers in prison," he added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of international cooperation, the
President said only by actively working against all the links in
the chain of production, distribution and use of narcotics will
the international community be able to think of a definitive way
out of the drug problem.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Russia Hold First High-Level Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl started here Monday the first
high-level government consultations between the two countries in a
bid to forge closer ties and improve cooperation.
</P>
<P>
With the start of the new mechanism of contact between Bonn and
Moscow, which goes along the lines of the regular high-level
consultations Germany holds with some other European countries,
German officials have spoken of "a special quality" of the
German-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also told reporters upon his arrival in Bonn Monday
afternoon that the bilateral consultations, which will be held
once a year in the future, indicated that the Russian-German
cooperation "has reached a higher level".
</P>
<P>
During the first round of talks held Monday evening between
Yeltsin and Kohl, the two leaders had discussed a wide range of
issues including the political situation in Russia, bilateral
economic cooperation, the battle against organized crime as well
as the Kosovo conflict, a German government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders' positions on international issues were "very
close", Yeltsin's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo conflict, Yeltsin stressed that Kosovo was an
inseparable part of Yugoslavia. He also said that political
pressure should be put on Belgrade and Kosovo-Albanian leaders in
order to restart their dialogue as soon as possible, the Russian
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman declined to comment on the question of
whether Russia would support a possible NATO military intervention
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stressed on Sunday that in
case of a Western intervention in the Kosovo conflict, Russia must
also be involved.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the talks, the two countries on Monday also
signed two agreements on nuclear cooperation.
</P>
<P>
One of the accord foresaw Russian deliveries of enriched
uraniam to a German nuclear research reactor in Munich. A second
agreement would serve to encourage deliveries of German
technologies to improve the security level of Russian nuclear
power plants, German officials said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the two sides will hold the formal round of the
talks with the participation of government ministers including
foreign, finance and defense ministers.
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Yeltsin are due to hold a joint press conference after
the meetings on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Congress Urged Not to Ban Foreign Satellite Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Aerospace Industries
Association has urged Congress here Monday not to ban U.S. satellite
launch atop Chinese rockets, warning that any policy change would
hurt the U.S. national interests.
</P>
<P>
AIA President Don Fuqua told a press conference that the issue
of Chinese launches of U.S. commercial satellites involves many
complex, technical, policy and political issues. "unfortunately,
the actions of the House were the result of a number of different
issues becoming entangled and confused."
</P>
<P>
On May 22, the House of Representatives passed several
amendments to the House Defense Authorization Bill, that if
accepted by the Senate, will have widespread implications for the
aerospace industry, U.S. national interest, and the American
public.
</P>
<P>
The House endorsed the bill amid speculations that the decision
to allow U.S. satellites to be launched atop Chinese rockets might
be influenced by political contributions and that sensitive
technology might be leaked. The House and the Senate have set up
task force to investigate the allegations.
</P>
<P>
"We urge restraint by Congress until the results of its own
reviews are complete. We believe that the existing launch policy
is sound. The policy benefits not only the industry and consumers,
but the nation," said Fuqua, who joined the AIA ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aerospace industries fear that the prohibition on
Chinese launches of U.S. satellites would turn that market over to
their French, Italian, and German competitors as well as other
customers who desire Chinese launches for economic or political
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Given that most available launch capability for the next three
years is already booked, lack of access to Chinese launchers would
also disrupt launch plans of U.S. communications companies,
resulting in financial losses.
</P>
<P>
"Our national interest is served by engagement with China,"
asserted Fuqua, who wrote to President Bill Clinton early this
month to express support to his China policy.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. aerospace industry, one of the leading U.S. exporters
to China, is appreciative of your Administration's decision to
renew China's Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status for another
year. The members of the Aerospace Industries Association strongly
support your policy of engagement with the Chinese," he wrote in
his letter dated June 3.
</P>
<P>
Fuqua expressed the hope that the current controversy
concerning Chinese launches of American satellites will not affect
the U.S. government's policy of engagement.
</P>
<P>
He told President Clinton that U.S. aerospace trade with China
in 1997 rose to 2.3 billion U.S. dollars from 1.7 billion dollars
in 1996, accounting for 17.6 percent of all U.S. exports to China.
</P>
<P>
U.S. satellite manufacturers have ordered six Long March
launches in 1997, while China's Long March is expected to service
11 percent of the space launch market during 1997-2006.
</P>
<P>
According to an AIA press release, as of March 1997, 25 Long
March launches have been tentatively booked through 2004. Over the
next decade, Euroconsult estimates the space launch market will
grow 86 percent, while the Teal Group forecasts 1,697 satellites
will be launched between 1998-2007.
</P>
<P>
The widespread attention on Chinese launches of U.S. satellites
will continue over the following weeks as hearings are held, the
annual MFN debate unfolds, the President visits China, political
connections are examined, and the nuclear balance of power in Asia
is tested, Fuqua predicted.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Storage Management Software Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 8 (Xinhua) -- As companies look for more ways to
handle storage management internally, the worldwide storage management
software market is expected to reach 4.8 billion U.S. dollars by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The software revenue in 1997 surpassed 2 billion dollars, according
to Dataquest, a California-based market analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
The market is being driven by three key segments: core, backup and
storage resource management.
</P>
<P>
Core storage management, namely file systems, volume management and
physical replication, involves products that provide basic
organization functions and ensure data integrity and availability by
offering fast failure recovery and data redundancy. Core product
vendor revenue reached 478.4 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Backup products, which provide backup, restore, archive and
hierarchical storage management tools, reached 1.33 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Products of storage resource management, which manage properties of
physical and logical storage resources such as media health,
availability, space loading, performance connectivity and utilization,
provided 210 million dollars in revenue.

UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor Luo
Gan talked with U.N. General Assembly President on relations
between China and United Nations during their meeting here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Luo is attending, as head of the Chinese delegation, the
anti-drug special session of the U.S. General Assembly at the U.N.
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Hennadly Y. Udovenko, the U.N. President and former Foreign
Minister of Ukraine, told the Chinese leader that China is playing
an important role in the United Nations. No matter acting as the
U.N. President or a Ukraine government official, he said, he
always kept a clear mind that Taiwan is a part of China which can
never be severed.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his appreciation for the excellent work of
Udovenko during his term of presidency, Luo Gan also thanked the
U.N. president for the firm stand of the United Nations in
thwarting the attempt of Taiwan to "return" to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Luo spoke highly of the traditional good relationship between
China and Ukraine, saying that it will help develop bilateral
relations if the two countries continue their mutual support in
the international affairs. Udovenko said that Ukraine pays great
attention to developing relations with China. It admires the great
achievement China has made in developing economy, he said, adding
that Ukraine would learn the Chinese experience.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Regulators Okays Conrail Dismantling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Surface
Transportation Board Monday approved a 10 billion dollar proposal
to dismantle Conrail Inc. in a bid to push rail competition in
Northeastern markets for the first time in two decades.
</P>
<P>
However, the federal regulators also imposed dozens of
conditions that CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. must meet to
address concerns over service levels, competition, labor rights
and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The board said it would keep the case under active review for
five years, two years longer than what the companies proposed to
accept.
</P>
<P>
Many shippers want increased supervision of the carriers in
light of service problems that followed a 1996 merger of Union
Pacific and Southern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Conrail was formed in 1976 and became the target of a bidding
war in 1996. CSX and Norfolk Southern agreed last year to jointly
buy the carrier and carve up its routes. In May 1997, Norfolk
Southern bought 58 percent of Conrail and CSX bought the rest at
that price in a compromise.
</P>
<P>
They promised to create competition in many Northeastern
markets for the first time since Conrail was born as a monopoly
out of six bankrupt carriers.
</P>
<P>
With Conrail routes, CSX would be the nation's third-largest
railroad with nearly 23,000 miles of tracks and Norfolk Southern
would follow with 21,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
CSX and Norfolk Southern, now dominant in the Midwest and the
Southeast, would control virtually all rail traffic in the East
with Conrail's Northeastern lines.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, some 1,500 union workers would lose
their jobs, and another 1,150 management
positions would be abolished, mostly at Conrail's Philadelphia
headquarters.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Five people drowned and
another 12 were feared dead after a South African-owned fishing
vessel sank off the Argentinian coast Saturday, South Africa's
Ambassador to Argentina said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The nationalities of the deceased had not yet been
established, Ambassador Aubrey Nkomo was quoted by South African
Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Luship, a Namibian-registered vessel, sank in rough seas
about 300 km from South Georgia Island after apparently being
struck by a big wave, Nkomo said.
</P>
<P>
The 38 crew members aboard the ship included South Africans,
Namibians and Irish, he said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one people were rescued later by a Chilean vessel, the
Isla Camila, the first to answer the 360-ton Luship's distress
call.
</P>
<P>
By Monday afternoon, five ships and an airplane from the
British Royal Air Force were still looking for survivors.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said the search was being hampered by atrocious weather.
</P>
<P>
"Most regrettably, not much hope is left of finding anyone
alive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The water conditions are treacherous and the water
temperature is about one degree Celsius. It is also snowing,"
the ambassador said.

LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The suicide rate in the Republic of
Ireland jumped to a record high in 1997 by increasing 14 percent
from 1996 to 433 cases, according to an official government report
released in Dublin Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government report said, male suicides outnumbered female by
355 to 78, and young or early middle-aged people formed the
largest group of suicides.
</P>

Health expert Feargal Bowers was quoted by Reuters as saying
that the figures were surprising in the context of Ireland's
booming economy.
</P>
<P>
Bowers noted that an increase in the divorce rate, and the
diminishing number of people attending church could have
contributed to the high suicide rate.
</P>
<P>
In view of the alarming figures, the country's opposition
parties called on the government to implement the findings of a
National Task Force set up in 1995.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Probes Apartheid Regime's Chemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is investigating the apartheid
government's chemical and biological warfare program, which
included covert assassinations by poisoning and the manipulation
of fertility.
</P>
<P>
The hearing went ahead in public in Cape Town Monday after an
initial request by a government delegation for it to be held
behind closed-doors was rejected by the TRC in the interests of
transparency, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The TRC heard testimony from a former South African Defense
Force (SADF) Captain and bio-engineer who later formed his own
front company to design and develop a series of poison-bearing
weaponry, said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Jan Lourens, a highly qualified scientist, said that he had
served in the South African Air Force and was later recruited by
the Special Operations Unit headed by Wouter Basson.
</P>
<P>
Basson is facing 10 criminal charges ranging from instigation
to murder and possession of huge quantities of drugs including
Ecstasy, to fraud of 50 million Rand (9.8 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lourens said that he was initially involved in the supply of
low-key technical equipment for use by military doctors such as a
radio network, high performance motor vehicles and fold-up
rifles.
</P>
<P>
He said it was during this period in about 1985 that he became
aware of experimentation on animals such as chimpanzees and
baboons on a farm near the Roodeplaat Dam outside Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Lourens said later that he was involved in the testing of a
"new generation" tear gas called CR, as opposed to the old variety
called CS. Baboons were placed in clear plastic cages and
exposed to the tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Lourens told the commission that he later formed his own
company called Protechnic, which became involved in developing
weaponry for the SADF.
</P>
<P>
He had a close association with Basson, who he said had lines
of contact with the SADF's Surgeon-General and covert elements
within the SADF.
</P>
<P>
During this time he became aware of the SADF's biological
program, which was headed by Riana Boorman who had been working
on ways of affecting the virility and fertility of animals.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed she was aiming to ultimately use the
technology to manipulate the fertility of people in South Africa
on an ethnic basis.
</P>
<P>
Lourens said that he later met a weapons expert called Phil
Morgan who had developed mechanisms which could be used to propel
poisonous substances.
</P>
<P>
These included rings with secret compartment, walking sticks,
umbrellas, bicycle pumps and screw drivers.
</P>
<P>
He conceded later in the hearing that these were all designed
for use by assassins to kill people in a covert way.
</P>
<P>
Lourens told the hearing that he nearly became a victim of his
own gadget when he had to deliver a poison-bearing screw driver
to a man in England called Trevor.
</P>
<P>
Lourens said that he accidentally got a taste of the poison
while demonstrating the James Bond type gadget to Trevor.
</P>
<P>
He said he lost consciousness but was later told he was lucky
to have survived.
</P>
<P>
Lourens said that he also came across international arms
dealers interested in buying South African chemical weapons
technology. But, he said, nothing came of these deals as far as
he knew.
</P>
<P>
The hearings will continue Tuesday.

consumption and the eradication of supply, the international
community has to act on the basis of mutual confidence,
solidarity and reciprocal and horizontal assistance, with full
respect for domestic law and the principles of international law.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Abacha to Be Buried Monday Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Late Nigerian Head of State General
Sani Abacha who died in the early hour of Monday will be buried
Monday night in northern Kano State where he was born, the
Nigerian TV Authority (NTA) said.
</P>
<P>
Footage of the NTA showed that the remains of Abacha, wrapped
in light blue cloth, was sent aboard a presidential plane and
left the Abuja airport for Kano at about 18:35 p.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
The remains of Abacha left the presidential villa in an
ambulance at about 17:00 p.m. and was accompanied by his wife
Mariam Abacha, other family members, members of the Provisional
Ruling Council (PRC) and the Federal Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
The body of Abacha is expected to be buried late Monday night
according to Islamic customs, NTA said.
</P>
<P>
The death of Abacha was announced at about 17:00 p.m. by the
Chief of Defense Staff, Major-General Abdulsalam Abubakar, after
a meeting of the PRC, the country's highest decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
The official announcement said that Abacha died in sleep,
giving no reason of the death, but unconfirmed report quoted
Western Diplomats in Nigeria as saying that he died of heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
The state TV station said the PRC is expected to reconvene
Monday night at about 23:00 p.m., after the burial. It met from
12:00 p.m. to 17:00 p.m. to discuss the situation after Abacha's
death.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's death has been a kind of shock to Nigerians. He
reportedly met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Sunday and held a
three-hour talk with him.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, 55, took over power from the interim government of
Chief Earnest Shonekan in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to the transition to civil rule program announced by
him in 1995, Abacha is expected to hand over power to an elected
civilian government in October this year.
</P>
<P>
In April, Nigeria's five political parties adopted Abacha as
their sole consensus candidate for the presidential election
scheduled to be held on August 1. But Abacha has been silent on
the issue until his death.
