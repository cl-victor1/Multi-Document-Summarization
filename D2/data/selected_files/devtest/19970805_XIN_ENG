<HEADLINE> Russian League Rejects Match-Fixing Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian officials on Monday
rejected claim of match-fixing in a premier league game last week.
</P>
<P>
"The Expert Council has ruled that the materials in its
possession do not give sufficient grounds for establishing that
the match Zhemchuzhina-Chernomorets was fixed," the council said
in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
The council studied reports by official observers at the July
23 match at Sochi, when the home side Zhemchuzhina won 3-1 over
Chernomorets Novorossiisk, their long-time rivals from further
along the Black Sea coast.
</P>
<P>
Zhemchuzhina coach Arsen Naidyonov had denied the allegations
and accused the soccer elite in Moscow of conspiring against
provincial sides.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales in July Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Auto sales gained steam in
July as General Motors Corp., the leading manufacturer, said its
U.S. sales of cars and light trucks jumped 6.5 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp., the third largest auto maker of the country,
said its July sales declined 9 percent from a record year-earlier
performance but were still the second-best for any July, according
to a report by the Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
Honda Motor Co. reported its best month ever with a 32 percent
surge from last July as its Accord sedan beat Toyota Motor Corp.'s
Camry in sales for the first month in 1997. Toyota said its
monthly sales rose 14.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the results, particularly those of GM, were
stronger than expected, especially coming after a month when GM's
market share fell to an all-time low of 28.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co., the second largest auto maker in the U.S., is
expected to report a slight increase in its July sales tomorrow,

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A two-day g-15 business and
investment forum started here today, in a bid to promote direct
economic cooperation among developing countries,
</P>
<P>
Of the 120 expected businessmen, about 35 from India,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, Brazil, Senegal, Algeria, Argentina
and Zimbabwe are attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Its main objectives are to provide occasion for the business
communities to interact and identify business opportunities in
member countries.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister
Nathan Shamuyarira said businessmen in the g-15 countries should
take the lead in promoting cooperation among countries of the
south.
</P>
<P>
He said governments were there to facilitate the work of the
business people by creating an enabling environment.
</P>
<P>
''At the same time the bottlenecks that hinder trade and
investment among us should be addressed squarely and those
requiring action on the part of our governments brought to our
attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira said the rapid globalization of the world economy
created both opportunities and challenges for developing
economies.
</P>
<P>
He said developing countries needed a stable international
macro-economic framework and enhanced financial resource support
to sustain the competitiveness of their economies.
</P>
<P>
''We hope that the newly established world trade organization,
together with the Bretton Woods institutions, will provide
international trade, financial and monetary systems conducive to
sustained economic growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Bretton Woods institutions mean the World Bank and the
International Fund, etc.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Optimistic About Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are more optimistic
about the country's economy than at any time during the past 10
years, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the Canadians (45 percent) polled believe the
economy will improve during the next year or so, according to an
opinion poll published today.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine percent Canadians feel the economy will remain the
same, while 15 percent feel it will get worse.
</P>
<P>
And the number of people optimistic about the economy has
increased by four percentage points since May, continuing a trend
of economic optimism increase over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The survey results show that Canadians have the highest level
of economic optimism since before the recession hit in the late
1980s, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 72 percent of Canadians think it is
a good or very good time to make a major purchase, compared with
24 percent who think it is a bad time.
</P>
<P>
On regional economies, Alberta residents are the most
confident, while those in British Columbia and Quebec are the
least optimistic.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Angus Reid Group between July 17
and 23, and polled 1,516 Canadian adults. It is considered to be
accurate within 2.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Assess IRA Truce Before Talks With Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain will make a judgement by
the end of this month whether Irish Republican Army (IRA)'s truce
was genuine before deciding to admit its political wing Sinn Fein
to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of this month, I will make a political judgement,
based on all the circumstances in the round, whether or not the
IRA ceasefire is genuine," Northern Ireland Secretary Marjorie
Mowlam told local business leaders in Belfast today.
</P>
<P>
If the truce was genuine, Sinn Fein would be allowed to join
peace talks for the first time in mid-September sponsored by
British and Irish governments, she said.
</P>
<P>
IRA declared a ceasefire which took effect on July 20, paving
the way for Sinn Fein to take part in the substantive peace talks
on the future of the divided province.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed guerrilla group has been fighting for the end of
British rule of Northern Ireland since 1969. About 3,200 people
have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam stressed that all guerrilla groups in Northern Ireland
must disarm.
</P>
<P>
"Decommissioning isn't an arbitrary or unreal issue....We are
committed to the total disarmament of all paramilitary
organizations," she said.
</P>
<P>
The disarm plans were put forward by the British and Irish
governments but opposed by the pro-British Protestant unionists.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said she would press ahead with the establishment of an
international "decommissioning body" to work on the surrender of
guerrilla arms while talks on a political settlement to the
Northern Ireland conflict proceed.
</P>
<P>
The government official also said she would hold talks with
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams in the next two or three days to
discuss the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first meeting between the two since Mowlam took
office in early May. Sinn Fein had been barred from ministerial
talks with Britain, Ireland and the United States until the IRA
called for a ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Down 1.1 percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in the
U.S. declined by 1.1 percent in June, the worst showing in six
months, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that construction spending totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 591.5 billion dollars in the
month, compared with a rate of 597.9 billion dollars in May.
</P>
<P>
The decline of construction spending in the U.S. followed
advances of 0.3 percent in May, which was sharply revised upward
from the initial estimate of a 1.8 percent drop. The spending in
June was the first drop since January and the steepest since a 1.2
percent fall in last December.
</P>
<P>
The weakness in June was led by non-residential, commercial
construction, which fell by 2.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 158.9 billion dollars. Drops in construction of
shopping centers and stores, private schools and colleges and
hospitals offset gains in hotels, offices and factories.
</P>
<P>
But residential spending also fell by 1.2 percent to a rate of
256.4 billion dollars. Single-family spending dropped by 1.1
percent and spending on apartments construction decreased by 7
percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Government construction, meanwhile, rose 0.7 percent to a rate
of 136.7 billion dollars, reflecting increases in spending on
offices, highways and streets and water facilities.

<HEADLINE> European Peace Envoy Critical of Israeli Punitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) peace
envoy Miguel Moratinos blasted today Israel's punitive measures
against the Palestinians taken after last week's suicide
bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after holding talks in Gaza with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, Moratinos said while EU
supported moves that would bring in security for Israel, it
regarded some of the Israeli measures as "illegal, inhuman and
amounting to be collective punishment."
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon, Moratinos traveled to Jerusalem to
hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on ways
to break the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy conveyed to Netanyahu a message from Arafat
who complained about the Israeli punitive measures taken after
the Mahane Yehuda market twin bombings last Wednesday, in
which 15 people were killed and 170 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
To pressure the PNA to crack down on terrorism, Israel
subsequently imposed a total closure on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, canceled the planned resumption of peace talks
and halted the transfer of funds to the PNA. Moreover, over
50,000 Palestinians working in Israel were ordered to go home.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has blasted the measures as Israel's "declaration of
war" against Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Moratinos that Israel was not working against
either Arafat or his authority, but against terrrorism. He
insisted that the PNA should declare war against terrorism and
produce specific results.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Bassiouny, Egypt's Ambassador to Israel, also
condemned Israel's punitive measures against the Palestinians. He
said the peace process should not be stopped, and the war
on terrorism must be fought with the knowledge that peace is
the only thing that can bring stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would
raise the issue during his scheduled talks with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy Tuesday in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli officials continued defending Israel's
hardline policies and tightening the screw on Arafat to crack
down on terrorism. Speaking to the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
argued that the measures taken following the suicide bombings
were not aimed at toppling the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Senior intelligence officers told the committee that Arafat
still refused to order a major crackdown on terror organizations
and their infrastructure, although he is strong enough to do so.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Arafat ordered the arrests of nearly 900
Palestinian extremists following the wave of suicide bombings in
Spring last year. They also charged Arafat for releasing a
number of the arrested extremists, some of whom were even
given jobs in the Palestinian security service.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos' efforts to resume the Israeli-Palestinian talks came
ahead of the arrival at the end of the week of U.S. special peace
envoy Dennis Ross, who is expected to propose new ideas in
breaking the ice and easing the rising tension between the two
sides.

PARIS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- France today deplored the commando
raid launched by Israeli troops against Hezbollah guerrillas last
weekend beyond the Israeli occupied zone in southern Lebanon, and
called for the continuation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The French government, which one knows is attached to the
sovereignty, independence and integrity of territory of Lebanon,
deplores the persistence of the acts of violence and military
action taken by Israeli forces on the Lebanese territory," said
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops, backed by helicopters and combat aircraft,
launched a commando raid five kilometers north of Israel's
self-claimed security zone in southern Lebanon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"In the grave crisis which traverses today the Near East and
which was marked recently by the tragedy of Jerusalem, the efforts
from all are more than ever necessary for averting the worse
temptation and pursuing the search for peace," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>

double bombing attack last Wednesday in a Jewish marketplace in

<HEADLINE> France Asks OAU to Intervene in Comoran Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- France today asked the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) to intervene in the crisis in the Comoros,
where a group of rebels on the island of Anjouan proclaimed the
island independent and asked for re-attachment to France last
week.
</P>
<P>
To the embarrassment of Paris, the rebels paraded with the
pictures of President Jacques Chirac and raised a French flag on a
local government building of Anjouan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels asked France to "hear the cries of distress from the
people of Anjouan" due to what they called economic backwardness
of the island.
</P>
<P>
"If the present difference would continue despite all, the OAU,
which has already played an essential role in the solution of the
Comoran crisis in 1995, should be without doubt appealed to to
intervene to facilitate the search for a political solution," said
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Comoran President Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim announced last week
that he would implement a national development program and
decentralize political and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Anjouan is one of the four islands that make up the Comoran
archipelago, which gained independence from France in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The fourth island of the Comoros, Mayotte, chose to stay under
French sovereignty in a referendum in 1975.
</P>
<P>
French troops intervened several times in the Comoros. The last
occurred in October 1995 when they ended a coup d'etat staged by
French mercenaries led by Bob Denard, who killed Comoran
President Said Mohamed Djohar.
</P>
<P>
France said on Sunday that it is attached to the territorial
integrity of the Comoros and it is for the Comorans to solve their
own problems.
</P>
<P>
France is reducing its troop deployment in Africa and has
maintained distance from the crises in the Central African
Republic and the Congo Republic which took place in the past few
months.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Tries to Upgrade Smaller Military Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The government will make vigorous
efforts to provide sufficient material and financial resources to
a smaller defense force with specialist training in key areas to
enhance Zimbabwe's level of military preparedness.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Moven Mahachi made the remarks at a press
conference here today when he launched this year's Zimbabwe
Defense Forces (ZDF) Community Assistance Week.
</P>
<P>
Now that the rationalization and reduction of the Zimbabwean
army to a manageable figure of 40,000 men and women had been
achieved, he said, ZDF had to ensure that the smaller force was
able to defend the state as effectively and efficiently as a
larger force.
</P>
<P>
He said, "in line with the three year rolling budget, our
equipment and weaponry refurbishment programs will be intensified
to facilitate the mobility and efficacy of our defenses."
</P>
<P>
He added during the past year ZDF participated in other key
sectors of the economy in support of civil society. These
included guarding key and strategic points, assisting in clearing
the water hyacinth in lake Chivero and supporting the department
of national parks and wildlife management in anti-poaching
activities.
</P>
<P>
"Our defense forces will continue to vigorously pursue
programs and projects aimed at supporting government's
development programs and strategies in various sectors of the
economy throughout the country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Chief Plotter in Trade Center Blast Put </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the man
accused of masterminding the World Trade Center bombing on
February 26,1993, which killed six people and injured more than
1,000, is expected to go on trial today in Manhattan, New York
City, according to a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the suspected chief plotter will
stand trial directly for his role in the World trade Center blast
which was described as the worst terrorist attack on American
soil, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in Manhattan court are expected to focus not on the
larger mysteries surrounding the defendant but on providing his
guilt in Trade Center blast. For example, did any country, group
or person--beyond Yousef--sponsor the Trade Center bombing? The
trial is expected to last three or four months.
</P>
<P>
Yousef fled the United States on the night of the Trade Center
blast and was not present at the first trial which ended with the
conviction of four low-level defendants. After Yousef's arrest in
Islamabad, Pakistan, he was extradited to the United States in
february 1995, and was tried in Manhattan court.
</P>
<P>
There are some reports that yousef's trial may come out of any
connection with the incident last week in Brooklyn, New York, in
which two men from Middle East are arrested and accused of
plotting suicide-bomb attacks in subway.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will meet tonight to
discuss the current deadlock of the Middle East peace process, a
senior Jordanian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two leaders was part of the contact
underway to assess the whole situation, said Jordanian Minister
of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh while meeting a visiting
delegation of Israeli lawmakers, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
There was now a dire need for collective efforts to keep
alive the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians,
especially after last week's suicide bombings in Jerusalem, in
which 15 people were killed and 170 others wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bombings took the lives of innocent victims and caused
severe Israeli measures against the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and its people, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
To pressure the PNA to crack down on terrorism, Israel
subsequently imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and canceled the planned resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli legislators arrived here Sunday for talks on means
to reactivate the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stalled for more than four months
since Israel start building the Har Homa settlement in East
Jerusalem in March this year.

<HEADLINE> DPRK to Continue Efforts for New Peace Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) will continue working for the
establishment of a new peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula,
said a Foreign Ministry spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
However, obligations laid out in the 1953 Korean armistice
agreement should be fulfilled until the new mechanism is set up,
the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) quoted the spokesman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was responding to a statement issued by the
foreign ministers meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum in Malaysia,
which said a new peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula was
urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
"We consider that this is similar to our position and is a
relatively correct assessment of the Korean issue," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the new peace mechanism should be
established without fail to avert the recurrence of war and
preserve a lasting peace on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"The DPRK-proposed mechanism involves an institutional device
for control over the military demarcation line and the
demilitarized zone and for the prevention of armed conflict and
accidents," he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Wants US Fed to Increase Short-term Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has recommended that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
should raise short-term interest rates to stave off inflation,
according to The New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that many on IMF's 24-member executive board
"cautioned that undue delay in tightening monetary policy could
undermine the current expansion by increasing the risk that
aggregate demand pressures would build."
</P>
<P>
The IMF said in a statement Monday that these board members
"took the view that a further, moderate and pre-emptive tightening
was necessary to guard against the emergence of inflationary
pressures" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement also praised the U.S. over all for its "skillful
management of economic policies, which has yielded remarkable
results."
</P>
<P>
The IMF statement followed its annual consultation with the
U.S. Treasury Department and other government officials including
U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan.

<HEADLINE> Uzbek Warlord Refuses Release of Taliban Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik today
ruled out the possibility of releasing some prisoners of the
Islamic Taliban militia before a negotiated settlement of the
Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after holding talks with United Nations
Special Envoy to Afghanistan Nobert Holl in Mazar-e-Sharif, about
300 kilometers northwest of Kabul, according to reports monitored
here today.
</P>
<P>
No prisoner could be released before the peaceful political
settlement of the Afghan problem, said Malik, a strongman in the
anti-Taliban northern alliance, based in Mazar-e-Sharif and led
mainly by Malik and Afghanistan's former military chief Ahmad
Masood.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about initiating talks with the Taliban's
leadership in Kabul, Malik said "the northern alliance has always
supported dialogue for the peaceful settlement of the Afghan
problems."
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance has proposed to set up a political
commission for the formation of a broad-based Afghan government in
Kabul. However, the Taliban have insisted that the commission
should include all Afghan factions, small and large, not just the
northern alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have also set the release of their prisoners as a
precondition for entering into meaningful peace talks while the
northern alliance demanded the demilitarization of Kabul before
agreeing to a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Malik briefly sided with the Taliban by allowing them into
northern Afghanistan when he mutinied against former Uzbek warlord
Rashid Dostum in May.
</P>
<P>
However, Malik quickly broke rank with the Islamic militia and
chased them out of Mazar-e-Sharif, leaving some 1,000 Taliban men
including some high-ranking officials captured.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Causes UK Ethnic Minorities' Poor Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Poverty rather than innate
biological differences is the cause of ill health suffered by some
members of Britain's ethnic minorities, according to a report
published today.
</P>
<P>
The report, Health of Britain's Ethnic Minorities, by the
Policy Studies Institute, says that Pakistanis and Bangladeshis
are 50 percent more likely to suffer from ill-health than whites
and that Caribbeans are 30 percent more likely. They are the three
least-healthy ethnic groups in Britain.
</P>
<P>
However, the report points out that those Indians, Africans and
Chinese who are closest to whites in income are as healthy as
whites.
</P>
<P>
Thus why the study, based on interviews with 5,200 people from
ethnic communities and about 2,800 whites, says the reasons for
the poor health suffered by some ethnic minority groups are
socio-economic, including unemployment, poverty and housing.
</P>
<P>
"Poor health is associated with poverty. Some ethnic minority
groups are among the poorest people in Britain and they have the
worst health," said Dr James Nazroo, author of the report.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that differences of health conditions between
ethnic minority groups and whites can not be attributed to
disadvantage experienced in the country of birth, as some
researchers used to believe.
</P>
<P>
This is because those that were born in Britain or who migrated
at an early age were more likely than those who migrated in their
adult or teenage years to have poor health.
</P>
<P>
The report calls for greater efforts to tackle socio-economic
differences and also for the health service to make services
accessible to those with poor English.
</P>
<P>
Some ethnic minority groups "also seem to be receiving poorer
quality health care than whites", says the report. "We need to
develop more culturally sensitive services, better targeted health
promotion, improved language skills for health care professionals
and accessible translation facilities."

<HEADLINE> Machine-building Industry Reports Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China's machine-building industry
in the January-June period registered a total output worth 247.9
billion yuan, or a year-on-year rise of 9.6 percent, the Ministry
of Machine-building Industry (MMI) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate is 3.1 percentage points higher than the
industrial output value growth posted by the country's state-owned
enterprises, said one official from MMI.
</P>
<P>
The added value of the industry totaled 62.22 billion yuan in
the period, up 6.7 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The production/sales ratio improved each month, rising from
91.8 percent in the beginning of the year to 95.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic returns has also improved, reversing the losses
suffered by a majority of machine-building enterprises before
March. Some large enterprises, including the Shanghai Automotive
Industry Corporation, the Tianjin Automotive Industry Corporation,
the Chunlan Group and the Qingling Group, contributed to the
profit rebound.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicated that the industry made profits totaling
4.35 billion yuan, "almost the same as that of 4.37 billion yuan
in the same period last year," said the official. Of the ten
sub-sectors of the industry, agricultural machinery, instruments,
general-purpose machinery for petrochemical industry and
automobile each earned more than 100 million yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
The export of machinery products also witnessed steady growth,
with batteries and generators, mining machines, single-cylinder
diesel engines, wire and cables, valves, and hoisting jacks all
posting an increase of more than 30 percent in the export value.
</P>
<P>
Experts with MMI predicted that the industry will generate
about 45 billion yuan in industrial output value each month in the
second half. "The industry is expected to post a total industrial
output value of 510 billion yuan this year, or an increase of 10
percent from last year," said one expert.

<HEADLINE> Anti-China Move Unpopular (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Last Saturday's edition of
People's Daily carried an article criticizing a recent US State
Department report wantonly attacking China's policies on religion.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, the report was laced with
presumptuous comments on religious situations in dozens of
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The US media, which has a history of flagrantly attacking
China's religious environment, has continuously resorted to
fabricating and distorting facts in order to cite yet another
round of anti-China sentiment, the article said.
</P>
<P>
These facts alone show that some members of the US government
and media flaunt the banner of human rights and attempt to use
religious issues as a pretext for interfering in China's internal
affairs, it said.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that these people accused China of "curbing
religious activities, and depriving Chinese people of their right
to religious freedom". In fact, the article said, the Chinese
Constitution clearly stipulates that citizens of the People's
Republic of China have the freedom to believe or disbelieve in
religion, and government bodies, social organizations and
individuals are prohibited from interfering in the citizens'
right, or from engaging in any form of related discrimination.
</P>
<P>
China has extensively implemented policies on religious freedom
since implementation of the reform and opening policies in 1978,
policies on religious freedom have been well implemented, with
normal religious activities fully protected by law, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, China is currently home to over
85,000 venues for different religious sects, more than 3,000
religious organizations, 74 related education institutions, and
more than 100 million religious followers.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that those who respect fact cannot help but draw
the conclusion that the Chinese people have full freedom of
religion.

<P>
The article went on to denounce the irrational attack on the
regulation requiring the registration of religious venues. It is a
common practice in most countries that Social organizations
sponsoring religious activities are required to register according
to law, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government issued its regulations on the
administration of religious sites in 1994. The regulations are
designed to protect the legal rights of religious organizations
and religious venues, and to protect the rights of religious
practitioners to carry out their duties, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Some Western people also accused China of persecuting religious
personages. In fact, however, the Chinese Constitution guarantees
the equal rights and obligations of all Chinese citizens. Anyone
found in violation of the guarantees faces prosecution according
to law, it said.
</P>
<P>
The article emphasizes that no one will be detained or
imprisoned for one's religious belief or for taking part in normal
religious activities. Chinese Criminal Law, in fact, stipulates
that staff of government bodies who deprive citizens of their
freedom in religious belief face a maximum sentence of up to two
years in prison, or otherwise face criminal detention for periods
lasting from 15 days to six months, it said.
</P>
<P>
The article said that China will spare no effort in cracking
down on those engaged in illegal activities while flaunting the
banner of religion.
</P>
<P>
Various religious cults have emerged in some parts in China in
recent years, the article said, adding that leader of the cults
have proceeded under the guise of religion to spread heretical
ideas, engage in swindling and seduce women. Punishing these cult
leaders according to law is to protects the legal rights of the
Chinese citizens and benefits society, the article stressed.
</P>
<P>
No country in the world tolerates criminal activities under the
guise of religion, it said, adding that if US government actions
against the Branch Davidians and Japanese actions against Aum
Shinrikyo were regarded as reasonable, why then should China's
efforts to ban religious cults be classified as the "persecution
of religious personages. (2)

<P>
The aforementioned sources also said that religious believers
in China do not enjoy equal political rights. The fact is,
however, all people enjoy the same political rights regardless of
their religious beliefs, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that some 17,000 members of religious
circles serve as deputies to people's congresses and members of
political consultative conferences of all levels.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the article admitted that China still has a lot to
do in fully implementing the policies on freedom of religious
belief.
</P>
<P>
"However, the undeniable fact is that China has maintained a
stable and harmonious religious environment in a world constantly
witnessing ethnic confrontations and religious conflicts. This
alone proves that China has seriously and effectively pursued
policies on religious freedom," it said.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that it was far from a coincidence that
the anti-China current based on religion originated in the United
States at a time when Sino-US relations are showing signs of
improvement, and high-level bilateral contacts and dialogue have
yielded or will soon yield positive results. The people of both
countries welcome improvements, it said.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that anti-China forces have attempted
to derail Sino-US ties, and used the Taiwan issue, as well as
issues related to trade, Hong Kong, human rights, and "political
contributions" to throw mud at China and force the US government
to change its policies toward the country. Religion has been added
to the list as yet another means of defamation.
</P>
<P>
The article urged the US government to help promote the healthy
and steady growth of Sino-US relations.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Freezes Aid for Croatian Town Expelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The German government today said
that it would block the reconstruction aid for the Croatian town
of Jajce in response to its expulsion on Monday of 500 returning
Moslem refugees.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has just approved the one-million-mark funds for Jajce a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel described the incident in
Jajce as a "slap in the face" for all parties interested in peace
and reconciliation, adding that he would propose other donor
countries to consider suspending their aid for the Croatian town.
</P>
<P>
The alleged involvement of Bosnian Croat officials and police
in Jajce in the expulsion of Moslem refugees was especially
alarming, Kinkel noted.
</P>
<P>
Recently, donor countries have decided not to provide further
reconstruction aid to towns and regions in Bosnia which do not
observe the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most western countries have now suspended contact
with Bosnian ambassadors after the Bosnian government failed to
agree on the distribution of ambassadorial posts among its ethnic
groups.

<HEADLINE> PLA Vows to Carry Out Historic Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army,
China's armed forces, and armed police troops have pledged to
uphold Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and effectively carry out their historic mission.
</P>
<P>
They made the pledge in response to President Jiang Zemin's
speech at a rally to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, senior officers of leading PLA
departments have earnestly studied President Jiang Zemin's
important speech. They agreed that the speech, while summing up
PLA's fine traditions and development experiences, spelled out
the sacred missions and glorious tasks PLA faces during the
cross-century period.
</P>
<P>
The speech serves as another guideline formulated by the third
generation of the collective leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party for PLA's reform and building.
</P>
<P>
The officers vowed to study the speech conscientiously to make
sure that instructions and orders of President Jiang Zemin and the
Central Military Commission are implemented to the letter.
</P>
<P>
Officers and soldiers of PLA troops expressed the view that it
is of paramount importance to uphold the principle of Party's
absolute leadership over the army, and this is the essence of
President Jiang Zemin's speech.
</P>
<P>
They noted that under new historic conditions, it is
imperative to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and
unswervingly adhere to the Party's basic line.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to resolutely safeguard the authority of the
Party Central Committee and the Central Party Military Commission
headed by Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The current priority is to enhance the army's overall quality,
especially the combat capability in modern warfares featuring high
technology, so that PLA will provide a safe environment for
China's modernization drive, they pointed out.

<HEADLINE> China's EximBank to Increase Financial Backing for Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of
China (EximBank) will increase its policy-oriented financial
support for the country's exports of machinery and electronic
products, a senior bank official said today.
</P>
<P>
"We will help make China's machinery and electronic products
more competitive on the international market by providing more
financial backing to exporters," Gu Mingchao, vice governor of the
EXimBank, said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that for the first time in 1995,
machinery and electronic products replaced clothing and textiles
as China's No.1 export item.
</P>
<P>
Last year exports of machinery and such products shot up 9.9
percent to 48.2 billion US dollars, 32 percent of the country's
total exports.
</P>
<P>
However, complete sets of equipment and high-tech products with
a high added value accounted for merely ten percent of China's
machinery and electronics exports in 1996, as against more than 40
percent in the developed countries and in some emerging industrial
countries.
</P>
<P>
The financial support of the EximBank, such as offering
importers with preferential policies like delayed payment, will
make Chinese exporters of machinery and electronics more
competitive worldwide, Gu said.
</P>
<P>
The EximBank, one of China's three policy-oriented banks, was
founded in April, 1994 to finance Chinese exports of capital goods
such as machinery and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Bank record shows that the EximBank has to date approved 27.2
billion yuan and 674.8 million US dollars in export seller's
credits and signed agreements for nearly 200 million US dollars in
export buyer's credits, in support of the export of complete sets
of equipment, vessels and aircraft worth more than nine billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EximBank has also handled 231 export credit
insurance deals valued at 930 million US dollars and provided
guarantees for 111 deals, with the guaranteed value totaling 960
million US dollars.

Bank statistics show that the CCB's general deposits, excluding
those in foreign exchange, soared 30 percent in the first six
months of the year to more than 1.2 trillion yuan at the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
The CCB's loans, which had reached 951.7 billion yuan by the
end of June, have provided a firm backing for many key upgrading
projects in infrastructure, especially for those in energy,
transportation, petrochemicals and building material, the news

<HEADLINE> Rules on Marriages by Chinese Abroad Promulgated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Civil Affairs and
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have jointly promulgated Rules on
the Management of Marriage Registrations by Chinese Staying in
Foreign Countries.
</P>
<P>
The Rules apply to Chinese citizens who have stayed in other
countries for more than six months but have not obtained permanent
residency, in order to protect their legitimate rights and
interests.
</P>
<P>
The Rules state that civil affairs offices above county level
designated by Chinese provincial civil affairs departments or
Chinese embassies and consulates in other countries will accept
marriage applications from such Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
In case a foreign country where Chinese citizens reside does
not recognize their marriage registrations handled with a Chinese
embassy, the Chinese citizens can return to China to handle such
applications or just apply to governmental offices of the foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
However, those marriage registrations recognized by foreign
governments are subject to China's Marriage Law.
</P>
<P>
The rules also stipulate the procedures for marriage or
divorce applications, the handling of family properties and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
While applying for marriages, those who stayed abroad for more
than six months but now have returned to China, should provide
valid proof for their marriage status during their stay abroad.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the rules state that servicemen of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army, police officers and others who have
knowledge of top State secrets may not apply for marriages with
offices of foreign countries where they live or with Chinese
embassies and consulates in foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Purchase Russian Fighters, Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia today decided to
purchase 12 Sukhoi-30k (Su-30k) jet fighters and eight
multi-purpose MI-17-IV helicopters from Russia to boost the
equipment of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for National Development Planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said no agreement on the final price of the warplanes
has been reached yet.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense and Security and the Armed Forces will
negotiate with Russia on the price, terms of payment, transfer of
technology, a counter-purchase scheme, the date of delivery, spare
parts and after-sales service, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the acquisition of the fighters and choppers will
be made under a counter-purchase scheme, in which Indonesia will
pay the military equipment in cash and Russia will later import
rubber, coffee and crude palm oil from Indonesia, also with hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia in June canceled its plan to purchase nine F-16
fighters from the United States citing "wholly unjustified
criticism" in the U.S. Congress against Indonesia's human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
After the cancellation, Indonesia sent teams to Russia, France
and Sweden to look for other fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
A joint team which studied the performance of the jet fighters
has drawn up a set of criteria to decide on what kind of warplanes
Indonesia will purchase. The team decided that the new jet fighter
should match the performance of the F-16.
</P>
<P>
The Su-30k can fly 3,000 kilometers without refueling and carry
a payload of eight tons of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the MI-17-IV was chosen to meet the Indonesian
army's requirements.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has not depended on a single source of military
equipment. It also operates the Kawk-200/100 bought from Britain,
Namad planes from Australia and two submarines from Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 500 generals will lose
their jobs in the Russian armed forces as part of the country's
sweeping military reforms announced last month, Russia's Chief of
General Staff Anatoly Kvashnin said today.
</P>
<P>
The average age of the Russian army is the highest in the world
and there are too many senior officers, such as generals and
colonels, but not enough junior officers, he told a meeting of the
educational departments of Russian defense and law enforcement
agencies today.
</P>
<P>
Kvashnin said intensive training courses were now being
organized to increase the number of junior officers, including
lieutenants and captains.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin last month announced his
decision to cut the size of the armed forces to 1.2 million by the
end of 1998 as part of his military reform plan.
</P>
<P>
There are over 3 million people in the Russian armed forces, of
which some 1.8 million are servicemen and about 1.2 million
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in military personnel to 1.2 million will be
phased in over three years, Kvashnin said.
</P>
<P>
He didn't see any "serious difficulties" in carrying out the
reforms.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Spend Half Billion Marks on Flood Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The German government will provide
500 million marks (some 270 million U.S. dollars) to help repair
the damage caused by recent floods in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, will also remain in the
flooded area along the Oder River to help clean up the region
after the water recedes, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said today at a parliamentary
meeting on the floods.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few weeks, the Bundeswehr has sent 30,000
soldiers and 2,000 vehicles and machines to the swollen Oder River
on the German-Polish border to consolidate dikes and help prepare
8 million sandbags.
</P>
<P>
Today's press reports said that for the first time in 19 days,
no new weak points have developed in the dikes overnight.
</P>
<P>
The threat of massive flooding in eastern Germany eased late
Saturday when the water level of the Oder River began to
recede. But reports warned that it is still one meter above the
danger line.
</P>
<P>
Reports said water levels, in the most optimistic scenario,
would return to normal on Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
Flooding has destroyed thousands of homes and caused 105 deaths
in Poland and the Czech Republic. Germany has escaped the worst of
the disaster with only several villages flooded and no casualties
reported.

<HEADLINE> Development of Large Automakers Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The development of large auto
manufacturing groups, particularly those with an annual one
million unit production capacity. is essential to the
international competitiveness of China's auto industry.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Xiaoyu, director of Department of Automotive
Industry under the Ministry of Machine-building Industry,
"Thirteen automakers produced 80 percent of 51 million automobiles
manufactured worldwide during 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The development of large auto manufacturing groups is in line
with the Chinese government's auto industry development policy,"
said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the First Auto Works Corp. (FAW), Dongfeng Motors
Corp. and Shanghai Auto Industry Corp. (SAIC) were slated to
become the country's first auto manufacturers with a one million
unit annual production capacity.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the three enterprises should attempt to
reach their goals by optimizing product mix, making full use of
existing facilities and constructing more plants.
</P>
<P>
The initial goal of Guidelines for China's Auto Industry
between 2000-2010 is to form as many as three auto manufacture
groups with an annual production capacity of 400,000 units each.
</P>
<P>
FAW, China's largest automaker, will strive to produce one
million units and earn 10 billion US dollars annually by the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
FAW, SAIC and Dongfeng produced 250,000, 200,000 and 140,000
vehicles respectively in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China is home to 100-odd auto manufacturing plants which
produced a mere 1.5 million units in 1996.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Cases Seen to Rise in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of HIV/AIDS cases is
expected to rise sharply in the Philippines with about 30,000
Filipinos likely to get infected with HIV virus in 1997, a senior
health official predicted today.
</P>
<P>
The number of HIV-infected people will increase to 50,000 this
year, Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica was quoted as saying by
the official Philippine News Agency. But she stressed that the
figure is still low among Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government will continue its all-out efforts to
prevent and control the infection of the HIV, she said, adding
that the main strategies for the prevention and control of the
HIV/AIDS infection are education and surveillance.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities have so far set up eight sentinel sites
in big urban areas in the country which do active surveillance,
Reodica said.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department has already trained front line health
workers in clinical care and management, counseling and laboratory
services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reodica said works are also being done with the
Department of Education for the inclusion of AIDS education in the
curriculum to start in elementary.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are a total of 916 confirmed cases of HIV/AIDS
in the country including 14 children.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today created the National Coordinating Council for Sugar (NCCS)
in order to save the country's ailing sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
The new body, which will be chaired by Agriculture Secretary
Salvador Escudero, will replace the Advisory Council on Sugar to
make the sugar industry globally competitive, according to a press
release from the Presidential Press Office.
</P>
<P>
Escudero told reporters that the newly created council "is much
more powerful than the advisory body."
</P>
<P>
The local sugar industry has been plunged into a crisis since
early this year because of an over-importation of cheap sugar
which caused local sugar prices to dive.
</P>
<P>
Because of the nose-diving sugar prices, many sugar cane
producers and millers have suffered huge economic losses. Sugar
industry leaders have warned that the industry will collapse if it
can not be upgraded to be competitive.

<TEXT>
<P>
China has laid a solid economic foundation for further
development in the next century, and the global environment of
peace and development has provided the opportunity for an even
greater economic upsurge.
</P>
<P>
"Our greatest challenges center on garnering greater resolution
to reform outmoded structures, and boldly introducing new
strategies to carry out the opening policy in order to ensure
further development and the continuance of the prevailing good
situation," said Ban.
</P>
<P>
China's reform has entered a critical period in which various
other elements enjoy rapid development, and the state-owned
economy continues to face difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"This has led some people to question whether a series of
profound reforms have strengthened or weakened public ownership,"
said Ban.
</P>
<P>
Other people have asked if further opening to the outside world
and the increasing influx of foreign investment will harm the
nation's sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
According to Ban, "The most powerful weapon for dispelling
doubts is to help people understand the basic situation in China
and the theory of the "primary stage of socialism."
</P>
<P>
"We should adhere to what Jiang Zemin said that we must depart
from the basic national situation, and make every effort to find
new forms of public ownership which can effectively promote the
development of productive forces," Ban said, adding that new forms
of organizations and management methods can be boldly applied so
long as they reflect the laws of social mass production.
</P>
<P>
Ban stressed: "Boldly applying and learning is the only way to
gradually standardize and ensure continued improvement."

<P>
"China has overcome previous deficiencies and currently leads
the world in the production of important materials such as iron,
steel, coal and power generation," according to Ban.
</P>
<P>
However, the author conceded imbalances in China's economic
development, and noted underdeveloped economies and certain levels
of poverty in certain parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The obvious income gap between the very few rich and the
majority of the population coexists with advanced science and
technology and the country's extremely primitive mode of
production.
</P>
<P>
"The country has a limited number of skilled personnel with a
command of high science and technology, and close to 25 percent of
the total population is either illiterate or semi-illiterate,"
said Ban.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee will address related problems by
concentrating efforts on economic construction, and carrying out
the principle of "one focus, two basic points." One focus refers
to "focusing on economic construction. Two basic points refer to
"adherence to the four cardinal principles and adherence to reform
and opening to the outside world".
</P>
<P>
The Party will continue to stress the said principle for the
next 100 years. The Party's goal is to propagate highly productive
forces needed to build a socialist market economy combined with
effective mechanisms of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of stocks and bonds has enhanced the vitality
of the enterprise, capital, technology and labor markets, and have
in turn led to the emergence of the shareholding, auction, lease
and contract systems.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the past 12-odd years show that China has ranked
as a world leader in terms of economic development. While in the
primary stage of socialism, China has recorded a higher period
growth rate than other countries.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China offers labor advantages, while the
United States offers advantages in terms of natural resources,
capital and technology.
</P>
<P>
According to Ban, "China's inferiorities far outweigh its
superiorities in terms of competitive forces when compared to
developed countries."

<P>
Editor's Note: China has recorded notable progress in reform
and opening since the end of the 14th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) in October 1992. Xinhua will mark
the opening of the 15th CPC National Congress with a series of
articles outlining the monumental success the third generation
leadership of the CPC Central Committee under the leadership of
Jiang Zemin has achieved in carrying out Deng Xiaoping's theory
for building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Today's edition of People's Daily
carried an article in which Ban Minli said that China is in the
primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
The article -- "The Basic National Situation; Primary Stage of
Socialism" -- asserts that China is still in the primary stage of
socialism, the "golden key which has inspired the Chinese people
to create a succession of monumental achievements over the past
two decades".
</P>
<P>
The article cited Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin's
continued assertions that China is in the primary stage of
socialism and will remain in that period for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
Ban pointed out that it has taken some 30 years for the Chinese
people to gain a clear understanding of the actual situation
facing the country, and that the aforementioned "primary stage of
socialism" refers to a stage of underdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
According to Ban: "Realistically speaking, China's productivity
is relatively low and the commodity economy in the country remains
underdeveloped." He added that "it will take at least 100 years
for a large country like China to become a developed country."
</P>
<P>
Ban also noted that poverty is not a characteristic of
socialism, and that the development of productive forces should be
the sole criterion for judging success in building socialism.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese people, from members of the central leadership to
ordinary citizens, must work diligently to achieve the ultimate
goal of developing production, creating wealth and improving the
living standard of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
China's total state-owned assets have doubled every five years
over the past two decades. China has emerged as a major
participant of the international trade, and as one of the world's
leading developing countries in terms of attracting foreign
investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today
promulgated regulations on funeral management, in a move to
encourage cremation and thrifty funeral arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"The Regulations are designed to greatly encourage cremation,
reduce burials, save land for cemeteries and discourage bad
funeral habits," Yang Yanyin, vice-minister of Civil Affairs, told
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people traditionally thought that the dead are tranquil
only after being buried. However, the funeral customs of Chinese
have changed since the founding of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
About 36 percent of the dead in China were cremated in 1996,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the standards for funeral management and services
have improved, she said.
</P>
<P>
She also pointed out that new regulations governing funeral
management need to be formulated because of new problems that have
cropped up in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The problems include unauthorized construction of cemeteries,
lavish funeral arrangements and superstitious funeral activities.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also stipulate the need to respect funeral
customs of ethnic groups.

<P>
"I prefer a stadium full of sports fans rather than soldiers, "
Savramis said, hinting at the practice adopted for boosting attendance
at the second world championships in Rome in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Savramis added that he had proposed to the IAAF president a change
in the dates for the meet, arguing that most people in the Athens
conurbation are away on holiday during the first 10 days of August.
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo told press yesterday:"There had maybe not been a great
campaign of promotion, and maybe because it was Saturday, poeople in
Athens go to the sea. I hope for the next few days that they will not
go to the sea. They have the sea all year. They can forget the sea for
one week."
</P>
<P>
The 80,000-seat Olympic stadium looked nearly empty on last
Saturday, the first day of the 9-day competition. But the attendance
was markedly up on Sunday night and last night, estimated at more than
35,000.

<HEADLINE> EU Warns U.S. Over Telecoms Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
warned the United States that its draft rules for implementing a
new global pact to free up the world telecommunications market
would breach World Trade Organization rules.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it had requested the U.S. reconsider its plans to
maintain the right to deny telecoms licenses under so-called
"public interest" reasons, which covered a range of factors such
as foreign policy, trade concerns and "very high risk to
competition."
</P>
<P>
The EU said such a rule, covering the issuing of satellite
licenses to foreign companies, meant the U.S. risked violating its
world trading obligations under the WTO Basic Telecoms deal
reached in February this year and which will go into effect on
January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The draft rule, aimed at implementing some of the commitments
made by the U.S. under the Basic Telecoms deal, was published on
June 4.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the EU went to Washington 10 days ago to
discuss the issue with U.S. officials. But in a statement today,
the EU warned that if the U.S. doesn't reconsider its draft plans,
it reserves the right to challenge the WTO deal.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- India and China have agreed to
further strengthen and develop the friendly cooperative
relationship between them.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached here today when Indian Prime Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral met visiting Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
Tang arrived here on Sunday to attend the 10th round of meeting
of the Sino-Indian Joint Working Group on Border Issues and vice
ministerial-level consultations between the two countries.

<P>
Gujral, who is also minister of external affairs, expressed the
belief that the friendly cooperative relations between India and
China will be further strengthened and developed through joint
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that during Jiang's visit to India last year, leaders
of both countries agreed to build a 21st-century-oriented,
constructive and cooperative partnership, which laid down the
guidelines for the development of Sino-Indian relations.
</P>
<P>
The further improvement and development of Sino-Indian
relations are not only beneficial to the peoples of both countries
but also conducive to peace and stability in Asia and the world as
a whole, Tang added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday and this morning, Tang held talks with Indian Foreign
Secretary K. Raghunath. The two sides reviewed the progress in the
implementation of an agreement on confidence building along border

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Exercising a harsh new economic weapon against the
Palestinian leadership, the Israeli government has suspended
reimbursement of taxes and other fees that it owes to the
Palestinian Authority. The money accounts for nearly two-thirds of
the authority's annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced that as of January
1, his government will redenominate the ruble by a factor of
1000. The move was meant to counter a symbol of inflation, which
has led to the current exchange rate of 6000 rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- With the blessing of the U.S. government, a Russian air
force plane has charted a new area of cooperation by flying from
Washington to Ohio to Florida taking photos of U.S. military
facilities. The five-day mission was a training exercise in
preparation for implementation of 1992 Open Skies treaty signed by
27 nations.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. raised the prospect of renewed economic sanctions
and other punitive measures against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia
unless President Slobodan Milosevic takes steps to hand over
prominent war crimes suspects and ensure Bosnian Serb compliance
with the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. joined six other Western nations in suspending
contacts with the Bosnian federation to force agreement on a plan
to distribute ambassadorial posts among Muslim, Croat and Serb
factions. Washington is also sending the architect of the Dayton
peace accord to the region in a fresh effort to secure compliance
with the pact.
</P>
<P>
-- Southeast Asia seems still on track to grow despite currency
slide. But it can no longer afford easy foreign capital, fixed
exchange rates.

ATHENS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Colin Jackson of
Britain surprised all his rivals by clocking his best time of the year
in the men's 110-meter hurdles first heat at the 6th World Athletics
Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion sent a warning to his opponents that he

title.
</P>
<P>
He clocked 13.19 seconds, the fastest ever time in a world
championships first round heat, the fourth fastest of 1997. The
previous fastest first round heat was also done by Jackson, 13.20 in
Rome in 1987.
</P>
<P>
In today's heat, Olympic silver medallist Masrk Crear of the United
States was 13.46 behind Jackson. Allen Johnson of the United States,
Olympic champion and the world title holder, clocked 13.62 in his
heat. Johnson is the most dangerous threat to Jackson in the final.
</P>
<P>
Jackson pulled out of the previous championships and had kept very
weak before the meet.

ATHENS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Ellina Zvereva of
Belarus looked sharp in the women's discus when she heaved the longest
throw of the qualifying round at the 6th World Athletics Championships
here today.
</P>
<P>
She hit her season's best with her third toss, landing the plate at
65.94 meters.
</P>
<P>
However, many other big names met troubles. The year's world leader
Beatrice Faumuina of New Zealand was under pressure after making two
fouls, but on the third throw she reached 64.58, good enough to keep
her hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
German Franka Dietzsch, the year's fourth best, made three fouls
and toppled out of final. Also eliminated without a mark was Norwegian
Mette Bergman, bronze medallist at the 1994 European Championships.
</P>
<P>
China's Xiao Yanling, Asian record holder and fifth at last year's

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Rate Remains Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Inflation rate of the Philippines
in July remained at the previous month's level of 4.8 percent
despite the continued depreciation of the peso and higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Data released today by the National Statistics Office also
showed that the average inflation rate for the first seven months
of the year was 4.6 percent, still within the 6 percent to 6.5
percent target for 1997 set by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank earlier projected a 6 percent rate
for the month due to the 10 percent depreciation of the peso
against the U.S. dollar and the 0.22 peso average increase in the
prices of oil products.
</P>
<P>
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said last
month's figure proved the government is well on track with its
macroeconomic projections.
</P>
<P>
Habito said there is no reason to revise these targets,
particularly on inflation and Gross National Product, because
these are "still within range."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the impact of the peso depreciation in the
inflation needs not to be substantial because the Philippines is
not only dealing with countries using the dollar currency.
</P>
<P>
Former Budget Undersecretary Benjamin Diokno said the impact
will be felt much later probably starting this month until
October.
</P>
<P>
He said the oil price adjustment which took effect on August 1
can trigger an upward swing in prices particularly of power and
transportation rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- An Arab League's emergency meeting
being held here today blast with fury the harsh measures taken by
the Israeli government against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting was called at the request of Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat to discuss
Israel's "collective punishment" inflicted upon Palestinians
following last week's bombing attacks in Jerusalem and unified
Arab stand towards it.
</P>
<P>
PNA delegate to the Arab League Mohamed Sobeih said Israel's
measures are considered "a clear call for all forms of violence."
</P>
<P>
He made an appeal to the Arab governments to lend support to
the Palestinian people to fight the Israeli crackdown in the West
Bank and Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Ambassador to Cairo Eissa Darwish urged the United
Nations Security Council and co-sponsors of the Mideast peace
process to take a clear stance to halt such measures that violate
international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Darwish said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
measures have left no room for compromise and called upon the
Arabs to halt negotiations and contacts with Israel until the
peace drive restores its terms of reference.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Ambassador Nabil Nejm, speaking on the sidelines of the
meeting, called for a unified Arab stance in facing "Zionist
intransigence and the unlimited support of Israel by the United
States regarding Arab issues of destiny."
</P>
<P>
Moroccan delegate said the PNA should not be blamed for the
terrorist acts by anti-peace process elements. "Frustration over
Israel's arbitrary practices against the unarmed Palestinian
people is the momentum behind the latest violence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Following the July 30 attack that took 15 lives, Israel imposed
tight travel restrictions on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, halted
the transfer of tax revenues to the PNA and suspended peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Early today, Israel arrested 11 Palestinians suspected of
"hostile terrorist activity" bringing to 156 the number detained
by Israel since the bombing in a strike against Islamic
militants.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Treasurer Peter Costello said
today that he expected unemployment rate to fall to about 8
percent by the end of the current financial year ending June 30,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after today's special cabinet meeting on employment,
Costello said employment opportunities would improve as the
economy picked up.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard was not at the meeting, as he has
been out of work for more than 10 days and is still recovering
from pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
Costello told reporters that "we expect over the course of this
year unemployment to fall and I expect at the end of this
financial year we'll see it at around or a little below the eight
percent mark."
</P>
<P>
According to latest figures issued by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics, unemployment rate reached 8.5 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister Amanda Vanstone conceded earlier that
unexpected parliament delays had forced the government to push
back its timetable for employment service reforms to March next
year.
</P>
<P>
She said the government was determined to ensure employment
services were better able to meet the needs of jobseekers.
</P>
<P>
"We have allocated six billion Australian dollars (4.5 billion
US dollars) for employment assistance programs over the next four
years to give unemployed Australians a better chance to get into
real jobs," she added.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today urged the economic sector in the country to make its
products successful in the free trade era.
</P>
<P>
The president warned that if it fails in the free competition,
Indonesia will become a marketplace for foreign products, and this
would chock up the country's development program and cause it to
lag behind.
</P>
<P>
But if Indonesia succeeds, its products will be able to compete
in the Southeast Asian as well as the Asia-Pacific regions, he
said during a ceremony marking the turnover of books on national
and regional manpower planning at the Bina Graha Presidential
Office here.
</P>
<P>
"Such an achievement will boost the country's industrial and
agricultural development," he said, adding that this in turn will
improve the people's welfare.
</P>
<P>
There is no other way but to improve the performance of the
country's economic forces, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also noted that the nation should increase and improve
the quality of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
"Only with qualified manpower could the nation be more
efficient," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Development has created more jobs and raised the people's
income. The family planning program has also lowered population
growth," he said, noting however that the number of unemployed
people remains high.
</P>
<P>
All these problems, he said, have to be seriously handled to
avoid social, economic and political unrest.

<HEADLINE> EU to Suspend Contact With Bosnian Ambassadors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today called
its member states to suspend contacts with ambassadors from
Bosnia-Herzegovina in protest of its non-respect of the deadline
concerning the nomination of its ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was proposed by EU High Representative for
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Carlos Westendorp, said an EU press release
received here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries were recommended to immediately suspend
contacts with Bosnian ambassadors not only in their own countries
but in third countries as well.
</P>
<P>
The suspension does not imply a suspension of all diplomatic
relations nor does it apply to other members of the diplomatic
corp of Bosnia, the press release clarified.
</P>
<P>
It was declared last May at Sintra that Bosnia was given a
deadline for nominating by common agreement ambassadors
representing the former Yugoslav republic.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Steps Up Establishment of Patent Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is stepping up its
efforts to create a patent search and examination center in the
country.
</P>
<P>
After such a center is well established, Thailand need not to
send papers to foreign countries which have patent databases to
check whether previous registrations exist, according to Banphot
Hongthong, head of the Intellectual Property Department of the
Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
This will speed up the processing and approval of patent
applications filed in Thailand because it will greatly shorten the
long patent search and examination time, Banphot was quoted as
saying by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, some 15 million to 16 million patent files will be in
the database of the Intellectual Property Department of the
Commerce Ministry, Banphot said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 20,000 active trademarks and 10,000
other patents registered with the department and the number is
growing by 20 percent each year, the official said.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Urged to Provide Credible Data on Its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Commission of the
Angolan Peace Process today urged the opposition UNITA to
implement a United Nations Security Council resolution which
calls for UNITA to provide credible data on its soldiers and
arms.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a communique signed by Blondin Beye,
the UN special representative based in Angola, that the National
Union for the Total Inpendence of Angola has not taken a bigger
step in observing the UN resolution.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the joint commission was concerned
because the data provided by UNITA of its military personnel and
weapons lacked credibility and transparency.
</P>
<P>
Under the UN resolution No. 1118 approved recently, the UNITA
is requested to provide information about the number of its
soldiers, arms and ammunition in and outside Angola, and pledge
to carry out outstanding tasks stipulated by the Lusaka Peace
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the present critical situation, the joint
commission appealed to the UNITA to take positive measures to
provide data as the UN requested for the UN Observers Mission
based in Angola to check.

WELLINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Swede Kenneth Eriksson won the
New Zealand rally after heralded Carlos Sainz of Spain ran into a
sheep at 110 miles an hour on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sainz started the final day eight seconds behind Eriksson and
was chasing for the lead in the opening stage when he took his
Ford Escort over a crest and into the sheep, standing in the
center of the road.
</P>
<P>
The accident slipped Sainz back to 34 seconds behind and although
he won the last five stages Eriksson managed a 13 second victory for
the Subaru team.
</P>
<P>
Sainz dropped to third behind team-mate Juha Kankkunen after
the accident but as the two Ford drivers both went flat-out in
pursuit of Eriksson, Sainz grabbed second back by six seconds.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Urged to Guarantee Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Local commercial bankers are
urging the government to set up a deposit insurance institution as
a measure to stabilize the country's troubled financial sector,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Deposits are being withdrawn from finance companies although
the government has moved to bail out financial institutions, said
Som Jatrusipitak, president of Siam City Bank.
</P>
<P>
As of June this year, more than 128 billion baht (5.12 billion
US dollars) had been withdrawn from local finance firms, thus
making both foreign and local creditors reluctant to extend credit
lines to them, Som said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a deposit insurance institution would help
restore confidence of the public, the banker noted.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank reportedly has agreed in principle to set
up such an institution, but stressed it needs one year to study
the matter.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Transportation Sector (3) Eds: rpt. for a correction in 1st and 2nd para. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the premier, a national grade-one single-track
railway line may handle about 15 million tons of cargos a year in
terms of passing-through capacity; if it is a double-track line
with automatic blocking devices, the figure may reach 60 million
tons or more.
</P>
<P>
He noted that electrification may help improve the
passing-through capacity. Technical upgrading of old railway lines
is considered an important way of increasing transport capacity.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve bulk cargo transport and regional economic
development, he said, a number of new railway lines will be built
during the Ninth Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
These include the Shenmu-Huangye Railway for shipping coal out
of the northwest; the Ankang line and Neikun line connecting the
northwest to the southwest; rail-ferry lines across the Qiongzhou
Strait and the Bohai Bay; and the Southern Xinjiang Railway.
</P>
<P>
While there is a strong demand for building new railways, not
enough study has been done of whether the new railway lines can
reach a certain transport level, Li pointed out, and if a railway
line fails to reach its designed capacity for a long period after
it begins operating, it will not be able to generate good returns.
</P>
<P>
"As we are building a socialist market economy, we should
always pay attention to feasibility studies on railway
construction," Li said.

<HEADLINE> HK Police Arrest 4 More Vietnamese Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four men, aged between 18 and 43, were arrested at Tai O
Bus Terminal between 07:20 and 07:45, the police authorities said
this evening.
</P>
<P>
The four illegal immigrants claimed they left Vietnam on July
24 with three other crewmen on board a wooden boat and landed at
Yi O, Lantau Island, at 03:00 this morning. They also claimed they
had each paid 300 U.S. dollars for the trip to Hong Kong with the
intention of seeking jobs.
</P>
<P>
The four men, together with the other seven captured at about
01:00 this morning, will be taken to Green Island Reception Center
later today before their repatriation, the police authorities said
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Now, the search operation involving police troops continues
both on land and at sea.
</P>
<P>
All the arrested Vietnamese illegal immigrants are expected to
be repatriated as soon as possible, according to a security
department official, who said that they "come to Hong Kong to seek
illegal employment and make money."
</P>
<P>
A source from the Information Department of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region's government told Xinhua overnight
that there are a total of 3,400 illegal Vietnamese immigrants now
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Among them, some 1,800, found to be non-refugees, would have to
return to Vietnam soon either voluntarily or under an Orderly
Repatriation Program (ORP) as agreed with the Vietnamese
government in 1991, the source said, adding that some 1,300
others, found to be refugees, are waiting for resettlement in
related countries.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier statistics from the local information
department, over 200,000 Vietnamese "asylum seekers" have arrived
in Hong Kong since 1975, and from 1988 it was apparent that most
Vietnamese arriving in Hong Kong were "economic migrants," who had
no hope of overseas resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, when a breakthrough was achieved in securing a
practicable solution to the Vietnamese immigrants, most of the
Vietnamese illegal immigrants have returned home voluntarily or
have been repatriated.

<P>
LUANDA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has offered 250,000
Rand (about 54,348 U.S. Dollars) to Angola to help resettle its
demobilized soldiers and their families.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued today by the South African Embassy to
Angola said that the money would be used to buy seeds,
fertilizer, clothing and other daily necessities for the disarmed
Angolan solders.
</P>
<P>
It said, since 1996 when Angola started demobilizing its
military personnel made excessive after a reconciliation reached
between the two warring factions in the country, the
international organizations have provided assistance to a large
number of disarmed Angolans in their re-settlement.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, about 100,000 Angolan military
personnel need to be demobilized and their re-settlement will
take about 37.2 million U.S. Dollars, but up to now only 310,000
U.S. Dollars have been donated for the program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the communique said that the South African
government has offered 600,000 Rand to the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the 1996-1997 fiscal
year, for the resettment of the about 300,000 Angolan refugees.

MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada will provide the
Philippines with 8.2 million Canadian dollars (5.9 million U.S.
dollars) to protect two large watersheds in the central and
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding was signed here by Philippine
Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon and Canadian Ambassador
to Manila Stephen Heeney.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the Canadian assistance will be used to
improve the management of two watersheds in Metro Cebu, a city in
the central Philippines, and Davao city in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Metro Cebu and Davao City are two of the Philippines' largest
urban centers outside Metro Manila, the capital region.
</P>
<P>
Both Metro Cebu and Davao require large volumes of water for
industrial and domestic use and their watersheds are vital to
their survival.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Defends Crackdown on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
today defended Israel's crackdown on the Palestinian-controlled
areas in the wake of Jerusalem bombings and urged the Palestinians
to uproot terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Levy made the statement at a press conference after a 30-minute
in-camera session of talks with his Egyptian counterpart Amr
Moussa at Cairo Airport, following his arrival on a short visit to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Levy tried to justify the measures taken by Israel in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip following the July 30 attacks that took 15
civilian lives and injured 170 others.
</P>
<P>
"We were forced to take these measures," he said. The aim is
not to "weaken the powers of the Palestinian Authority nor to
lead to its fall," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the Israeli top diplomat said that these measures are
intended to create "a sort of awareness of the importance of
security cooperation and of uprooting terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"We want the peace march to advance in a normal atmosphere and
without any violence," Levy said. "We want relations between the
Israelis and Palestinians to become closer," he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) as Israel's
partner in the peace march, he demanded the PNA to commit to its
obligations, "especially when a tragic incident takes place and

</P>
<P>
"Terrorists are walking free and that there is a lack of
confidence and an absence of any peaceful atmosphere," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there must be a kind of reciprocity when matters
come to obligations that constitute the main foundation for
propelling the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said his talks with Levy and the latter's meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak afford an opportunity to discuss several
problems which impede the peace process and led to such a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"It is no secret that the peacemaking is going through a
critical phase unprecedented in the peace march history, and
therefore, we will discuss problems related to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Egypt will exercise pressures on Israel, Moussa
reiterated the importance of dealing with the problems that have
wrecked the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot give up the peace process and we will discuss the
dimensions of the situation and reach an agreement over various
issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
Calling terrorism an international problem, Moussa said Egypt's
role is to create and guarantee an atmosphere of security for all
to allow the peace march to advance and become fruitful.
</P>
<P>
He said he would have further discussions with Levy on how to
restore confidence between the Israeli and Palestinian sides so as
to resume the peace talks and convince the world community that
the peace march can go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who had talks with Mubarak later, came here as the latest
of a string of intensive diplomatic efforts to revive the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, on the verge of collapse
following the Jerusalem suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
Israel hopes to take advantage of Egypt's influence on PNA
President Yasser Arafat to pressure the PNA to launch a war
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Levy's visit here synchronized with an emergency meeting of the
Arab League here, called by Arafat to discuss Israel's "collective
punishment" of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the twin bomb attacks, Israel imposed tight
travel restrictions on the West Bank and Gaza, halted the transfer
of tax revenues to the PNA and suspended peace talks. It has
rounded up 156 Palestinians suspected of terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that Arafat
should launch a long-term war against anti-Israeli terrorist
organizations and their infrastructure, on which the future of the
peace process hinges.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Scheme for Malacca, Singapore Straits to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Maritime
Organization (IMO) has agreed in principle to extend the Traffic
Separation Scheme (TSS) aimed at reducing ship collision in the
Straits of Malacca and Straits of Singapore, Malaysia's Deputy
Transport Minister Mohamed Ali Rustam said today.
</P>
<P>
The IMO sub-committee on safety navigation agreed in principle
to the TSS extension, proposed by Malaysia, Indonesia and
Singapore to the IMO two years ago, at a London meeting in mid
July, the minister said when opening a two-day national seminar on
maritime disaster here.
</P>
<P>
He added that the extension needs the endorsement of the
sub-committee which will meet at IMO in London in May next year.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ali said the July meeting of the sub-committee also
agreed to the proposal to implement the Ship Mandatory Reporting
system for ships in the two straits, which would also require
similar endorsement.
</P>
<P>
The proposed TSS extension stretches from the One Fathom Bank
near Port Klang, some 40 kilometers west of Kuala Lumpur, to Teluk
Ramunia in Johor, about 370 kilometers southeast of Kuala Lumpur,
covering a distance of 468 kilometers as compared to 184
kilometers under the present TSS.
</P>
<P>
TSS is necessary to avoid collision of vessels in both the
straits, Mohamed Ali said, adding that between January and April
this year, there were 46 maritime accidents such as ships
colliding and running aground in the Straits of Malacca.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Fresh Strike Anticipated as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians living in Sierra Leone
have begun to flee the country for fear of being trapped in
anticipated fighting launched by west African peacekeeping force
(ECOMOG) against the junta in power.
</P>
<P>
They are also fleeing the crisis-ridden country in view of
renewed hostilities against Nigerians by soldiers loyal to the
junta's strongman, Major Johnny Paul Koroma, according to press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
This is not the only reason provoking anticipation among
observers that the count-down to military action by the
Nigerian-led ECOMOG against the junta may have begun.
</P>
<P>
The successful conduct of election and the swearing-in of the
newly-elected government in Liberia marks an end to that
country's seven-year civil war, and this also means that ECOMOG
has been able to mobilize more troops for military mission in
Sierra Leone any time from now.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, which clashed with soldiers of the junta after they
overthrew the elected government in the coup on May 25, is
reported to have about 11,000 troops for operation in Liberia,
Sierra Leone's close neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has
launched diplomatic moves since the coup, with the aim of getting
rid of the junta.
</P>
<P>
The latest attempt failed last Thursday when talks between
ECOWAS foreign ministers and the junta broke off in Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire, after Koroma's announcement to stay until 2001.
</P>
<P>
General Sani Abacha, ECOWAS chairman and Nigerian head of
state, soon announced "full scale sanctions" against the country
while he was in Liberia last Saturday to attend the swearing-in
ceremony of President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
He also advised people with commercial interests in Sierra
Leone to suspend their business there forthwith and called for
support from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Both the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations
have said they would endorse ECOWAS' military action against the
junta should the latter fail to heed diplomatic moves for a
handover to ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbha.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional body has threatened to use force to restore
Kabbah's government in case economic embargo and sanctions fail.
</P>
<P>
Koroma said in a radio announcement last week that his troops
would defend Sierra Leone to the last drop of their blood should
ECOMOG intervene in the internal affairs of their country.
</P>
<P>
Several countries, including the United States, have evacuated
their nationals from the troubled country since the coup, which
drew international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
At press time, no order has been given by the Nigerian
government for the evacuation of its nationals, estimated at more
than 5,000, from Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
But some of the Nigerians have begun to flee the troubled
country, most of them reportedly to neighboring Liberia by road,
following increased hostilities against them by the junta and
anticipated strike by ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
At least 19 of them were transported from Liberia to Lagos by
a Nigerian Air Force aircraft on Monday.
</P>
<P>
While blaiming the Nigerian embasssy in Freetown for lack of
protection, the returnees said several of their compatriots had
been arrested by the lawless soldiers there as situation was
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The worsened situation is a logic result of ECOMOG's sanctions
which has been tightened since the collapse of the Abidjan talks.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 15 Sierra Leoneans have died of starvation
due to shortage of food, fuel and other supplies in the country.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross officials were quoted as attributing the death of
the 15 perosns to initial blockade by ECOMOG vessels in Freetown
port.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no report on the effect of ECOMOG's tightened
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Reaffirms Manila's Commitment to ASEAN Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
reiterated the Philippines' firm commitment to the vision of the
Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) of a "united
Southeast Asia, united in peace, genuine spirit of ASEAN and
cooperative prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Ramos issued the statement as the nine-nation regional group is
set to celebrate its 30th anniversary on August 8.
</P>
<P>
"The 30th anniversary of the founding of ASEAN is a most
fitting occasion for all of us to be reminded of the vision of
ASEAN's founders, the vision of a stable, peaceful and progressive
Southeast Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Few could have predicted that within 30 years, ASEAN became a
thriving Southeast Asian community of people that work together
for the security, stability and prosperity of their region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN started as a five-member group composed of Indonesia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Brunei joined ASEAN in 1984, Vietnam in 1995 and Laos and
Myanmar last month.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said ASEAN derived its success and strength from its
commitment to certain fundamental principles, namely "consensus as
the basis of decision-making, acceptance of one another as equals,
respect for one another's sovereign rights as independent states
and the settlement of disputes through peaceful consultations.

<HEADLINE> EAC Chief Urges Energy Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- East African Cooperation (EAC)
chief Francis Muthaura has urged further privatization of the
energy sector with more private investments so as to accelerate
economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
The EAC energy sector now faces substantial challenges,
especially in rural areas, resulting in the wide gap between
demand and supply and the high cost of necessary investment, he
was quoted by today's Kenya Times as warning.
</P>
<P>
Rural electrification programs in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda,
all the three EAC member states, have declined in recent years
due to various commercial factors and difficulties in funding, he
said at the EAC headquarter in Arusha, northern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He urged the EAC members to strengthen cross-border networks
of rural energy projects, development of appropriate sources of
energy and more participation of the local communities in the
energy projects.
</P>
<P>
"The EAC is required, therefore, to develop arrangements which
maximize utilization of energy resources in a complementary
manner, so as to enhance supply of energy, which would support
faster socio-economic development in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, more private money is needed as EAC governments
alone could not be expected to provide the necessary resources to
generate and distribute energy to the extent required, he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> 15 People Die Following Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, August 5 (Xinhua)-- At least 15 people were killed
and several others were wounded when fierce fighting between the
forces of faction leader, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, and those of the
Rahanwein Resustance Army (RRA) broke out in and around
Qansahdhere town yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Qansahdhere, the fighting broke out
when a large number of the RRA men equipped with small arms had
infiltrated into the town and fired on the militiamen of Hussein
Aidid who in their turn returned fire.
</P>
<P>
Radio Ali Mahdi quoting a spokesman for the RRA said the
Rahanwein forces have captured the town of Qansahdhere inflicting
the militiamen of Hussein Aidid heavy losses. According to the
spokesman, their forces have killed 12 of Hussein Aidid's men
during the fighting yesterday afternoon and have retaken control
of the town and its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
In response to the claim of the RRA, Hussein Aidid's interior
minister, Mr Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, said the town of Qansahdhere
is still under the full control of their government forces.
However, Mr Qanyare did not rule out the fighting in the area,
but characterized it as a banditry act against the stability of
the region. Mr Qanyare said as he put it the bandits were chased
away by what he called the national forces.
</P>
<P>
There has been some querrilla fighting activities in the
regions of Bay and Bakol in recent weeks. At least three people
have died when similar guerrilla fighting was launched by the RRA
forces in Qansahdhere last week. According to reports from the
region, the RRA guerrilla fighters are being trained and supplied
with assault rifles and RPGs by the Ethiopian forces in Gedo
region.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid's men maintain dozens of battle wagons to
continue their grip on the regions of Bay and Bakol dominated by
the Rahanwein communities. These regions had been under the
control of late General Aidid's troops since his invasion nearly
two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Ranks Second Among Top Ten Expensive Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong rose to the second among
the top ten expensive cities in the world due to its high housing
costs and a strong currency, said a survey published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was carried out twice a year, was conducted
by Corporate Resources Group, a Geneva-based consultancy. It used
as comparison the prices of housing and nearly 200 products and
services most commonly sought by foreigners traveling abroad,
including housing, food, clothing, cars, alcohol and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
During the survey, New York was used as a base of 100 to
calculate the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
Japanese capital Tokyo ranked first with a rating of 169
points, which was nearly 15 percent points cheaper than last year
because of the weaker Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Moscow and St. Petersburg, which were in third and
tenth places in the survey, were the only two European cities
among the top ten due to the strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the most expensive cities were all from Asia,
including China's other cities, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou,
which stood for the fifth, the sixth and the ninth respectively,
said the survey.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Move Against Prices Speculators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Trade and Industry
Secretary Cesar Bautista said here today that the country would
continue to maintain stable prices of basic goods by making
deliveries to areas where there are tight supplies.
</P>
<P>
Bautista, also chairman of the National Prices Coordinating
Council (NPCC), meanwhile urged consumers to report retail outlets
or vendors overpricing basic commodities to NPCC hotlines.
</P>
<P>
Some reports of overpricing are due to these erring outlets
which are acting on their own and even without advice from
manufacturers to adjust prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
Separate price surveys conducted between July 11 and July 28
this year showed that prices of basic commodities have generally
remained stable, he said, adding that minor increases were traced
to seasonal factors affecting supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
However, local consumers are complaining that the prices of
basic commodities have been going up after the Central Bank
announced the de facto devaluation on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The peso has so far dipped by 10 percent to 28.88 pesos against
one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Bautista expressed confidence that a more realistic peso-dollar
rate would be achieved shortly because the Central Bank is moving
to normalize the supply and demand of dollars.

<HEADLINE> Electrification Chief Urges Energy Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- East African Cooperation (EAC)
chief Francis Muthaura has urged further privatization of the
energy sector with more private investments so as to accelerate
economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
The EAC energy sector now faces substantial challenges,
especially in rural areas, resulting in the wide gap between
demand and supply and the high cost of necessary investment, he
was quoted by today's Kenya Times as warning.
</P>
<P>
Rural electrification programs in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda,
all the three EAC member states, have declined in recent years
due to various commercial factors and difficulties in funding, he
said at the EAC headquarter in Arusha, northern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He urged the EAC members to strengthen cross-border networks
of rural energy projects, development of appropriate sources of
energy and more participation of the local communities in the
energy projects.
</P>
<P>
"The EAC is required, therefore, to develop arrangements which
maximize utilization of energy resources in a complementary
manner, so as to enhance supply of energy, which would support
faster socio-economic development in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, more private money is needed as EAC governments
alone could not be expected to provide the necessary resources to
generate and distribute energy to the extent required, he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Doctor Uses Titanium Mesh For Bone Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A surgeon at Shanghai's
Changzheng Hospital has successfully used titanium for a bone
graft on two cervical spondylosis patients for the first time in
China.
</P>
<P>
The operation was performed by Dr. Yuan Wen. One of the
patients, whose vertebrae had been damaged in an accident causing
loss of use of limbs, was able ultimately to leave the hospital by
himself.
</P>
<P>
The traditional method of treating the cervical disease is to
remove the diseased part of the spine and replace it with bone cut
from the patient's ilium.
</P>
<P>
That method of operation required a 50 to 60 day recovery
period before the patient could leave the bed. The new method of
operation, which uses a titanium mesh instead of bone, allows the
patient to walk soon after surgery.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yuan graduated from the No. 2 Military Medical University
in Shanghai, and studied spinal medicine in the United States. He
was awarded a prize for scientific progress by the army in 1996,
and another for state scientific progress this year.

<P>
PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Jeanne Calment, the oldest lady of the world, died at the
age of 122 Monday in Arles, France. Born on February 21, 1875,
Calment became a courted star for her exceptional resistance
against death. Her longevity shows the tendency that inhabitants
of developed nations will live longer and longer.
</P>
<P>
-- The two sides of the Korean peninsula, the United States and
China will begin today preparatory talks in New York on the
replacement of the armistice treaty signed in 1953 with a peace
treaty. If everything goes well, the participants in the
negotiations will begin formal talks in September.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- With a budget which tends to be balanced, a solid growth
without inflation, and an unemployment rate the lowest since 1973,
the United States has entered an ideal economic situation baptized
"new economy" which has brought the country into the seventh year
of consecutive growth. Meanwhile, under the effect of
de-regulation, the rise of prices has become very difficult, while
the gains in productivity have made salary rise possible without
bringing inflation.
</P>
<P>
-- Thanks to prevention efforts in residence houses, the number
of burglaries has dropped considerably since 1993 in France. In
France, eight out of 1,000 inhabitants are assaulted by burglars
each year, compared with 27 out of 1,000 in Britain and 37 out of
1,000 in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Arab Support Urged to Face Israeli Retaliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
today urged prompt Arab actions to save the Palestinian people
from Israel's collective punishment measures following last week's
suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made at an emergency session of the Arab League
(AL), convened here at noon at the request of PNA President Yasser
Arafat to examine the impacts of the large-scale Israeli campaign,
the faltering Arab-Israeli peace process and regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's MENA news agency reported, citing diplomatic sources,
that Arab delegates will discuss a 10-point Palestinian note and
another note submitted by the Arab League Secretariat on ways of
confronting Israeli measures.
</P>
<P>
Arafat sent a message to AL Secretary General Abdel Meguid
Monday, detailing 12 "repressive" measures taken by Israel and
accusing it of making "collective punishment" of the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Arab nations and international groups to press for
an end to their sufferings.
</P>
<P>
Following the July 30 terror attack that took 15 lives in
Jerusalem, Israel imposed tight travel restrictions on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, halted the transfer of tax revenues to the
Palestinian Authority and suspended peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Early today, Israel arrested 11 Palestinians suspected of
"hostile terrorist activity," bringing to 156 the number of
Palestinians detained by Israel since the bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day AL meeting chaired by Meguid, permanent
delegates to Arab body will pore over ways to further coordination
for the formation of a unified Arab stand in face of Israeli
"retaliatory" measures.
</P>
<P>
Cairo-based diplomatic sources said a strongly-worded joint
statement is forthcoming at the meeting. It is expected to call
for an immediate halt of Israeli measures, give backing to
Palestinian rights, and demand signatories to the Oslo agreement
to help salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting came in parallel with a trip to Egypt by
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and a few days ahead of a
multi-leg regional tour by U.S. Peace Envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League was originally set to convene its 108 session
today on facing the Israeli measures.

little changed in lackluster dealings with market participants
citing a lack of directional cues for the currency.

<P>
National Australia Bank foreign exchange manager Derek Price

direction for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"I think the dollar is pretty close to the bottom but people
who want to buy are still finding it tough to reconcile these
interest rate differentials," he added.
</P>
<P>
The margin between Australian and U.S. dollar short and long
term interest rates has narrowed dramatically over the past few
months.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the Commissioner
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will not intervene in the
affairs within the limit of the high-degree autonomy of the HKSAR,
a spokesman of the office said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Wu Hongbo, stressed that the office will only
conduct the foreign affairs related to the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the office will certainly not meddle with the
election of the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR which is
scheduled to be held in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks in response to some reporters'
inquiry which resulted from local media reports on the working
ties recently established between the office and the Department of
Electoral Affairs of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that Ma Yuzhen, commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of China in the HKSAR, recently met with Tung Chee Hwa,
Chief Executive of the HKSAR, many times and his office has set
up normal working ties with the Department of Justice, Security
Bureau, Constitutional Affairs Bureau, Department of Immigration
and the Information Services Department.
</P>
<P>
It is helpful that the HKSAR government appointed the
Constitutional Affairs Bureau as a coordinator for the office to
make contacts with other departments and bureaux due to the fact
that the newly-established office is not familiar with the
specific functions of these departments and bureaux, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the office will only conduct the foreign affairs
related to the HKSAR and it will not intervene in the affairs
within the limit of the HKSAR's high-degree autonomy as well as
the election of the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR to be
held in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China, has recorded notable achievements in simplifying its
administrative structure and cutting government staff by nearly
three percent.
</P>
<P>
The province has energetically carried out reform of government
departments in line with State Council's policies since 1993. The
current 1,422 government departments and 73,127 civil servants
represent respective reductions of 27 percent and 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of provincial government departments has been cut by
30.5 percent to the current 57, with staff levels cut by 25
percent to 7,192.
</P>
<P>
Analysts point to the fact that simplification of the
administrative structure has enabled governments at all levels
introduce macro-controls and supervision better suited to the
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's effort to promote a large number of middle-aged and
younger officials has greatly improved the age structure and
knowledge level of government staff members.

<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Altogether 77 public sector
companies have been offered for sale by the end of June as Egypt
picks up its pace of six-year privatization, Egyptian Gazette
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministerial Committee for Privatization under the
chairmanship of Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri on Monday
reviewed the privatization program until June 1997 by which date
nearly 22 percent of the public enterprise sector had been offered
for sale.
</P>
<P>
They included 14 companies whose assets and shares were totally
sold, 43 others over half of whose shares had been sold and 20
companies with less than 50 percent of their shares being sold.
</P>
<P>
The committee also approved to sell part of the shares of other 33
state-owned companies in the field of maritime transport, industry
and trade in the Bourse in the latter half of 1997, said
Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif.
</P>
<P>
The total proceeds from selling the shares of these companies
totaled 5.88 billion Egyptian pounds (1.73 billion U.S. dollars)
of which 1.878 billion (552 million dollars) had been used to pay
debts owed to the banks.
</P>
<P>
Participation of the private sector represented 60 percent of
the volume of economic activities in Egypt by 1995, a 50 percent
rise over the 1970s. The sector is expected to shoulder 70 percent
of the investments in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
But the government has been reluctant to sell a majority stake
in vital sectors, such as oil and gas, telecommunications and
transports.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Ban of Medicines for Expatriates Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A recent government decision
to ban dispensing of costly medicines to expatriates in the
country has roused protest and concern among doctors who attacked
it as discrimination against foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 Kuwaiti doctors today submitted a memorandum to the
Ministry of Health asking it to reconsider the decision and arrive
at a more acceptable alternative solution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a delegation of doctors met with the ministry's
Undersecretary Sulaiman Al-Ali and conveyed their dissatisfaction
over the government measure which discriminates between local
citizens and expatriates.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health made the decision mainly, among other
things, to confront financial difficulties. Kuwaitis enjoy a wide
range of cradle-to-grave social welfare including free health
care. Foreign nationals having local residence visa are also
guaranteed access to free medical care except for some costly
examinations and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Signatories to the memo said this measure is totally
"unacceptable to the medical fraternity because treatment implies
the constant availability of medicines without any disruption."
</P>
<P>
Doctors said almost 72 out of the 83 medicines on the list to
be withheld to foreign nationals had no alternatives at state-run
pharmacies, including almost all life-saving drugs.
</P>
<P>
They said it was a "big headache" to write out a prescription
for some expatriate patients because some of the drugs along with
their substitutes had been included in the list of banned
medicines.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has so far failed to respond to the doctors'
protest, sources said.

<P>
SEOUL, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam today made a cabinet reshuffle, replacing 11 ministers
including those for home affairs, justice, education and
agriculture portfolios.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, two deputy prime minister and ministers of
foreign affairs, defense and security affairs were retained for
their posts while the rest were replaced.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle reflects President Kim's will to ensure a fair
and strict presidential elections and handle economy and national
security effectively, said the outgoing presidential spokesman
Yoon Yeo-joon. He was appointed as the new environment minister
today.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Transportation Sector (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roads are the foundation of the transport industry, Li added,
and the most widely used part of it. The popular saying
goes: "Road building goes before prosperity." By the end of the
Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95), China's had 1.16 million km of
roads and highways. A national road network has taken shape
running to 97 percent of townships and 80 percent of villages.
</P>
<P>
However, low-grade roads don't meet the economic growth and
living standard needs, Li said. So, a continued effort must be
made to develop road transportation and improve existing
roads. During the Ninth Five-Year-Plan (1996-2000), 110,000 km of
roads will be added to the network, including 6,000 km of
expressways, and 60 percent of them in central and western China.
Seven national routes will be built, including one from Beijing to
Zhuhai, and another from Lianyungang to Horgas, Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility studies must be done before building, with economic
benefits being taken into account, Li said, and departments
concerned must halt various unauthorized road charges.
</P>
<P>
Steps should be taken to phase out tractors that consumes a
large amount of fuel and diesel trucks for farm use. Instead,
efforts can be made to develop passenger-cargo vehicles, which
have a potential market in rural areas, the Premier said.
</P>
<P>
The central government and local areas should make an effort to
raise the large amounts of capital needed for road building. A
road building fund consists of vehicle purchase surcharges and
road tolls. It is also reasonable to add road maintenance and
building taxes to gasoline and diesel oil costs, Li said, and this
policy is being tried out in Hainan Province, and will be used in
the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Road transportation should be mainly used for short or
medium-distance travel, especially for transporting vegetables,
fruits and other special commodities. The state will set prices
for railway and water transport of large amounts of commodities,
but the market has the final say on road transport costs, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Roads are still the major means of transport in urban areas. In
big cities, ring roads, viaducts, and overpasses can be built to
ease traffic jams. But, urban construction, which is very
expensive, can only be done in accordance with local ability. In
the current circumstances, public buses continue to be a major
part of urban traffic, while cars serve as a supplement, Li said.

China had 438 deepwater berths, each accommodating 10,000 dwt
ships by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, Li said, with a
combined annual handling capacity of 700 million tons, 5.5 million
tons of which is in containers.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to add 100 berths for 10,000-dwt ships with
an additional handling capacity of more than 200 million tons in
the Ninth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
The handling capacity of Qinghuangdao and Tianjin will be
expanded and a new port will be built at Huangye, in Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the coal handling
capacity will reach 180 million tons.
</P>
<P>
There is a great potential for developing container transport
in the 1996-2000 period. The state will build or expand 30
container berths, bringing China's container handling capacity to
10 million TEUs by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Deep-water berths with 30 million tons of additional capacity
will be built in Qingdao, Ningbo, and Zhoushan to expand the
mineral ore handling capacity.
</P>
<P>
The country will use more 200,000 to 300,000 dwt ships for
oceangoing transport to reduce the cost of transportation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
New ports will be built at Dalian and Yingkou to ship maize
from northeastern provinces to southern provinces and for export
overseas. The crude or refined oil capacity will be increased.
</P>
<P>
When the first phase of the Three Gorges Project is completed,
the Yangtze River will be 8.5 meters deep, allowing 35,000-dwt
ships to travel down to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan, Li said, the country will harness
2,400 km of inland rivers and build 160 new berths that will add
42 million tons of handling capacity. The cost of inland water
projects will be shared by the central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for the ocean shipping industry to raise the
value of its annual cargo to 400 billion US dollars by the year
2000, Li said. So far, China's deep sea transport vessels have a
combined capacity of 23.5 million dwt. The China Oceangoing
Transport Group, one of the largest in the world, has a total
carrying capacity of 16 million dwt.
</P>
<P>
In view of the acute competition in the world, China will add
regular liners to Latin America and Africa to enhance economic and
trade co-operation with customers in these regions.

<P>
Air transport, Li said, is an advanced means of transportation
that has good prospects for development. During the Eighth
Five-Year Plan (1991-95) the sector saw rapid expansion, with the
passenger handling capacity growing 25 percent annually. In 1995,
Chinese airlines carried 51 million passengers and the figure is
expected to exceed 100 million.
</P>
<P>
Air cargo transport is expected to increase as well.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that a network of airports has been built in the past
decade in most municipalities, and provincial and autonomous
region capitals.
</P>
<P>
After the reforms separating enterprise management from
administon, Air China and five other major airlines assumed
responsibility for their own operations, and competition among
them has improved the quality of service and increased profits.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's aircraft industry has also developed
substantially. Small and medium-sized passenger aircraft like the
Yun-7 and Yun-12 are operating on a number of domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
Domestic airlines should accelerate the training of pilots, Li
said, and making certain of their skills, love of their profession,
and ability to fly under all weather conditions are an urgent
matter.
</P>
<P>
The policy "Safety first, normal operations, and quality
service" must be adopted by domestic airlines as their policy
because they face intense competition on both the international
and domestic markets, Li said.

Noting that pipeline transport -- which is referred to as the
fifth mode -- has become an important means of delivering energy,
Li said China laid over 19,000 km of crude oil and natural gas
pipeline by the end of 1996, and during the current Ninth
Five-Year Plan, it has given priority to building a comprehensive
pipeline network.
</P>
<P>
In eastern parts of the country, he said, the existing
pipelines will be rebuilt to improve the oil flow and to meet
petroleum import requirements, while in western parts, work will
concentrate on extending pipelines from the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, where large oil and gas basins are located, to
the most oil and gas-starved provinces in central China.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Shaanbei-Beijing gas pipeline linking northern part
of Sha'anxi Province with the Chinese capital is now in full
swing. The pipeline will help ease the gas supply strain in north
China, Li said.
</P>
<P>
More pipelines are expected to be laid with the exploration and
development of oil- and gasfields in the Sichuan Basin in the
southwest and on Hainan Island.
</P>
<P>
Li also called for conducting experiments in more advanced
techniques for moving liquified coal via pipelines.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Imports to Outpace Exports in 1997: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is expected to
record a slightly higher growth in merchandise imports than growth
in merchandise exports in 1997, according to an official report
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise imports are expected to increase 8.0 percent to
213.1 billion ringgit (about 85.24 billion U.S. dollars) while the
exports of merchandise are expected to increase 7.5 percent to
211.4 billion ringgit (about 84.56 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997,
the Malaysian International Trade and Industry Report 1996/1997
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to lumpy imports to meet the needs of the air
services, shipping and land transportation services and other
infrastructure projects, the expansion in the output of
export-oriented industries in 1997 is also expected to result in
an increase in the import of such components at a pace higher than
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, exports grew 6.3 percent to 196.7 billion ringgit
(about 78.68 billion U.S. dollars) while imports increased 1.5
percent to 197.3 billion ringgit (about 78.92 billion U.S.
dollars), leading to a significant improvement in Malaysia's trade
account in the year with a trade deficit of about 240 million U.S.
dollars from a deficit of about 3.76 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But statistics released Monday by the Statistics Department
showed that in the first half of this year, Malaysia posted a
trade deficit of 2.7 billion ringgit (about 1.08 billion U.S.
dollars) from a deficit of 687.8 million ringgit (about 275.12
million U.S. dollars) in the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister
Rafidah Aziz said today after releasing the report that she
expected a higher export growth in the second half of 1997 based
on an anticipated increase in the upturn in the electrical and
electronics sector which makes up the bulk of Malaysia's
manufactured exports.

On the major roles of China's railways, Li Peng said because of
China's vast area and huge population, with an uneven distribution
of resources and uneven economic development, railways are needed
for long-distance transportation of the bulk of goods.
</P>
<P>
Railways are used to ship coal from the west to the east and
from the north to the south, to ship grain from the north to the
south, to transport ore from the south to the north, and to get
cotton from the west to the east, he said.
</P>
<P>
With comparatively low fares, he noted the railways are
good for mid- and long-distance passenger transportation.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the Eighth Five-Year-Plan (1991-1995), China had
62,600 kilometers of railways, a cargo volume of 1.3 trillion
ton/km and 354.6 billion person/km, accounting respectively for 36
and 39.4 percent of the total national transportation volume.
</P>
<P>
In terms of technology, he said steam locomotives had been
replaced almost entirely by diesel and electric
locomotives. Double-track rails accounted for 27 percent of the
total and electrified rails made up 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new Beijing-Kowloon Railway, and the new Nanning-Kunming
Railway, which serves as a passage for the southwestern part of
the country to the sea, are expected to contribute greatly to the
national economy and to the poverty-relief efforts of regions
alongside them.

<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, in an article
carried in today's "Economic Daily", said that China should try to
build a nationwide, comprehensive transportation network.
</P>
<P>
The transportation sector should take railways as the backbone
and highways as the basis, he said, making full use of
waterways and actively backing civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
China faces a long and arduous task in the development of
transportation and an effort must be made to bring the initiatives
of both the central and local governments into play, he said.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring transport systems and transforming the mode of
growth in delivery capacity are two major keys to the fast and
healthy development of the sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Transport and communications are basic industry of the
national economy, and one of the major symbols judging the degree
of its modernization, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sector has seen rapid growth since the late 1970s and a
comprehensive network has basically taken shape. But, Li noted,
the sector still falls short of meeting the needs of fast economic
growth. The Chinese government has listed transportation as a top
priority in its medium-and long-range development plan.
</P>
<P>
The sector has entered a new stage of development with the
national economic growth, and co-ordinated action is needed in
building a comprehensive transport network.

According to the premier, the annual cargo load of a
single-track, standard grade-one national railway should reach
about 15 million tons; if it is double-track with automatic
blocking devices, the annual cargo load can be raised to 60
million tons or more.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a diesel locomotive can improve the capacity of a
diesel locomotive. Technical upgrading of old railways is
considered an important way of increasing transportation capacity.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve bulk cargo transport and regional economic
development, he said, a number of new railways will be built during
the Ninth Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
These include the Shenmu-Huangye Railway for shipping coal out
of the northwest; the Ankang line and Neikun line connecting the
northwest to the southwest; rail-ferry lines across the Qiongzhou
Strait and the Bohai Bay; and the Southern Xinjiang Railway.
</P>
<P>
While there is strong demand for building new railways, not
enough study has been done of whether the new railway lines can
reach a certain transport level, Li pointed out, and if a railway
line fails to reach its designed capacity for a long period after
it begins operating, it will not be able to generate good returns.
</P>
<P>
"As we are building a socialist market economy, we should
always pay attention to feasibility studies on railway
construction," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Transportation Sector (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Railway construction during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000) will focus on large-capacity passenger transport and
network strengthening, with emphasis on both technical
transformation and new line construction.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,000 kilometers with over 3,000 kilometers of
double-track lines and over 4,000 kilometers of electrified lines
are expected to be added during the period, Li said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the total length of railway lines in
operation is expected to reach 68,000 kilometers, with the
technical level of the railways significantly improved, the
proportion of double-track lines at 34 percent and electrified
lines 27 percent, annual cargo loads of 1.5 trillion ton/km and
the passenger transportation of 470 billion person/km, according
to the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
Because construction costs a great deal of money, a railway
construction fund was set up during the Eighth Five-Year-Plan
period (1996-2000) by adding 2.7 cents (one RMB yuan = 100 cents,
8.3 yuan = one US dollar) to the transportation cost of every
ton/km of goods. This added about 30 billion yuan each year to the
fund, which with bank loans and bonds, would provide a stable
source of funds for railway construction.
</P>
<P>
Raising money by increasing cargo transportation costs would
result in higher operation costs for railway users, especially
power suppliers, and steel and coal producers, and this in turn
would be passed on to all industries and the cost of people's
living expenses. It should be understood that railway
transportation costs in China are still relatively low when
compared with waterway and highway transportation costs.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li Peng noted as short-distance transport should focus on
highways, the cost of short-distance railway transport should be
raised and railway stations with inadequate passenger and cargo
flow should be closed to support highway transport and to raise
the speed of railways.
</P>
<P>
The improved standard of living, the five-day work week, and
the tourism boom have provided more opportunities for railway
development. The use of double-deck trains, the increase in train
speeds, and improved time-tables are all valuable experiments, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Safety, on-time operations, and good service should be the
direction the railways should move in. Well-disciplined,
responsible, and professional railway workers and staffs are
equally important to the improvement and improved efficiency of
railways, he said.
</P>
<P>
Railway construction workers should improve their technical and
management level to sharpen their competitive edge in China and in
the world.
</P>
<P>
In manufacturing railway equipment, Li said, the sector is now
capable of meeting the country's needs and more projects are
underway in the international market. State railway administrative
departments should give more decision-making power to
manufacturers under the principle of separating the administration
from the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the railway management system should develop
towards enterprise groups while retaining the national unified
dispatching operations. Because the railways are the lifeline of
the national economy, construction of trunk lines should mainly
rely on state investment, and other trunk lines and branch lines
can use local and overseas capital.

<HEADLINE> American Lawmakers Stack Campaign Chests for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Republican lawmakers of the
United States have collected, in the first half of this year,
millions of dollars of campaign funds for the 1998 election, says
a report by the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
The campaign committee of House Speaker Newt Gingrich got 1.8
million dollars, says the report, twice the amount he raised in
the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Richard Armey, House majority leader, had raised 400,000
dollars by June 30. The sum he raised in the first half of 1995
was 191,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Republican Party committees raising money for Congress
candidates took in more than 23 million dollars over the last six
months, compared with 11 million dollars raised by their
Democratic counterparts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from contributions from individuals, lawmakers and party
committees obtained money from special interest groups. Gingrich
got more than 200,000 dollars from political action committees
(PACs) -- groups donating money to lawmakers or candidates who
shared their points of view. About a third of Armey's money also
came from these organizations.
</P>
<P>
Richard Gephardt, House minority leader, raised 1.4 million
dollars, with more than 500,000 dollars coming from PACs. Gephardt
raised less than one million dollars in the first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, raised
one million dollars by June 30, 425,000 dollars coming from PACs.
</P>
<P>
Republican and Democratic committees raised hundreds of
thousands of dollars in controversial "soft money" donations from
corporations, unions and wealthy patrons by mid-year. President
Bill Clinton and some lawmakers have called for a ban on such
donations.
</P>
<P>
Soft money is exempt from the annual 25,000-dollar legal
contribution limit for each donor. It is supposed to be spent only
on party-building activities and not on promoting individual
candidates.
</P>
<P>
But both parties poured millions of dollars of soft money into
advertisements aimed at influencing the presidential election last
year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King to Visit Israel on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein is to
arrive in Jerusalem Wednesday morning, one week after the
Jerusalem bombings, in an attempt to get the peace process back on
track, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hussein is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to explore ways to re-establish confidence in
the peace confidence. Jordanian officials said the King will also
meet with Palestinian leaders during his visit.
</P>
<P>
The trip was proposed in an telephone conversation Tuesday
between Hussein and Netanyahu. The King offered to pay a visit and
the prime minister agreed. Earlier in the day, the King held talks
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the ongoing peace crisis.
</P>
<P>
Details of the King's visit to Israel will be worked out today,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's visit is among a flurry of diplomatic activities
aimed at reviving the peace process, which suffered a grave
setback after the double suicide bombings in Jerusalem's Mahaneh
Yehuda market last Wednesday in which 15 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy leaves for Egypt
this morning for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross is due to arrive here at
the weekend on an open-ended visit for meetings with Israeli and
Palestinian leaders. U.S. officials said his mission is primarily
to secure the resumption of security coordination between Israel
and Palestinians.

</P>
<P>
It will be the first time the Union Cyclist International to
produce launch out tests for the substance at a world track
meeting, according to event executive director Russell Miller.
</P>
<P>
EPO is a body process to develop red blood cells. Athletes who
use the derivative will be provided with extra oxygen in the
system to enhance performance.
</P>
<P>
Riders from 34 countries and regions will be tested for EPO in
the Perth race which is slated from August 27 to 31.
</P>
<P>
EPO tests upon riders in last month's Tour de France showed
that most riders were eligible to compete.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Create Purest Crystals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have set
a world record by creating the purest-ever crystals of the
semiconductor gallium arsenide which allow electrons to move at
record speed, Today's The Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The achievement, gained by researchers at the Weizman
Institute, surpassed the previous world record of 11.7 million
centimeters per second set by Bell Laboratories in the United
States eight years ago. The Israeli scientists got electrons
to race through the semiconductor at 14.4 million centimeters
per second.
</P>
<P>
The crystal is so pure that it contains only one foreign
atom per five billion gallium arsenide atoms. This would be
the equivalent of a single cube of sugar in a five-storey
apartment block on a 300 square-meter lot, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Vladimir Umansky, PH.D student Rafael Picciotto and
Professor Mordehai Heiblum set the record at Weiaman Institute's
Braun Center for Submicron Research. Their achievement makes
possible the study of electrons' behavior in extremely pure
materials and provides an important research tool for making
faster and more efficient electronic devices such as transistors
for the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
The scientists used a unique vacuum system to grow such
pure crystals. This facility holds a world record for such
systems - for emptiness rather than purity - because it
produces what appears to be a near-perfect vacuum.
</P>
<P>
Gallium arsenide is gradually replacing silicon- long the
king of the microelectronics industry - because of its
superior characteristics. It comprises the main component of
cellular phones because it allows electrons to travel faster
than silicon and absorbs light very efficiently.
</P>
<P>
It is also better for satellites, because it stands up
better than silicon to radiation in outer space, where
satellites are a growth industry, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Strikers Threat to Paralyze Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Air traffic controllers in
Kenya's three main airports have threatened to ground all airport
operations nationwide unless the government reacts over their
demands within two days ending Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ultimatum was issued on Monday as the hard-hitting go-slow
by the controllers continued for the third day.
</P>
<P>
The controllers vowed they will in the meantime start
increasing delay time for landings and take-offs.
</P>
<P>
They said they are getting impatient over the failure by the
government to respond to their basic salary hike demand since the
go-slow started at midnight on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The government has been ignoring us since Saturday. Now we
have decided to go on full scale strike should (head of Civil
Service) Kuindwa not give us a positive reply in writing," said
the controllers in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Air transport services now are plunged into a major confusion
with several local and international airlines forced to cancel
their flights and travelers stranded at the airports in Nairobi,
Mombasa and Kisumu.
</P>
<P>
Flights were delayed for up to six hours or diverted to
neighboring Tanzania on Monday, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
Exporters of fresh horticultural crops and cut flowers on
Monday said the strike is negatively affecting their operations.
</P>
<P>
However, "we will continue our strike indefinitely until our
demands are met," a striker vowed.

<HEADLINE> S. African Currency Further Depreciates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South African national
currency of Rand continued depreciating against U.S. Dollar
yesterday, closing at 4.65 Rand against the Dollar, but
economists and traders had expressed no panic over the slip.
</P>
<P>
The Rand dropped to a new six-month low of 4.66 in early
trade yesterday from last Friday's 4.63 Rand before profit-taking
pushed it back to a close of 4.65 Rand, financial sources said.
</P>
<P>
The currency has lost eight cents against U.S. Dollar in the
last seven trading days. Most economists still expect the Rand to
trade at between 4.70 Rand and 4.75 Rand by year-end.
</P>
<P>
Local economists claimed there was no need to panic over the
depreciation.
</P>
<P>
James Cross, Deputy Governor of Reserve Bank said on Monday
that his bank believed the Rand's recent weakness had much to do
with the U.S. currency's strength.
</P>
<P>
"With the Dollar strong against virtually all currencies, it
is to be expected that it should also be strong against the
Rand," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Dollar reportedly reached a new seven-and-a-half year
high of DM 1.87 yesterday, and traders said more gains were
expected in the short term.
</P>
<P>
South African economists welcomed the Rands' decline, saying
that it was needed for the country to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
It was "very good news that the Rand is falling gradually and
in a controlled fashion", economist Hanis Farhan said, adding
that a lower Rand would boost exports, which in turn would have a
positive effect on the current account.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Diplomatic Efforts Intensified to Save </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian peace
process, on the verge of collapse following the Jerusalem suicide
bombings last week, is regaining momentum after diplomatic efforts
were intensified by concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
In a reconciliatory phone conversation overnight, Mahamoud
Abbas, deputy head of Palestinian National Authority (PNA), told
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy that the PNA is ready to
resume security cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest in a flurry of ongoing diplomatic
activities aimed at reviving the peace process, which suffered a
huge blow in the double bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda
market last Wednesday that killed 15 people.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, told Levy over the phone that
he deplored the acts of terrorism and extended his condolences to
the families of the victims. He said PNA President Yasser Arafat
was of the same opinion that "these are attacks against the
Palestinian people as well as against the people of Israel,
because they are aimed at harming the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Abbas added that the PNA was ready to resume security
cooperation with Israel and Arafat had promised to act against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In response, Levy told Abbas that it was essential that "your
voices be heard and that they guide future policy." He stressed
that cooperation for the purpose of advancing the peace process
should be the common goal.
</P>
<P>
The Abbas-Levy conversation was the highest-level contact
between the two sides since the Jerusalem bombing attack. The same
night Jordan's King Hussein, who met Arafat earlier in the day,
made a phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
offering to visit Israel Wednesday to discuss ways to save the
peace process at the critical time.
</P>
<P>
Levy is also expected to meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in Alexandria today to
discuss the current situation and explore ways to revive the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Israel hopes to take advantage of
Egypt's influence on Arafat to pressure the PNA to launch a war
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright also made a phone
call to Arafat Monday night, telling him that the U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross would return to the region this weekend with a new
initiative to break the ice in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Ross was expected here Saturday night and his
visit would be open-ended. Ross postponed his trip, scheduled a
week back, following the Jerusalem bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, European Union special peace envoy Miguel
Moratinos held separate talks with Arafat in Gaza and with
Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos conveyed a message to Netanyahu from Arafat who
demanded Israel lift sanctions against Palestinians imposed after
the Wednesday terror attack, including a total closure on
Palestinian territories, expelling Palestinians workers, halting
transfer of customs revenues to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
In order to pressurize the Palestinian side to combat
terrorism, Netanyahu insisted that Arafat should launch a
long-term war against anti-Israeli terrorist organizations and
their infrastructure, on which the future of the peace process
hinges.

of civilians in war situations, politicization and combat
operation techniques, according to the report.

supplies and other equipment have been secured at the expense of

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents had killed 740
people in Uganda in the first six months this year, "The Monitor"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Joseph E. Opio, assistant commissioner of police in charge of
traffic and road safety, said 4,047 civilian, 288 government, 52
diplomatic, 159 foreign and 48 unregistered vehicles had been
involved in 3,701 accidents in the period.
</P>
<P>
The accidents-free districts are Archipelago Kalangala in the

said.
</P>
<P>
Kampala, the capital, is at the top of the statistics with 125
victims in the period, comparing with the 149 victims in the same
period of 1996. Among the total 48 unregistered vehicles involved
in the accidents, 23 were intercepted in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
However, Grace Turyagumanawe, senior superintendent of police
in charge of traffic in the capital, told the paper that the
reduction of accidents in the city was contributed to the
preventive measures and alertness of police even at night. Any
driver found drunk will be jailed, he warned.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests U.S. Military Harassment in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran has strongly protested
against U.S. military harassment and intimidation of Iranian boats
in the Persian Gulf, said a report here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA said Iran submitted a letter
to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Monday to protest the
U.S. military fleet's "illegal actions" in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, notes of protest have already been
sent to the U.S. State Department on July 3 through Iranian
interest section in the Pakistani embassy in Washington,
requesting an official explanation.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said a U.S. warship had fired eight rounds of shot on two
Iranian boats sailing 7.2 kilometers from the Soroush oil platform
in the Gulf. The boats had to change course to avoid any damages.
</P>
<P>
Another incident occurred on February 26 when a U.S. helicopter
hovered over an Iranian boat sailing 128 kilometers off the port
of Ganaveh, the report said. The boat, filled with water and then
in danger of sinking, was forced to change course toward the
Iranian mainland.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Iranian government demands an explanation from
U.S. officials regarding the two incidents and called for an end
to the illegal behavior by U.S. forces in the Gulf, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According the report, the letter to the U.N. chief was
submitted by Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Majid Takht Ravanchi.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time in less than a year that the Iranian
government lodged protests against U.S. violations of its air
space and territorial water.
</P>
<P>
Iran has constantly condemned U.S. military presence in the
Gulf and warned against its threat to peace and security in the
region.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Iran has also enhanced its defense capability
in its southern coast through the purchase of new submarines and
missile boats.

<P>
TEHRAN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 22 Iranians were drowned
in the past week in the Caspian Sea, bringing the total
casualties to 94 so far this summer, a press report said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jomhuri Islami reported that most of the
victims were travelers who did not known how to swim. they
were drowned outside of the protected areas in the Caspian
Sea.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not say how many of the victims were
women. Previous reports said that women took a large proportion
of the total casualties.
</P>
<P>
The protected areas in the Caspian Sea have been divided
into male and female swimming areas. The women's swimming area
is screened off because the Islamic law in Iran forbids women
to swim in places where they can be seen by men.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Day In A Chinese Nature Reserve (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- He Jianyuan, deputy-director of
the Wuyishan National Nature Reserve in east China's Fujian
province begins his day at about 6:00, when he comes to his office
amidst the singing of birds to prepare for a "nature protection"
summer camp that starts two hours later.
</P>
<P>
Although his work hours are supposedly from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00
p.m., he almost never follows this schedule. "He always leaves his
office after nine o'clock in the evening," his wife complains.
</P>
<P>
The reserves spanning more than 50,000 hectares of forest are
home to a third of China's mammals and a fourth of its bird
species. He and his 100 staff members are guarding this kingdom.
</P>
<P>
On July 28, a group of middle school students from Fujian and
the neighboring Jiangxi province came to Guadun, a small village in
the reserve to attend the summer camp, which was organized by the
Provincial Department of Forestry as part of the Global Environment
Facility-funded biodiversity project.
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised to find that I could clearly see my toes in
the river water and thought it must be the reserve staff's effort
to make it so clean," said one 14-year old girl from Fuzhou,
capital of Fujian. She said that later she will make her own
effort to help clean the country's other rivers.
</P>
<P>
Another group of teachers and students from the Fujian Forestry
School was being led on a biological resources survey by a
deputy-director, who said survey findings will serve as important
reference for a reserve administrative plan being worked out.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Day In A Chinese Nature Reserve (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For three experts from Beijing's University of Forestry, the day
was a busy one. They had come to the reserve for ten days to try
to make a final decision on establishing a corridor linking two
core areas of the nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
"The corridor will greatly benefit gene exchanges between the
two core areas and promote the biodiversity protection work,"
explained Zhang Ying, one of the three.
</P>
<P>
Liao Chuanping, head of the reserve's Tongmu Wildlife Protection
Station, went to a small village in the reserve to inspect
fire-prevention work, after finishing his daily field patrol.
</P>
<P>
Liao has 18 colleagues in the station, which is one of eight in the
reserve, who include 12 forest rangers made up of local
farmers. "In the past 11 years, after graduating from polytechnic
school, I have been working here as a grass-roots staff member,"
said Liao, "and I love my work, and I love every tree and blade of
grass here."

MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that a most crucial task in Russian-Chinese
relations is to complete the demarcation of the border between the
two countries by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting a group of Russian media
chiefs here.

Primakov called on concerned authorities in Russia to abandon
localistic interests, saying that if the localistic interests were
not given up, the fate of the border agreements between Russia and
China would be in question.

On Russian-Japanese relations, Primakov said both Russia

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Develop Fish Farming in Paddy Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
subsidize 1.8 million farmer families to develop fish farming in
paddy fields, sources in the Ministry of Agriculture said today.
</P>
<P>
The method is to fill water into the paddy fields as the plants
have grown about two inches high. Then release fish fry, each
about two centimeters long, into the fields and keep them in the
paddy fields for about eight weeks until they grow to at least two
inches in length, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
As the fish feed on pests, insects and larvae in the fields,
there is no need to use chemicals to kill pests and insects.
</P>
<P>
The fish in the paddy fields will also help kill mosquito
larvae, saving the money spent to combat and treat malaria and
other mosquito-transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
The United Nation's Development Program has identified this
method as one of the best alternatives to reduce the cost of paddy
production after research, according to the sources.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Ensure Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today said it would
reposition itself to ensure that it remains competitive as an
investment location against the backdrop of increasing competition
for global foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The 1996/97 International Trade and Industry Report released
here today said competition for foreign direct investment has
intensified in view of the changing world trade and economic
patterns and the emergence of new competing production bases
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
For Malaysia, which would need to sustain investment flows in
the region of 25 billion ringgit (about 10 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1997 in the manufacturing sector, existing strategies will be
improved upon and new strategies of investment promotion for 1997
will be based on the industrial cluster and manufacturing
approaches, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This will provide the basis for the development of a more broad
based, resilient and internationally competitive industrial
sector, said the report prepared by the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of small and medium industries will also be
enhanced to strengthen the industrial linkage between domestic and
foreign companies in the development of industrial clusters, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Small and Medium Industries Development Corporation
(SMIDEC) is currently in the process of identifying new industrial
sites to enable an orderly development of a new breed of SMIs
which will be more efficient and technologically-progressive.
</P>
<P>
The existing fiscal and financial facilities for SMIs are the
Industrial Technical Assistance Fund (ITAF), the Integrated
Marketing Program for the Food Industry, the Soft Loan Scheme for
Modernization and Automation, the Soft Loan Scheme for Quality
Enhancement, the Infrastructure Development Program and the SMI
Exposition and Industrial Fairs.
</P>
<P>
The report also stressed that one of the challenges for the
next phase of industrial development will be the ability to
integrate the development of support services with that of
manufacturing industries to generate the linkage required to
foster the growth of strong and resilient industrial clusters.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma has called for concerted efforts and cooperation
among African nations in designing programs to curb deforestation
and land degradation.
</P>
<P>
Juma made the appeal while opening a five-day international
workshop on composite materials and waste minimization here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is great hope in new technologies to turn
agricultural residues and wastes into useful construction
materials and therefore reduce dependence on wood products.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president noted that deforestation and land
degradation are taking place at a great pace in the country,
cautioning that unless drastic measures were taken, Tanzania and
many other African countries would soon experience
desertification.
</P>
<P>
He said that the indiscriminate use of forests is largely
caused by poverty, "symbolized by such negative practices as
rampant felling of trees for firewood and bad farming practices."
</P>
<P>
The dwindling rain forest reserves and rapid expansion of the
Sahara desert southwards pose a threat to the survival of the
people in the African countries, Juma warned.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by experts from 14 countries in
Africa and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Opposes Linking Trade to Conditionalities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it would
together with other developing countries continue to oppose
efforts to link trade to conditionalities such as human rights and
the environment.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is of the view that the extra-territorial application
of domestic legislations should be rejected since such action had
no basis of international jurisprudence and would operate to
undermine the World Trade Organization (WTO)'s multilateral
trading system, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
said in its 1996/97 report released today.
</P>
<P>
It said that regional trade agreements had been and would
remain an integral part of the world trading system with existing
regional trading arrangements continuing their process of widening
and deepening the economic integration of their member economies.
</P>
<P>
The 1996/97 International Trade and Industry Report said
several regional groupings had forged inter-regional economic
cooperation which included the EU's links with the CEE (Eastern
European Countries), CEFTA (Central European Free Trade Area), CIS
(Commonwealth of Independent States) and SADC (South African
Development Community), and ASEAN's links with CER (Closer
Economic Relations).
</P>
<P>
"To further strengthen economic cooperation among member
countries, regional groupings continued to focus on consolidating
and reviewing their activities which include deregulation, trade
liberalization and trade facilitation", it said.
</P>
<P>
The challenge is to ensure that the proliferation of regional
groupings will not operate to erode the multilateral trading
system and degenerate into competing regional economic blocs, it
said.

<HEADLINE> China to Send 198 Delegation to World University Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- China will send a 198-member team
to the 19th World University Games to be held from August 19 to 31
in Sicily, Italy, it was announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, the Chinese delegation includes 116
athletes. They will take part in eight out of 10 sports of the
games and are very competitive in diving, gymnastics, fencing and
some events of athletics.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Hailiang is one of China's gold hopefuls at the games.
The 20-year-old diver won the bronze medal of men's platform at
the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Cai Weiyan, a female pole vaulter, also has a good chance of
winning a medal at the Universiade. She finished third at last
year's world indoor championships and cleared 4.35 meters this
season.
</P>
<P>
Fan Hongbin leads a strong Chinese gymnastics team into the
games. A member of the silver-medal-winning team at the Atlanta
Olympics, Fan is highly favored to win some medals at the
Universiade, especially at his specialty of rings.
</P>
<P>
China will not send its swimmers to the games as they are
concentrated on preparing for the Pan Pacific Swimming
Championships to be held in Japan and the Eighth National Games to
be held in Shanghai in October.
</P>
<P>
The 19th World University Games are expected to attract more
than 6,000 athletes from some 150 countries and regions. The
games will feature in diving, swimming, water polo, gymnastics,
athletics, fencing, volleyball, basketball, football and
tennis.

WELLINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand share market

<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 workers of Zambia
Revenue Authority (ZRA) have been dismissed for alleged
corruption and other related charges, according to Times of
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper today quoted ZRA public relations manager
Michael Mwape as saying here on Monday that eight of those sacked
are from Lusaka, four from Kitwe, five from Ndola and the rest
from other stations.
</P>
<P>
He could not give an exact amount involved though he said the
sum is in millions.
</P>
<P>
Those removed include investigators and customs officers who
are alleged to have corruptly obtained government cash.
</P>
<P>
Mwape said corruption in the authority is still rampant
despite the good conditions of service for employees.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption is difficult to eradicate in an organization
dealing with a lot of money on a daily basis. The only thing you
can do is to reduce. Our officers are not solely to blame because
businessmen are the ones who offer bribes. But we are firm on
those proved to be involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged business community to be honest when dealing with ZRA
officers.

Lilia de Lima, director general of the Philippine Economic Zone
Authority, said the figure surpassed the whole year's target of 75
billion pesos (2.6 billion dollars) set by the government.
</P>
<P>
Investments were steadily going up in these zones due to the
strong confidence of investors in the country's economy and its
competitive workforce, she said.
</P>
<P>
De Lima belied reports that foreign investors are shying away
from the country because of so much politics. She revealed that at
least 25 Singapore-based electronics manufacturers have expressed
interest to set up factories in the country's economic zones this
year.
</P>
<P>
According to her, foreign investors not only brought huge
capitals into the country, but also helped ease the country's
unemployment pressure.
</P>
<P>
"To me, the solution to the present problem of unemployment and
underemployment in the country is the development of more economic
zones that will invite more foreign investors to come in," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of looking for jobs in urban centers, the jobless can
stay where they are while foreign companies go to these areas to
establish their factories there and hire the people right there,
de Lima said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has so far established 49 economic zones.

<HEADLINE> No Mercy on Fitness Test, Warns HKFA Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Football
Association (HKFA) would stand firm on its decision that those who
cannot pass the fitness tests will be barred from playing in the
First Division, officials have warned.
</P>
<P>
The "no mercy" warning was released by Peter Leung Shou-chi,
team director of first-division side South China, in the wake of
an obviously disappointing mock test here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eight members of the Hong Kong team for the National Games
later this year in Shanghai and another four from the first
division side Sing Tao failed to pass the standard which requires
running 3,000 meters within 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The failures had alarm bells ringing, local English-language
newspaper Hong Kong Standard commented Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Those who fail must not be allowed to register and the only
chance for them is to take the second test, said Leung, who is
also Hong Kong team's director.
</P>
<P>
"If they fail that as well, then sorry, they are out," he was
quoted by another local newspaper South China Morning Post as
saying. "Don't expect the HKFA to lower the standard," he added.
</P>
<P>
The four Sing Tao players will be barred from training with the
team and they had to take special physical training on their own,
team officials said.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no problem for a professional player to pass
the test. The referees have to run 2,800 meters in 12 minutes
before they can register with the HKFA. They have been doing that
for years and all around the world," said the team's coach Sin
Tik-hung.
</P>
<P>
HKFA announced months ago the decision that from the coming
season on players must undergo fitness tests before being allowed
to register.
</P>
<P>
The HKFA decision at once triggered anger among first division
players. But the game's local governing body insisted in going
ahead with the tests, saying that poor physical status was one of
the factors behind Hong Kong's declining playing standard.
</P>
<P>
The actual HKFA test is set for August 21.

<HEADLINE> UFO sightings in Cold War may have been spy planes, says CIA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- US national security
authorities systematically lied by explaining that United States
spy planes were often identified as UFOs during the Cold War, says
a recent study by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
</P>
<P>
The report claims that most sightings of unidentified flying
objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s stemmed from glimpses of
such spy planes as the U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird.
</P>
<P>
The study claims the US military were unwilling to disclose the
existence of aircraft developed to photograph enemy targets from
high altitudes. They chose instead to release false and misleading
stories.
</P>
<P>
This is the first admission of federal deception on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Both the CIA and the Air Force defended their lies yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"We sometimes take extraordinary means to protect national
security assets," said US Air Force spokeswoman Gloria Cales.
"We have classified programs that we need to protect."
</P>
<P>
The study, written by historian Gerald Haines, quoted CIA
officials who worked on the U-2 and Blackbird projects as saying,
"Over half of all UFO reports from the late 1950s through the
1960s were accounted for by manned reconnaissance flights" over
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"This led the Air Force to make misleading and deceptive
statements to the public in order to allay public fears and to
protect an extraordinarily sensitive national security project,"
the study said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployment in
New Zealand has reached its highest level since December 1994,
Radio NZ reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said the household labor force survey, the official measure
of unemployment in the country, shows that the number of
unemployed reached 122,000 in June, 14,000 more than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Now, the unemployment rate stands at 6.7 percent, representing
the second consecutive rise in one year. The unemployment rate
rose from 6.5 percent in March this year and from 6 percent a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
If not for the increase in part-time jobs, the rate would be
higher. Full time jobs declined by 5,000 in the three months to
June, offset by an increase of 6,000 part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, NZ's unemployment is still below the average
unemployment rate of 7.3 percent in the OECD countries.

PRAGUE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of cars stolen in the

average of nearly 75 cars stolen each day.
</P>
<P>
A senior Czech police officer said recently that in 1996 a
total of 27,500 cars were stolen in the country, six times the
number in 1989. Half the thefts occur in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Though most Czechs take every sorts of precautions, the officer
predicted a 10 percent increase in car-thefts this year. At the
moment, only 20 percent of all stolen cars are retrieved.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that most cars are stolen by crime organizations
that sell the booty abroad.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Seeks Foreign Banks' Greater Role in Industrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of the serious
liquidity crisis faced by the local commercial banks in extending
term loans to industrial sector, Dhaka has asked the foreign banks
to expand their operation in this sector, bank sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has asked the foreign banks to
expand their business in term lending to the industrial sector by
creating a new industrial financing consortium.
</P>
<P>
Sources in foreign banks said that a meeting between Finance
Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria and the chief executives of 12 foreign
banks doing business in Bangladesh was held Monday to discuss the
issue of industrial financing.
</P>
<P>
Operations of the foreign banks so far were restricted to only
trade financing. But the World Bank took the initiative in
involving the foreign banks in the term loans to support
industrial investment in the country, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the National Commercial Banks (NCBs) are now
facing a liquidity shortage and fail to meet the demand of
borrowing as a large chunk of their loans got stuck to defaulters.
</P>
<P>
As of June 12 this year, the total liquidity of the banking
system stood at 13.74 billion taka (about 3.16 billion U.S.
dollars) while the NCBs only had a paltry total of 276 million
taka (about 6.34 million dollars) in excess liquidity.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, foreign banks' excess liquidity stood at
5.83 billion taka (about 134 million dollars) in the same period
and local private banks enjoyed a total of 5.16 billion taka
(about 118 million dollars) excess liquidity.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Justifies Denial of Asylum to Hondurans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's foreign ministry
today justified its decision to dislodge a group of Hondurans
seeking refugee at its embassy in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The embassy was occupied on July 28 by 16 indigenous peasants
of Honduras, who were asking Costa Rica for asylum on claims of
harassments and threats by cattle dealers, land owners and
Honduran militaries.
</P>
<P>
After analyzing the case, the Costa Rican foreign ministry
refused to offer the peasants asylum for lacking good reasons.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo said the decision to resort
to police to end the illegal occupation was taken after
consultation with President Jose Maria Figueres.
</P>
<P>
Honduran police on Sunday dislodged the peasants from the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
According to Costa Rican officials, the dislogement was carried
out by unarmed police without violence. But the peasants
complained they were treated violently.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters' Strike Cripples Package Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of American
businesses today were forced to scramble for other ways to send
packages as a result of the Teamsters Union's nationwide strike
against United Parcel Service (UPS).
</P>
<P>
There were no new talks scheduled for the nation's biggest
package delivery service and the 185,000 striking Teamsters on
their dispute over pay, pensions and the use of part-timers.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton ruled out federal
intervention in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they'll go back to the (negotiating) table. But at this
time I don't think any further action by me is appropriate," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The walkout against UPS, which delivers 12 million parcels a
day, or 80 percent of the nation's package deliveries, immediately
affected people on both the sending and receiving ends.
</P>
<P>
The UPS' chief rival, the Postal Service, was hard-pressed to
handle the overflow business, imposing a limit of four parcels per
window customer.
</P>
<P>
Also, FedEx, which normally ships 2.8 million packages a day,
saw its volume approach last Christmas' record of four million.
</P>
<P>
Teamsters President Ron Carey, who walked out of the federally
mediated talks Sunday night, said UPS forced the strike by
refusing to resolve such concerns as the large number -- about 60
percent -- of part-time unionized jobs.
</P>
<P>
The UPS chief negotiator Dave Murray challenged the Teamsters
leadership to let its members vote on the company's final offer
made last week.
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters represent nearly two-thirds of UPS' 302,000
employees in the U.S. The walkout is the first nationwide strike
in UPS' 90-year history.
</P>
<P>
The union is demanding that UPS rely less on part-timers and
hire more full-timers. But UPS says it has three- to four-hour
busy periods in the morning and afternoon, and the company
wouldn't be competitive enough if it guaranteed all employees a
full-time job.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were also in dispute over the company's desire to
withdraw from the Teamsters' multi-employer pension and health
funds.
</P>
<P>
The UPS said it would improve its employees' pensions, but the
union called the move a deal killer.
</P>
<P>
Besides a modest increase from the top wage of 20 U.S. dollars
an hour, the company said its offer included profit-sharing
bonuses beginning with 3,060 dollars for full-time employees and
1,530 dollars for part-timers.

KATHMANDU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kathmandu-based World Hindu
Federation (WHF) has threatened to launch nationwide
demonstrations against the Adventist Development and Relief Agency
(ADRA) unless it stops its illegal activities in Nepal
immediately.
</P>
<P>
A WHF press release said that unless the ADRA stops its illegal
activities within a week from August 4, the WHF will launch a
nationwide demonstration and press the Nepali government to take
legal action to demoralize and discredit it nationally and

The WHF also threatened to take the matter to the International

The ADRA, an international non-governmental organization who
entered Nepal a few years ago, is supposed to provide health and

<P>
BONN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany, Poland and the Czech
Republic decided today to cooperate more closely in fighting Oder
River floods.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of environmental protection of the three eastern
European countries meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, decided to form
a task force in the existing committee for protecting the Oder to
formulate action plans for flood prevention and disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
The Oder is the border river between Germany and Poland. Since
early July, heavy storms have been battering the bordering areas
of the three countries, with rainfall about 10 times that of the
same period in the past.
</P>
<P>
Rising waters breached dams and inundated farmland, city
streets and homes, killing more than 100 people in Poland and the
Czech Republic and leaving hundreds of thousands of people
homeless.
</P>
<P>
Experts have put the estimated losses caused by the floods at
three billion deutsche marks.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 troops of the German Defense Forces took part
in flood fighting, for first time since the reunification of
Germany in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Weighs Line-Item Veto Power Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today he has not yet decided whether to strike out individual
items in the comprehensive tax and budget bills awaiting his
signature, noting that his new line-item veto authority ought to
be used "somewhat sparingly."
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to sign the budget and tax-cut bills on
Tuesday. After signing them, he has five days to decide whether to
cut out individual items.
</P>
<P>
Voicing his support for the line-item veto, Clinton told
reporters during a photo session, "I think if we have it, it ought
to be used. I believe that it ought to be used somewhat sparingly."
</P>
<P>
Before the new law was passed last year, the only way
presidents could reject spending laws was to veto whole budget
bills. Clinton is the first president to have line-item veto
authority.
</P>
<P>
He said his aides were still reviewing the tax and budget bills
to determine which items were open to the line-item veto, or
whether any of them should be stricken.
</P>
<P>
Last week, House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said
he doubted Clinton would veto specific items, saying that to do so
would violate the spirit of the bipartisan negotiations between
the White House and the Congress.

<HEADLINE> Fish Oil May Reduce Breast Cancer Risk: experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Fish oils may change the
composition of human breast tissue in a way that could reduce the
risk of getting breast cancer, United States experts here say.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Johnson Cancer Center, in the University of
California, explained that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in
omega-6, found in vegetable oils, are metabolized into
hormone-like substances which promote the growth of cancer
cells. But the PUFAs in omega-3, found in fish oils, are
metabolized into prostaglandin that inhibits cancer cell growth.
</P>
<P>
In a study conducted by the center, 25 women with breast cancer
adopted a three-month diet heavy in fish oils, soy products and a
variety of vegetables. They were found to have experienced a
four-fold increase in the ratio of omega-3 PUFAs to omega-6 PUFAs
in their plasma, and a 1.4-fold increase in their breast tissue.
</P>
<P>
John Glaspy, who led the study, said he was very optimistic
about these results.
</P>
<P>
Dilprit Bagga, the nutritionist for the study, said that a high
ratio of omega-3 PUFAs to omega-6 PUFAs did inhibit breast cancer
by both preventing it and by down-sizing tumors where cancer
already existed.
</P>
<P>
Asian women have about one third as much breast cancer as
American women. Their breasts contain a higher amount of omega-3
PUFAs.
</P>
<P>
Japanese women, who have a low incidence of breast cancer by
following a traditional Japanese diet, faced an equally high
frequency of breast cancer with American women when they went to
the United States and adopted Western diets.

<HEADLINE> Manila's Inflation Rate Target Unchanged: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite the peso depreciation and
the recent oil increase, the Philippines government's average
inflation rate target for 1997 would remain at 6 to 6.5 percent, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published here today, Philippine Secretary of
Socio-economic Planning Cielito Habito said that even if the
inflation rate averaged at 8 percent during the second half of
this year, the country's annual average would settle at 6.3
percent, still within the range of the original inflation rate
target.
</P>
<P>
Triggered by the economic crisis in Thailand and speculations
in the foreign exchange market, the Philippine currency has
depreciated 10 percent since July 11 and is now sold at 29 pesos
for the U.S. dollar. The peso depreciation has prompted price
increases in many sectors.
</P>
<P>
But Habito said that the National Economic and Development
Authority headed by him had already factored in the oil price
increase, effect of the El Nino phenomenon and the peso
depreciation to its final computation.
</P>
<P>
"What we came out with is a modest 6 percent to 6.5 percent
figure. In fact, we already incorporated an assumed 0.40 peso (per
liter) oil price increase last July, but the increase only
materialized this month," Habito said.
</P>
<P>
"The inflation rate average was only at 4.6 percent last
semester. If we are to follow the government's range, then we can
afford to have an average of 8 percent this second half to get 6.3
percent by year's end," he said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in the Philippines traditionally increases
during the second half of the year due to resumption of classes,
the holiday season and other activities that require bigger
budgets.

<HEADLINE> Hungry Is World's Eighth Biggest Tourist Destination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Hungary has become the world's
eighth biggest tourist destination, the latest report of the World
Tourism Organization said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, a traditionally important sector of Hungary's economy,
developed at a fast speed in the early 1990s. The number of
visitors to the central European country reached 40 million for
the first time in 1993, and has stayed around that figure each
year since then.
</P>
<P>
Hungary earned 2.2 billion U.S. dollars from its tourist
industry in 1996, an 30 percent increase on the previous year and
almost 3 times the amount in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The country has hosted an annual International Tourism Fair
since 1978, and this year's fair attracted more than 80,000
visitors from nearly 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
Now Hungary has decided to develop tourism in the countryside
as a special attraction and turn its capital city into a center of
international conference for eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on the number of visitors, ranks the United
States as the biggest tourist destination in the world, followed
by Spain, Italy, Britain, China and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Set to Modernize After Joining ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has set objectives and
goals for modernizing and developing the country after its
admission into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
today's official paper The New Light of Myanmar quoted senior
leader Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting here Monday to commemorate the ASEAN's
30th anniversary, Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the State Law
and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), called for efforts step by
step based on the prevailing internal political and economic
situation to advance the country's economic development in
cooperation with the other ASEAN member nations.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is also chairman of Myanmar's Leading Committee
for ASEAN Affairs, urged respective ministries to establish a good
economic foundation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar has become a full-fledged member of the ASEAN,
there is much work to be done, he said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed Myanmar's ASEAN admission to the results of
friendly relations and reciprocity forged during the last visits
to the Southeast Asian countries of SLORC Chairman Senior General
Than Shwe and to the mutual respect and understanding among
Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that criticism, both positive and negative, emerged
from inside and outside the country regarding Myanmar's entry into
the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the criticism is like, efforts are to be
multiplied on self-reliance for the development of our country
like other ASEAN member nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, along with Laos, became a full member of ASEAN on July
23, which also embraces Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Students in Japan Gather for Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The "Japan Tent", an annual
gathering of foreign students studying in Japan, entered a new
stage Monday as participants began to stay with Japanese families.
</P>
<P>
About 350 foreign students from nearly 100 countries and
regions attended the eight-day gathering, held at Ishikawa
Prefecture in central Japan. The 64 Chinese students are the
largest group among the participants.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony on Friday, Ishikawa Prefecture Governor
Masanori Tanimoto, a co-sponsor of the event, said he hoped
foreign students would know more about Japan's nature and culture
through the activities.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 foreign students had participated in the
activity since 1988, when the first Japan Tent was held.
</P>
<P>
The tent has played an active role in boosting exchanges
between Japan and other countries, Tanimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Minister of Education and Culture Takashi Kosugi,
former United Nations General Secretary Boutros-Boutros Gali and
some foreign diplomats in Japan attended Friday's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In a special speech to the students, Gali urged them to gain a
new understanding of the role of international law in promoting
world peace in the post-Cold War era, which features continued
regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador to Japan Xu Dunxin also sent a message to
the gathering, saying the Japan Tent had played, and would
continue to play, an active role in promoting international
exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The event is scheduled to end on August 8.

<HEADLINE> Italy returns Nazi-looted jewelry to Jewish community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Italy returned jewelry looted by
German Nazis during World War II to their Jewish owners living
in Trieste, a northeastern port city.
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi and leader of the
Trieste Jewish community Tullia Zevi yesterday attended the
handover ceremony of the jewelry, which was contained in five
large sacks and estimated to be worth 70 billion lire (about
39 million U.S. dollars) today.
</P>
<P>
The jewels were a part of the cache looted by Nazis but
captured by Allies while being transported to Germany. Owners
claimed some of the jewels in 1957, while the rest have been
stored in the warehouse of Trieste's bank.
</P>
<P>
Trieste's Jewish community lodged a claim for these items last
year. They plan to display them for owners to identify and sell
the unclaimed jewels and use the money for humanitarian purposes.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said the jewels' significance lies not in their value,
but that they symbolize the miseries the Jews once suffered.
</P>
<P>
Zevi praised the Italian government for returning the jewels,
saying it would serve as an example for other countries still
holding Jewish jewelry.

BUENOS AIRES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentina ranks second
worldwide on honey exports for its sales of 52,291 tons of
the product to overseas markets in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China occupied the first place with 55,000 tons exports.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that Argentina this year will produce 72,000
tons to rank the third in the world, due to the diminished

</P>
<P>
Among buyers of Argetinan honey is Germany, that bought last
year 18,800 tons, almost 36 percet of the total, followed by the
U.S. with 16,700 (32 percent).
</P>
<P>
Honey prices last year have risen due to a downfall in main
exporters like Mexico and China, the constant demand for the
product and the decrease of subsidies in industrialized countries.

<HEADLINE> Fish Farming Helps Rice Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Fish breeding is a way for
Chinese farmers to "kill two birds with one stone."
</P>
<P>
The lucrative practice of raising fish in paddy fields allows
China to promote both rice growth and the harvesting of aquatic
products, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
One hectare of the standard rice-and-fish field is expected to
produce 7,500 kilograms of rice and 750 kilograms of fish annually.
</P>
<P>
Scientific research suggests fish farming in the paddy fields
increases rice production up to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say ridge exposes the rice crop to sunshine while fish
eat pests.
</P>
<P>
China can develop another 6.7 million hectares of paddies into
lucrative fields, says Li Qianyun, an official with the Ministry
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has promoted the technology during several
conferences throughout the decade. Pilot bases are being
constructed across the country to prove it is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has reports suggesting that more
than 1.4 million hectares of rice fields have been developed, a 13
percent increase from last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Hikes Overnight Lending Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines Monday hiked its overnight lending rate from 22
percent to 26 percent while maintaining its overnight borrowing
rate at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's new overnight lending rate is higher than
the 21 percent to 22 percent inter-bank call loan rate, the rate
banks charge each other for overnight borrowing.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a situation where banks are borrowing from us
and re-lending at inter-bank rates," Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aside from maintaining its tight grip on liquidity, the central
bank is thus effectively discouraging banks to borrow from the
institution to curb monetary expansion.
</P>
<P>
"There could have been banks in need of liquidity and would
have come to us. We're prepared to lend at a higher price," said
Amando Tetangco, the central bank's managing director for research
and treasury.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the increase in the bank's lending rate
may represent the bank's efforts to mop up more funds from the
system.
</P>
<P>
The move is also perceived as a way to establish a floor on
further rise in commercial bank's interest rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Gross sales of personal computers
in China will exceed three million units this year, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the year, PC sales amounted to 1.4
million units, as opposed to 2.1 million units for the whole of
1996.
</P>
<P>
"The computer market this year is in real good shape," said
Zhang Qi, director general of the Department of Computer and IT
Advancement of the Ministry of Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
The big increase in PC sales is mainly a result of the
nationwide build-up of the information infrastructure, which
accounts for more than 90 percent of PC supplies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an increasing number of Chinese families have bought
desktop PCs for processing information and accessing the internet,
she said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half year, China's computer industry generated 57
billion yuan (6.87 billion US dollars), up 42.5 percent on the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The import and export of computers amounted to 5.7 billion US
dollars, of which exports rose 42 percent to 3.7 billion US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Suspends Contacts With Bosnian Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, Aug 4 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish foreign ministry today
announced suspension of contacts with Bosnia's ambassador in
Stockholm, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on a recommendation made by the
International High Representative in postwar Bosnia, Carlos
Westendorp, said Gun-Britt Andersson, Under Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp told reporters in Sarajevo on Saturday he had
recommended to Western powers that no ambassador be treated as a
legitimate representative of Bosnia until a law governing Bosnian
ambassadorial appointment was passed.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton Peace Agreement required the Bosnian Authorities
settle before August 1 the differences over how nearly 30
ambassadorial posts should be divided among Serbs, Croats and
Moslems. No agreement has been reached on the question.
</P>
<P>
Andersson said the international community must be very serious
in carrying out the peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Week's Rain Lifts Harvest's Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 5 (Xinhua) -- North and Northeast China's
crops, particularly autumn crops to be harvested in the next two
months, are expected to be lifted out of this summer's severe
drought with more rainfall, today's China Daily quoted Ministry of
Agriculture sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rains averaging from 25 to 50 millimeters have showered
millions of hectares of thirsty crops in parts of the provinces
between July 27 and Saturday, officials for the State
Flood-Control and Drought-Prevention Headquarters (SFCDPH) said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
This may reduce the possibility of severe crop failure, which
worried agriculture officials a few weeks ago, experts said. More
than 70 percent of China's annual total grain yield depends
heavily on its autumn harvest.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Agricultural officials made it clear that last
week's rainfall has eased the persistent drought in parts of
Northwest China's arid Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi provinces, North
China's Hebei Province, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and
parts of Northeast China's Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang
provinces, as well.
</P>
<P>
Precipitation recorded at 10 to 20 millimeters alleviated
drought situations in eastern Liaoning, middle and western Jilin,
western Heilongjiang provinces and northeastern parts of the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The British jury in a sensational
soccer match-fixing trial reported on Monday that it had still not
been able to agree on its verdicts after two days of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The judge at the court in Winchester, southern England, where
the trial is now in its 43rd day, sent the five men and six women
home for the night after their foreman reported their failure to
come to any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
In the trial, former top players Bruce Grobbelaar, 39, John
Fashanu, 34, Hans Segers, 35, and Malaysian businessman Heng Suan
Lim, 32, are accused of conspiring to give or accept corrupt
payments to influence the result of matches.
</P>
<P>
It is alleged they were part of a plot involving an Asian
betting syndicate to rig English premier league games.
</P>
<P>
The jury at a previous trial in the same case, which ended
earlier this year, failed to reach a verdict.

in leading Philippine newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine businessmen warned Monday that prices of basic
commodities will go up by 3 percent to 4 percent starting next
month if the government cannot control the peso rate to the 28.50
level and reduce the interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Business Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine Central Bank has projected that the recent
peso depreciation would help trim the country's trade deficit this
year from the original projection of 13.848 billion U.S. dollars
to 12.536 billion dollars, because of increases in export revenues
and reduction of import growth.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine authorities expect the remittances of
overseas Filipino workers this year to exceed the 1996 total of
4.9 billion U.S. dollars but doubt that the country's gross
international reserves will reach 14 billion dollar level as
originally projected.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine Defense Secretary Renato de Villa said Monday
that he submitted his resignation to President Fidel Ramos, and

<HEADLINE> NZ Wool Export Earnings Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's wool exports
fell 8 percent in terms of value in the last season which ended in
June 30.
</P>
<P>
The decline was caused by the weaker demand, particularly from
its largest market China/Hong Kong, although demand from some
other markets remained buoyant, professional magazine Wools of New
Zealand said in its latest market review.
</P>
<P>
The review said exports to China/Hong Kong dropped 33 percent
during the first six months of the season. Demand recovered in the
final two months of the season, but the season ended with
China/Hong Kong buying a little over 50,000 tons of NZ wool
compared with around 70,000 tons in the previous season.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sheep numbers in NZ sank to a new low of 47.4
million in 1996, down 3 percent from 48.8 million in 1995.
However, the decline in sheep numbers was offset by an increase in
clip per head and a rundown in grower-held stocks.

<HEADLINE> Brisk Shanghai Apartment Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Shanghai purchased
an average 100 apartments daily in the first half of this year,
twice the average in last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the city's real estate trade center show that
1.9 million sq.m. of housing were sold during the period, with
individuals purchasing 18,700 apartments covering 1.5 million
square meters.
</P>
<P>
Constantly rising income levels have made housing more
affordable for local residents, with individuals accounting for
some 50 percent of total housing sold between 1994-1996.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the rapid growth in individual housing
purchases to extensive sales promotion campaigns by real estate
agents and increased housing loans offered by banks.
</P>
<P>
Individuals purchased a record 80 percent of housing sold
during the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The majority of individuals purchased apartments to improve
living conditions, with others considering purchases as an
investment.
</P>
<P>
Brisk sales were recorded for housing in the medium price
range, with a sluggish market for more expensive ones in the
downtown area.

<HEADLINE> Pak Official Leaves for Iran on Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Additional Foreign
Secretary on Afghanistan Iftikhar Murshed left here for Teheran
Monday night in a bid to coordinate his country's Afghan policy
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Teheran, he will hold talks with Iranian
officials on diplomatic efforts for the restoration of peace in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Iran should work concertedly to get peace
materialized in the strife-torn Afghanistan as "the two countries
have suffered the most" because of the problem, Murshed told the
media before his departure for Teheran.
</P>
<P>
"We will coordinate our policies with Iranian brothers. Once
the Afghan groups are brought within the negotiating range for an
intra-Afghan dialogue we hope to invite countries with common
borders with Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Teheran is in reciprocity to Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister Allaudin Broujerdi's visit to Islamabad last
month.
</P>
<P>
During Broujerdi's visit, the two countries agreed to use their
influence to induce the Afghan warring factions to enter into
negotiations for peace in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> US Asks Palestinians to Take Concrete Security Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States today called
on the Palestinian Authority to take real actions on security
matters in the wake of the suicide bomb attack at a Jerusalem
market last week, which killed 15 people.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for concrete, sustained, concerted, consistent
actions" against terrorism, State Department spokesman James Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. Middle East mediator Dennis Ross will take this
message to the Palestinian leadership when he travels to the
region later this week, once the period of mourning in Israel for
the victims of the bombings is over.
</P>
<P>
During his upcoming visit to the Middle East, Ross "will have
what is essentially a security brief. We will support any measure
that enhances security," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas assured Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy by telephone today that the
Palestinians were prepared to resume full security cooperation
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, however, complained that the measures taken
by the Israelis were aimed at the whole Palestinian Authority as
if they were the enemies.

<HEADLINE> US Special Operations Command Wants Quicker Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Special Operations
Command plans to accelerate its purchase of 50 CV-22 tiltrotor
aircraft, acquiring all the planes by 2006 rather than 2008, the
U.S. Defense News said in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was specially designed and equipped for special
forces operations. The aircraft was being built by Forth Worth,
Texas-based Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. and Boeing Defense and
Space Group's Helicopters Division. It takes off like a
helicopter. Once airborne, its two propellers tilt forward,
allowing it to fly like a conventional aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Prepared by the command's Fixed-Wing Special Operations
Acquisition Center, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, the plan
proposes expediting the purchase at a cost of 338 million U.S.
dollars by buying the first two CV-22s in 2000 rather than 2001,
and buying two additional aircraft -- six planes instead of four
-- each year through 2005.
</P>
<P>
The cost of buying two aircraft a year earlier than planned was
estimated to be 239 million dollars. Accelerated purchase of the
aircraft's electronics would be 99 million dollars. Total
acquisition costs of the 50 aircraft would be 4.06 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Gore Approves Plan for 12 Bln Dlr US Arms Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. defense procurement
spending would rise by 12 billion U.S. dollars, or 29 percent, by
2000, under a series of initiatives approved by Vice President Al
Gore recently, the Defense News reported.
</P>
<P>
This would allocate 54 billion dollars to the purchase of
defense hardware, compared with the 42 billion dollar spending
plan for 1997, the military weekly said in its August 4-10
edition.
</P>
<P>
It said that a 54 billion dollar procurement budget in 2000
also is a goal of the Quadrennial Defense Review, released in May,
and the forthcoming second National Performance Review in
September will recommend some ways to raise the money, U.S.
Department of Defense officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 goals have been created to trim billions from operation
and support budgets and transfer the proceeds to procurement.
Among the goals are disposing of 145,000 acres of surplus
property, 12 billion dollars worth of supplies, 3 billion dollars
of government-owned tooling and equipment and 2.2 billion dollars
of National Defense Stockpile inventory, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The goals also include privatizing 30,000 housing units,
eliminating layers of management, and reducing the annual release
of toxic chemicals to 2.6 million kilograms from 3.3 million
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The weekly also said that Gore approved Pentagon goals to
reduce by one-quarter the time it takes to deliver weapons; for
example, new weapons would be delivered in eight years rather than
the average 11 years it takes to move hardware from design to
initial production.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States today joined
its Western European allies in suspending contact with Bosnian
envoys to try to force the Bosnian government to fairly divide
ambassadorial posts.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to suspend contact with the accredited Bosnian
ambassador, effective immediately," State Department spokesman
James Foley told a regular news briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
But Foley added that the suspension will not affect economic
assistance to Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France and other European countries decided to suspend
contact with Bosnian envoys Sunday under the recommendation of
Carlos Westendorp, the international high representative in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp made the recommendation after Bosnian leaders failed
to meet an August 1 deadline for agreement on the division of
33 ambassador posts among Serbs, Croats and Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Israel to Resume Negotiations with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today urged the Israeli
government to return to the negotiation table with the
Palestinians in order to revive the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
While meeting a delegation of Israeli lawmakers, Jordanian
Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali said Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu must demonstrate "the true desire for achieving
peace."
</P>
<P>
Jordan would try hard to reinvigorate peace negotiations and
break the current stalemate which was worsened by Hamas suicide
bombings in West Jerusalem last Wednesday, he told the Israeli
legislators who arrived here earlier Monday for talks on means to
reactive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the kingdom also backed the Egyptian mediation
between Israel and the Palestinians, Majali was quoted by Radio
Jordan as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the peace process, the Palestinians should fully regain
their rights, including the right of statehood, he added.
</P>
<P>
All sides could be winners only by peace, but this required
drop of intransigence and adoption of flexible dialog, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
As to the Jerusalem bombings that killed 15 people, Majali said
that Jordan opposed all forms of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Building confidence was the only way to prevent extremists and
the enemies of peace from achieving their goals, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli legislators told Majali that Jordan enjoyed high
credibility with the Israeli people and could play a leading role
in improving the situation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
They hoped that King Hussein of Jordan would personally
intercede to help the peace process out of the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been deadlocked for more than four
months since Israel declared to build Jewish settlements in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. Jordan and
Egypt are the only Arab countries that achieved peace with the
Jewish state.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran today exchanged 47 Iraqi
soldiers' remains for 15 Iranian soldiers' remains left from the
1980-88 war between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the two
sides made the exchange at Shalamcheh border region in
southwestern Iran.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Iranian Brigadier General Mirfaisal
Baqerzadeh, head of the committee in charge of search for those
missing in action, also exchanged views with his Iraqi
counterpart Rabah Ali on swap of the remaining bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi military official promised to solve the remaining
issues between the two sides as far as he is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Baqerzadeh underlined the importance of freeing the Iranian
prisoners of war still held captive in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the remains of the Iranian soldiers
were found in the operational zones of Valfajr-8 and Faw in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The remains of 60 Iranian soldiers had been exchanged for the
those of 77 Iraqi soldiers on January 14, 1997 at Shalamcheh
border region.
</P>
<P>
On April 15, Iran exchanged remains of 20 Iranian soldiers for
remains of 55 Iraqi soldiers at Shalamcheh border region.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of remains of soldiers from the two sides is
regarded as a goodwill gesture to improve the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war from 1980 to 1988.
Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said earlier that
the damages inflicted by the eight-year Iraqi imposed war on
Iran totals 1,000 billion dollars, equal to 80 years of Iran's
income from oil exports.

leaders how to open up new fields of cooperations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
There is no limit as regard to the fields of cooperations
among the Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa, he said,
adding that Mozambique would like to see strengthened
cooperations with Angola in every field.
</P>
<P>
He denied the bilateral relations between Mozambique and
Angola have been at a standstill, but admitted that visits to
each country by its leaders have been less since they have to
focus their efforts on the peace process at home.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, bilateral ties have been developing as
leaders of the two countries have met time and again at sessions
of the summit meetings of the Organization of African Unity and
of the community of Portuguese speaking countries, etc.
</P>
<P>
The realization of peace in the two countries have paved way
for more visits between leaders of the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Simo arrived here from South Africa and he will leave for Cape
Verde, an island country off Senegal in the Atlantic Ocean.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel today made a gesture
to new Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, calling for bettering
relations with Iran, a country the Jewish state regards as its
potential arch enemy.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry, in an official statement, expressed
hope that Khatami who was formally sworn in as president today,
would open what it called a new page in relations between Iran and
all its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, a 54-year-old Shi'ite Muslim clergyman known for his
moderate political views, took over as Iran's new president
Sunday. He said the Islamic republic sought friendly relations
with all countries.
</P>
<P>
The latest political development in Iran has been followed
up closely in Israel. Israel has been wondering whether the
new president will change Iran's support for the Lebanese
guerrilla organization Hezbollah in its struggle against Israeli
occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the long-run, Chief of the General Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak last week warned of the danger that Iran, with
the help of the Russians, will be able to build long-range
missiles that can hit Israel.
</P>
<P>
In his speech before the powerful Knesset (Parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee, the army chief said that Iran
is also making great efforts to develop its nuclear capability.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Set up Commission for Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Attorney General Amos
Wako today issued a draft bill proposing the establishment of a
commission to collect views of Kenyans for constitutional
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill to be introduced in Parliament for debate soon
was published in a special issue of the Kenya Gazette supplement
today.
</P>
<P>
Wako said that, once enacted, the bill would enable Kenyan
people to freely participate in and contribute to the debate for
changing the current Constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the proposed commission will be
comprised of commissioners appointed by the President from
religious organizations, political parties, trade unions and
other bodies.
</P>
<P>
The bill said that the chairman of the commission must be an
eminent lawyer with a speciality in constitutional matters and
laws.
</P>
<P>
The commission, if established, will complete its work within
24 months from the date of its appointment and present its report
to the president who will in turn send it to the speaker of the
National Assembly for presentation to a select committee for
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The National Convention Executive Committee (NCEC), an
alliance grouping leaders from Opposition parties, religious
organizations and civil society, wants total constitutional
reforms within two years to curb presidential powers and create a
level political playing field.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the period for the appointment of the
commissioners, a national debate and the approval of reforms by
parliament could last more than three years.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi met religious leaders here
today to discuss issues of constitutional reforms and maintenance
of peace and security in this east African country.

LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Major share prices on the European
markets all extended last week's decline and ended sharply lower
Monday, with Frankfurt falling more than 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Leading shares on the London market recovered most of their
losses after Wall Street staged its own recovery from an early
sell-off. The FTSE 100 index closed at 4895.7, 3.6 points down.
</P>
<P>
As in the US, the specter of another imminent interest rate
rise hung over dealings, despite some promising half-year results.
</P>
<P>
German shares suffered the most losses among the three major
European markets as interest rate worries pushed the DAX-30 index
below the key 4,300-level for the first time since July 22 and
down 111.85 points at 4,296.94 by the end of the session.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean FM Missing After Failed Abidjan Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean foreign minister
has disappeared in Abidjan after leading the aborted talks last
week, a report from the Ivorian capital here said today.
</P>
<P>
Pallo Bangura and senior diplomat, Dauda Kamara, have not been
seen for several days at the luxury Hotel Ivoire in Abidjan,
where they and a dozen compatriots held talks with the west
African foreign ministers last week.
</P>
<P>
The talks broke off last Thursday morning after coup leader
Major Johnny Koroma announced the junta's intention to stay in
power for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The position runs counter to the requirement of the foreign
ministers of Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire, who,
mandated by the Economic Community of West African States, held
two rounds of talks with the junta's delegation for ways to
return the rule to a civilian government.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted "well-placed sources" in Abidjan as saying
that Bangura and Kamara requested and received an audience with
Ivorian Foreign Minister Amara Essy on Friday and did not return
to the hotel afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean press reports reaching here today hinted that
Bangura was seeking political asylum in Ethiopia, where he had
served in the Sierra Leonean embassy, while Kamara could have
sought refuge in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangura's wife was reported to have criticized her
husband vehemently for associating himself with the junta.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Minister: War-torn Economy Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's war-torn economy has
been well on its way of recovering from the damages estimated at
200 billion U.S. dollars inflicted by the 1990 Iraqi invasion,
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister Nasser Al-Rudhan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the major indication of the economic recovery is
the decline in the state's budget deficit from 6 billion dinars
(19.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 1990-91 fiscal year ending June 30
to 693 million dinars (2.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Inflation stands at a comfortable rate of two percent while
other production indexes and indicators also restored to pre-war
levels, according to the minister in an interview by the Saudi
Arabic daily Okaz published in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, today.
</P>
<P>
The GDP recorded a 17 percent growth rate to reach 30 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait spent a total of 70 billion U.S. dollars in the
reconstruction process, said Rudhan, also the financial minister,
who was quoted by the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
High oil prices in the international market also played a major
role in the recovery, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another measure the government took to boost the economy is to
diversify income sources rather than being limited to oil as the
only major state revenues generating source.
</P>
<P>
Al-Roudhan also pointed out that the government is intended
to privatize state-owned companies and issue its privatization law
this year in a bid to enhance the role of the private sector,
which controls 75 percent of the country's general domestic
production.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economic Situation Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government today
issued a statement, saying that the economic situation is under
control following a decision by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to halt an aid package to Kenya last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the government reaffirmed its
commitment to reform process with available resources for
priority programs.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued here after the Kenyan cabinet held a
meeting to discuss a number of issues, especially the economic
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Kenyan people to continue promoting the economy
on the basis of their own resources so that the development of
the country would remain firmly in the hands of Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
A more comprehensive statement will be issued at a later date
by the government after the IMF decision is adequately analyzed,
it said.
</P>
<P>
On August 1, Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said
that his government was committed to maintaining economic
stability following the IMF suspension of the three-year Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
He announced that the government would cut its expenditure for
the 1997/98 fiscal year and take sufficient revenue measures to
safeguard the macro economic stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister conceded that "this (the IMF decision)
could have serious repercussions. It could dent investors'
confidence, affect the Shilling, affect inflation and it is
something that could shake confidence in the economy."
</P>
<P>
The suspension of a total of 215 million U.S. Dollars loan
caused an initial panic at the local financial markets with the
Kenyan currency of Shilling depreciating from 59 to 61 versus a
Dollar last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Shilling opened at 62.50 to the Dollar and later
weakened to nearly 63, three percent down from Friday's close.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ground Forces Command Staff to Be Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The command staff of the Russian
ground forces will be more than halved before the end of the year,
the Interfax news agency quoted an official as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
The official said "a new command structure is being drafted and
the reduction will start in September." As many as 320 of the
current 700 command personnel will remain by January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The remaining personnel will man the ground forces headquarters,
which will include military hardware, logistics and military
education services, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ground forces will be eventually transformed into
general-purpose force, whose commander will simultaneously serve
as deputy defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The ground forces, which are to become an element of an
all-purpose force, will gradually be reduced from 420,000 to
200,000 servicemen.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the lower status of the ground force
command is attributable to the upgrading of military, which are to
become operational and strategic commands to which all services
stationed in their areas will be subordinated.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of armed units now at the disposal of other
ministries being subordinated to military district commands is
under consideration, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of military academies will be cut by nearly half
from the present 102, the official said. In particular, the Armor
Academy and the Frunze Academy are to merge.
</P>
<P>
The disbandment of superfluous military schools is to be
brought to completion before September 1, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader to Attend Peace Talks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktas is to attend the second round of U.N.-sponsored direct
talks with Cypriot President Glafkos Clerides in Switzerland,
according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued following a meeting of Turkish Cypriot
self-styled cabinet in northern part of Nicosia said that Denktas
will fly to the Swiss town of Montreaux for the talks scheduled
for next Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet has reached the decision to attend the talks
planned to be held in Switzerland on August 11," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, however, warned that the Turkish Cypriot
delegation will leave the negotiating table if the European
Union (EU) starts the accession talks with the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission announced last month that Cyprus was
included in the ranks of the prospective EU membership
candidates, triggering strong reaction from both Turkey and the
Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry has warned that the European
Commission's recommendation would greatly jeopardize the ongoing
Cyprus talks aimed at bringing a lasting solution to the divided
island.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government today welcomed the decision by Denktash
to attend the second round of U.N.-sponsored direct talks.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Denktash's decision to go to Switzerland. Each
side will outline its views and arguments at the talks next
week," Cypriot government spokesman Manolis Christofides said at
his daily press briefing in Nicosia today.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took over the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which
was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Denktash threatened not to go to the talks unless
the European Union suspended the accession negotiations with
Cyprus, due to begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash met last month at Troutbeck, near New
York, in the first round of direct talks sponsored by the U.N. for
the first time in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
They had two meetings last week in Nicosia under the auspices
of the U.N. Resident Representative on the island, Gustave
Feissel, to discuss humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in
northern Cyprus to protect the security of the Turkish Cypriots
there.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- World indoor champion Sabine Braun of
Germany added the outdoor world title to her credit by winning the
women's heptathlon with a total of 6,739 points at the 6th World
Athletics Championships here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Olympic bronze medallist Denise Lewis of Britain finished second
with 6,654 points ahead of Remegiya Nazaroviene of Lithuania, 6,566.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of injuried Olympic and defending champion Ghada
Shouaa of Syria, the two-day, seven-event contest was dominated
completely by Braun.
</P>
<P>
Braun, the 1991 world champion who competed in her fifth world
championships, won the first two events - 100m hurdles and high jump -
to lead the total. She increased the gap after the first six events,
beating Lewis by 82 points.
</P>
<P>
"It all went by itself, even the 800 meters came to me very easy.
So for tonight, I plan a party with my friends, who supported me so
well over the two days," said Braun after the win.
</P>
<P>
Lewis told the press that the timetable was no good. But
Nazaroviene was just satisfied with her minor medal, saying:"Never in
my life did I expect this medal. I was hoping that God would help me
to be third, with one personal best this is a great result."

LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The British Foreign Office
announced here today that the British government was suspending
its contact with the Bosnian Embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
The London government made the decision after Bosnia's joint

appointment of ambassadors by the August 1 deadline. As a result,
I am today suspending contact with the Bosnian Charge d'Affairs in

resolve his matter speedily and to find resolutions for the range
of other issues."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Mozambican Foreign
Minister Leonardo Simao said today the opposition National Union
for the Total Independence in Angola (UNITA) should contribute to
the peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Simao made the appeal when having talks with his Angolan
counterpart Venancio De Moura, according to the Angolan News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Simao arrived here this afternoon for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Moura briefed Simao on the peace process and the economic
situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Moura noted that owing to the unilateral suspension of the
Lusaka Peace Accord by UNITA, the peace process in Angola now is
at a very delicate stage.
</P>
<P>
UNITA's strategy, Moura charged, remains to seize state power
through the barrel of the gun.
</P>
<P>
Simao said the establishment of the national unity and
reconciliation government in Angola and of the national assembly
with UNITA elements as its members, constituted an important step
for the Angolans toward reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He urged UNITA to contribute positively to the end of the
peace process and called on all Angolans to unite to speed up the
development of the country.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers reviewed existing bilateral relations and
discussed new realms of cooperation between Mozambique and
Angola.

<HEADLINE> Annan Approves Iraqi Food Distribution Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today approved the Iraqi food and medicine distribution plan
for implementing the oil-for-food program under a new Security
Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General sent to the president of the Security
Council a letter informing the council that he had approved Iraq's
plan for the purchase and distribution of human supplies under the
oil-for-food program," UN spokesman Fred Ackhard announced at the
noon briefing today.
</P>
<P>
The renewed oil-for-food program allows Iraq to export oil
worth 2 billion dollars in six months for import of food, medicine
and other supplies, according to the resolution adopted by the
Security Council on June 4.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed strict economic sanctions,
including oil embargo, on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990. The sanctions would not be lifted until the UN
special commission has confirmed that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of destruction, related material and program.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the humanitarian crisis as a consequence of the
long-term sanctions, the Security Council adopted resolution 986
in April 1995 allowing Iraq to export oil worth 2 billion dollars
in six months to purchase food and other civilian goods. The first
oil-for-food program was implemented nearly 20 months after the
adoption of resolution 986.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the UN Secretary-General, Iraq has to
submit an oil pricing formula, which UN overseers or oil experts
have to approve.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel has closed the Auga crossing
on the southwestern borders with Egypt due to the "prevailing
security situation."
</P>
<P>
Israel informed Egypt of the border closure today, Egypt's MENA
news agency quoted an unidentified security source as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is the second Israel-Egypt crossing closed following last
Wednesday's bombing attack by Palestinian extremists against
Israelis in West Jerusalem which killed 15 people.
</P>
<P>
Another Rafah crossing, about 220 kilometers northeast of
Cairo, had been closed earlier and only foreign tourists are
allowed to pass.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,500 Palestinians, including women and children, have
been waiting in front of Rafah gate pending an Israeli entrance
permit to the Palestinian self-rule Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
The group, running short of money and left out in the cold, are
"extremely suffering," the MENA report said.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the Israeli decision to seal off the Israeli
border with Egypt and Jordan, among other Israeli measures against
the Palestinians following Wednesday's bombings, will be discussed
during an emergency Arab League meeting here tomorrow.

in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism Oldemiro Baloi today

<HEADLINE> Study Claims British Public "Ignorant About EU" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Three in four people in Britain
know little or nothing about the European Union (EU), while only
2 percent think they are well-informed on EU matters, according
to a report published by a British think-tank.
</P>
<P>
The study conducted by the Demos information research company
revealed that the Euro-information gap is startling because
one-third of all British legislations and 70 percent of business
legislations are decided in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The Demos report argued that the best means of plugging the
divide between the public and the decision makers is through the
creation of pan-European parties.
</P>
<P>
"Although national politicians and parties continue to think,
talk and act in exclusively national terms, power has long moved
beyond national boundaries," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report rejected an EU "roll-back" strategy
favored by Britain's Eurosceptic Conservative party to return
powers to nation states.
</P>
<P>
"In practice, there are too many areas of social and economic
life which are transnational for this to be practical, and in any
case, the economic and political benefits of EU membership are
overwhelming," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Arabs to Save Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat today urged prompt action on the Arab and
international levels to save the Palestinian people from the
Israeli collective punishment measures.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Cairo-based Arab League (AL) said
that Arafat today sent a message to AL Secretary General Esmat
Abdul Meguid, detailing 12 "repressive" measures taken by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched an intensive security campaign since last
Wednesday when two suicide bombers blew themselves up in a
Jerusalem market, killing 13 Israelis and injuring 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused Israel of freezing negotiations and contacts
between the two sides, sealing Palestinian cities and villages and
cutting contacts between them as part of a plan to isolate the
Palestinian self-rule areas in Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel had stopped movement of Palestinian workers and
goods in the Palestinian-controlled areas and between these areas
and Israel, Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israel's retaliatory moves also included shutting down Gaza
coastline to Palestinian fishermen, issuing an arrest warrant
against the head of the Palestinian Police, grounding ambulances,
tying up the movement of doctors and patients as well as stopping
vaccination campaigns, Arafat said in the release.
</P>
<P>
In an emergency meeting scheduled for Tuesday, the AL delegates
will examine the impacts of the large-scale Israeli security
measures after the bombing, the faltering Arab-Israeli peace
process and regional stability.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, to be chaired by Meguid, permanent
delegates to the League will pore over ways for furthering
coordination in hope of formulating a unified Arab stand.
</P>
<P>
Cairo-based diplomatic sources said a strongly-worded joint
statement was expected following Tuesday's emergency meeting,
calling for an immediate halt of the Israeli measures, backing
Palestinian rights, and demanding signatories to the Oslo
agreements to help save peace.
</P>
<P>
The Arab delegates are set to discuss a ten-point Palestinian
note and another note submitted by the Arab League Secretariat on
ways of facing the Israeli measures, according to the diplomatic
sources.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting synchronizes with a trip to Egypt by
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy. U.S. Peace Envoy Dennis Ross
will also make a multi-leg Middle East tour a few days later.
</P>
<P>
Following the twin explosions, Israeli authorities arrested
more than 100 Palestinians, toughened security measures in the
various Israeli cities and put the army and police forces on the
alert.

EU countries recalled their ambassadors from Teheran after an
April ruling by a German court accused Iranian leaders of ordering
the 1992 killings of four Kurdish dissidents in a restaurant in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's predecessor Hashemi Rafsanjani earlier made an offer
to allow the return of EU ambassadors if the German envoy was sent
back last of all.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, however, stressed today that all EU countries had
agreed that there should be no "discrimination" in the return of
envoys. The ambassadors of the 15 EU countries would only return
to Teheran together, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Situation Worsening, Returned Nigerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The situation in embattled Sierra
Leone has continued to deteriorate as fuel shortage is grinding
activities in the capital Freetown to a standstill, fleeing
Nigerians said today.
</P>
<P>
A harrowing experience now pervades Freetown as rebel soldiers
have taken to looting, seizure of vehicles and senseless
killings, according to the 19 Nigerians who returned aboard a
Nigerian Air Force aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Speculation that available fuel might not last beyond August
14 was making the rounds in Sierra Leone, said Mrs. Bola Balogun,
one of the returned Nigerians, quoted by the News Agency of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
That indicated a worse situation was awaiting residents of the
troubled country after the period, a situation not helped by the
sanctions imposed by Sierra Leona's neighbors, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions against the country was announced Saturday by
Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha, the current chairman
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), in
which Sierra Leone is a member.
</P>
<P>
Another Nigerian, who is just identified as Mrs. Mulero, was
quoted as saying that the price of fuel in Freetown had risen
from 3,000 Leones (about 3.5 U.S. dollars) before the crisis to
10,000 Leones (nearly 12 dollars) per container of four liters by
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Freetown, some 28,000 tons of
diesel and generating oil for electricity were brought into the
city Sunday, while another two vessels with petrol and kerosene
were expected to arrive soon.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the news quoted by Mrs Balogun, the National
Petroleum Company said the country's oil stock would last for
four to five months and it was enough to give 24 hours non-stop
light in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of some 6,000 tons of rice last Friday, regarded
as crucial for the crisis-ridden country, was also reported.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the tiny west African country began on May 25
when a section of soldiers overthrew the civilian government led
by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and brought Major Johnny Paul
Koroma in power.
</P>
<P>
Efforts of talks to get rid of the junta in power after
several clashes between ECOWAS peace-keeping force and soldiers
loyal to Koroma broke down last Thursday after Koroma announced
the junta would not step down until 2001.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha announced "full scale sanctions" against Sierra
Leone when he was in Monrovia, Liberia, to attend the swearing-in
ceremony of newly-elected President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
He also advised people with commercial interests in Sierra
Leone to suspend them forthwith and called for support from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Several countries, including the United States, have evacuated
their nationals from the troubled country since the coup, which
drew international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Both the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations
have endorsed ECOWAS' intention to resolve the crisis in all
possible ways.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional body has threatened to use force to restore
Kabbah's government in case economic embargo and sanctions fail.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Defends Secularist System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today reiterated that Turkey's secularism must be
respected.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a overseas Turkish delegation from the
Netherlands, Demirel said that he himself supported the
eight-year compulsory education reform program worked out by the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The eight-year system is not only important in terms of
education, but also can be considered a step forward in terms of
Turkey's development," Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that in a democracy, people's different
religious believes should be guaranteed, but the state itself
must be based on law.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his hope that the Parliament would
make a right decision on the approval of the government's
education reform bill.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year compulsory education plan initiated by the
Education Ministry has drawn strong opposition from the Welfare
Party and other conservative Islamists because of possible
closure of religious schools.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 protesters held a demonstration here late last
month to express their anger, demanding the Parliament to block
the adoption of the education reform bill.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the eight-year compulsory education
plan worked out in accordance with the military suggestion aims
to curb the rapidly expanding fundamentalist force in the
secular republic.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat met here today on means to
overcome the current crisis in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held when the tension between the Palestinians
and Israel became more severe following two suicide bombings
killed 13 Israelis and wounding 170 others last Wednesday in
Jewish West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here tonight on a short visit, briefed
Hussein on Israeli measures against the Palestinians and efforts
exerted by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) at various
levels to remove obstacles hindering the resumption of the peace
talks, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan and other Jordanian senior
officials attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee
Secretary General Mohammoud Abbas and other senior Palestinian
officials also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stalled for more than four months
since Israel began the construction of a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
After Israel canceled a plan to build a new Jewish settlement
in Jerusalem, the two sides on July 28 decided to resume the peace
talks. But after the suicide bombings, Israel announced it will
not resume talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are the only Arab countries world that
achieved peace with the Jewish state.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A Greek delegation of ministers
headed by Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos will visit Albania
Tuesday in an effort to better the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member delegation will also include Greek Public
Minister George Romeos, National Defense Undersecretary Dimitris
Apostolakis, Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis, National
Economy Undersecretary Alexandros Baltas, Public Works
Undersecretary Dimitris Verelis and Labor Undersecretary Christo
Protopappas.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first visit by Greek ministers to Tirana
following the neighboring country's general elections on June 29.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day visit, the Greek ministers will discuss with
their Albanian counterparts such issues as illegal Albanian
immigrants in Greece, the need to reorganize Albania's police, the
promotion of military cooperation agreements, the technical
details concerning the provision of a 20 million U.S. dollar loan
to the Albanian central bank, and the liberalization of education
through the granting of permits for the operation of private
schools.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the forthcoming visit, Kranidiotis said today
that the visit underlined the "high priority" attributed by both
sides to the substantive strengthening of relations between them,
and would give the Greek ministers the opportunity to express
their interest in the security and consolidation of the rights of
the Greek minority, about 300,000 living especially in southern
Albania.
</P>
<P>
"Greece is willing to continue, both bilaterally, and in the
framework of international organizations, the policy of supporting
Albania, boosting its European orientation and strengthening its
relations with NATO," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the success of the visit would constitute a
landmark in the history of Greek-Albanian ties.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Develop Free Trade Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- SADC chief Kaire Mbuende
said in Gaborone today that his organization will go ahead with
plans to set up a free trade bloc, despite criticism from some
international economists.
</P>
<P>
Radio Gaborone quoted The Executive Secretary of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) as saying that there is need
for free trade bloc for the movement of goods in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Southern Africa is seen as having a small market
because the region has not yet been integrated.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende was reacting to comments made last week by Jeffry
Herbst, an economist with Princeton University in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Herbst said SADC should switch its focus from free trade to
boosting infrastructure and coordinating economic policies and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The American economist said regional trade within SADC is
unlikely to play a major part in the economies of member states
because the market is small.
</P>
<P>
SADC was formed five years ago to coordinate efforts for a
common market. The regional grouping is made up by 12 countries,
with a total population of 150 million and a combined Gross
Domestic Product of 170 billion U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> US Bank Backs Exports for Indonesian Copper-Gold Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank
today announced provision of 425 million U.S. dollars in project
financing to back exports of goods and services to develop the
Batu-Hijau copper-gold project in Sumbawa, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Batu-Hijau project, which is regarded as the world's
largest copper and gold deposits, located in a remote and sparsely
populated area of Indonesia, involves construction of port
facilities, a power plant, roads, telecommunications facilities
and a mine which includes a concentrator, a crushing station and
conveyor systems.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors of the project are Newmont and Sumitomo Corp. of
Japan. Production from the mine is expected to average 700,000
tons of copper-gold concentrate per year when completed. The
concentrate will be sold through long-term contracts to smelters
located primarily in Asia. The deposit is estimated to contain
some 10.6 billion pounds of copper and 12.1 million ounces of gold
in proven and probable reserves.
</P>
<P>
A syndicate of commercial banks led by Chase Manhattan Bank
will provide a 425 million dollar construction loan for the
Indonesian project. At project completion, the U.S. Export-Import
Bank will replace the commercial bank financing with a 425 million
dollar loan.
</P>
<P>
Other lenders to the project include the Export-Import Bank of
Japan which offers 500 million dollars and Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau, Germany's export credit agency, 75 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Export-Import Bank is a federal government agency of the
country that supports American exports around the world.

<HEADLINE> Desertification, Droughts Affecting Zimbabwe: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Recurrent droughts and
desertification will continue to be the twin problems affecting
Zimbabwe, particularly in rural areas, a deputy minister said
today.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a national workshop here to discuss the
U.N. convention to combat desertification and droughts, Mines,
Environment and Tourism Deputy Minister Edward Chindori-Chininga
said the two problems have negatively affected millions of the
country's population.
</P>
<P>
The situation is worse for rural areas, where 80 percent of
the estimated 12.4 million people live, he said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day workshop, sponsored by the U.N. Development
Program, is being attended by representatives of the government,
rural district councils and non-governmental organizations
dealing with the environment.
</P>
<P>
Chindori-Chininga said the issue of desertification is
relevant to Zimbabwe because land degradation is one of the
country's major environmental problems which needs immediate
attention.
</P>
<P>
He said, "there is need for change in mankind's economic
activities, a change that must be based on the new understanding
that human activities aimed at industrial, mining and
agricultural development and improvement of man's living
standards have a negative impact on the environment."
</P>
<P>
He urged the workshop to explore possibilities of establishing
a Zimbabwe national desertification fund and the target
beneficiaries, promote stake holder participation and
partnership.

<HEADLINE> Jajce Incident Condemned by International Organs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- International organizations
today expressed their outrage at the Bosnian Croats in Jajce who
had forced hundreds of Muslim returnees to flee again over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite appalling that these people were re-cleansed from
their homes one year and nine months after Dayton, having been
able to gather enough courage to go back to theri partially
destroyed homes last week," said Chris Janowski, spokesman for the
UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
According to UN police monitors, drunken Croat mobs over the
weekend expelled or intimidated over 500 Muslim returnees to flee
the Croat-controlled Jajce and surrounding villages. Several
Muslim houses were burned and one dead body was found in one of
the burned houses.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement signed by Bosnian parties in Dayton, Ohio,
in 1995, stipulates that refugees and displaced persons are
entitled to return to pre-war homes.
</P>
<P>
Janowski warned that without the return of refugees to their
homes, "the entire peace process is threatened and the whole peace
process could collapse."
</P>
<P>
The Office of High Representative (OHR), which is in charge of
the overall implementation of the Dayton peace accords, also said
that it was "extremely disturbed and concerned" about the cases of
expulsion of returnees in Jajce.
</P>
<P>
"These events are inacceptable and are in direct contravention
of the peace agreement," said OHR spokesman Simon Haselock, adding
that they also threatened the existence of Muslim-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
Haselock said that High Representative Carlos Westendorp has
sent a letter to Croat authorities, demanding that expelled
refugees be allowed to return to Jajce in the next 48 hours.

WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency today announced that for fiscal 1997 ending June
30, it issued a record 70 guarantee contracts for projects with
614 million U.S. dollars in new coverage in 25 developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The portfolio was broadened by writing coverage for investments
in 11 new countries, namely Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain,
Colombia, Egypt, Georgia, Guatemala, Guinea, Paraguay, Romania and
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The MIGA is a member of the World Bank Group. Its country

during the year, further extending the potential scope of the
MIGA's guarantee activities.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the development impact of the MIGA's fiscal 1997
projects include the creation of about 4,000 jobs and facilitation
of some 4.7 billion dollars in foreign direct investments in the
developing countries in which they were located. The total of 293
guarantee contracts issued in the MIGA's history have played a
pivotal role in facilitating an estimated 20 billion dollars in
foreign direct investment in 52 developing member countries and
economies in transition, and have helped generate some 40,000 new

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's New Policy to Boost Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government today
announced it will play a more active role in agriculture by
introducing new farming systems aimed at boosting production and
raising farmers' competitiveness in the markets.
</P>
<P>
In his policy statement for the 1997/98 farming season, Lands
and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said under the
Agricultural Sector Investment Program (ASIP), the government had
moved away from direct involvement through price support and
controls.
</P>
<P>
This new move was aimed at transforming small holder
agriculture into fully commercialized farming and developing
requisite infrastructure in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"Future responses to drought will thus be aimed at reducing
the current emphasis on the provision of food aid in favor of a
broader approach involving the development of social strategies
and schemes which help families to cope with effects of drought,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
ASIP as encompassed in the Zimbabwe agricultural policy
framework 1995-2020, had since identified four key areas for
investment which included crop and livestock production, small
holder irrigation development, rural credit and input supply and
education and training.
</P>
<P>
Against that background, an agricultural policy management and
marketing information system to link the departments of
veterinary services, agro-tech, research and specialist services
and the agricultural finance corporation was being set up.
</P>
<P>
On production prospects for the coming season, Kangai said
there is now greater scope for farmers to intensify production of
almost all commodities to meet domestic and export markets
requirements.

<P>
ATHENS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- France's Stephane Diagana and Czech
Sarka Kasparkova beat world big names to highlight the third day
competition with world season's top performances at the 6th World
Athletics Championships here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Diagana, who had not been counted as a pre-race favourite, kicked
hard on the home straight to notch the men's 400-meter hurdles gold
medal in 47.70 seconds, 0.07 seconds inside the year's best set by
American Bryan Bronson, who was nipped at the line by silver winner
Llewellyn Herbert of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kasparkova, world indoor champion this year, added the outdoor
world title to her credit by landing the fastest distance at 15.20
meters in the women's triple jump final, beating the year's best by
six centimeters. Rodica Mateescu of Romania grabbed the silver at
15.16 to third finsher Yelena Govorova of Ukraine's 14.67.
</P>
<P>
Sabine Braun of Germany, 1991 world champion who has competed in
the championships for five times, dominated the women's heptathlon
easily, collecting a total of 6,739 points.
</P>
<P>
Olympic bronze medal winner Denise Lewis of Britain and Remegiya
Nazaroviene of Lithuania won the silver and bronze with 6,654 and
6,566 points respectively.
</P>
<P>
Catherine Freeman of Australia proved that her season's best mark
set last month was not a fluke when the rising star wound up first to
win the women's 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
Sandie Richards of Jamaica was times 49.79 and Jearl Miles-Clark of
the United States 49.90.
</P>
<P>
After defending champion and Olympic winner Derrick Adkins of the
United States relegated in the semifinals, the men's 400m hurdles
final was an open race. Diagana reeled over the year's fastest hurdler
Bronson with 100 meters to go, and maintained the lead to finish.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great moment for me. After one year absent from the track
due to injury, I am back with my first individual title," said the
winner.
</P>
<P>
Bronson was just upset, saying:"I couldn't get my rhythm. Don't ask
why, the race was totally off!"
</P>
<P>
The women's triple jump final saw Kasparkova hit her best on the
fifth round, beating early leader Mateescu by four centimeters.
</P>
<P>
"The first try of the Romanian girl over 15 meters didn't make me
crazy, I knew I had five more jumps. It was harder to compete here
than in Atlanta because everybody especially at home was awaiting a
gold," said Kasparova.
</P>
<P>
Two times Olympic and world champion Michael Johnson of the United
States sailed into the men's 400m final with ease, clocking the
fastest time in the round in 44.37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Most of the world class athletes entered the next round without

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Committee on Establishment of Int'l </HEADLINE>

UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Preparatory Committee
on Establishment of International Criminal Court today opened its
fourth session at U.N. headquarters with approving its program of
work for its current session, concentrating discussions in two
working groups.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement to the fourth session, Chairman
Adriaam Bos of Netherlands said there was a great deal of work to
be done before the diplomatic conference, to be convened in June
and July of 1998 in Rome. He also expressed appreciation of the
work done outside the formal meeting by the non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for efficiency in order to narrow the
differences on the topics to be discussed and to come up with
proposals as concrete as possible for the diplomatic conference.
</P>
<P>
Adriaam proposed that the first group concentrate in the topics
of complementarity and the trigger mechanism which refers to the
question of what, or which actors could initiate or "trigger"
court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The second working group would discuss procedural matters and
would be chaired by Sylvia Fernandez de Gurmendi of Argentina, the
vice-chairperson of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the present work program would be kept
flexible, in the light of progress made, and that it was also
possible that the working group procedural questions might need
more time. He also hoped that there would be time to finish the
informal discussions on general principles of criminal law.

<HEADLINE> Russian Air Force Views US Military Under Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A Russian air force jet flew
for the first time from Washington to Ohio and Florida, taking
photos of American military facilities last week.
</P>
<P>
The five-day mission, which ended Saturday, was a training
exercise in preparation for implementation of the 1992 Open Skies
Treaty, according to an Associated Press report today.
</P>
<P>
The Open Skies Treaty, signed by 27 nations in Finland,
promotes openness by allowing participating countries to gather
information about each other's military forces through unarmed
observation flights.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the treaty has been delayed because
Belarus, Ukraine and Russia have yet to ratify it. The U.S.
ratified it in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The flight was the first over the U.S. by a Russian aircraft
under the treaty. A U.S. team departs for Russia later this month.
</P>
<P>
"I think that for our countries this was a very great event,"
Russian Air Force Col. Mikhail Botvinko told reporters today. "We
have shown that we can work well together in a spirit of mutual
understanding."
</P>
<P>
The 20-member Russian crew, traveling in a modified 1970s
twin-engine turboprop cargo plane, arrived in the U.S. on July 28.
