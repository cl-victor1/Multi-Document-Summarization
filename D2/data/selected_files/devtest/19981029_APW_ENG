Leopard strolls into woman's bedroom, watches TV

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A leopard sauntered into a house and
lolled on a bed for four hours, watching television and napping,
before being packed off to the zoo, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   After her 4-year-old son saw the leopard stroll up the driveway
and break open the bedroom door, Bimla Devi bolted the other door
to the room and ran outside screaming to call the police, The Asian
Age reported. No one was hurt.
	   Officials said the animal had either escaped from the local zoo
or strayed from a dense forest near the town of Panchkula, about
250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of New Delhi. They said the
leopard apparently entered the house to escape morning traffic.
	   ``It watched all the morning (television) programs,'' Devi told
The Hindustan Times. ``It tampered a little with the children's
books and school bags but did little other damage to the house.''
	   Tired by then, the leopard took a nap sprawled on the bed.
	   Police and forest officials watched the leopard for several
hours, trying to decide how best to capture it. They eventually
tranquilized the leopard, caged it and took it to the nearby zoo.
	   Wild animals sometimes stray into cities in India in search of
food because increasing deforestation has shrunk their habitat.

Singapore economy shrinks, unemployment rises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede graf to clarify Goh did not announce jobless data
himself &QL; 
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Releasing data showing a shrinking economy amid
rising unemployment, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said
Thursday his country is under increasing external pressure.
	   Goh said preliminary data showed gross domestic product shrank
1.5 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last
year, Singapore's first such contraction since its last recession
in the mid-1980s.
	   ``Every now and then, a people is faced with a crucial test,''
Goh told a gathering of union leaders. ``We are now faced with such
a test.''
	   Singapore's economy has steadily slowed since the start of the
regional crisis. GDP grew 6.1 percent in the first quarter and 1.6
percent in the second. As the economy weakens, joblessness has
increased.
	   Minister for Manpower Lee Boon Yang said that based on early
data, unemployment rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.5
percent in September, nearly double the 2.3 percent in June.
	   About 20,000 workers lost their jobs in the first nine months of
the year, equaling the record number of layoffs during Singapore's
last recession, said Lee, who described the figure as ``extremely
high'' compared with last year's total of 9,874 layoffs.
	   Goh identified three main culprits for Singapore's recent pain:
shrinking regional demand for its products and services; a global
downturn in industries like electronics, which accounts for 77
percent of Singapore's domestic manufacturing exports; and slumping
demand hurting corporate earnings, which have on average plunged 55
percent in the first half of 1998.
	   The government's most recent forecast for 1998 estimated growth
between 0.5 to 1.5 percent, well off the healthy 7.8 percent
increase last year.
	   Speaking to reporters at the union gathering, Trade and Industry
Minister Lee Yock Suan said the economy should meet the official
forecast, though many private economists have predicted a slight
overall contraction for the year.
	   Goh said the government's ``top priority is to help companies
survive the harsh market conditions'' in order ``to save and create
jobs.''
	   Since much of Singapore's problems are external and therefore
out of its control, Goh said the government must focus on
``sharply'' reducing the cost of doing business here, which has
risen compared to many of its Asian competitors.
	   Ruling out a competitive devaluation of its currency or the
adoption of market and capital controls, he recommended slashing
labor costs ``substantially'' by scrapping most pay raises and
other variable pay components, and reducing by half the 20 percent
salary contribution from employers to the state-run mandatory
pension fund.
	   Goh said odds were 1-in-5 that another ``financial typhoon''
will sweep through the region, also saying that Singapore must
prepare for that eventuality.

More automaker layoffs expected in Thailand, but GM, BMW hiring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By ANUCHIT NGUYEN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai automakers will lay off thousands
of workers before the end of the year as they try to survive a
recession that has caused a drastic drop in sales, analysts
predict.
	   ``There will be more layoffs by car companies, especially on the
sales side, as local sales remain sluggish,'' Surapong
Paisitpattanapong, spokesman for the Automotive Industry Club, said
in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires.
	   But at least two major car companies _ General Motors Corp. and
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, or BMW _ are taking advantage of the
downturn to build a presence in a market long dominated by Japanese
rivals.
	   Thailand is the largest vehicle producer in the region, earning
it the nickname ``the Detroit of Southeast Asia.''
	   However, the sector is now in dire need of new investment, and
GM and BMW plan on scooping up some of the highly-skilled, laid-off
workers to man their new production plants scheduled to open in
2000.
	   Demand for automobiles has plummeted since the onset of
Thailand's economic crisis in July 1997.
	   New vehicle sales in the first nine months of 1998 fell 69
percent to 100,003 from the same period last year. Analysts said
sales for 1998 will be 130,000-140,000, compared with 363,156
vehicles in 1997 and 589,126 vehicles in 1996.
	   Since the beginning of Thailand's economic crisis in July 1997,
makers of cars, motorcycles and automotive components have laid off
about 85,000 workers or 30 percent of the once 284,000-strong work
force, Surapong said.
	   Honda Motors laid off 200 sales staff. Mazda Motors closed two
of its assembly plants, putting 600 out of work. Nissan cut 200,
with further layoffs expected, Surapong said.
	   Toyota, the country's largest car producer, will reduce staffing
through attrition, a company official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The layoffs have had a ripple effect through the industry,
leading to massive job cuts and outright closures of parts
suppliers, Surapong said.
	   Analysts say new car sales won't rebound until the second half
of 1999 at the earliest.
	   ``It is going to take time before the industry gets back on its
feet,'' said John Bonnel, director of Automotive Resources Asia, a
Bangkok-based automotive marketing company.
	   The increasing availability of highly skilled workers is helping
newcomers such as GM. The world's largest automaker is recruiting
aggressively for its dlrs 500 million car assembly plant under
construction in Thailand.
	   Germany's BMW is investing 1 billion baht (dlrs 27 million) in a
manufacturing plant for 10,000 BMW and Rover vehicles annually for
the domestic market and export to East Asia.
	   Kantanit Sukontasap, vice president of GM, said the layoffs have
made the search for well-trained technicians far easier than two
years ago when the industry suffered a severe labor shortage.
	   In an effort to offset plunging demand in the local market, most
major car makers are trying to increase exports from their Thai
manufacturing bases.
	   Ford Motor Corp. will export half of the production from its
dlrs 500 million assembly plant, a joint venture with Mazda. The
plant, which can produce 100,000 one-ton pickup trucks annually,
began production this year, a Ford spokeswoman said.
	   GM is committed to exporting 70 percent of total production of
40,000 sedans from its future plant.
	   Toyota said exports of cars and parts from Thailand will reach 9
billion baht (dlrs 243 million) this year. In August, Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. boosted pickup truck production to 73,000 vehicles a
year from 60,000 in 1997 to increase exports.
	   Surapong said Thai automakers will export 60,000 new cars this
year, up from 42,000 in 1997. In the first eight months of 1998,
total export value of vehicles and parts rose 65 percent to 25.1
billion baht (dlrs 678 million).
	   But exports, mostly to East Asia, won't solve the automakers'
problems in full, with the rest of the region in recession.
	   ``Demand in other countries is significantly lower in the
current economic situation,'' Surapong said.

Hundreds of whales die after stranding on New Zealand beach

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Conservation officials shot dead
42 stranded pilot whales Thursday as 288 perished on a remote beach
off the southern tip of New Zealand.
	   The whales were stranded on Stewart Island late Wednesday and
most were dead by the time Department of Conservation officials got
to them Thursday, an official said.
	   ``The surviving whales were so distressed it was better to put
them out of their misery,'' Southland conservation official Lou
Sanson told The Associated Press. ``This is one of the largest mass
strandings in the world and was a distressing scene for staff. But
it's an entirely natural event which has been happening for
thousands of years.''
	   A hunting party found the long-finned pilot whales, also known
as black whales, beached at remote Doughboy Bay. When department
staff flew over the site at dawn Thursday only 60 whales were
alive. Eighteen more had died by late morning.
	   After consultation with members of the country's two main mammal
rescue groups, Project Johan and Marine Watch, ``the judgment was
made that all the whales were too far gone to save them,'' Sanson
said.
	   The whales were found in a tight group, hard aground at the
southern end of the bay. Fully-grown, the adults reach a length of
21 feet (6.5-meters).
	   ``Our marine mammal specialists say this is one of the largest
strandings recorded in the world,'' Sanson said.
	   He said it followed the stranding of 206 whales on the west
coast of Australia's island state of Tasmania on Oct. 17. More than
100 died after a series of strandings.
	   New Zealand recorded a larger stranding on Great Barrier Island
near Auckland, last decade, when 450 were beached.
	   Sanson said extensive samples of whale tissue, liver tissue and
teeth had been removed from the whales for investigation by marine
scientists.
	   ``We've lost the whales, but we intend to use the opportunity
for scientific purposes,'' Sanson said.
	   The samples would be used in an effort to determine the cause of
the stranding.
	   The remoteness of the site meant the carcasses would be left on
the beach, and it was expected wave action and natural processes
would dispose of them.
	   Pilot whales are widespread in the Pacific. They travel in large
herds of several hundred and have a tendency to strand in groups in
shallow sandy bays.
	   Experts remained puzzled as to why the whales blindly return to
deadly shallows. Theories include that one whale is beached by
accident while chasing food, then attracts the others in its pod
with its distress cries.

	   Tutu reported the judge's move even as the hearing was still
going on.
	   Commission officials speculated that the handover ceremony could
go forward anyway Thursday, and aides at Mandela's office said
there were no plans to change the ceremony.
	   The Truth Commission came under attack from both sides of
apartheid-era rule Wednesday. In addition to the ANC move,
apartheid's last president, F.W. de Klerk, filed a lawsuit forcing
the panel to excise a finding that he was an ``accessory after the
fact'' to state-sponsored bombings.
	   The attacks on the watershed report _ the product of two years
of testimony by thousands of witnesses _ showed just how difficult
reconciliation was in this country four years after the fall of
apartheid.
	   Created with the ANC's blessing, the panel was charged with
promoting reconciliation by laying bare apartheid-era atrocities.
It has held hearings around the country for more than two years,
listening to both victims and perpetrators.
	   It has the power to grant amnesty as well as recommend
prosecution.
	   From the beginning, the panel angered many whites, who saw it as
an instrument to punish them, as well as many blacks, who feared it
would allow apartheid's perpetrators to escape.
	   Wednesday's events showed how strong the divisions remain.
	   The ANC had expressed outrage that the commission would find it
guilty of ``gross violations of human rights.'' To condemn it would
``criminalize the whole liberation struggle,'' said Thenjiwe
Mtintso, the party's deputy secretary-general.
	   She said the commission sent a letter Wednesday rejecting the
ANC's appeal for last-minute revisions.
	   According to leaks of the report, the commission has found the
ANC guilty of planting mines in rural areas, executing enemy
agents, blurring the line between military and civilian targets and
fomenting political violence.
	   De Klerk, who shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for
bringing an end to the racist system, sued in Cape Town to stop the
report's release.
	   He challenged its finding that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation, which housed anti-apartheid
organizations.
	   The finding could have opened him up to prosecution because de
Klerk did not seek amnesty.
	   The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk
did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know about the
roles of former law and order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Johan van
der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but failed to tell police.
	   De Klerk contends that when he learned about the bombings, the
two were already applying for amnesty, and he did not think it was
necessary to report the matter.
	   Tutu said the commission would delete de Klerk's name while it
prepares a defense. That apparently was enough for de Klerk's
lawyers to agree to a postponement of the case, which was then
scheduled for a hearing March 4.
	   ``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu
later told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually
appear.''

Taliban leader wants young boys off the battlefield
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ If he's too young to grow a beard,
he's too young to join Afghanistan's Taliban religious army.
	   This from the Taliban's reclusive leader Mullah Mohammed Omar in
a broadcast Thursday on the Taliban-run Radio Shariat.
	   Omar warned his commanders that they would be punished under
Islamic law if young boys were found carrying guns and fighting on
the front lines against opposition troops. He did not specify what
the penalty would be.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army, which rules roughly 90 percent of
Afghanistan, is battling a northern-based opposition, of mostly
minority ethnic groups, on at least three different front lines.
	   The heaviest fighting has been in northern Takhar province where
the opposition retook the capital of Taloqan several days ago.
	   It was not immediately clear what prompted Omar to issue his
latest edict.
	   With their country wracked by fighting for much of the past two
decades, many of Afghanistan's boys have neither been to school nor
received technical training.
	   In Afghanistan there are few jobs and for many young males the
only source of income is the army.
	   Omar did not specify any age limit for enlistment in the Taliban
army, only referring to whether or not the recruit has facial hair.
	   Both sides in the Afghan civil war have used boys as young as 11
or 12 on the front lines.
	   Omar also expressed concern about reports that young boys were
being forced into homosexual relationships and threatened to impose
Islamic justice on anyone found guilty of having a homosexual
affair.
	   In Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, where a harsh form of Islamic
justice has been applied, the death penalty is imposed for crimes
of murder, sodomy and adultery.
	   Under Taliban law, men found guilty of homosexuality are forced
to stand in front of a mud or brick wall, which is collapsed on top
of them, usually with the help of a tank. The men remain buried for
30 minutes and if they are alive when the debris is removed their
sentence is commuted. Such a punishment has been applied to at
least eight men accused of homosexuality, and two are reported to
have survived the ordeal.
	   The Taliban movement that emerged out of Islamic religious
schools adheres to a rigid form of Islam that bars women from work,
girls from school and demands that women be accompanied by a close
male relative outside the home. It also demands that men grow a
beard, pray at the mosque and wear a turban or head covering,
similar to Islam's prophet Mohammed.

At least 14 workers killed in South Korean fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ At least 14 workers were killed and 10
others injured Thursday when a fire swept through a cold storage
facility under construction in the southern port city of Pusan,
police said.
	   The death toll could rise as some workers were believed trapped
in toxic gas which filled parts of the eight-story structure, they
said.
	   Police, quoting witnesses, said the fire, believed to have
started by welding sparks, spread rapidly upward, trapping several
dozen workers.
	   The blaze was put out in two hours but firefighters had
difficulty moving into the building because of toxic gas. They
initially found 14 bodies on two upper floors, police said.
	   Ten workers were admitted to hospital with burns, cuts and other
injuries, police said.
	   About a half dozen workers escaped to the roof where they were
later airlifted away by helicopter, they said.

Judge blocks release of apartheid rights report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series. Minor editing. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A judge blocked the release of a
watershed report Thursday on South Africa's racist past while he
considered a challenge to its findings by the ruling African
National Congress party, Desmond Tutu reported.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was to have released the
3,500-page report to journalists ahead of its formal handover
Thursday by Tutu, a former Anglican archbishop, to President Nelson
Mandela.
	   But Judge Wilfred Thring in Cape Town ordered the panel to
withhold the report from journalists while he held a hearing on the
ANC's application to block the report. The ANC had objected to a
finding in the report that it had committed ``gross human rights
violations'' in its decades-long struggle against white rule.
	   The ANC's legal maneuvering outraged Tutu, the Nobel-peace prize
laureate who heads the Truth panel. Speaking outside a convention
center where the solemn handover ceremony was to be held later
Thursday, he compared the ANC to the white rulers of apartheid.
	   ``I have struggled against a tyranny. I didn't do that in order
to substitute it with another,'' he told journalists. ``If there is
a tyranny, an abusive power ... I will oppose it with every
fragment of my being.''
	   Tutu reported the judge's move even as the hearing was still
going on.
	   Commission officials speculated that the handover ceremony could
go forward anyway Thursday, and aides at Mandela's office said
there were no plans to change the ceremony.
	   The Truth Commission came under attack from both sides of
apartheid-era rule Wednesday. In addition to the ANC move,
apartheid's last president, F.W. de Klerk, filed a lawsuit forcing
the panel to excise a finding that he was an ``accessory after the
fact'' to state-sponsored bombings.
	   The attacks on the report _ the product of two years of
testimony by thousands of witnesses _ showed just how difficult
reconciliation was in this country four years after the fall of
apartheid.
	   Created with the ANC's blessing, the panel was charged with
promoting reconciliation by laying bare apartheid-era atrocities.
It has held hearings around the country for more than two years,
listening to both victims and perpetrators.
	   It has the power to grant amnesty as well as recommend
prosecution.
	   From the beginning, the panel angered many whites, who saw it as
an instrument to punish them, as well as many blacks, who feared it
would allow apartheid's perpetrators to escape.
	   The ANC had expressed outrage that the commission would find it
guilty of ``gross violations of human rights.'' To condemn it would
``criminalize the whole liberation struggle,'' said Thenjiwe
Mtintso, the party's deputy secretary-general.
	   She said the commission sent a letter Wednesday rejecting the
ANC's appeal for last-minute revisions.
	   According to leaks of the report, the commission has found the
ANC guilty of planting mines in rural areas, executing enemy
agents, blurring the line between military and civilian targets and
fomenting political violence.
	   De Klerk, who shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for
bringing an end to the racist system, sued in Cape Town to stop the
report's release.
	   He challenged its finding that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation, which housed anti-apartheid
organizations.
	   The finding could have opened him up to prosecution because de
Klerk did not seek amnesty.
	   The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk
did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know about the
roles of former law and order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Johan van
der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but failed to tell police.
	   De Klerk contends that when he learned about the bombings, the
two were already applying for amnesty, and he did not think it was
necessary to report the matter.
	   Tutu said the commission would delete de Klerk's name while it
prepares a defense. That apparently was enough for de Klerk's
lawyers to agree to a postponement of the case, which was then
scheduled for a hearing March 4.
	   ``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu
later told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually
appear.''

Govt. urges toughening of sports drug laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The federal government has proposed
tougher sentences for people caught trafficking and dealing sports
drugs, following calls from Olympic chiefs for offenders to get
jail time.
	   Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone released a report Thursday
aimed at standardizing drug laws throughout Australia. It proposed
penalties for sports drugs to match those for narcotics such as
heroin, cocaine and ecstasy.
	   ``Sports drugs such as anabolic steroids also pose a major
threat, particularly to young people,'' Vanstone said in a
statement. ``This report proposes that anyone who traffics in
significant quantities of anabolic steroids should face the same
penalties as other drug traffickers.''
	   A spokesman for Vanstone said the 300-page report had been sent
to state governments over the past few days.
	   In August, Australian Olympic Committee chief John Coates called
for standard drug laws throughout the host country of the Sydney
2000 Olympics and sent a detailed report to the federal and state
governments and the International Olympic Committee.
	   The IOC backed' Coates call for jail terms for traffickers and
dealers.
	   ``Australia has an opportunity to lead the world in this regard
with the staging of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and the current
international focus on doping in sport,'' Coates said in August.
``Now is the time to act. If we're to ensure that the 2000 Olympics
are not remembered as the drug games immediate action is
required.''
	   Vanstone's spokesman, Kevin Donnellan, said the AOC was aware
that the federal government report released Thursday was already
being compiled when Coates released the AOC report.
	   Vanstone said there had been a rising concern about the use of
sports drugs by children.
	   In the AOC report it was claimed that sports drugs posed as
serious a social risk to the community as narcotics.
	   Coates said the non-medical use of anabolic steroids in
Australia was greater than the use of heroin and cocaine and a
survey of 11 to 17-year-old schoolchildren in New South Wales
showed about four percent were using sports drugs.
	   In May a United States study claimed that some boys and girls as
young as 10 were taking steroids to do better in sports.

	   In Calgary, Alberta, Stu Barnes had two of the Pittsburgh
Penguins' five power-play goals, lifting his team over the Calgary
Flames.
	   Brad Werenka, Rob Brown and German Titov also scored for the
Penguins (4-2-1), who won for the second time in a row, improving
their road record to 4-1.
	   Jaromir Jagr had three assists for the Penguins, who took a 3-2
lead after two periods in large part thanks to the Flames' penchant
for bad penalties. The Penguins, who entered the game with the
fourth-ranked power play in the league, went 5-for-8 with the man
advantage.
	   Jarome Iginla and Valeri Bure scored for the Flames, who dropped
to 2-5-1.

	   In Edmonton, Alberta, Boris Mironov and Bill Guerin scored two
goals apiece, leading Edmonton over Washington 8-2 in a game marred
by an injury to Oilers star Doug Weight.
	   Weight assisted on Mironov's goal in the first period that
helped the Oilers get off to a big early lead. It was Weight's
fifth assist in four games since ending a contract holdout.
	   But later in the period, Weight, who had signed a two-year, dlrs
7.8-million contract, left the ice with a knee injury. He did not
return and was to have his right knee tested Thursday.
	   Kelly Buchberger, Mike Grier, Josef Beranek and Roman Hamrlik
also scored for the Oilers, now 4-4-0. Adam Oates and Joe Juneau
scored for Washington (3-3-2).

Eight doctors sickened after drinking poisoned tea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In Japan's latest poisoning case, eight doctors in
Western Japan were sickened after drinking beverages brewed from
water laced with a toxic sodium compound, police said Thursday.
	   The doctors suffered mild nausea and dizziness after drinking
tea and coffee made from a communal hot pot at the Udano Hospital
in Kyoto, 374 kilometers (234 miles) west of Tokyo, said police
spokesman Yoshiyuki Mizuko.
	   Police have identified the toxic substance as sodium azide, a
chemical used in many industrial products, including air-bags.
	   The incident comes two days after another sodium azide poisoning
case at a biology research institute in southwestern Japan, where a
professor and three others were sickened after drinking tea laced
with the chemical.
	   Police did not know if the two incidents were related, Mizuko
said.
	   Japan has been shaken by a series of poisoning cases. Four
people died in July after eating curry laced with arsenic. Since
then, there has been one other fatality _ a 58-year-old man who
drank cyanide-laced tea bought from a supermarket.

NBA cancels rest of games for November, talks continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting continuing past midnight &QL;

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Stern cut two more weeks off the NBA
schedule, debated the finer points of the lockout with Michael
Jordan, and then met with the players to see if the sides could
compromise on the ``guts'' of a new deal.
	   ``I feel neither optimism nor pessimism. I just think that we've
got to talk,'' the NBA commissioner said. ``We may have the
skeleton of a deal, But in terms of a hard negotiation on the guts
of this deal, I would say we're no place yet.''
	   The cancellations, which wiped out the rest of the November
schedule, came after a meeting of the league's Board of Governors
at which some owners asked when the ``drop dead'' date would be for
losing the entire regular season.
	   Stern said he did not want to set a deadline.
	   ``One, we want to be ready to be imaginative,'' he said. ``Two,
we don't want to make threats; we want to make a deal.''
	   With that, he and the owners' negotiating committee walked out
of their news conference, took an elevator three flights up, and
went into a conference room where about 100 players had been
meeting.
	   According to several sources who were in the room and spoke to
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, Jordan, Washington
Wizards owners Abe Pollin and Stern had one of the most heated
exchanges after Jordan asked why increases in franchise values were
not being figured into profitability calculations.
	   After that 90-minute question-and-answer meeting, the sides
resumed formal negotiations at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT) Wednesday at a
Manhattan law office and were still meeting at midnight (0500 GMT
Thursday).

Goh says Malaysian capital controls both good and bad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said
Thursday that Malaysia's recently imposed capital controls help the
country's economy to grow but scare away foreign investors.
	   ``Capital controls and an expansionary monetary policy should
help Malaysia to grow next year,'' Goh said in a wide-ranging
speech to union leaders in Singapore. ``But foreign investors are
likely to stay away because of its capital controls and recent
political developments.''
	   Malaysia adopted controversial market controls in September that
pegged the ringgit to the U.S. dollar, banned overseas trading of
its stocks and currency, and effectively closed the country's
markets from foreign portfolio investment.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad also announced last week an
expansionary budget for 1999 that includes stimulus measures
designed to pull the country out of recession.
	   Malaysia's economic problems are ``aggravated by political
problems and increased frictions with its neighbors,'' Goh said.
	   The sacking, arrest and detention of former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim has led to increasingly violent street
protests by his supporters.
	   Malaysia's relations with neighbors Indonesia and the
Philippines have been strained recently over Anwar's treatment,
while ties with Singapore have soured over a host of issues
including border disputes and economic competition.
	   Goh made an oblique reference to some of the tensions between
his country and Malaysia, saying their economic policies will be
``more nationalistic and inward looking, at least where Singapore
is concerned.''

Australians push for 8-day swimming program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian swimming officials remain
hopeful the sport's international governing body will approve an
eight-day program for the Sydney Olympics despite news that FINA's
technical committee has recommended the retention of seven days.
	   FINA will meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, next week to finalize
the Games program, which sees the reintroduction of semifinals in
all races up to 200 meters.
	   Australian officials say semifinals will disadvantage
competitors who swim multiple events, such as Michael Klim, who
contested seven at this year's world championships in Perth.
	   However, president of Australian Swimming Terry Gathercole said
while FINA's technical committee was recommending a seven-day
program, it was also putting an eight-day proposal forward for
consideration.
	   ``They have recognized, after some lobbying from Australian
Swimming, that there may be some merit in the eight-day program,''
Gathercole said. He said Games organizers had also thrown their
support behind holding the swimming races over eight days and he
was confident they had stressed this when they met with FINA
president Mustapha Larfaoui in Sydney last week.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A monument commemorating the 1979
ouster of the Marxist Khmer Rouge regime from Cambodia by an
invading Vietnamese army was repaired Thursday, two months after
being defaced by antigovernment protesters.
	   New heads for the statues of Vietnamese and Cambodian soldiers
were raised into position by stonesmiths, replacing sections
sledgehammered by protesters calling for the ouster of Cambodian
leader Hun Sen.
	   Hun Sen's political opponents have branded him as a surrogate
Vietnamese ruler because of his close ties to Cambodia's larger
neighbor. Many Cambodians hate the Vietnamese and believe Vietnam
is intent on swallowing up their nation.
	   ``We are restoring it for the sake of the relationship between
the two countries,'' Municipal Cabinet Chief Mann Chhoeun said of
the Cambodia-Vietnam Friendship Monument. ``We must be grateful to
those who liberated us from Pol Pot.''
	   The invasion of the Vietnamese army is a contentious issue that
divides Cambodia's political thinkers.
	   Some view it as the welcomed end to the reign of the Khmer
Rouge, responsible for deaths of nearly 2 million Cambodians by
execution, disease and starvation during the communist group's
failed attempt to create an agrarian utopia.
	   Others see the invasion as the beginning of more than a decade
of foreign domination by a historically hostile neighbor.
	   Speeches by opposition politicians during a July election
campaign often made negative references to Hun Sen's close
cooperation with the Vietnamese after the invasion.
	   Once a Khmer Rouge commander, he defected to Vietnam in 1997
fearing he would be purged. He was the leader of a
Vietnamese-installed government after the invasion.
	   Hun Sen's party scored a narrow victory in the July election,
but the results were contested by the opposition, which claimed
widespread fraud and voter intimidation by the ruling party.
	   Anti-Vietnamese rhetoric reached a fever pitch as opposition
supporters outside parliament called for the ouster of Hun Sen, and
on Aug. 30 a pack of protesters marched to the monument, set it on
fire with gasoline and smashed parts of it with sledgehammers.
	   The demonstrations came to a violent end when Hun Sen ordered
police to disperse the protesters. Using clubs, cattle prods and
gunfire, police killed at least four demonstrators and wounded
dozens more.

Thai government helps widow of farmer who committed suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Distraught because the government
refused to help him, Chum Sakon, an elderly Thai farmer who was
cheated out of his land, hanged himself on the street outside the
prime minister's office.
	   Now, one week after Chum's suicide, the government of Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai has given his widow a low-interest loan to
buy back the land, a government spokesman said on Thursday.
	   The suicide garnered national headlines and the country's
political opposition attempted to use it to portray Chuan and his
government as uncaring toward the poor.
	   Thailand is in the midst of a severe economic crisis. Nearly 2
million people are unemployed and many segments of the population
are experiencing hardships.
	   Chum's widow said he had traveled to Bangkok several times to
seek government help to regain his farmland, but bureaucrats
refused to see him. Chum claimed corrupt businessmen with the help
of local government officials had defrauded him out of the land by
getting him to sign contracts he couldn't read.
	   The loan to Chum's widow, Ob, is worth 404,000 baht (dlrs
10,918). The opposition had presented her with 10,000 baht (dlrs
270) to help buy back the land.

Report: Nomura to cut 20 percent of domestic outlets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nomura Securities Co., Japan's biggest brokerage,
will close about 20 percent of its retail outlets in Japan as part
of restructuring measures, a leading financial daily said Thursday.
	   Nomura has already said it will cut 2,000 jobs out of its
current 13,000-strong work force by 2001 as part of measures to
cope with the negative impact of financial turbulence abroad and
recession at home.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper said the 20-percent cutback in
Nomura's domestic offices is aimed at easing the burden of real
estate-related expenses.
	   Atsuko Toda, a spokeswoman at Tokyo-based Nomura, said the
company has not yet decided how many outlets it will close. Nomura
currently operates 137 domestic retail outlets.
	   Earlier this month, Nomura reported 207.2 billion yen (dlrs 1.76
billion) in loses, mostly from foreign operations, for the first
half of fiscal 1998. At the same time, the brokerage announced
sweeping restructuring steps that will include reducing its work
force and reviewing overseas operations.
	   Other Japanese brokerages have said they would consider
restructuring drives, including major jobs cuts.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY (AP) _ A bomb exploded Thursday at a Gaza intersection
used by Israeli settlers, killing one person and wounding three
others, Israeli media reported.
	   Calling the incident a terror attack, Israel radio reported that
an explosives-laden car tried to crash into a bus carrying Jewish
school children from the Kfar Darom settlement to their school. An
Israeli army vehicle guarding the civilian convoy diverted the car,
and it exploded without hitting the bus.
	   An ambulance driver told Israel radio that the children were
unharmed. The driver, identified only as ``David,'' said all the
casualties were Israelis. He said the wounded received treatment at
the scene and were flown to a hospital by helicopter.
	   The intersection is near Gush Katif, the main Jewish settlement
bloc in Gaza, where about 5,000 Jewish settlers live, near the
Palestinian city of Khan Yunis.
	   Israeli buses there travel in convoys, guarded by Israeli army

Govt. urges toughening of sports drug laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes, details &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The federal government has proposed
tougher sentences for people caught trafficking and dealing sports
drugs, following calls from Olympic chiefs for offenders to get
jail time.
	   Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone released a report Thursday
aimed at standardizing drug laws throughout Australia. It proposed
penalties for sports drugs to match those for narcotics such as
heroin, cocaine and ecstasy, which in some cases could lead to life
sentences.
	   ``Sports drugs such as anabolic steroids also pose a major
threat, particularly to young people,'' Vanstone said in a
statement. ``This report proposes that anyone who traffics in
significant quantities of anabolic steroids should face the same
penalties as other drug traffickers.''
	   A spokesman for Vanstone said the 300-page report had been sent
to state governments over the past few days.
	   The report said police intelligence found the illicit trade in
steroids was steadily increasing nationwide but trafficking in
steroids was not treated as a criminal offence in most Australian
states.
	   ``Steroids are not included in the international conventions and
there is no obligation on Australia to make criminal offences in
relation to their trade,'' the report said. ``At present,
trafficking in steroids is not an offence in most Australian
jurisdictions. This omission is inconsistent with the policy of
governing other drugs trafficked on the black market.''
	   In August, Australian Olympic Committee chief John Coates called
for standard drug laws throughout the host country of the Sydney
2000 Olympics and sent a detailed report to the federal and state
governments and the International Olympic Committee.
	   The IOC backed Coates' call for jail terms for traffickers and
dealers.
	   ``Australia has an opportunity to lead the world in this regard
with the staging of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and the current
international focus on doping in sport,'' Coates said in August.
``Now is the time to act. If we're to ensure that the 2000 Olympics
are not remembered as the drug games immediate action is
required.''
	   Vanstone's spokesman, Kevin Donnellan, said the AOC was aware
that the federal government report released Thursday was already
being compiled when Coates released the AOC report.
	   Vanstone said there had been a rising concern about the use of
sports drugs by children.
	   In the AOC report it was claimed that sports drugs posed as
serious a social risk to the community as narcotics.
	   Coates said the non-medical use of anabolic steroids in
Australia was greater than the use of heroin and cocaine and a
survey of 11 to 17-year-old schoolchildren in New South Wales
showed about four percent were using sports drugs.
	   In May a United States study claimed that some boys and girls as
young as 10 were taking steroids to do better in sports.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 100 workers demonstrated
Thursday for the release of a jailed labor activist who was
convicted of organizing a strike while former President Suharto was
in power.
	   The rally came one day after 8,000 students demonstrated outside
Indonesia's Parliament in the biggest protest to hit the capital
since violent unrest forced the authoritarian Suharto to quit in
May.
	   Like the students, the workers demanded an end to the Indonesian
military's big role in politics and said that the armed forces
always favored employers in labor disputes. They staged their
protest outside the attorney general's office.
	   Their main demand was the release of Dita Indah Sari, who was
convicted last year of organizing a 1996 strike by 20,000 workers
in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city.
	   He was arrested in a nationwide crackdown on opposition
activists and sentenced to six years in jail.
	   ``We want the release of our hero,'' said Gimin, a worker. ``He
was put in jail by the Suharto regime because he defended our
rights and our struggle.''
	   The workers, who came from diamond, electronics and shoe
factories, also demanded that the government lower the prices of
basic commodities. Inflation has soared and millions of people have
lost their jobs as Indonesia endures its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   The students who gathered near the legislature on Wednesday
demanded that Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, quit
over ongoing political and economic turmoil.
	   They called on the government to abandon plans to convene a
special assembly that will cast guidelines next month for elections
in 1999.
	   Student leaders claim the assembly won't push for real change
and is filled with holdovers from the Suharto era.
	   Habibie has taken steps to implement democracy, freeing some
political prisoners and allowing banned magazines to reopen and
political parties to form. Critics, however, say he is not moving
fast enough.

NBA cancels rest of games for November, talks continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with meeting over; comments from Stern,
Davis; no talks scheduled, other details on talks and quote from
Jordan. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Stern cut two more weeks off the NBA
schedule, debated the finer points of the lockout with Michael
Jordan, and then met for eight hours with the players in pursuit of
the ``guts'' of a new deal.
	   ``Where the parties are, a deal is not close,'' Stern said after
talks broke off at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) Thursday.
	   ``We agreed at the end of the evening to get away, get some
sleep, and do some analysis of both sides' proposals.''
	   No new talks were scheduled but the sides did agree to speak
later Thursday by phone.
	   Jordan sat in on the talks for the first time on one of the most
eventful days of the lockout.
	   The cancellations, which wiped out the rest of the November
schedule, came after a meeting of the league's Board of Governors
at which some owners asked when the ``drop dead'' date would be for
losing the entire regular season.
	   Stern said he did not want to set a deadline.
	   ``One, we want to be ready to be imaginative,'' he said. ``Two,
we don't want to make threats; we want to make a deal.''
	   With that, he and the owners' negotiating committee walked out
of their news conference, took an elevator three flights up, and
went into a conference room where about 100 players had been
meeting.
	   According to several sources who were in the room and spoke to
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, Jordan, Washington
Wizards owner Abe Pollin and Stern had one of the most heated
exchanges after Jordan asked why increases in franchise values were
not being figured into profitability calculations.
	   After that 90-minute question-and-answer meeting, the sides
resumed formal negotiations at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT) at a Manhattan
law office.
	   ``I don't think we accomplished what we set out to accomplish,''
said Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers, a member of the union's
bargaining team. ``We're both saying a lot but nothing's getting
done.''
	   ``We've been trying to take steps to bridge the gap. Now the
shoe is on the other foot,'' union president Patrick Ewing said
before the evening session. ``In my negotiating with the Knicks,
they always told me one side cannot monopolize the whole thing. It
needs to be a win-win situation.''
	   Two weeks' worth of games already had been scrapped, and now the
season can't begin until Dec. 1 at the earliest.
	   Stern did say, however, that the league and union would discuss
``recapturing'' games. That was a change from two weeks ago, when
the league announced the first set of cancellations and said the
games would not be made up.
	   ``They had told us about games being recaptured. We knew that,''
said Jeffrey Kessler, the lead outside counsel for the union. ``You
can add (games) on later, or put more into the schedule.''
	   Until this labor dispute, the league had never lost a game to a
work stoppage.
	   In all, 194 games have been lost with the latest cancellation of
95 games. Each team's 82-game schedule has now been whittled to
about 68 games, and the players have lost about dlrs 200 million in
salaries.
	   Wednesday's meetings were the third straight day of talks, and
the sides have moved closer to an agreement on the framework _ or
``skeleton _ of the next agreement. For the first two or three
years, there will be a luxury tax on the highest contracts. If that
system did not reduce the amount of revenues being devoted to
salaries, a modified hard cap would be implemented under which
players would put 10 percent of their salaries into an escrow fund.
	   ``The main point is having the skeleton. We think that is
significant, since we had not agreed on a skeleton before,''
Kessler said. ``Now we're talking essentially about whether the
players will take a bad deal, which they won't. The issue is now
about dollars.''
	   But agreeing on the numbers will not be easy.
	   Players received 57 percent of designed revenues last season,
and the owners want to scale that back to 48 percent by the 2002-03
season. The union has offered two cap-tightening measures if the
percentage reaches 63 percent.
	   Among the players on hand were Jordan, Scottie Pippen, David
Robinson and Reggie Miller. Jordan was probably the most vocal,
several participants said.
	   ``I have an obligation as a veteran player,'' Jordan said, ``to
see that the players of tomorrow have the same benefits and
opportunities that I have.''
	   Also on Wednesday, the league announced that a Dec. 12 game in
Mexico City between the San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Clippers
will not be held at that site because of the lockout.

	   Also on Thursday about 30 women protested on Jakarta's main
street against violence against women, that they claim, has been
``sponsored by the state.''
	   Karlina Laksono, a spokeswoman for the group, said rape had been
used as a method of intimidation against women in areas such as
East Timor and Aceh where separatists have been fighting for
independence from Indonesia.
	   Currently an inquiry is being held into allegations that mass
rapes were committed during rioting in May.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl
through the western Caribbean to lash the Honduran coast, toppling
trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at
least 32 people.
	   Mitch was slowly weakening as it hovered over the Bay Islands
early Thursday, a popular Honduran tourist area. The area is 25
miles (40 kilometers) off the coast.
	   ``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike
Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island. ``Few houses have remained
standing.''
	   At its peak Tuesday, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean
hurricane in this century, with 180-mph (288-kph) winds. By 0600
GMT Thursday, the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm still
packed a dangerous punch, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center
said its brush with land had slowed the winds to 100 mph (160 kph).
	   The U.S. National Weather Service said only three Atlantic
storms were stronger than Mitch at its peak: Gilbert in 1988, Allen
in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
	   The rainfall _ up to 25 inches (64 cms) in mountain areas _
began to take a toll. More than 50 rivers had overran their banks
in Honduras, and the government evacuated more than 45,000 people
from low-lying areas, according to emergency chief Col. Guillermo
Pinel.
	   Many towns were cut off by washed-out roads and downed bridges,
and the hurricane severed phone lines on the Bay Islands, making it
difficult to gauge the extent of the damage. The government said
72,000 people were forced to flee their homes.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development announced it had
sent two helicopters each to Belize and Honduras to help in search,
rescue and relief efforts.
	   Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had
been isolated by the storm, left without power, telephones or
potable water service.
	   Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain,
citrus and banana crops had been damaged ``and the economic future
of Honduras is uncertain.''
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse declared the Caribbean coast a
disaster zone, and officials said 23 people had died in Honduras
alone, including 14 on Guanaja.
	   Five people were killed in La Ceiba, including three police
officers swept into a river in their car, said regional police
chief Maria Lisa Borjas.
	   The Red Cross in neighboring Nicaragua said eight people died
there in flooding from Mitch's rains. The organization blamed the
deaths on the government, saying it ``hasn't adopted the safety
measures necessary for people to cross rivers.''
	   Mexican officials said a wave kicked up by the storm washed a
Connecticut man off a catamaran south of Cancun on Monday, and he
was presumed dead. He was identified as Robert Gates, 55, of
Niantic.
	   Both highways out of La Ceiba, a city of 40,000 people, were cut
Wednesday. To the east, the Saopin bridge sagged into the water as
the swollen river weakened its pillars. To the west, the Pico
Bonito bridge was entirely washed away.
	   Supermarkets emptied of food shut their doors on lines of
frustrated customers and people evacuated low-lying homes by wading
through chest-deep water with sodden bags of belongings of their
heads.
	   Electricity was out in the entire town and the sea moved a
half-block into town in some places. In the Barrio Ingles
shantytown, the ground was covered in white foam from the surf,
making it look as if it had snowed.
	   Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from vulnerable
beach resorts and cutting back on pumping oil from wells in the
Gulf of Mexico.
	   In the Mexican resort of Cancun, 375 miles (640 kilometers)
north of Honduras, American and other tourists formed long lines at
the airport trying to leave before the storm arrived.
	   But as Mitch inched south, Cancun Mayor Rafael Lara Lara
canceled the city's emergency alert.
	   A tourism official for Mexico's Quintana Roo state, which
includes Cancun and Cozumel, said only 10,000 of the 30,000
tourists in the state had decided to stay as the hurricane headed
nearer.
	   Belize City, Belize's capital until 1961 when it was destroyed
by Hurricane Hattie, was a ghost town. Most of its 75,000 residents
had fled in cars and buses commandeered by the government.
	   Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few people
wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company
was broadcasting only the weather channel.
	   Freddy Sikaffy stayed behind with his wife to take care of his
Hotel El Centro, which was closed. But he had stored up only enough
food for a couple of days, and that was almost gone.
	   ``We have some water, some bread and some tin stuff,'' he said.
``But we thought that by Wednesday the hurricane would be out of
here.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government is
considering the imposition of price controls on sugar, which has
soared over 20 percent in the past month, according to Agriculture
Secretary William Dar.
	   Dar said he will recommend that President Joseph Estrada impose
nationwide price controls on both raw and refined sugar.
	   He said the price controls should take effect within the next
few weeks, and that refined sugar prices shouldn't be higher than
32 pesos (78 cents) a kilogram (35 cents a pound).
	   The price of refined sugar has risen sharply to 40 pesos (97
cents) a kilogram (44 cents a pound) from 32.50 pesos (79 cents) a
month ago. It compares to 22 pesos (54 cents) a kilogram six months
ago.
	   Trade undersecretary Ernesto Ordonez said there are guidelines
under the Consumer Price Act that would warrant such an action.
	   ``When a commodity price increases by 10 percent from the
previous month, there is a prima facie case for profiteering and
the burden of proof is on the trader,'' Ordonez said.
	   Some analysts warned, however, that price controls on sugar
would cause traders to divert their stocks to the black market and
further push prices up, because the price rise reflects a shortage
of the commodity.
	   In 1995, rice disappeared from Metro Manila markets when the
government imposed price controls despite a shortage. Instead of
supplying the capital region, traders opted to sell their stocks in
provinces outside Metro Manila at a price dictated by market
forces.
	   Dar is unfazed by such possibilities. He said if traders take
advantage of the situation, local government officials will raid
their warehouses.
	   ``The price of sugar is exorbitant. Do you want it to remain at
that level?'' he asked. ``We have to protect the ordinary people.''
	   Ordonez said traders need to prove there is a sugar shortage to
justify the price increases.
	   Only in cases when imports are made during wild fluctuations in
the exchange rate would such volatility in prices be justifiable,
he said.
	   The government said 12,636 tons of sugar arrived in the country
Tuesday from Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, and 5,000 tons would
arrive Thursday from Thailand.
	   It said the shipments were delayed because of typhoons Zeb and
Babs, adding that supply and prices should stabilize soon.

	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Former captain Mike Atherton scored 88
as England made an encouraging start to its Ashes cricket tour of
Australia on Thursday.
	   Against an attack featuring former Australian test players
Dennis Lillee and Bruce Reid, England made 297 for five off 50
overs at the Lilac Hill ground.
	   A crowd of about 10,000 turned out for England's first game of a
five-test tour.
	   Atherton survived a dropped catch while 15 and scored his runs
off 108 balls, hitting 13 fours. Captain Alec Stewart was also in
good form on the ground where he spent several seasons playing
grade cricket and made 74.
	   Lillee, the world's premier paceman during the 1970s and early
80s, finished his six overs with 0-22.

Dollar falls, Tokyo stocks finish higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Thursday,
while Japanese stock prices finished higher on bargain-hunting
after recent declines.
	   The dollar bought 116.70 yen, down 1.18 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level overnight of 117.82
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 152.65 points,
or 1.13 percent, closing at 13,668.72 points. On Wednesday, the
index lost 304.61 points, or 2.20 percent.
	   Traders said the dollar moved lower on selling by Japanese
exporters and U.S. hedge funds in thin trading due to a lack of
fresh market-moving news.
	   ``Markets are thin after the chaos of a few weeks ago, but with
heavy selling interest if the dollar gets to 120 yen,'' Takashi
Nakauchi, foreign exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, overall sentiment remained poor due
to worries about corporate earnings and the direction of emerging
markets, including Brazil and Russia.
	   Earnings worries were compounded after Sony Corp. on Wednesday
lowered its group earnings forecast for the full fiscal year
through March. Shares of Sony ended Thursday's trading at 7,700 yen
(dlrs 66.4), down 310 yen (dlrs 2.7) from Wednesday's close.
	   Sony also said its earnings slipped 5.4 percent in the first
half of the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, hurt by falling prices for
consumer electronics products.
	   The worsening trend in the electronic giant's earnings
underscores the weakness of the overall economy as Sony is
considered one of the strongest Japanese blue chips.
	   Over the next few weeks, many Japanese companies will announce
their earnings results for the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30,
and their forecasts for the year through March.
	   Meanwhile, on Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones industrial
average edged higher after three sessions of profit-taking, closing
up 5.93 points at 8,371.97.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed up 8.49 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,037.10.
The TOPIX declined 14.37 points, or 1.37 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 0.870 points, unchanged from Wednesday's finish. Its
price was marginally lower at 108.25 yen from 108.26 yen.

	   GAZA CITY (AP) _ In an attack blamed on Palestinian militants, a
bomb exploded in a central Gaza Strip junction Thursday as an
Israeli convoy of army jeeps and a school bus drove by. At least
one Israeli was killed and three were wounded, paramedics said.
	   One witness said he saw two bodies. The children were unharmed.
	   Palestinian witnesses said three Palestinians were also wounded,
apparently by Israeli soldiers or settlers who began shooting
randomly in response to the explosion. Palestinian police said they
exchanged fire with Israeli troops, but that no one was hurt.
	   Palestinian Jaber Yamawi said he was waiting at a bus stop when
the blast went off. ``I saw one Israeli jeep blow up and burn
completely,'' said Yamawi. ``I saw them take out two soldiers in
ambulances and after that there was gunfire.''
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler who prepares bodies for
burials, said he saw two bodies at the scene. ``The jeep is still
burning,'' he told Israel radio an hour after the explosion.
	   ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered all over. There is oil, gas,
blood. Things we see too often lately,'' Kirshenzach said.
	   The attack raised questions about whether the implementation of
the new Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security accord will begin on
schedule on Monday.
	   A centerpiece of the agreement is a Palestinian pledge to work
harder to prevent attacks by Palestinian militants on Israelis.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would hold up
implementation if he felt the Palestinians were not doing their
part in stopping terror attacks.
	   In a first response, the army sealed the Gaza Strip, barring
Palestinians from leaving and entering.
	   Thursday's blast went off at about 7:40 a.m. (0540 gmt) at an
intersection about half a mile south of Kfar Darom, an isolated
Jewish settlement in the center of the Gaza Strip.
	   It was not clear whether the explosion was set off by a car bomb
or by a remote-controlled device planted by the side of the road.
	   At the time a bus carrying children from Kfar Darom, escorted by
army jeeps, was passing by. One Israeli was killed and three adults
were lightly injured, an ambulance driver, identified only as
David, told Israel radio. He said the wounded received treatment at
the scene and were flown to a hospital by helicopter.
	   The intersection is near Gush Katif, the main Jewish settlement
bloc in Gaza, where about 5,000 Jewish settlers live, near the
Palestinian city of Khan Yunis.
	   Israeli buses there travel in convoys, guarded by Israeli army
vehicles.

Report: Ruling party legislator arrested in fraud scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors arrested a Japanese ruling party
legislator Thursday on suspicion of falsifying political subsidy
reports to hide misuse of party funds, news reports said.
	   Yoichi Nakajima, a Liberal Democratic Party member of
Parliament, allegedly ordered the fabrication of receipts to
account for 12.6 million yen (dlrs 106,000) that went missing from
subsidies received from party headquarters.
	   Nakajima, 39, was arrested on charges of violating the political
party subsidy law and the political fund control law, Kyodo News
and national broadcaster NHK reported.
	   The lawmaker, who represents a district in Gunma prefecture
(state) in central Japan, has reportedly denied wrongdoing and said
he was unaware of the actions of his subordinates.
	   Prosecutors declined to comment on the case.
	   The mass-circulation newspaper Asahi said some of the false
receipts included expenses for political events that never
occurred.
	   Japan's political world has been rocked by a series of
corruption scandals in recent years that have exposed cozy ties
between government officials and businesses.
	   This is the first time, however, that a legislator has been
arrested on charges of violating Japan's political party subsidy
law.

Pinochet: A fate that could frighten former dictators in exile

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Haiti's ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier is in France,
reportedly broke. Ethiopia's Mengistu Haile Mariam, under tighter
security since an assassination attempt, now mostly just stays home
reading and writing.
	   Even before the Oct. 16 arrest in London of former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on a Spanish extradition warrant,
life has been uneasy for some fallen dictators.
	   Pinochet _ at least until he showed up in London last month _
had it made compared with his fellow former rulers wanted for mass
murder, torture and kidnapping. He was in his native land, immune
there from prosecution.
	   For the rest, whether they live in luxury or poverty, it's
mostly been one long battle to fade into foreign obscurity. They
have their bodyguards, their money, their memories and their hopes
that the midnight knock on the door, the assassin's bullet or the
extradition warrant never comes.
	   Along with Duvalier and Mengistu, there's Haiti's Raoul Cedras,
dwelling quietly in a high-rent district of Panama City; Paraguay's
Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, given sanctuary in Brazil since the 1989
coup that ended his 34-year-dictatorship; and Uganda's Gen. Idi
Amin, living with several wives and at least 30 children in
all-expenses-paid luxury in Saudi Arabia.
	   Human rights investigators say some 300,000 people were killed
during Amin's eight years of blood-soaked rule after he seized
power in a 1979 coup in the east African nation.
	   Now in his early 70s, Amin lives in the Red Sea port city of
Jiddah, where he has been spotted on evening walks along the coast
or attending Friday prayers in a nearby mosque.
	   The Saudi government pays his huge expenses, including cars,
drivers, cooks, maids and a monthly allowance. In return, the
Saudis _ who won't talk about their infamous guest _ demand silence
and no political activity.
	   Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, whose family's 1957-86
dynasty saw tens of thousands massacred and tortured to death in
Haiti, is less fortunate.
	   Duvalier, who was 19 when he succeeded his father, Francois _ a
doctor known as ``Papa Doc'' _ as president in 1971, is a virtually
forgotten figure.
	   The man who once had a private militia of thousands of so-called
Tontons Macoutes, wreaking havoc and living off extortion, is now
never seen in public. He is divorced from his wife and reportedly
lives on handouts from friends.
	   Mengistu, a Marxist accused of mass murder and crimes against
humanity during his 17-year rule, has perhaps more cause to worry
than most.
	   Zimbabweans, mostly poor, were unenthusiastic about his 1991
arrival in Harare, capital of their central African country,
particularly after the government picked up an unpaid phone account
for dlrs 15,000.
	   His protector, Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, is now
increasingly unpopular. And since the 1995 assassination attempt _
two gunmen were jailed for two years _ life has gotten more
restrictive.
	   In occasional telephone interviews with The Associated Press in
Harare, Mengistu has sounded lonely.
	   Most recently in March, asked about Mugabe's fading political
fortunes, Mengistu said he had no plans to try to find new refuge
in Communist North Korea.
	   ``Most of the time I am just staying at home and reading and
writing something about my country,'' he said.
	   In Brazil, Paraguay's Stroessner keeps quiet and avoids
photographers, and there are no reports of him ever being seen
outside the mansion where in lives in the posh Lago Sul district of
the capital, Brasilia.
	   In 1989, the United States refused him an entry visa for
prostate cancer treatment.
	   In Panama City, Cedras looks secure: Panama flatly rejected an
extradition request from Haiti earlier this year.
	   Human rights activists and many commentators, however, contend
that after Pinochet's London experience, no dictator can ever feel
safe again.
	   Essayist Mario Vargas Llosa, among Latin America's most widely
translated writers, could think of no better warning for aspiring
dictators worldwide.
	   ``To know that the international community does not guarantee
impunity for their crimes and they will always live on the fly,
like cornered rats ... will be a powerful vaccination against the
Third World plague of military pronouncements, barracks
insurrections and coups d'etat,'' Llosa wrote in the Spanish daily
El Pais.

part in stopping terror attacks.
	   In a first response, the army sealed the Gaza Strip, barring
Palestinians from leaving and entering.
	   Thursday's blast went off at about 7:40 a.m. (0540 GMT) at an
intersection about half a mile south of Kfar Darom, an isolated
Jewish settlement in the center of the Gaza Strip.
	   It was not clear whether the explosion was set off by a car bomb
or by a remote-controlled device planted by the side of the road.
	   At the time a bus carrying children from Kfar Darom, escorted by
army jeeps, was passing by. One Israeli was killed and three adults
were lightly injured, an ambulance driver, identified only as
David, told Israel radio. He said the wounded received treatment at
the scene and were flown to a hospital by helicopter.
	   The intersection is near Gush Katif, the main Jewish settlement
bloc in Gaza, where about 5,000 Jewish settlers live near the
Palestinian city of Khan Yunis.
	   Israeli buses there travel in convoys, guarded by Israeli army
vehicles.

Turning against rebels, 500,000 Rwandans seek army protection

	   NYARUTOVU, Rwanda (AP) _ In a major blow to a four-year Hutu
insurgency, nearly half a million of Rwandans weary of rebel
intimidation, extortion and empty promises of returning to power
have sought protection from the army.
	   ``The fact people are here means the rebels are losing support
among the population,'' said Jean-Claude Hakuzimana, a 27-year-old
Hutu teacher. ``But I don't know for how long we can continue to
live like this.''
	   Hakuzimana is one of the 30,000 Hutus who fled their homes in
the past two months to escape forced recruitment by the rebels. He
has found his home at this squalid, roadside camp 50 miles (80
kilometers) northwest of Kigali, one of a dozen makeshift
settlements throughout the region.
	   The Tutsi-led army hopes to finally succeed in defeating the
Hutu rebels hiding in mountainous northwestern Rwanda by removing
the largely Hutu population that has been both their human shield
and their source of support.
	   The army has been battling the rebels with mixed success since
its July 1994 ouster of Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the slaughter of more than 500,000 people that year.
	   It was only this year that the government successfully combined
military pressure with a campaign to persuade local Hutu officials
to cooperate with the authorities and identify the rebels in their
midst.
	   Almost nightly extortions of money and meager food supplies have
alienated people from the Hutu fighters. Anyone not cooperating was
killed and desertion from rebel ranks meant certain death,
Hakuzimana said.
	   The rebels have been attacking local offices, schools and health
centers _ symbols of the state they want to make ungovernable.
Bridges and roads have been damaged and people often were told to
``take sides,'' Hakuzimana said.
	   ``They say they are fighting against Tutsi domination. But this
is a Hutu-against-Hutu war. They kill everyone who doesn't follow
them,'' Hakuzimana said of the rebels. ``If you refuse to give
money, you're dead. If you refuse to give them bed, you're dead.
The fact the army showed more power recently made people turn
against the rebels.''
	   The government, which sent troops to neighboring Congo in August
to clear Hutu bases from the border area, simultaneously launched
several large search-and-destroy operations in northwestern Rwanda
in an attempt to break the Hutu insurgency.
	   The rapid increase in the number of displaced people _ which has
doubled since August _ has caught both the government and aid
agencies off guard and threatened to create a humanitarian crisis.
	   The government prefers not to have foreign aid workers around
who could become witnesses to extrajudicial killings during
military operations. But it needs the food and medical supplies
they provide to keep the Hutu civilians on its side.
	   Only a few aid agencies are willing to operate in northwestern
Rwanda, where rebel ambushes, the kidnappings of missionaries and
the slaughter of both Hutus and Tutsis have become the norm.
	   ``If this trend continues, we will be faced with trying to
assist the largest number of people displaced in the Great Lakes,''
said Michele Quintaglie, a World Food Program spokeswoman. ``But we
can't do it alone. We need more aid agencies to come and help us.''
	   Nyarotovu's deputy mayor, Alphonse Nzaramyimana, said at least
three people a day were dying from malaria, dysentery or simply
because they had no food.
	   Rebels destroyed the camp's only water tank during a raid in
May. Today people struggle to wash in a muddy creek.
	   WFP has only been able to provide each of the displaced with 11
pounds (5 kilos) of beans per month. The agency says it will take
until the end of next month to deliver sufficient food to all of
the displaced in the region that used to be the breadbasket for
this nation of 7.2 million.

Indonesian workers demonstrate for release of labor leader

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 100 workers demonstrated
Thursday for the release of a jailed labor activist who was
convicted of organizing a strike while former President Suharto was
in power.
	   Dozens of students also rallied outside Parliament, one day
after 8,000 students demonstrated there in the biggest protest in
the capital since violent unrest forced the authoritarian Suharto
to quit in May.
	   Like the students, workers who gathered outside the attorney
general's office demanded an end to the Indonesian military's big
role in politics and said that the armed forces always favored
employers in labor disputes.
	   Their main demand was the release of Dita Indah Sari, who was
convicted last year of organizing a 1996 strike by 20,000 workers
in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city.
	   She was arrested in a nationwide crackdown on opposition
activists and sentenced to six years in prison.
	   ``We want the release of our hero,'' said Gimin, a worker. ``She
was put in jail by the Suharto regime because she defended our
rights and our struggle.''
	   The workers, who came from diamond, electronics and shoe
factories, also demanded that the government lower the prices of
basic commodities. Inflation has soared and millions of people have
lost their jobs as Indonesia endures its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   The students who gathered near the legislature Thursday also
demanded that the government revoke the national philosophy,
Pancasila, which mandates social tolerance. Suharto jailed many
opponents after accusing them of violating the creed.
	   On Wednesday, student demonstrators demanded that Suharto's
successor, President B.J. Habibie, quit over continuing political
and economic turmoil.
	   They called on the government to abandon plans to convene a
special assembly that will cast guidelines next month for elections
in 1999.
	   Student leaders claim the assembly won't push for real change
and is filled with holdovers from the Suharto era.
	   Habibie has taken steps to implement democracy, freeing some
political prisoners and allowing banned magazines to reopen and
political parties to form. Critics, however, say he is not moving
fast enough.
	   Also Thursday, about 30 women protested on Jakarta's main street
against violence against women that they claim has been
state-sponsored.
	   Karlina Laksono, a spokeswoman for the group, said rape had been
used as a method of intimidation against women in areas such as
East Timor and Aceh where separatists have been fighting for
independence from Indonesia.
	   An inquiry now is being held into allegations that mass rapes
were committed during rioting in May.
	   The government has denied using rape as an instrument to cow its
opponents.

	   Paramedics said they knew of one dead in the attack blamed on
Palestinian militants, and a witness said he saw two bodies. The
report of three dead could not be confirmed independently.
	   The children were unharmed.
	   Palestinian witnesses said three Palestinians were also wounded,
apparently by Israeli soldiers or settlers who began shooting
randomly in response to the explosion.
	   Palestinian police said they briefly exchanged fire with Israeli
troops, but that no one was hurt. However, about an hour after the
blast, senior officers from both sides were seen standing together
and discussing the situation calmly.
	   Palestinian Jaber Yamawi said he was waiting at a bus stop when
the blast went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 gmt).
	   ``I saw one Israeli jeep blow up and burn completely,'' said
Yamawi. ``I saw them take out two soldiers in ambulances and after
that there was gunfire.''
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler who prepares bodies for
burials, said he saw two bodies at the scene. ``The jeep is still
burning,'' he told Israel radio an hour after the explosion.
	   ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered all over. There is oil, gas,
blood. Things we see too often lately,'' Kirshenzach said.

U.N. official `regrets' restrictions on meetings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The U.N. special rapporteur on religious
intolerance has expressed regret that Vietnam limited access to
some religious groups during his 10-day assessment visit.
	   In a carefully worded statement released just before he left the
country late Tuesday, Abdelfattah Amor chastised the Vietnamese
government for the restrictions.
	   ``While thanking the government of Vietnam for its invitation,
the special envoy wishes to remind of the necessity of respect for
the rules and guarantees of his mandate regarding freedom of
movement and freedom to meet anybody without any restraints or
repercussions,'' Amor said.
	   When Amor was granted permission to visit Vietnam in July _
three years after he submitted his original request _ the United
Nations said he would come only if given free access to all
religious groups and individuals.
	   In Vietnam, any religion not sanctioned by the government is
considered superstition that must be eliminated. That includes
unsanctioned sects of Buddhism and other religions.
	   Human rights groups say church leaders have been jailed in the
past because of their religious practices. Officials deny they hold
any religious or political prisoners, just people who have broken
the law.
	   Thich Quang Do, secretary-general of the banned Unified Buddhist
Church of Vietnam, said Amor and other U.N. officials were turned
away by plainclothes police at the gate of his Thanh Minh Zen
monastery in Ho Chi Minh City on Monday.
	   Do was released from prison last month after nearly four years
as part of a general amnesty for more than 5,000 inmates.
	   Amor confirmed the incident and other difficulties, including a
ban on travel to Danang and Hau Nghia in Quang Ngai province.
	   ``The special envoy regrets that he was not given the chance to
meet with representatives of certain religious communities (Hoa
Hao, Taoist, Confucian, Hindu),'' the statement said.
	   Amor said he went to a labor camp in Dong Nai province to meet
with three jailed members of the Unified Buddhist Church. On
arrival, he was told that one had been freed the previous day as
part of the government's second amnesty in two months.
	   The meeting with the two other men was interrupted repeatedly,
Amor's statement said. The camp commander claimed another member of
the banned church and three Catholics were not there ``even when
multiple sources have confirmed their presence ... and said one of
them suffers from mental health problems.''
	   Amor will deliver a full report on his visit to the next U.N.
Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva in March.
	   The Vietnamese government denied Tuesday that restrictions had
been placed on the U.N. official. There was no immediate reaction
Thursday to Amor's statement.
	   The U.S. Congress has included Vietnam on a list of 36 countries
that practice religious suppression. Vietnam responded by calling
that a distortion and suggested Congress should reconsider an ``old
and meaningless story.''
	   Communist Party General Secretary Le Kha Phieu said in June that
Vietnam ``truly respects religious freedom,'' but that religious
activities must follow the country's laws and policies.

	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Israel would not delay implementation of the new
land-for-security agreement in response to the bombing.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants. The clock starts ticking on Monday.
	   Bar-Illan said Israel would be watching the Palestinian
Authority's response to the bombing closely. He also said he held
Yasser Arafat's government indirectly responsible for the attack.
	   ``We blame them for lionizing and glorifying terrorists on the
one hand while giving lip service to fighting terrorism,'' he said.

Specialized care said to help injured brains heal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHESDA, Maryland (AP) _ Survivors of traumatic brain injury
have the best chance of resuming active lives if they receive
specialized _ though expensive _ rehabilitation that can retrain
their brains, said a government panel.
	   ``The brain seems to have a remarkable capacity to heal if given
the right opportunities,'' said Dr. Bruce Wexler of Yale
University, describing sophisticated brain exercises that can help.
	   Traumatic brain injury is any injury to the brain resulting from
such trauma as car crashes, falls, violence or sports accidents.
Some suffer severe brain damage that causes long-term debilitation,
while others suffer milder injuries with more subtle symptoms such
as a personality change or memory problems.
	   Better trauma care is getting more severely injured people
hospitalized in time to save them. But survival doesn't necessarily
mean recovery, and doctors have long debated the best way to treat
survivors.
	   The National Institutes of Health, at Congress' request,
convened brain experts who spent a year studying that question.
Wednesday, the panel concluded the best care is a comprehensive
treatment program including cognitive, physical and social
rehabilitation tailored to each patient, often lasting for many
years.
	   That's expensive, the panel acknowledged. In some rural areas,
rehabilitation isn't even offered. Some insurance policies won't
cover outpatient rehabilitation or long-term care.
	   ``We can only state what is appropriate care and hope it gets
funded,'' said the panel's chairman, Dr. Kristjan Ragnarsson of New
York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine. ``We know we cannot cure
this condition. But there are treatments.''
	   Take patients in a coma. There is no evidence that the one-time
fad of stimulating patients while they're comatose helps, and it
may even hurt, said Dr. James Kelly of the Rehabilitation Institute
of Chicago. Instead, once patients begin to emerge from a coma,
they need special physical and mental stimulation during the time
each day that they are fully aware. ``You need a sophisticated team
that knows when to stimulate, and when to back off,'' Kelly said.
	   Physical, speech and occupational therapy help patients function
on their own, but they also need specialized cognitive exercises,
the panel said. Computer programs that help patients track moving
objects, for instance, can improve attention span, and other
seemingly simple exercises can improve the higher-learning sections
of the brain, said Wexler.
	   The panel stressed that much more research is needed. No single
treatment fits all patients, and doctors don't understand enough
about how the brain works to know why one person recovers better
than another.
	   Also, primary care physicians must be better educated to spot
subtle brain injuries, the panel said. Patients whose doctors don't
link a past concussion, for instance, to headaches, depression or
an aggressive personality change can spend frustrating years
seeking help, said panelist Candace Gustafson, a Boston nurse who
recovered from brain injury. And injured children may need more
help in school.
	   The panel also urged better efforts to prevent brain injury.
Half of all cases are related to alcohol use. Others could be
prevented by such simple acts as wearing helmets when bicycling or
skating.

Report: Hong Kong gang figure admits plotting murder, kidnapping,
</HEADLINE>
robbery &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Reputed mob boss ``Big Spender'' Cheung
Tze-keung and 35 accomplices are awaiting verdicts that could carry
the death penalty, after several begged a Chinese court for
leniency in a sensational gangland trial, local media reported
Thursday.
	   The case in mainland China is closed, but unconfirmed reports
say one of Cheung's lieutenants admitted plotting all of the
crimes, including murder, kidnapping, robbery and gun-running,
while Cheung got a big emotional lift as his common-law wife showed
up Wednesday to watch the final arguments.
	   Despite the possibility of an execution hanging over his head,
Cheung broke into a big smile when Law Yim-fong, 36, made her
surprise appearance at the courtroom in Guangzhou, media reports
said.
	   Law was able to come after Hong Kong police dropped bail
conditions that were set after she was arrested in August on
suspicion of laundering money for Cheung. Her arrival ``appeared to
transform the alleged crime boss into a lovelorn husband,'' the
South China Morning Post reported, quoting defense lawyers it did
not identify.
	   Cheung, 44, made no statements in his own defense, newspapers
said, although his lawyer again argued the case should be moved to
Hong Kong. Hong Kong does not execute people, while many of the
charges in this case are punishable by death in China.
	   Some of the defendants entered guilty pleas, begged for leniency
or expressed regrets over their actions, newspapers said.
	   One of the top figures in the gang, ``Tall Guy Seven'' Chan
Chi-ho, reportedly told the court he was guilty of all charges.
	   ``It seemed he didn't care any more,'' said a source who was
quoted anonymously by the Post.
	   Local media have extensively covered the trial, which reportedly
includes charges based on kidnappings of property magnate Li
Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and the chairman of Sun Hung Kai
Properties, Walter Kwok, said to have netted hundreds of millions
of U.S. dollars in ransom.
	   But since a closed Chinese court is trying crimes allegedly
committed in Hong Kong, the case has raised concerns about Hong
Kong's independent judiciary.
	   Justice officials in Hong Kong have rejected Cheung's attempts
to have the trial transferred, saying they had insufficient
evidence to take over the case.
	   Hong Kong's top government official, Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa, said that since Cheung also allegedly broke laws in
China, it was appropriate for him to be tried there.
	   If the defendants are found guilty and are unable to win an
appeal, mainland authorities would arrange a public session to
announce the judgments and then set immediate executions, the
Chinese-language daily Ming Pao reported, quoting sources it did
not identify.
	   Verdicts could take a few days to a few months, media reports
said.

	   Paramedics said they knew of one dead in the attack blamed on
Palestinian militants, and a witness said he saw two bodies. The
report of three dead could not be confirmed independently.
	   Israel radio said at least two Israelis were wounded. The
children were unharmed.
	   Palestinian witnesses said three Palestinians were also wounded,
apparently by Israeli soldiers or settlers who began shooting
randomly in response to the explosion.
	   Palestinian police said they briefly exchanged fire with Israeli
troops, but that no one was hurt. However, about an hour after the
blast, senior officers from both sides were seen standing together
and discussing the situation calmly.
	   The attack raised questions about whether the implementation of
the new Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security accord will begin on
schedule on Monday.
	   Palestinian Jaber Yamawi said he was waiting at a bus stop when
the blast went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT).
	   ``I saw one Israeli jeep blow up and burn completely,'' said
Yamawi. ``I saw them take out two soldiers in ambulances and after
that there was gunfire.''
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler who prepares bodies for
burials, said he saw two bodies at the scene. ``The jeep is still
burning,'' he told Israel radio an hour after the explosion.
	   ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered all over. There is oil, gas,
blood. Things we see too often lately,'' Kirshenzach said.
	   A centerpiece of the new agreement is a Palestinian pledge to
work harder to prevent attacks by Palestinian militants on
Israelis.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would hold up
implementation if he felt the Palestinians were not doing their
part in stopping terror attacks.
	   In a first response, the army sealed the Gaza Strip, barring
Palestinians from leaving and entering.
	   Thursday's blast went off at about 7:40 a.m. (0540 GMT) at an
intersection about half a mile south of Kfar Darom, an isolated
Jewish settlement in the center of the Gaza Strip.
	   It was not clear whether the explosion was set off by a car bomb
or by a remote-controlled device planted by the side of the road.
	   At the time a bus carrying children from Kfar Darom, escorted by
army jeeps, was passing by. One Israeli was killed and three adults
were lightly injured, an ambulance driver, identified only as
David, told Israel radio. He said the wounded received treatment at
the scene and were flown to a hospital by helicopter.
	   The intersection is near Gush Katif, the main Jewish settlement
bloc in Gaza, where about 5,000 Jewish settlers live near the
Palestinian city of Khan Yunis.
	   Israeli buses there travel in convoys, guarded by Israeli army
vehicles.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Fire swept through a cold storage
plant under construction, killing at least 21 workers and injuring
15 others Thursday in the southern port city of Pusan, police said.
	   Police said the fire, believed to have been ignited by welding
sparks, engulfed the three upper floors of the eight-story
structure, trapping dozens of people inside.
	   Most of the dead suffocated in toxic gas that filled parts of
the building, they said. Clusters of bodies were found in the
stairways leading to the rooftop.
	   The blaze was put out in two hours but firefighters had
difficulty moving into the building because of the gas.
	   Fifteen people, including 10 workers and five firefighters, were
hospitalized with burns and other injuries, police said. Some
suffered broken legs and back injuries after jumping from the
building.
	   About a half dozen workers escaped to the roof, where they were
later rescued by helicopter, police said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Teachers at a secondary school in Siberia started
a hunger strike Thursday to press demands for overdue wages, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Teachers at another 18 schools in the Topchikha district decided
they would not return to work after a national holiday next week,
ITAR-Tass said, quoting Alexander Ivanov, press secretary of the
territorial committee of educators' trade union.
	   The teachers, like many other government workers and pensioners
across Russia, have not received their salaries for months.

Taliban leader wants young boys off the battlefield

 &UR; Eds: ADDS details in 8th graf on salary of army recruit &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ If he's too young to grow a beard,
he's too young to join Afghanistan's Taliban religious army.
	   This from the Taliban's reclusive leader Mullah Mohammed Omar in
a broadcast Thursday on the Taliban-run Radio Shariat.
	   Omar warned his commanders that they would be punished under
Islamic law if young boys were found carrying guns and fighting on
the front lines against opposition troops. He did not specify what
the penalty would be.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army, which rules roughly 90 percent of
Afghanistan, is battling a northern-based opposition, of mostly
minority ethnic groups, on at least three different front lines.
	   The heaviest fighting has been in northern Takhar province where
the opposition retook the capital of Taloqan several days ago.
	   It was not immediately clear what prompted Omar to issue his
latest edict.
	   With their country wracked by fighting for much of the past two
decades, many of Afghanistan's boys have neither been to school nor
received technical training.
	   In Afghanistan there are few jobs and for many young males the
only source of income is the army, which pays 90,000 afghanis a
month or the equivalent of dlrs 3. This compares to a doctor who
receives 80,000 Afghanis a month.
	   Omar did not specify any age limit for enlistment in the Taliban
army, only referring to whether or not the recruit has facial hair.
	   Both sides in the Afghan civil war have used boys as young as 11
or 12 on the front lines.
	   Omar also expressed concern about reports that young boys were
being forced into homosexual relationships and threatened to impose
Islamic justice on anyone found guilty of having a homosexual
affair.
	   In Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, where a harsh form of Islamic
justice has been applied, the death penalty is imposed for crimes
of murder, sodomy and adultery.
	   Under Taliban law, men found guilty of homosexuality are forced
to stand in front of a mud or brick wall, which is collapsed on top
of them, usually with the help of a tank. The men remain buried for
30 minutes and if they are alive when the debris is removed their
sentence is commuted. Such a punishment has been applied to at
least eight men accused of homosexuality, and two are reported to
have survived the ordeal.
	   The Taliban movement that emerged out of Islamic religious
schools adheres to a rigid form of Islam that bars women from work,
girls from school and demands that women be accompanied by a close
male relative outside the home. It also demands that men grow a
beard, pray at the mosque and wear a turban or head covering,
similar to Islam's prophet Mohammed.

Report: Ruling party legislator arrested in fraud scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details, background; CORRECTS first name of lawmaker to
Yojiro &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors arrested a Japanese ruling party
legislator Thursday on suspicion of falsifying political subsidy
reports to hide misuse of party funds, news reports said.
	   Yojiro Nakajima, a Liberal Democratic Party member of
Parliament, allegedly ordered the fabrication of receipts to
account for 12.6 million yen (dlrs 106,000) that went missing from
subsidies received from party headquarters.
	   Nakajima, 39, was arrested on charges of violating the political
party subsidy law and the political fund control law, Kyodo News
and national broadcaster NHK reported.
	   Five other people were reportedly being investigated in the
case. Prosecutors were planning to raid Nakajima's offices for
evidence, NHK said.
	   Nakajima's office allegedly sent the falsified accounting
reports to a prefectural election committee and to LDP
headquarters. His office reportedly received some 20 million yen
(dlrs 168,000) in government subsidies issued through LDP
headquarters in 1996 and 1997.
	   The lawmaker, who represents a district in Gunma prefecture
(state) in central Japan, has reportedly denied wrongdoing and said
he was unaware of the actions of his subordinates.
	   Prosecutors declined to comment on the case.
	   The mass-circulation newspaper Asahi said some of the false
receipts included expenses for political events that never
occurred.
	   Japan's political world has been rocked by a series of
corruption scandals in recent years that have exposed cozy ties
between government officials and businesses.
	   This is the first time, however, that a legislator has been
arrested on charges of violating Japan's political party subsidy
law.
	   Earlier this year, another LDP legislator, Shokei Arai, hanged
himself hours before he was expected to be arrested on charges of
accepting kickbacks from Nikko Securities Co., a major brokerage.

Far East region threatens to cut power
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Local authorities in Russia's Far Eastern region
of Kamchatka are threatening to cut electricity to all their
customers, including military sites, the ITAR-Tass news agency said
Thursday.
	   The first deputy governor of the Kamchatka administration, Boris
Sinchenko, wrote a letter to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
advising him of the problem, ITAR-Tass said.
	   It gave no other details, other than to say Kamchatka's energy
sector ``is in a disastrous condition.''
	   Earlier this month the region started rationing electricity, hot
water and heating to homes and businesses. Sinchenko said at the
time the region had only a 10-day supply of fuel. He blamed the
federal government for failing to deliver promised funds to buy
more fuel.

Noisy Algerian press wages silent battle with authorities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Algeria's often noisy, always energetic
privately-owned press has been all but silent for two weeks, and
four leading editors say it will stay that way _ until they win
their tug-of-war with the state.
	   The editors claim they are being targeted by authorities who see
an increasingly aggressive press as a threat to their special
interests.
	   Press reports prompted the recent resignations of the justice
minister and President Liamine Zeroual's top aide, both of whom
were accused of abusing their offices.
	   Now the Algerian press is paying for that, the editors contended
at a Paris news conference Wednesday.
	   The editors gathered here under the auspices of the
Brussels-based International Crisis Group to explain their plight.
The group is a private organization that deals with humanitarian
and political crises.
	   The editors represent the dailies El Watan, Le Soir d'Algerie,
El Khebar and La Tribune _ among seven newspapers that shut down
Oct. 14 to protest an ultimatum by the state-run printing house for
two newspapers to pay back debts or lose printing rights.
	   But there are no debts, the editors said. Even routine arrears
could not be settled because the demand for payment within 48 hours
fell on a weekend, they said.
	   ``At the risk of upsetting the international community, the
government has struck,'' said Omar Belhouchet, of El Watan, one of
the two papers, along with Le Matin, targeted by the printers.
	   ``Authorities are seeking above all to preserve a system ... to
preserve their interests,'' Belhouchet said.
	   Authorities claim the affair is but a commercial dispute, but
the protest movement by editors is slowly gathering steam.
	   Three political parties, the Front for Socialist Forces, the
pro-Islamic Movement for a Peaceful Society and the anti-Islamic
Rally for Culture and Democracy, expressed support Wednesday for
the newspapers.
	   Women's groups have also voiced support.
	   ``We are clients of the state. The state has a monopoly on
printing and that becomes a means of pressure ... blackmail,'' said
Zoubir Souissi, executive editor of Le Soir d'Algerie.
	   The press protest, along with a handful of strikes, has taken
the focus off the violence wracking Algeria, doing battle for
nearly seven years with Islamic insurgents. An estimated 75,000
people have been killed.
	   ``There are political, even existential differences between
us,'' said Kheiredine Ameyar, executive editor of La Tribune. ``But
we have decided to stick together.''
	   Algeria boasts a plethora of press titles, but the oldest
privately-owned newspaper, Le Soir d'Algerie, was only born in
1990, a year after a new Constitution abolished the single-party
state.
	   Today, the Algerian press is widely considered among the freest
in the Arab world. But this is not the first time authorities have
tried to muffle it. El Watan has been suspended five times, and
Belhouchet has been to court on various charges.
	   Another daily, La Nation, acclaimed for its independent
reporting, has been shut down since December 1996.
	   The president of the International Crisis Group, Alain Destexhe,
said a silenced press would cast doubt on the credibility of
upcoming presidential elections.
	   Zeroual announced plans to cut short his term, scheduled to end
in 2000, and hold elections before the end of February.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A judge rejected a challenge from
the ruling African National Congress party on Thursday and allowed
the release of a watershed report by the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission on South Africa's racist past.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission can now release the
3,500-page report to journalists ahead of its formal handover later
Thursday by Desmond Tutu, a former Anglican archbishop and the
commission chairman, to President Nelson Mandela.

the panel, when the ruling was announced. ``That's a victory for
truth and human rights in this country.''

	   BELIZE CITY, Belize (AP) _ Plywood planks covered shop windows,
stray dogs ran freely, and police and soldiers patrolled deserted
streets.
	   For all practical purposes, Belize City, the main city in this
Central American country, was closed Wednesday. Most of its 75,000
residents seemed to have decided to flee the Caribbean port to go
somewhere else to wait for Hurricane Mitch.
	   They had good reasons to be cautious. Belize City was devastated
by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 and again by Hurricane Greta in 1978.
It's a flat, low-lying city, where many houses are built on stilts
and a moderate rainfall is enough to cause flooding.
	   Those who could headed to the capital, Belmopan, and other
places on higher ground. Many others headed to emergency shelters.
	   Local radio broadcast updates about hurricane conditions and
messages from residents searching for relatives from whom they were
separated in the haste to leave the city. Cable television was
still in service, but only one station was offered: The Weather
Channel.
	   Kevin Everett was among 800 people who spent the night in a
packed schoolhouse. If the hurricane hits, his house could be wiped
out.
	   ``I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about my life,'' he
said.
	   Beulah Sikaffy invited some friends and employees of her
family's business to stay in the three-story building that is her
home and office.
	   By Wednesday, the number visiting was up to an estimated 80
people.
	   Next door, the 14-room hotel owned by her brother-in-law, Freddy
Sikaffy, was closed down.
	   Soldiers armed with M-16 automatic rifles joined police on
patrols to stop looters. ``We've received a lot of burglary
complaints. That's why we're here,'' said Police Constable Nelson
Augustine.
	   Soldiers and police also guarded the Fiesta Inn, one of the
largest hotels in Belize City. The hotel was closed but a handful
of guests with nowhere else to go were permitted to stay.
	   Bob and Sue Sharpe of Austin, Texas, were among them. Security
guards allowed the couple to stay there Tuesday after they fled in
a boat from Caye Caulker, a small island where they had been
vacationing.
	   ``The water was just coming over the sides of the boat on us all
the time,'' Mrs. Sharpe said.
	   At the hotel, she and her husband share a room with two other
men. The restaurant is closed, and there's little to do but wait
for breaks in the rain.
	   Still, she had no complaints.
	   ``It's been wonderful,'' she said. ``We're completely safe and
comfortable. We have TV _ even if all you can watch is The Weather
Channel.''

Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah introduces himself to the world

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince
Abdullah has returned from a world tour aimed at establishing
himself as the man in charge in his oil-rich kingdom and unveiling
a gentler picture of himself at home.
	   Abdullah, next-in-line to the ailing King Fahd, visited key
allies as the United States, France, Britain, China and Japan
during his six-week, seven-nation world tour that ended Tuesday.
	   Abdullah opened the doors to new business, tried to dispel the
notion he was anti-American and showed himself a more forceful
spokesman than Fahd on the touchy issue of Arab-Israeli relations.
Journalists and analysts who accompanied him said Wednesday that
the prince succeeded in stepping out from Fahd's shadow.
	   ``He was given the reception of a head of state everywhere we
went,'' said journalist Amir Taheri. ``Abdullah is now in charge
and they have to deal with him, that there has been a transition of
power and that it was smooth.''
	   Abdullah, who took over the throne briefly in 1995 when Fahd had
a stroke, has taken on more responsibilities since Fahd has been
hospitalized four times this year. Fahd is believed to be at least
75 and Abdullah a couple of years younger.
	   Abdullah also wanted to affirm Saudi Arabia's commitment to its
policies, said Waheed Hashem, assistant professor of political
science at King Abdul-Aziz University in the Saudi Red Sea port
city of Jiddah.
	   ``He wanted to assure leaders ... relations will remain the same
and there will be no major shifts in the country's oil or foreign
policy,'' he said.
	   In Washington, Abdullah met with heads of major oil companies
and discussed joint ventures. The need for foreign investment is
crucial since the drop in oil prices has left the Saudis with an
estimated dlrs 13 billion deficit.
	   The prince also presented himself as a friend of the West. When
asked by Time magazine about allegations that he was anti-American,
Abdullah replied, ``I assure you that I fully appreciate the strong
and deep relations that tie our two countries.''
	   But whereas Fahd shied from discussing Israel _ a major U.S.
ally _ Abdullah was more bold.
	   In an interview with the Saudi daily al-Riyadh, Abdullah
criticized Israeli policies and said he constantly brought up with
Western leaders the importance of Jerusalem to Arabs and Muslims.
	   ``We were able to find an understanding with these leaders about
the significance of the holy city, the seat of the third holiest
shrine in Islam, and the Palestinians living there,'' the paper
quoted Abdullah as saying.
	   Abdullah also increased his popularity at home by taking the
unprecedented step of allowing pictures of himself wearing tennis
shoes and colorful sports shirts. For most, it was the first sight
of a Saudi leader without the traditional flowing white robes.
	   ``This gave Saudis a new perspective of him and made him appear
human ... like he was one of us,'' Hashem said.

Hamas claims responsibility for car bomb explosion in Gaza
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES throughout with Palestinian
security officials saying two dead, Hamas claims responsibility,
Palestinians confirm it was a car bomb &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a suicide attack by
Islamic militants, a Palestinian motorist drove into an Israeli
convoy of army jeeps and a school bus Thursday and detonated
explosives, killing himself and an Israeli man.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
bombing that also injured three Israelis. ``It's a revolution until
death,'' said a caller to Israeli radio who read a statement he
said was issued by Hamas.
	   The armored school bus was damaged, but the about 40 children
riding in it were not hurt. The children were given psychological
counseling.
	   Israel said the attack would not hold up implementation of the
land-for-security agreement signed last week in Washington, but
demanded that the Palestinian Authority do more to fight terrorism.
	   In a first response, the army sealed the Gaza Strip.
	   Witnesses said the plast went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 gmt)
at the Gush Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time,
a school bus carrying children from the nearby Jewish settlement of
Kfar Darom drove by, accompanied by army jeeps.
	   Palestinian Jaber Yamawi said he was waiting at a bus stop when
the blast went off. ``I saw one Israeli jeep blow up and burn
completely,'' said Yamawi. ``I saw them take out two soldiers in
ambulances and after that there was gunfire.''
	   Abdel Razek Majaida, a senior Palestinian police official, said
the driver of the booby-trapped car had waited until the school bus
arrived, then detonated the explosives in the vehicle.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler who prepares bodies for
burials, said the jeep was still burning an hour later. ``Parts (of
bodies) are scattered all over. There is oil, gas, blood. Things we
see too often lately,'' Kirshenzach told Israel radio.
	   Paramedics said three Israelis were wounded in the blast and
taken to hospitals.
	   There were initial reports by Palestinian witnesses that Israeli
soldiers or settlers opened fire randomly after the exlosion,
wounding three Palestinians, but the reports could not be
confirmed.
	   Amin al Hindi, a senior Palestinian security official, said his
forces were cooperating with the Israelis and that the Palestinian
Authority would respond harshly.
	   ``This incident is aimed at destroying the peace process and we
will take measures,'' al Hindi said.
	   Implementation of the new peace agreement is to begin Monday,
and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said there would not be delay. Under the accord, Israel
is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks in
exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   However, Bar-Illan said Israel would be watching the Palestinian
Authority's response to the bombing closely. He also held Yasser
Arafat's government indirectly responsible for the attack.
	   ``We blame them for lionizing and glorifying terrorists on the
one hand while giving lip service to fighting terrorism,'' he said.

	   In San Jose, California, Keith Tkachuk scored the tie-breaking
goal and Jeremy Roenick added another less than 30 seconds later as
the Phoenix Coyotes kept the San Jose Sharks winless.
	   The Sharks (0-5-2), the only team in the NHL without a victory,
had a 2-1 lead going into the third period but couldn't hold it.
	   With the game tied, San Jose goaltender Steve Shields came out
of the goal to swat away the puck at 13:48 of the third period. But
a charging Tkachuk snapped it up and easily scored his fifth goal
of the season. It was his fourth goal in the last three games.
	   Roenick then capitalized on the stunned Sharks (0-5-2) with his
goal 24 seconds later. The Coyotes (4-2-1) are undefeated in three
games.
 &UR; Mighty Ducks 5, Lightning 3
	   In Anaheim, California, Anaheim's Stu Grimson scored two goals
for the first time in 511 NHL games as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks
beat the Tampa Bay Lightning.
	   Paul Kariya and Tomas Sandstrom scored less than two minutes
apart in the first period on redirected shots and Guy Hebert made
42 saves, helping Anaheim extend its unbeaten streak to four games
(3-0-1) and snap Tampa Bay's three-game winning streak.
	   The game was played before only 13,963, the smallest crowd to
witness a hockey game in the 17,174-seat Anaheim Arena since the
Ducks entered the league in October 1993.
	   Mikael Renberg, Cory Cross and Wendel Clark scored for the
Lightning.

PRETORIA: this country.'' Judge Wilfred Thring in Cape Town ordered
</HEADLINE>
the panel to withhold the report from journalists while he held a
hearing on the ANC's application to block the report. The ANC had
objected to a finding that it had committed ``gross human rights
violations'' in its decades-long struggle against white rule.

<TEXT>
	   At about 10 a.m. (0800 GMT), Thring ruled in favor of the panel,
rejecting the ANC's 11th-hour bid to block the report.
	   The ANC's legal maneuvering outraged Tutu, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1984 for his anti-apartheid struggle. Speaking
outside a convention center where the solemn handover ceremony was
to be held later Thursday, he compared the ANC to the white rulers
of apartheid.
	   ``I have struggled against a tyranny. I didn't do that in order
to substitute it with another,'' he told journalists. ``If there is
a tyranny, an abusive power ... I will oppose it with every
fragment of my being.''
	   Tutu said he was ``devastated'' by the ANC action and commission
officials said the legal wrangle detracted from the panel's role in
helping tell the truth about victims of atrocities.
	   ``This is not about us,'' said commissioner Yasmin Sooka ``It is
about the people who have died, the people who disappeared, the
people who will never be known about.''
	   The Truth Commission came under attack from both sides of
apartheid-era rule Wednesday. In addition to the ANC move,
apartheid's last president, F.W. de Klerk, filed a lawsuit forcing
the panel to excise a finding that he was an ``accessory after the
fact'' to state-sponsored bombings.

Indonesia won't reopen case of foreign journalists killed in East
</HEADLINE>
Timor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president will not launch
a new investigation into the killings of five foreign journalists
during its 1975 invasion of East Timor, a senior official said
Thursday.
	   The refusal by President B.J. Habibie to reopen the case comes
despite new claims that his current information minister, Lt. Gen.
Mohammad Yunus Yosfiah, had been involved in the slayings while
serving as a young army officer.
	   Yunus has strongly denied the allegations.
	   Media reports earlier this month suggested that Habibie was
considering whether to look into the matter again.
	   However, State Secretary Akbar Tanjung, a Cabinet minister and
close Habibie aide, said no new investigation was planned.
	   ``The government considers the case closed and that's final,''
he told reporters at Indonesia's presidential palace. ``We are not
going to going to reopen the case.''
	   Reporter Malcolm Rennie, 28, and cameraman Brian Peters, 29,
both British citizens; Australian reporter Greg Shackleton, 27,
Australian soundman Tony Stewart, 21, and New Zealand cameraman
Gary Cunningham, 27, were killed in an attack on Balibo village on
Oct. 16, 1975.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, that
year and annexed it in 1976. The half-island territory has endured
years of human rights abuse and guerrilla warfare since then.
	   The United Nations is now brokering talks between Indonesia and
Portugal aimed at bringing peace as many East Timorese agitate for
independence from Indonesia.
	   Earlier this month, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
announced his government would reopen an earlier investigation into
the killings.
	   Downer said he would refer new evidence from an alleged witness
to former Australian government lawyer Tom Sherman, who reported in
1996 that there was no deliberate attempt by Indonesian forces to
eliminate the men.
	   A man who claimed to have witnessed the killings told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. television earlier this month that Yunus ordered
Indonesian soldiers to kill the journalists.
	   Contradicting an Indonesian claim that the journalists were cut
down in a cross fire, the witness, Olandino Maia Guterres, said
there had been no gunfire from East Timorese resistance fighters.
	   Guterres said four of the journalists were shot dead and one was
stabbed before their bodies were dressed in military uniforms and
photographed by Indonesian troops, including Yunus.
	   Meanwhile, a former army general was reported Thursday to have
rejected a U.S. court verdict ordering him to pay dlrs 14 million
compensation to the mother of Kamal Bamadhaj, a New Zealander who
was killed in the 1991 massacre in East Timor.
	   Sintong Panjaitan was chief of the Bali-based Udayana military
command that oversees East Timor when Indonesian troops fired on
pro-independence East Timorese demonstrators in Dili.
	   The Indonesia government has said that at least 50 people were
killed and dozens were missing in the incident. Human rights
activists put the deaths at more than 180.
	   Bamadhaj, a Malaysian-New Zealand citizen, was among the dead.
His mother, Helen Todd, sued Panjaitan in the United States when
the former general was studying in Boston, Massachusetts, in the
mid-1990s.
	   The court awarded Mrs. Todd the compensation just before
Panjaitan returned to Jakarta.
	   ``The government does not agree with the court's decision,''
Panjaitan was quoted Thursday as saying by The Jakarta Post.
	   Panjaitan, is now the secretary of development operations at the
State Secretariat, a post that places him directly under President
B.J. Habibie.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov flew Thursday to
the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia where he was expected to
meet with the leaders of several restive regions, possibly
including the Chechen president.
	   Primakov arrived in Vladikavkaz, capital of North Ossetia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   ITAR-Tass said he planned to meet the presidents of North
Ossetia and Ingushetia to discuss a permanent settlement to 1992
fighting between ethnic Ingush and Ossetians.
	   The Interfax news agency said Primakov would also meet with
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who wants Russia to help repair
damage caused during their 1994-96 war.
	   Maskhadov's press secretary, Mairbek Vachagayev, said they will
also discuss hostage-takings and other crimes, which have been
rampant in Chechnya since the end of the war.
	   Chechen law enforcement officials are in the midst of a
crackdown on hostage-takings. More than 100 people, including five
foreigners, are believed to be held.
	   The violence associated with hostage-takings and other crimes
has often spilled over Chechnya's borders into neighboring regions.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war, but no country has recognized its independence claim. Moscow
insists the territory remains part of Russia.

Chinese highway workers unearth 50-year-old bombs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Workers building an expressway in central
China have found a cache of 1940s-era artillery shells and mortar
bombs left by the losing side in the Chinese civil war, an official
newspaper says.
	   Police in Chongqing have recovered 54 artillery shells and 82
mortar bombs from a hole dug for the roadway foundation and believe
there are more, the Chongqing Evening News reported in its Oct. 23
edition, seen in Shanghai Thursday.
	   A 92-year-old resident of the area said the site had been used
in the late 1940s as an arsenal by Chinese Nationalist forces, the
newspaper reported.
	   The Nationalists were defeated by the Communists in 1949 and
fled to the island of Taiwan.
	   A photograph in the newspaper showed Chongqing police handling
two of the one-foot-long (25-centimeter-long) shells.

Singapore charities hit by falling donations amid economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Donations to charity organizations in Singapore
have plummeted as corporate sponsors reel from the economic
downturn, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Some charities have collected less than half what they received
last year, said The Straits Times, which reported that most of
Singapore's 12 main organizations were struggling with major
reductions in donations.
	   The Singapore government strongly opposes state-run welfare
systems, relying instead on private intervention and limited state
subsidies for the poor. Unemployment benefits do not exist.
	   Manpower Minister Lee Boon Yang said Thursday that unemployment
rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.5 percent in September,
nearly double the 2.3 percent in June.
	   Corporate donations to the local branch of the Salvation Army
have plunged to less than 1 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
617,000), compared with about 1.7 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
1.1 million) for the same period last year, said the report.
	   ``Companies have become more prudent and are tightening their
belts,'' National Council of Social Services chief executive
officer Benedict Cheong was quoted as saying. ``Many have no or
less money for philanthropic causes.''

PAL marks resumption of international flights with festival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines resumes
international flights after more than a month Thursday with a party
for passengers leaving on a flight for Los Angeles.
	   Colorful bunting, native Philippine cuisine and music in the
departure area awaited more than 200 passengers flying on PAL
flight PR102, company officials said.
	   ``This feels like a rebirth. We felt so bad before and now we're
happy that we're back,'' said Maria Lourdes Afzelius, PAL manager
for special services.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after a union
representing ground personnel turned down a management-proposed
recovery plan that included a 10-year suspension of collective
bargaining in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown.
	   The airline resumed domestic flights on Oct. 7. On Thursday, it
was beginning thrice-weekly flights between Manila and Los Angeles,
with stopovers in San Francisco. The two U.S. destinations will be
served with separate flights from Manila starting Nov. 11.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, said it plans to gradually expand
its international operations to cash in on an expected influx of
Filipino overseas workers coming home for the Christmas holidays.
	   It plans to resume flights on Dec. 1 to the Saudi Arabian cities
of Dhahran and Riyadh, with service three times a week. Both cities
have large numbers of Filipino construction workers and housemaids.
	   Asian flights will resume Nov. 11, including daily flights to
Tokyo and 14 flights a week to Hong Kong, the airline said. Service
to Singapore, Taipei, Fukuoka and Osaka will begin later in
November.
	   PAL will initially use Airbus A340-300 planes on the U.S.
flights. A PAL official said the airline is wary of using its
larger Boeing 747-400 planes because of fears they could be seized
by creditors in the United States.
	   Two of PAL's four Boeing 747-400 planes were seized earlier by
authorities in Hong Kong and Los Angeles at the request of the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, which financed them. Manila's Securities and
Exchange Commission has since asked the Ex-Im Bank to return the
planes.
	   PAL has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in debt
after being devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by Asia's
continuing financial crisis, which reduced passenger numbers and
inflated costs.
	   PAL's top officials, led by its chief stockholder and chairman
Lucio Tan, have been talking with two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific Airways and Northwest Airlines of the United States,
over selling a possible 40 percent stake in the airline.

Yeltsin congratulates Primakov on his 69th birthday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent his prime
minister birthday congratulations Thursday, noting that Yevgeny
Primakov has assumed his new duties at a difficult time.
	   Primakov turned 69.
	   Yeltsin noted Primakov will need courage and political will to
battle the latest economic crisis, which erupted in mid-August, a
month before Primakov became prime minister.
	   Primakov is carrying out more and more of the country's top
leadership duties as the 67-year-old Yeltsin battles another round
of illnesses and relinquishes his authority over day-to-day
affairs.

Yemeni tribesmen abduct two Austrians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesmen have kidnapped two Austrian
men and refused to negotiate their release before the kidnappers'
demands are met, a security official said Thursday.
	   The two Austrians were kidnapped on Wednesday in Abyan province,
490 kilometers (303 miles) south of the capital San`a by five armed
members of the al-Bakazim tribe, the official said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The al-Bakazim tribe kidnapped the Austrians to pressure the
government to rescind a court order that condemned three fellow
tribesmen to death after they were convicted of armed robbery and
murder, he said. The Austrians' names were not given.
	   Security officials traveled late Wednesday from Zinjibar, the
capital of Abyan, to al-Mahfad where the men were being held to
negotiate for the Austrians' release but the tribesmen refused to
negotiate, the official said.
	   In August, Yemen's president approved a law that imposes a
possible death penalty for people carrying out kidnappings.
	   Since 1991, tribesmen have kidnapped more than 250 foreigners to
pressure the government to meet demands for better services or
money. So far, government efforts to stop the abductions, including
sending armed guards with tourists, have not fully succeeded.
	   Large swaths of Yemen are ruled by tribesmen armed with
everything from rifles to artillery. But the hostages _ often oil
workers, diplomats or tourists _ are usually treated as guests and
emerge from the ordeal inconvenienced but unhurt.
	   The last kidnapping occurred July 22 when tribesmen abducted two
Belgian tourists. They were released the next day.

Japanese stocks rise after four-day decline, dollar slips
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details,
comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rose on buying by public
funds Thursday after a four-day decline, but worries over upcoming
corporate earnings reports kept trading subdued. The U.S. dollar
slipped against the yen.
	   The dollar bought 116.36 yen, down 1.52 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level overnight of 117.82
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 152.65 points,
or 1.13 percent, closing at 13,668.72. Over the previous four
trading days, the index had fallen a total of 779.49 points,
including Wednesday's 304.61-point fall, or 2.20 percent.
	   ``It looks as if there has been a fresh injection of public
funds into the market,'' said Akira Nakamura, manager at Chuo
Securities.
	   But overall sentiment remained poor due to worries about
corporate earnings and the direction of emerging markets, including
Brazil and Russia.
	   Sony Corp., considered one of Japan's strongest companies,
lowered its group earnings forecast Wednesday for the fiscal year
ending next March. Sony shares ended Thursday's trading at 7,700
yen (dlrs 66.40), down 310 yen (dlrs 2.70) from Wednesday's close.
	   Sony also said its earnings slipped 5.4 percent in the six
months ended Sept. 30, hurt by falling prices for consumer
electronics products.
	   Over the next few weeks, many other Japanese companies will
announce their earnings results for last six months and their
forecasts for the full fiscal year.
	   Trading was light, with about 295 million shares changing hands
on the first section, down from Wednesday's 306 million. Advances
outnumbered declines 556 to 507, with 193 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 8.49 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,037.10. It
had declined 14.37 points, or 1.37 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar moved lower on selling by Japanese
exporters and U.S. hedge funds in thin trading.
	   ``Markets are thin after the chaos of a few weeks ago, but with
heavy selling interest if the dollar gets to 120 yen,'' said
Takashi Nakauchi, foreign exchange manager at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 0.870 points, unchanged from Wednesday's finish. Its
price slipped to 108.25 yen from 108.26 yen.

Train derails in heavy rain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A Paris-Strasbourg train went off the tracks early
Thursday, and officials said heavy rains in eastern France were the
likely source of the accident.
	   No one was injured in the 12:30 a.m. derailment at the exit of a
tunnel in Arzviller in the Moselle region.
	   The engine and the first car of the train flew off the tracks
even though the train had slowed its speed because of conditions,
according to the state-run train authority, the SNCF.
	   Heavy rains left residents of the Moselle town of Sarrebourg
inundated, with some elderly stranded in their homes, according to
France-Info radio. Numerous roads were cut.
	   Travelers on the Paris-Strasbourg train were taken to their
destinations by bus. The line was not expected to be operational
until mid-afternoon, the SNCF said.

Indonesian students, workers stage anti-government protests

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of students protested outside
Parliament and workers rallied for the release of a comrade
Thursday in a second day of anti-government demonstrations.
	   The protest at the legislature came one day after 8,000 students
gathered there in the biggest rally in the capital since violent
unrest forced former President Suharto to quit in May.
	   The students, many of them women wearing Islamic head scarves,
warned they will step up demonstrations ahead of a government
assembly next month that will shape guidelines for 1999 elections.
	   Meanwhile, about 100 workers demonstrated for the release of a
jailed labor activist who was convicted of organizing a strike
while the authoritarian Suharto was in power.
	   Like the students, workers who gathered outside the attorney
general's office demanded an end to the Indonesian military's big
role in politics and said that the armed forces always favored
employers in labor disputes.
	   Their main demand was the release of Dita Indah Sari, who was
convicted last year of organizing a 1996 strike by 20,000 workers
in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city.
	   She was arrested in a nationwide crackdown on opposition
activists and sentenced to six years in prison.
	   ``We want the release of our hero,'' said Gimin, a worker. ``She
was put in jail by the Suharto regime because she defended our
rights and our struggle.''
	   The workers, who came from diamond, electronics and shoe
factories, also demanded that the government lower the prices of
basic commodities. Inflation has soared and millions of people have
lost their jobs as Indonesia endures its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   The students who gathered near the legislature Thursday also
demanded that the government revoke the national philosophy,
Pancasila, which mandates social tolerance. Suharto jailed many
opponents after accusing them of violating the creed.
	   On Wednesday, student activists demanded that Suharto be put on
trial for alleged corruption and that his successor, President B.J.
Habibie, quit over continuing political and economic turmoil.
	   They urged the government to abandon plans to convene the
People's Consultative Assembly, which will cast regulations in
November for elections next year.
	   Student leaders claim the assembly won't push for real change
and is filled with holdovers from the Suharto era.
	   Habibie has taken steps to implement democracy, freeing some
political prisoners and allowing banned magazines to reopen and
political parties to form. Critics, however, say he is not moving
fast enough.
	   Also Thursday, about 30 women protested on Jakarta's main street
against violence against women that they claim has been
state-sponsored.
	   Karlina Laksono, a spokeswoman for the group, said rape had been
used as a method of intimidation against women in areas such as
East Timor and Aceh where separatists have been fighting for
independence from Indonesia.
	   An inquiry now is being held into allegations that mass rapes
were committed during rioting in May.
	   The government has vehemently denied using rape as an instrument
to cow its opponents.

Roche says De Puy sale given final approval
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche said
Thursday the European Commission has given the green light to the
sale of orthopedics maker DePuy Inc. to Johnson and Johnson.
	   The decision, which follows approval by U.S. antitrust
authorities, means Roche can sell its 84 percent stake in DePuy to
Johnson and Johnson, Roche said in a statement.
	   ``The transaction will be closed in a few working days,'' it
added.
	   New Brunswick-based health-care products giant Johnson and
Johnson announced in July it had agreed to acquire DePuy for dlrs
3.5 billion.
	   The sale price of the Roche stake is dlrs 2.9 billion.
	   Roche acquired De Puy as part of its dlrs 11 billion takeover of
Bermuda-based Corange Inc., also the owner of Germany's Boehringer
Mannheim Group.

Matsushita Electric profits down 80 percent in last six months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Battered by sluggish corporate sales and stock
market losses, Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. said Thursday that net profit dropped 79 percent in
the first half of this fiscal year.
	   In announcing the 7.7 billion yen (dlrs 66 million) earnings for
the six months ended Sept. 30, Matsushita blamed weakening demand
by corporate customers for computer products such as display
screens and CD-ROM drives.
	   As a group, Matsushita and its 326 related companies saw net
profit decline 83 percent to 9.5 billion yen (dlrs 81 million).
	   The Osaka-based electronics maker also said it took a 45.5
billion yen (dlrs 390 million) loss on its massive equity portfolio
because of the slumping Tokyo stock market.
	   Matsushita, known overseas for its ``Panasonic'' and
``Technics'' brands, said sales in the first half slipped 4 percent
from the same period last year to 2.3 trillion yen (dlrs 20
billion).
	   Group sales were down only slightly to 3.9 trillion yen (dlrs
33.4 billion).
	   Matsushita's shares closed down half a percent ahead of the
earnings announcement on expectations the company would follow Sony
Corp., which reported disappointing results the previous day.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Skip Away faces Silver Charm in a long-awaited
showdown while trying to win the Breeders' Cup Classic for the
second straight year and also become the first horse to earn dlrs
10 million.
	   Favorite Trick, the 1997 Horse of the Year, will try to win the
Mile on the grass in only his second start on the surface and
become the first to win two different Breeders' Cup races. Last
year, he won the Juvenile.
	   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas will send out five stakes winners to try
for his sixth victory in the Juvenile.
	   The 15th Breeders' Cup on Nov. 7 at Churchill Downs promises to
be some show.
	   The main event, of course, is the long-anticipated showdown
between Skip Away and Silver Charm, but the Classic is anything but
a two-horse race.
	   There is talk it will be ``the best field ever put in the
starting gate,'' D.G. Van Clief, president of Breeders' Cup
Limited, said Wednesday on a conference call after it was announced
that a total of 117 horses were pre-entered for the seven races.
Official entries will be taken next Wednesday.
	   Skip Away will be seeking his eighth win, sixth in a Grade I
stakes, in his ninth start this year. Silver Charm, winner of the
dlrs 4 million Dubai World Cup, will be trying to win for the sixth
time in eight 1998 starts.
	   Skip Away would be the first two-time Classic winner. A
third-place finish would be worth at least dlrs 480,000 and make
him the first horse to earn dlrs 10 million. The record holder is
Cigar, with dlrs 9,999,815.
	   The Daily Racing Form has made Skip Away the early 2-1 favorite,
with Silver Charm at 5-2. Listed at 4-1 is the entry of Awesome
Again, unbeaten in five starts this year, who beat Silver Charm in
the Stephen Foster June 13 at Churchill Downs; 3-year-old
Coronado's Quest Downs, winner of the Haskell Invitational and
Travers; and Touch Gold, 1997 Belmont Stakes winner. They will be
coupled because of common ownership.
	   Also among the 11 pre-entries Victory Gallop, the 1998 Belmont
Stakes winner, and Britain-based Swain, second in the Dubai World
Cup. With 11 starters the 1 1/4-mile Classic would be the richest
race in history.
	   Silver Charm was not nominated so his owners, Bob and Beverly
Lewis, must pay a fee of dlrs 480,000, 12 percent of the dlrs 4
million purse. Neither Gentlemen nor his sire were nominated so
owner R.D. Hubbard has to ante up dlrs 800,000, 20 percent of the
purse, to start the 6-year-old horse. Of Silver Charm's fee dlrs
400,000 would be added to the purse while dlrs 720,000 of
Gentlemen's fee would be added. That would make the purse dlrs 5.2
million.
	   Gentlemen, however, also was pre-entered in the Mile on the
grass, and that race is listed as the first preference for him. The
supplemental fee for the dlrs 1 million mile would be dlrs 200,000.
	   Each race is limited to 14 starters determined on a point
system. Those on the preferred listed were rated by a committee.
For instance, if one of the 14 horses is not officially entered or
is scratched, No. 15 on the preferred list moves into the field.
	   The Juvenile Fillies and the Distaff also drew less than 14
starters.
	   Excellent Meeting, a stakes winner in California in her last two
starts, is the 5-2 choice in a 12-horse field for the dlrs 1
million Juvenile fillies. Next at 3-1 is Silverbulletday, winner of
the Alcibiades at Keeneland on Oct. 1. Both are trained by Bob
Baffert, trainer of Silver Charm.
	   Sharp Cat, winner of five straight stakes, is the even-money
choice in a field of nine fillies and mares for the dlrs 2 million
Distaff.
	   There were 21 pre-entries in the dlrs 1 million Juvenile. Lukas'
five, all in the top 14, They would run as two entries, each listed
at 2-1. A three-horse entry is Cat Thief, Mountain Range and
Tactical Cat. A two-horse entry is Yet It's True and Time Bandit.
	   The dlrs 2 million Turf drew 19 horses; the dlrs 1 million Mile
drew 26, and 25 were pre-entered in the dlrs 1 million Sprint.

Former soldier found after living in jungle 19 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Police said Thursday they have found a
former South Vietnamese soldier in the jungle, where he said he has
been living since escaping from a re-education camp 19 years ago.
	   Nguyen Hoang Chinh, a police officer in the central province of
Quang Ngai, said Pham Van En was found last Friday in the Go Lau
jungle while police were cracking down on illegal loggers.
	   En, 60, of the H're ethnic minority, told police that he and
three other inmates escaped from the re-education camp in 1979. He
got lost in the jungle and has been living there ever since, Chinh
said.
	   En, who was described as being in good shape, told police he
survived by eating tree leaves and hunting.
	   Many soldiers who fought for the U.S.-backed government in
Saigon were sent to re-education camps after the country was
reunited in 1975.

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A judge rejected a challenge from
the ruling African National Congress party on Thursday and allowed
the release of a watershed report by the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission on South Africa's racist past.
	   Shortly after the ruling, the panel released the 3,500-page
report to journalists ahead of its formal handover later Thursday
by Desmond Tutu, a former Anglican archbishop and the commission
chairman, to President Nelson Mandela.
	   ``That's fantastic,'' said Alex Boraine, the deputy chairman of
the panel, when the ruling was announced. ``That's a victory for
truth and human rights in this country.''
	   Judge Wilfred Thring in Cape Town earlier ordered the panel to
withhold the report from journalists while he held a hearing on the
ANC's application to block the report. The ANC had objected to a
finding that it had committed ``gross human rights violations'' in
its decades-long struggle against white rule.
	   At about 10 a.m. (0800 GMT), after two and a half hours of
argument, Thring ruled in favor of the commission and rejected the
ANC's 11th-hour bid to block the report.
	   Thring told a packed court room that time constraints forced a
delay in giving reasons for his ruling. He ordered the ANC to pay
court costs.
	   The ANC's legal maneuvering outraged Tutu, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1984 for his anti-apartheid struggle. Speaking
outside a convention center where the solemn handover ceremony was
to be held later Thursday, he compared the ANC to the white rulers
of apartheid.
	   ``I have struggled against a tyranny. I didn't do that in order
to substitute it with another,'' he told journalists. ``If there is
a tyranny, an abusive power ... I will oppose it with every fiber
of my being.''
	   Tutu said he was ``devastated'' by the ANC action and commission
officials said the legal wrangle detracted from the panel's role in
helping tell the truth about victims of atrocities.
	   ``This is not about us,'' said commissioner Yasmin Sooka ``It is
about the people who have died, the people who disappeared, the
people who will never be known about.''
	   The Truth Commission came under attack from both sides of
apartheid-era rule Wednesday. In addition to the ANC move,
apartheid's last president, F.W. de Klerk, filed a lawsuit forcing
the panel to excise a finding that he was an ``accessory after the
fact'' to state-sponsored bombings.
	   The attacks on the report _ the product of two years of
testimony by thousands of witnesses _ showed just how difficult
reconciliation was in this country four years after the fall of
apartheid.
	   Created with the ANC's blessing, the panel was charged with
promoting reconciliation by laying bare apartheid-era atrocities.
It has held hearings around the country for more than two years,
listening to both victims and perpetrators.
	   It has the power to grant amnesty as well as recommend
prosecution.
	   From the beginning, the panel angered many whites, who saw it as
an instrument to punish them, as well as many blacks, who feared it
would allow apartheid's perpetrators to escape.
	   The ANC had expressed outrage that the commission would find it
guilty of ``gross violations of human rights.'' To condemn it would
``criminalize the whole liberation struggle,'' said Thenjiwe
Mtintso, the party's deputy secretary-general.
	   She said the commission sent a letter Wednesday rejecting the
ANC's appeal for last-minute revisions.
	   According to submissions to the court on Thursday, the
commission has found the ANC guilty of torture and ``blurring the
lines'' between military and civilian targets. Mines planted by the
ANC rural areas killed innocent people, including farm laborers and
their families.
	   De Klerk, who shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela for
bringing an end to the racist system, sued in Cape Town to stop the
report's release.
	   He challenged its finding that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation, which housed anti-apartheid
organizations.
	   The finding could have opened him up to prosecution because de
Klerk did not seek amnesty.
	   The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk
did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know about the
roles of former law and order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Johan van
der Merwe, a former police commissioner, but failed to tell police.
	   De Klerk contends that when he learned about the bombings, the
two were already applying for amnesty, and he did not think it was
necessary to report the matter.
	   Tutu said the commission would delete de Klerk's name while it
prepares a defense. That apparently was enough for de Klerk's
lawyers to agree to a postponement of the case, which was then
scheduled for a hearing March 4.
	   ``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu
later told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually
appear.''

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's president laid a wreath at
founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's ornate mausoleum on Thursday as the
country prepared for a night of balls, banquets and fireworks to
celebrate its 75th anniversary as a secular republic.
	   Hundreds of flag-waving youths and military officers stood to a
standstill chanting the Turkish national anthem as Suleyman Demirel
laid the wreath.
	   ``I was so excited because I was coming here that I was not able
to sleep,'' said Fadime Aktug as she witnessed the opening of the
day-long celebrations.
	   Two elderly men, bearing war medals awarded to their fathers who
fought for Turkey's independence after World War I, saluted
journalists and passer-bys at the mausoleum. A blimp, floated over
the capital, its sign declaring: ``Ataturk, we are following in
your footsteps.''

	   Veterans groups from the United States, France, Germany,
Britain, Japan and Vietnam turned out Thursday to dedicate the
Vietnam Friendship Village, which is testimony that old enemies can
work together.
	   The result of a decade of corporate donations, bake sales and
other grassroots fund-raising that brought in more than dlrs 1
million, the cluster of eight buildings 11 kilometers (seven miles)
north of Hanoi will be home to young and old who still suffer a
quarter-century after the Vietnam War ended.
	   ``This is about the possibility of average people making a
difference,'' said George Mizo, a Vietnam War veteran who became a
high-profile anti-war activist. ``We cannot change the past, but we
can change the present and the future.''
	   Vietnam Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh, other government
officials, foreign diplomats and veterans gathered at the reclaimed
swampland to dedicate the first phase of the village, which
currently houses 30 children and 20 adults.
	   By spring, the number is expected to total 100, with a goal of
providing housing and support for another 50.
	   No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent
Orange, which was sprayed over wide swaths of jungle by U.S. planes
during a 10-year period to strip away cover from North Vietnamese
troops and their resupply convoys.
	   Estimates range from tens of thousands to 2 million Vietnamese.
In April, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai ordered the first nationwide
survey, to be completed next year.
	   It's virtually impossible to determine which birth defects or
ailments are directly related to Agent Orange. But the Vietnamese
Red Cross says there appear to be common threads, and a research
facility at the village will study the links.
	   Mizo, a Boston native who now lives in Stuttgart, Germany, was a
sergeant in an artillery unit when he was injured in a rocket
attack in January 1968 in the buildup to the Tet offensive.
	   Redeployed back home, he spoke out against the war and was in
and out of military jails for two years. In the mid-1980s, he was
among a group of four veterans who staged a hunger strike on the
steps of the U.S. Capitol in solidarity with Nicaragua.
	   Shortly after his son Michael's birth in 1988, Mizo became
involved in a project by American veterans to build a pagoda in
Vietnam. It developed instead into the Friendship Village.
	   On Thursday, his son handed out drawings done by his fellow
students in Stuttgart to the Friendship Village children.
	   ``This represents healing and reconstruction,'' the elder Mizo
said moments earlier. ``Those who have experienced the horrors of
war know how precious life is.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government tanks rolled along a
Kosovo highway toward this provincial capital Thursday, while U.S.
and European envoys urged ethnic Albanian rebels not to take over
checkpoints vacated by police and to begin talks as soon as
possible.
	   At least 21 tanks and six other vehicles were seen heading
toward a military base in Pristina, apparently part of the on-going
redeployment of government forces demanded by NATO and the U.N.
Security Council.
	   An agreement reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
required Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to remove or
redeploy forces in Kosovo, which were increased dramatically after
he launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists Feb. 28.
	   As the drawn down continues, rebels of the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army have been milling around positions vacated by Serb
police and Yugoslav troops. Scores of uniformed KLA guerrillas
marched in formation at Wednesday's funeral at Dragobilje, some 40
kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   That was unthinkable three days earlier, when Serb police manned
a checkpoint on the road to Dragobilje and shooting between the
sides erupted nightly.
	   With the fighting over, diplomatic efforts are now focusing on
efforts to bring Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians to the
conference table to negotiate the longterm future of the province,
part of Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia.
	   Special U.S. mediator Christopher Hill, who has been
spearheading efforts toward peace talks, urged the rebels Wednesday
not to increase tensions by taking over former Serb checkpoints and
bunkers.
	   Hill told reporters that the Americans and Europeans are
insisting that the KLA not try to exploit the situation created by
the departure of virtually all the special police and troops sent
to Kosovo after Milosevic launched his crackdown on the rebels Feb.
28.
	   Reinforcing that demand, the special European Community envoy
for Kosovo, Wolfgang Petritsch, urged the Kosovo Albanians to begin
a ``constructive dialogue'' with Milosevic on self-rule for the
majority Albanian province, which is part of Yugoslavia's main
republic Serbia.
	   Petritsch said it was of ``particular importance'' for the
Kosovo Albanians to take advantage of this ``historical moment'' to
resolve the crisis.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people. Most want independence. The Americans and Europeans,
however, do not support independence, fearing it would lead to
similar demands by ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in the
southern Balkans.
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, NATO has announced plans to
begin spy flights over Kosovo this weekend to make sure Milosevic
is sticking by the agreement.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also
hopes that most of the 2,000 people which it will send to the
province to verify the agreement will be in Kosovo in the next few
weeks.
	   That should enable most of the thousands of refugees still
camped in the hills to return home and avoid the humanitarian
disaster which had been widely predicted before the
Milosevic-Holbrooke deal.
	   Also Wednesday, a senior U.S. humanitarian aid official said he
believed international actions had prevented thousands of refugees
from dying this winter because the agreement enabled organizations
to rush in clothing, food and other supplies.
	   Already, international organization are rushing more aid to the
refugees now that fighting has stopped.
	   ``The humanitarian disaster we all feared has been averted,''
Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, said in Pristina. ``I think we will see
no deaths due to isolation or lack of food.''
	   A U.N. refugee agency spokesman said people were returning home
in many areas, and he expected the numbers to increase.
	   ``People can't wait to return because it is getting very cold,''
said the spokesman, Fernando del Mundo.

Taiwan seeks resumption of talks with China after another
</HEADLINE>
hijacking &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The unusual case of a Chinese airline
captain who hijacked his own flight to Taiwan had officials on both
sides grappling Thursday with the touchy question of how they
should deal with such cross-border crimes.
	   Taiwanese leaders called for a fresh dialogue, while China
demanded the return of renegade Air China pilot Yuan Bin, saying
that would help to deter future hijackings and keep the skies safer
for travelers.
	   Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of Taiwan's government Mainland
Affairs Council, said Wednesday's sensational diversion of Air
China flight CA905 highlights an urgent need to restart talks
between the rival sides on safety concerns.
	   ``We should resume the talks and sign an agreement as soon as
possible,'' Sheu told a news conference.
	   But China was calling for swift action and not words, saying the
Taiwanese should return Yuan to China, where Wednesday's hijacking
took place.
	   ``There have been precedents for the mutual repatriation of
hijackers, which is feasible,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang told reporters in Beijing. ``The Taiwan authorities should
act accordingly and repatriate Yuan Bin and other hijackers from
the mainland at an early date so as to safeguard the safety of air
passengers.''
	   Yuan's flight from Beijing to the southwestern Chinese city of
Kunming ended up instead at Taipei's international airport after
the disgruntled captain changed course to protest pay and working
conditions at the state-owned carrier.
	   Yuan, 30, was accompanied by his wife, Xu Mei, 27. Both have
been taken into custody by Taiwanese authorities, who have not yet
said what charges might be filed.
	   Air China executives in Beijing refused Thursday to comment on
the hijacking or on Yuan's complaints. The incident garnered only a
small mention in Beijing's official People's Daily.
	   Taiwanese newspapers said Yuan complained that the airline did
not provide pilots with necessary safety training and that the
company had failed to allocate him a large house, but instead gave
houses to people with better connections.
	   Yuan's frustrations are common in the airline, despite attempts
at reform, said Angelica Cheung, a prominent aviation journalist
from Hong Kong.
	   Pilots' salaries hover around U.S. dlrs 1,000 per month, high
pay by Chinese standards but a pittance compared to what foreign
pilots can earn, she said.
	   And as at most Chinese state enterprises, management at Air
China can be distant and rigid, with pilots locked into employment
contracts that prevent them from transferring to jobs at
better-paying startup airlines, Cheung said.
	   While Yuan's job protest made for an unusual type of hijacking _
some reports have even raised questions about whether a captain of
a jet can be charged with hijacking if no force was used _ it also
resurrected an issue that has been a sore point between Taiwan and
China.
	   Taiwan used to greet hijackers from China almost as heroes,
before cracking down after tense Taiwan-China relations began
thawing in the 1980s.
	   During a string of air piracies in 1993 and 1994, Taiwan
arrested 16 Chinese hijackers and sentenced them to prison for up
to 12 years.
	   Two were paroled and sent back to China last year. But China
refused to tell Taiwan about their fate in the mainland, and Taiwan
then declined to repatriate six others who have since been paroled.
	   Taiwan and China were close to signing an agreement on
repatriating the hijackers in 1995 when China broke off the talks
in anger over a Taiwanese drive to gain international recognition.
	   Taiwan had agreed to send back all hijackers except those who
could face political prosecution in China, and China had agreed not
to retry the hijackers.

Paris Club of creditors agrees to reduce Bosnia's debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Signing the agreement with
the Paris Club creditors, Bosnia saved more than dlrs one billion,
reduced the remaining debts and spread the repayment over more then
30 years.
	   The agreement was signed late Wednesday in Paris and welcomed by
Bosnia's domestic and international institution. The top
international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, considers this
agreement ``an outstanding achievement,'' a press release from his
office in Sarajevo said.
	   The agreement is reducing and rescheduling Bosnia's debts to the
Paris club. Some of the creditors wrote off the entire debt and
others 67 percent of it, allowing an payment period extension to 23
and grace of six years, the Bosnian news agency ONASA said.
	   The agreement takes into account Bosnia's specific difficulties
and efforts of the country's government and the international
institutions to create a sound economic environment, Westendorp's
statement said.

Hamas claims responsibility for car bomb explosion in Gaza

<TEXT>
	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A Palestinian suicide
bomber on Thursday drove an explosives-laden car into an Israeli
army jeep escorting a bus with 40 elementary school students,
killing himself and an Israeli soldier.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack that also injured three Israelis. ``It's a revolution until
death,'' said a caller to Israeli radio who read a statement he
said was issued by Hamas.
	   The armored school bus was damaged, but the children were not
hurt in the powerful blast. After the attack, the children were
taken to their school in Gush Katif bloc of Jewish settlements
rather than being returned home to nearby Kfar Darom settlement.
	   In school, the children talked to teachers and counselors about
their experience. The children, ranging in age from about six to
14, talked of the big boom and flames and many asked about their
friends on a second school bus, school officials said.
	   Israel said the attack would not hold up implementation of the
land-for-security agreement signed last week in Washington, but
demanded that the Palestinian Authority do more to fight terrorism.
	   In a first response, the army sealed the Gaza Strip.
	   Witnesses said the blast went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 gmt)
at the Gush Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time,
the Israeli convoy was passing by.
	   Palestinian Jaber Yamawi said he was waiting at a bus stop when
he heard the explosion. ``I saw one Israeli jeep blow up and burn
completely,'' said Yamawi. ``I saw them take out two soldiers in
ambulances and after that there was gunfire.''
	   Abdel Razek Majaida, a senior Palestinian police official, said
the driver of the booby-trapped car had waited until the school bus
arrived, then detonated the explosives in the vehicle.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler who prepares bodies for
burials, said the jeep was still burning an hour later. ``Parts (of
bodies) are scattered all over. There is oil, gas, blood. Things we
see too often lately,'' Kirshenzach told Israel radio.
	   Paramedics said three Israelis were wounded in the blast and
taken to hospitals.
	   Maj. Gen. Yom Tov Samia, the commander of Israeli troops in the
Gaza Strip, said the jeep leading the convoy bore the brunt of the
explosion and that one of the soldiers in the vehicle was killed.
	   Samia also said the identity of the suicide bomber was known and
that he was a resident of the nearby Palestinian town of Khan
Yunis.
	   There were initial reports by Palestinian witnesses that Israeli
soldiers or settlers opened fire randomly after the exlosion,
wounding three Palestinians, but the reports could not be
confirmed.
	   Amin al Hindi, a senior Palestinian security official, said his
forces were cooperating with the Israelis and that the Palestinian
Authority would respond harshly.
	   ``This incident is aimed at destroying the peace process and we
will take measures,'' al Hindi said.
	   Implementation of the new peace agreement is to begin Monday,
and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said there would not be delay. Under the accord, Israel
is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks in
exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   However, Bar-Illan said Israel would be watching the Palestinian
Authority's response to the bombing closely. He also held Yasser
Arafat's government indirectly responsible for the attack.
	   ``We blame them for lionizing and glorifying terrorists on the
one hand while giving lip service to fighting terrorism,'' he said.

Japanese business group leader sees possible recovery next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of Japan's most influential business lobby
said Thursday that the world's second-largest economy might start
pulling out of its prolonged slump late next year.
	   Takashi Imai, chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic
Organizations, or Keidanren, said speedy implementation of recently
proposed economic stimulus measures ``could put the economy on
track for 2 percent growth by late next year.''
	   Speaking at the Japan Press Club, Imai welcomed government moves
toward increasing public works spending and enacting deeper tax
cuts to jump start the recession-bound Japanese economy.
	   Imai, who also serves as chairman of top-ranked steelmaker
Nippon Steel Corp., urged banks to tap into public funds that the
government recently earmarked as part of a financial stabilization
program.
	   He expressed concern about a credit crunch affecting many
Japanese companies as cash-strapped banks have tightened loan
extension requirements.
	   Imai noted the Bank of Japan's efforts to increase liquidity in
the banking system have had little impact so far.

62 Vietnamese fishermen dead in natural disasters this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Bad weather has killed 62 Vietnamese
fishermen so far this year, local press reported Thursday.
	   Twelve others remain missing as the result of storms, floods and
waterspouts that sank about 100 fishing boats, the newspaper Youth
quoted the Ministry of Fisheries as saying.
	   In a letter Monday, Fisheries Minister Ta Quang Ngoc urged local
governments to give more help to rescue operations and said
fishermen should equip themselves better.
	   The death toll is still far lower than last year, when Typhoon
Linda swept across the Mekong Delta, killing nearly 400 people and
leaving more than 3,000 others missing.

Truth panel finds ANC guilty of human rights abuses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: WITH BC-South Africa-Truth Commission &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A panel probing apartheid era
crimes has found the African National Congress committed human
rights abuses including torture and killing innocent civilians.
	   Documents presented Thursday during an early morning court
hearing showed that the ANC killed innocent farmworkers with
landmines and killed informers during its decades-long struggle
against white minority rule.
	   The ANC, that won 1994's first democratic elections, tried to
block the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's
final report. But Judge Wilfred Thring in Cape Town turned down the
bid and released the report.
	   President Nelson Mandela's party argues that it was fighting a
just war against oppression and that commission officials did not
give the ANC enough time to put forward its defense.
	   The court papers gave details of findings that had been leaked
to South African media earlier this week.
	   Among the main abuses:
	   _ there was ``blurring of the lines'' between military and
civilian targets, causing loss of innocent lives in bomb attacks.
	   _ an ANC landmine campaign on border farms killed innocent
people, including farm laborers and their families.
	   _ informers, defectors and mutineers were killed.
	   _ torture was widely used by ANC security officials in their
military camps abroad. Methods included regular beatings with
sticks, being tied to a log ``like a pig on a spit,'' starvation
and lengthy periods in solitary confinement.
	   Only one name is mentioned in the court papers, that of Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, the former wife of President Nelson Mandela,
whose bodyguards beat and killed suspected opponents in the 1980s.
	   The commission said the ANC had to accept full responsibility
for the actions of the so-called Mandela United Football Club and
had failed to take action against it.
	   ``Madikizela-Mandela at all times regarded herself as being part
of the underground structures of the African National Congress,''
the findings said.
	   Details of abuses against blacks ordered by the National Party
that ruled during apartheid are expected to be reported later
Thursday.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Battered by sluggish corporate sales and stock
market losses, Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. said Thursday that net profit dropped 79 percent in
the first half of this fiscal year.
	   In announcing the 7.7 billion yen (dlrs 66 million) earnings for
the six months ended Sept. 30, Matsushita blamed weakening demand
by corporate customers for computer products such as display
screens and CD-ROM drives.
	   As a group, Matsushita and its 326 related companies saw net
profit decline 83 percent to 9.5 billion yen (dlrs 81 million).
	   The Osaka-based electronics maker also said it took a 45.5
billion yen (dlrs 390 million) loss on its massive equity portfolio
because of the slumping Tokyo stock market.
	   Matsushita, known overseas for its ``Panasonic'' and
``Technics'' brands, said sales in the first half slipped 4 percent
from the same period last year to 2.3 trillion yen (dlrs 20
billion).
	   Group sales were down only slightly to 3.9 trillion yen (dlrs
33.4 billion).
	   Matsushita's shares closed down half a percent ahead of the
earnings announcement on expectations the company would follow Sony
Corp., which reported disappointing results the previous day.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nomura Securities Co., Japan's biggest brokerage,
will close about 20 percent of its retail outlets in Japan as part
of restructuring measures, a leading financial daily said Thursday.
	   Nomura has already said it will cut 2,000 jobs out of its
current 13,000-strong work force by 2001 as part of measures to
cope with the negative impact of financial turbulence abroad and
recession at home.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper said the 20-percent cutback in
Nomura's domestic offices is aimed at easing the burden of real
estate-related expenses.
	   Atsuko Toda, a spokeswoman at Tokyo-based Nomura, said the
company has not yet decided how many outlets it will close. Nomura
currently operates 137 domestic retail outlets.
	   Earlier this month, Nomura reported 207.2 billion yen (dlrs 1.76
billion) in loses, mostly from foreign operations, for the first
half of fiscal 1998. At the same time, the brokerage announced
sweeping restructuring steps that will include reducing its work
force and reviewing overseas operations.
	   Other Japanese brokerages have said they would consider
restructuring drives, including major jobs cuts.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines resumed
international flights Thursday after more than a month hiatus when
a plane carrying 200 passengers departed Manila for Los Angeles.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after a union
representing ground personnel turned down a management-proposed
recovery plan that included a 10-year suspension of collective
bargaining in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown.
	   The airline resumed domestic flights on Oct. 7.
	   On Thursday it began thrice-weekly flights between Manila and
Los Angeles, with stopovers in San Francisco.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, said it plans to gradually expand
its international operations to cash in on an expected influx of
Filipino overseas workers coming home for the Christmas holidays.
	   It plans to resume flights on Dec. 1 to the Saudi Arabian cities
of Dhahran and Riyadh, and flights to Tokyo and Hong Kong will
resume Nov. 11, the airline said.
	   PAL will initially use Airbus A340-300 planes on the U.S.
flights. A PAL official said the airline is wary of using its
larger Boeing 747-400 planes because of fears they could be seized
by creditors in the United States.
	   PAL has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in debt
after being devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by Asia's
continuing financial crisis, which reduced passenger numbers and
inflated costs.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi, Thailand's candidate to head the World Trade
Organization, said Wednesday the trade body should continue to
promote liberalization despite the economic crisis gripping parts
of the world.
	   Supachai said liberalization will generate demand and eventually
reverse the current slowdown.
	   Thailand has followed that path, Supachai said, by proposing
that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade
Agreement _ AFTA _ reduce the number of products excluded from the
agreement.
	   It also has proposed moving forward the adoption of the
agreement to 2001, instead of 2003, and making sharp reductions in
AFTA tariffs, he added.
	   Supachai said he expects Thailand's economic downturn to bottom
out by the beginning of 1999.
	   The baht closed Wednesday at a 12-month high of 36.85 against
the dollar. Thai commercial banks' prime lending rates have dropped
to 13.5-13.75 percent, from 15.5 percent in July.
	   A new head for the world trade body will be chosen after the
term of the current director-general, Renato Ruggiero, ends next
April 30.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite winning his first battle against
extradition to Spain, Gen. Augusto Pinochet's hopes of being
whisked home to Chile immediately must wait.
	   The High Court on Wednesday rejected two arrest warrants from a
Spanish magistrate seeking Pinochet's extradition to face charges
of murder, torture and kidnapping of political opponents during his
17-year rule. The court said the former dictator is immune from
criminal prosecution in Britain because the alleged crimes occurred
while he was head of state. Pinochet also won repayment of his
legal costs, estimated to be 350,000 pounds (dlrs 560,000).
	   Lord Chief Justice Thomas Bingham said, however, that Pinochet
must remain in custody pending an appeal by prosecutors to the
House of Lords, Britain's highest court.
	   Prosecutors said they will file an urgent appeal Monday. It is
uncertain how long the ruling will take. Predictions in the British
media ranged from next week to several weeks.
	   Meantime, Pinochet's lawyers asked for his release on bail. A
bail hearing was scheduled for Friday. Magistrates said they would
consider holding the hearing at the private London hospital where
Pinochet is recovering from back surgery Oct. 9.
	   But the general was moved from the London Clinic to another
London hospital on Thursday morning, police said. Scotland Yard
police headquarters confirmed Pinochet had been moved after an
ambulance was seen leaving the London Clinic under police escort.
The name of the hospital where he will be treated was not
immediately available.
	   Pinochet was arrested at the London Clinic by British
authorities Oct. 16 at the request of a Spanish judge who alleges
Pinochet, during his rule from 1973 until 1990, was responsible for
up to 4,000 murders, including at least one in the United States,
and sent agents to Spain to kill opponents.
	   Chilean senator Francisco Prat said Tuesday that the general
would be transferred, probably to a private apartment, because the
hospital complained of the ``situation of crisis'' caused by his
presence.

D SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesmen have kidnapped two Austrian
men and refused to negotiate their release before the kidnappers'
demands are met, a security official said Thursday. &HT;    The two Austrians were kidnapped on Wednesday in Abyan province,
about 280 kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital San`a, by
five armed members of the al-Bakazim tribe, the official said on

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines resumes
international flights after more than a month Thursday with a party
for passengers leaving on a flight for Los Angeles.
	   Colorful bunting, Philippine cuisine and a live native band in
the departure area awaited more than 200 passengers flying on PAL
flight PR102, company officials said.
	   ``This feels like a rebirth. We felt so bad before and now we're
happy that we're back,'' said Maria Lourdes Afzelius, PAL manager
for special services.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after a union
representing ground personnel turned down a management-proposed
recovery plan that included a 10-year suspension of collective
bargaining in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown.
	   The airline resumed domestic flights on Oct. 7. On Thursday, it
was beginning thrice-weekly flights between Manila and Los Angeles,
with stopovers in San Francisco. The two U.S. destinations will be
served with separate flights from Manila starting Nov. 11.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, said it plans to gradually expand
its international operations to cash in on an expected influx of
Filipino overseas workers coming home for the Christmas holidays.
	   It plans to resume flights on Dec. 1 to the Saudi Arabian cities
of Dhahran and Riyadh, with service three times a week. Both cities
have large numbers of Filipino construction workers and housemaids.
	   Asian flights will resume Nov. 11, including daily flights to
Tokyo and 14 flights a week to Hong Kong, the airline said. Service
to Singapore, Taipei, Fukuoka and Osaka will begin later in
November.
	   PAL initially planned to use Airbus A340-300 planes on the U.S.
flights but said Thursday it decided to use a bigger Boeing 747-400
for the flight to Los Angeles because of an unexpected surge in
demand for seats.
	   Two of PAL's four Boeing 747-400 planes were seized earlier by
authorities in Hong Kong and Los Angeles at the request of the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, which financed them. Manila's Securities and
Exchange Commission has since asked the Ex-Im Bank to return the
planes.
	   The seizures have made PAL officials wary of deploying the
remaining 747-400s on foreign routes.
	   PAL said a federal court in San Francisco has ordered the Ex-Im
Bank to return the planes.
	   The airline has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion
in debt after being devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by
Asia's continuing financial crisis, which reduced passenger numbers
and inflated costs.
	   PAL's top officials, led by its chief stockholder and chairman
Lucio Tan, have been talking with two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific Airways and Northwest Airlines of the United States,
over selling a possible 40 percent stake in the airline.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Haiti's ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier is in France,
reportedly broke. Ethiopia's Mengistu Haile Mariam, under tighter
security since an assassination attempt, now mostly just stays home
reading and writing.
	   Even before the Oct. 16 arrest in London of former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on a Spanish extradition warrant,
life has been uneasy for some fallen dictators.
	   Pinochet _ at least until he showed up in London last month _
had it made compared with his fellow former rulers wanted for mass
murder, torture and kidnapping. He was in his native land, immune
there from prosecution.
	   For the rest, whether they live in luxury or poverty, it's
mostly been one long battle to fade into foreign obscurity. They
have their bodyguards, their money, their memories and their hopes
that the midnight knock on the door, the assassin's bullet or the
extradition warrant never comes.
	   Along with Duvalier and Mengistu, there's Haiti's Raoul Cedras,
dwelling quietly in a high-rent district of Panama City; Paraguay's
Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, given sanctuary in Brazil since the 1989
coup that ended his 34-year-dictatorship; and Uganda's Gen. Idi
Amin, living with several wives and at least 30 children in
all-expenses-paid luxury in Saudi Arabia.
	   Human rights investigators say some 300,000 people were killed
during Amin's eight years of blood-soaked rule after he seized
power in a 1971 coup in the East African nation.

China reports five killed by Babs

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Tropical storm Babs killed five people in
southeastern China and caused an estimated 480 million yuan (dlrs
58 million) in damage, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
Thursday.
	   It was the first official word of Chinese deaths in Babs, which
killed at least 192 people in the Philippines while it was at
typhoon strength. The storm weakened to a tropical storm before
moving Sunday into southeastern China, where it pounded coastal
areas with torrential rains. It moved back out to sea Tuesday.
	   Xinhua did not give any details of the deaths in the
southeastern province of Fujian, but said damage included 1,461
collapsed houses and greenhouses, 114 boats destroyed and 12 ships
sunk.
	   Damage was most serious in the cities of Zhangzhou and Longyan,
Xinhua said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government tanks rolled along a
Kosovo highway toward this provincial capital Thursday, while U.S.
and European envoys urged ethnic Albanian rebels not to take over
checkpoints vacated by police and to begin talks as soon as
possible.
	   At least 21 tanks and six other vehicles were seen heading
toward a military base in Pristina, apparently part of the on-going
redeployment of government forces demanded by NATO and the U.N.
Security Council.
	   An agreement reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
required Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to remove or
redeploy forces in Kosovo, which were increased dramatically after
he launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists Feb. 28.
	   As the draw-down continues, rebels of the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army have been milling around positions vacated by Serb
police and Yugoslav troops. Scores of uniformed KLA guerrillas
marched in formation at a funeral Wednesday for a KLA fighter at
Dragobilje, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   That was unthinkable three days earlier, when Serb police manned
a checkpoint on the road to Dragobilje and shooting between the
sides erupted nightly.
	   With the fighting over, diplomatic efforts are now focusing on
efforts to bring Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians to the
conference table to negotiate the longterm future of the province,
part of Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia.
	   Special U.S. mediator Christopher Hill, who has been
spearheading efforts toward peace talks, urged the rebels Wednesday
not to increase tensions by taking over former Serb checkpoints and
bunkers.
	   Hill told reporters that the Americans and Europeans are
insisting that the KLA not try to exploit the situation created by
the departure of virtually all the special police and troops sent
to Kosovo after Milosevic launched his crackdown on the rebels Feb.
28.
	   Reinforcing that demand, the special European Community envoy
for Kosovo, Wolfgang Petritsch, urged the Kosovo Albanians to begin
a ``constructive dialogue'' with Milosevic on self-rule for the
majority Albanian province, which is part of Yugoslavia's main
republic Serbia.
	   Petritsch said it was of ``particular importance'' for the
Kosovo Albanians to take advantage of this ``historical moment'' to
resolve the crisis.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people. Most want independence. The Americans and Europeans,
however, do not support independence, fearing it would lead to
similar demands by ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in the
southern Balkans.
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, NATO has announced plans to
begin spy flights over Kosovo this weekend to make sure Milosevic
is sticking by the agreement.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also
hopes that most of the 2,000 people which it will send to the
province to verify the agreement will be in Kosovo in the next few
weeks.
	   That should enable most of the thousands of refugees still
camped in the hills to return home and avoid the humanitarian

Milosevic-Holbrooke deal.
	   Also Wednesday, a senior U.S. humanitarian aid official said he
believed international actions had prevented thousands of refugees
from dying this winter because the agreement enabled organizations
to rush in clothing, food and other supplies.
	   Already, international organization are rushing more aid to the
refugees now that fighting has stopped.
	   ``The humanitarian disaster we all feared has been averted,''
Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, said in Pristina. ``I think we will see
no deaths due to isolation or lack of food.''
	   A U.N. refugee agency spokesman said people were returning home
in many areas, and he expected the numbers to increase.
	   ``People can't wait to return because it is getting very cold,''
said the spokesman, Fernando del Mundo.

France recruits handicapped to help deter reckless drivers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Speedsters caught in the act will face off
handicapped victims of auto accidents waiting at the roadside with
police this weekend -- a test to see if reality can deter reckless
driving.
	   The weekend, which marks the end of the All Saints Day holiday,
is traditionally a high-risk weekend on French roads, with 26-30
deaths a day, instead of the 20-22 deaths usually counted at this
time of year.
	   The test operation will be limited to three regions around Paris
-- Seine-et-Marne in the east, Yvelines in the west and Essonne in
the south. If successful, it is to be put into effect around
France, according to Isabelle Massin, in charge of road security.
	   ``Young handicapped people won't be there to give lessons,''
Massin was quoted as saying in Thursday's edition of Le Parisien,
``but to serve as witnesses to their own daily lives and say,
`Tomorrow don't become like us.'''
	   The wish, Massin told the daily, is that such dramas will speak
more loudly than the statistics -- 8,000 dead and 30,000 injured on
French highways last year. An additional 300 are expected to be
killed in this particularly murderous year, she added.
	   The handicapped will accompany police who stop cars for speeding
and other infractions like drunken driving. They will then meet
with the drivers along the side of the road.
	   The handicapped involved in the operation belong to the
Association of the Paralyzed of France and the National Union of
Families of Cranial Trauma.
	   ``No one will be forced to take part,'' Massin said of the
handicapped volunteers.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government tanks rolled along a
Kosovo highway toward this provincial capital Thursday, while U.S.
and European envoys urged ethnic Albanian rebels not to take over
checkpoints vacated by police and to begin talks as soon as
possible.
	   At least 21 tanks and six other vehicles were seen heading
toward a military base in Pristina, apparently part of the on-going
redeployment of government forces demanded by NATO and the U.N.
Security Council.
	   An agreement reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
required Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to remove or
redeploy forces in Kosovo, which were increased dramatically after
he launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists on Feb. 28.
	   As the draw down continues, rebels of the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army have been milling around positions vacated by Serb
police and Yugoslav troops. Scores of uniformed KLA guerrillas
marched in formation at Wednesday's funeral of a guerrilla killed
by a Serb land mine in Dragobilje, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southwest of Pristina.
	   That was unthinkable three days earlier, when Serb police manned
a checkpoint on the road to Dragobilje and shooting between the
sides erupted nightly.
	   With the fighting subsided, diplomatic efforts are now focusing
on efforts to bring Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians to the
conference table to negotiate the long-term future of the province.
	   Special U.S. mediator Christopher Hill, who has been
spearheading efforts toward peace talks, urged the rebels Wednesday
not to increase tensions by taking over former Serb checkpoints and
bunkers.
	   Hill told reporters that the Americans and Europeans are
insisting that the KLA not try to exploit the situation created by
the departure of virtually all the special police and troops sent
to Kosovo after Milosevic launched his crackdown.
	   Reinforcing that demand, the special European Community envoy
for Kosovo, Wolfgang Petritsch, urged the Kosovo Albanians to begin
a ``constructive dialogue'' with Milosevic on self-rule for the
majority Albanian province, which is part of Yugoslavia's main
republic Serbia.
	   Petritsch said it was of ``particular importance'' for the
Kosovo Albanians to take advantage of this ``historical moment'' to
resolve the crisis.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people. Most want independence. The Americans and Europeans,
however, do not support independence, fearing it would lead to
similar demands by ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in the
southern Balkans.
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, NATO has announced plans to
begin observation flights over Kosovo this weekend to make sure
Milosevic is sticking by the agreement.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also
hopes that most of the 2,000 people which it will send to the
province to verify the agreement will be in Kosovo in the next few
weeks.
	   That should enable most of the thousands of refugees still
camped in the hills to return home and avoid the humanitarian
disaster which had been widely predicted before the
Milosevic-Holbrooke deal.
	   Also Wednesday, a senior U.S. humanitarian aid official said he
believed international actions had prevented thousands of refugees
from dying this winter because the agreement enabled organizations
to rush in clothing, food and other supplies.
	   Already, international organization are rushing more aid to the
refugees now that fighting has stopped.
	   ``The humanitarian disaster we all feared has been averted,''
Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, said in Pristina. ``I think we will see
no deaths due to isolation or lack of food.''
	   A U.N. refugee agency spokesman said people were returning home
in many areas, and he expected the numbers to increase.
	   ``People can't wait to return because it is getting very cold,''
said the spokesman, Fernando del Mundo.

Indonesian mobs kill four people suspected in mysterious murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs lynched four people, including
one woman who was hanged in front of a police station, as vigilante
attacks spread on Indonesia's main island, newspapers reported
Thursday.
	   The military has been unable to quell the violence on Java
island, in which more than 160 people have been killed since July.
	   Assassins, said to dress in ninja-like black clothing, have
targeted suspected black magic sorcerers, and Muslim clerics have
been among the victims. Mobs have attacked people believed to be
the killers.
	   Gen. Subagyo, the army chief, pledged Thursday to restore order
in the region as soon as possible, the official Antara news agency
reported. Indonesia's largest Muslim group, Nahdhatul Ulama, has
warned it will deploy its own security forces if the military does
not protect its members.
	   The vast majority of killings have been in eastern Java, but
fear and suspicion have spread westward. On Tuesday, mobs assaulted
a woman who did not identify herself in the central Java town of
Sarang, the newspaper Suara Karya reported.
	   The assailants stripped the woman, then beat and dragged her
before hanging her in front of the police station. Officers did not
intervene because the mob threatened to set the station on fire,
the newspaper reported.
	   In a similar killing Monday night, a crowd tortured and stabbed
to death a man in the central Java village of Tanjung Emas, 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta. The mob, which suspected
him of murder, seized him from Muslim clerics who were protecting
him.
	   In Pati, another central Java town, vigilantes with sticks and
bricks killed two vegetable vendors Wednesday, the newspaper Media
Indonesia reported.
	   Suspicion had fallen on the men because they were wearing black
clothing, which the murderers are said to wear.

<TEXT>
	   The proposed 1,730-kilometer (1,075-mile) pipeline stretches
between the Azeri capital of Baku and Turkey's Mediterreanan port
of Ceyhan.
	   Caspian oil reserves provide one of the world's richest oil
resources. There has been a great battle to get the oil flow
through Turkey against plans by international companies to use more
routes that would carry the oil through the narrow Turkish Straits.
	   The declaration has been a triumph for Turkey, which got all the
countries involved in the project _ apart from Russia _ to declare
their support for Baku-Ceyhan.
	   The declaration was signed by the presidents of Turkey,
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakistan and Uzbekistan. The Turkmen
President refused to sign the declaration but gave no reason.
	   In the declaration, the presidents strongly confirmed their
determination ``in realizing the Caspian-Mediterranean
(Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) project as the main export pipeline.''
	   They also instructed ``their related authorities regarding the
creation of all necessary conditions for the realization of the
east-west energy corridor and within this the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline.''

<TEXT>
	   Turkey has been lobbying energy companies to choose the Caspian
route. The companies are expected to announce their decision Nov.
12.
	   The main alternative is an existing pipeline from Baku to the
Georgian Black Sea of Supsa. Oil companies reportedly have been
favoring that route, showing reluctance to invest in the estimated
dlrs 2.5 billion cost of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.
	   Turkey's main argument against other routes is the heavy oil
tanker traffic through the Bosporus strait, which has led to
hundreds of accidents.
	   ``This is the most environmentally sound, economically rational
project for the export of Caspian oil,'' said Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel.

Swazi police say bridge explosion possible attack on King Mswati
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ An explosion badly damaged a bridge
two hours after King Mswati III crossed it, police said Thursday.
	   Wednesday's explosion on the Lusushwana River bridge near
Manzini could have been caused by a bomb or dynamite, police said.
	   Mswati was returning from a month-long investment tour in the
Far East.
	   Police said they were investigating a possible connection to
political activists who protested a 25-year-old ban on political
parties in recent elections.
	   Only one person was injured in the incident on the seldom-used
bridge.

Hamas claims responsibility for car bomb explosion in Gaza
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement by Israeli commander, children taken to
school, one of the dead an Israeli soldier. &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A Palestinian suicide
bomber on Thursday drove an explosives-laden car into an Israeli
army jeep escorting a bus with 40 elementary school students,
killing himself and an Israeli soldier.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack that also wounded three Israelis.
	   ``It's a revolution until death,'' said a caller to Israeli
radio who read a statement he said was issued by Hamas, which
opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
	   Israel said the attack would not hold up implementation of the
land-for-security agreement signed last week in Washington, but
demanded that the Palestinian Authority do more to fight terrorism.
	   In a first response, the Israeli army sealed the Gaza Strip,
barring Palestinians from leaving or entering.
	   The armored school bus was damaged, but none of the children was
hurt in the powerful blast. After the attack, the children were
taken to their school in the Gush Katif bloc of Jewish settlements
rather than being returned home to the nearby Kfar Darom
settlement.
	   In school, the children talked to teachers and counselors about
their experience. The children, ranging in age from about six to
14, talked of the big boom and flames and many asked about their
friends on a second school bus, school officials said.
	   Witnesses said the blast went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT)
at the Gush Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time,
the Israeli convoy was passing by.
	   Palestinian Jaber Yamawi said he was waiting at a bus stop when
he heard the explosion. ``I saw one Israeli jeep blow up and burn
completely,'' said Yamawi. ``I saw them take out two soldiers in
ambulances and after that there was gunfire.''
	   Abdel Razek Majaida, a senior Palestinian police official, said
the driver of the booby-trapped car had waited until the school bus
arrived, then detonated the explosives in the vehicle.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler who prepares bodies for
burials, said the jeep was still burning an hour later. ``Parts (of
bodies) are scattered all over. There is oil, gas, blood. Things we
see too often lately,'' Kirshenzach told Israel radio.
	   Paramedics said three Israelis were wounded in the blast and
taken to hospitals.
	   Maj. Gen. Yom Tov Samia, the commander of Israeli troops in the
Gaza Strip, said the jeep leading the convoy bore the brunt of the
explosion and that one of the soldiers in the vehicle was killed.
	   Samia also said the identity of the suicide bomber was known and
that he was a resident of the nearby Palestinian town of Khan
Yunis.
	   There were initial reports by Palestinian witnesses that Israeli
soldiers or settlers opened fire randomly after the explosion,
wounding three Palestinians, but the reports could not be
confirmed.
	   Amin al Hindi, a senior Palestinian security official, said his
forces were cooperating with the Israelis and that the Palestinian
Authority would respond harshly.
	   ``This incident is aimed at destroying the peace process and we
will take measures,'' al Hindi said.
	   Implementation of the new peace agreement is to begin Monday,
and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said there would not be any delay. Under the accord,
Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12
weeks in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   However, Bar-Illan said Israel would be watching the Palestinian
Authority's response to the bombing closely. He also held Yasser
Arafat's government indirectly responsible for the attack.
	   ``We blame them for lionizing and glorifying terrorists on the
one hand while giving lip service to fighting terrorism,'' he said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow's mayor says he's tired of people asking
him whether he plans to run for president in 2000.
	   ``I work a lot and usually keep in good shape, but questions
about the presidency make me feel tired,'' Yuri Luzhkov told
reporters.
	   However, Luzhkov then reiterated that he would run if he feels
no other candidate can solve Russia's problems, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Others expected to run in 2000 are Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov, liberal political Grigory Yavlinsky, former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Alexander Lebed, a former general
who is now governor of a vast Siberian region.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov flew Thursday to
the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia where he met with the
leaders of several restive regions, including secessionist
Chechnya.
	   Primakov arrived in Vladikavkaz, capital of North Ossetia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   ITAR-Tass said he met the presidents of North Ossetia and
Ingushetia and discussed a permanent settlement to 1992 fighting
between ethnic Ingush and Ossetians.
	   The Interfax news agency said Primakov also met with Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov, who wants Russia to help repair damage
caused during their 1994-96 war.
	   Maskhadov's press secretary, Mairbek Vachagayev, said they will
also discuss hostage-takings and other crimes, which have been
rampant in Chechnya since the end of the war.
	   Chechen law enforcement officials are in the midst of a
crackdown on hostage-takings. More than 100 people, including five
foreigners, are believed to be held.
	   The violence associated with hostage-takings and other crimes
has often spilled over Chechnya's borders into neighboring regions.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war, but no country has recognized its independence claim. Moscow
insists the territory remains part of Russia.

Report: Singapore firm develops computer to fit car dashboards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore company has developed a
full-fledged computer designed to fit in a car's dashboard, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The computer runs Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system and
includes features normally found in desktop computers, such as a
large capacity disk drive, a modem for e-mail and Internet access,
and CD-ROM and floppy disk drives, The Straits Times reported.
	   Singapore's GPS Technologies originally developed the Searcher1
as a navigation system, but it evolved into what is believed to be
the world's first full-fledged car computer, the paper added.
	   Operated with either a touch-sensitive screen, an infrared
wireless keyboard or by voice commands, the car computer also
supports extra screens placed in the back seat, and may be marketed
to busy executives or outfitted in luxury cars.
	   Developed at a cost of 600,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 370,000),
it will sell for about 5,600 Singapore dollars (dlrs 3,500), plus
800 to 1,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 500 to 620) for each
additional screen, the paper said.
	   Several automakers have expressed interest in fitting the
computer into their luxury cars, the report said, but it did not
identify these manufacturers.
	   The company also is considering selling the computer in
traffic-clogged Southeast Asian cities like Bangkok and Kuala
Lumpur, where drivers or passengers could take advantage of time
lost in gridlock.

Johnson files for free agency, Yankees and Mets talk about Belle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Randy Johnson, perhaps baseball's most explosive
pitcher, is now on the free-agent market. And Albert Belle,
explosive because of both his bat and his temper, is already
attracting attention.
	   Both the New York Yankees and Mets said Wednesday they have
contacted Belle's agent, and other teams are thought to be
interested, too.
	   It was unclear if the Yankees' interest in the outfielder is
genuine, or if they were just sending a message to Bernie Williams,
who is unsure whether he'll re-sign with the World Series
champions.
	   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said he isn't bothered by
Belle's tempestuous past.
	   ``Nobody's history scares me,'' Steinbrenner said. ``We have a
discipline in the organization that has proven itself.''
	   Belle generally prefers to avoid reporters and would have
trouble doing that in the Yankees clubhouse, where dozens of
writers and cameramen spend hours each day.
	   Joe Torre's team was been a model of tranquility this year, and
Belle doesn't appear to be a good fit.
	   ``Who comes from deeper problems that Darryl and Doc?''
Steinbrenner said, referring to Darryl Strawberry and Dwight
Gooden. ``Yet they accepted the discipline and accepted the
direction.''
	   Steinbrenner made an appearance Wednesday to donate two dlrs
100,000 checks from the Yankees foundation to repair buildings
destroyed by Hurricane Georges.
	   One will pay to rebuild the Dr. Carl Th. Georg Regional
Children's Hospital in San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic.
The other will fund reconstruction of the Center for Senior
Citizens in Jurabo, Puerto Rico.
	   Even though he's technically no longer a Yankee, Williams will
personally deliver the checks in Puerto Rico, his native country,
and the Dominican Republic, along with team officials.
	   Mets general manager Steve Phillips said he talked with Belle's
agent, Arn Tellem, but about a different player.
	   ``You'd certainly have to be interested in him offensively and
what he's done,'' Phillips said. ``Any team in baseball would like
to add his offense to their club. But does he fit? I can't tell you
yes or no.''
	   Belle hit .328 with 49 homers and 152 RBIs last season. He
agreed to a dlrs 55 million, five-year contract with the Chicago
White Sox in November 1996, but has a unique clause in his deal
that allowed him to become a free agent Tuesday and also gave him
the option through Nov. 25 of returning to his White Sox contract.
	   Arizona general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said he intends to
have Williams in for a visit next month. Diamondbacks manager Buck
Showalter was Williams' manager in New York from 1992-95.
	   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, is seeking a deal at least seven
years long and exceeding the dlrs 91 million Mike Piazza got from
the Mets.
	   ``Here's a player who was the American League batting champion,
a Gold Glove center fielder. I think it would be useful, if he
wants to, to have a conversation with him,'' Garagiola said. ``He
is one of the most attractive players on the market.''
	   Meanwhile, David Cone and the Yankees postponed a decision on
whether he will exercise a dlrs 5.5 million player option for next
season. The deadline, originally midnight EST Wednesday, was pushed
back to Nov. 4.
	   Johnson, who filed for free agency Wednesday, led the majors
with 329 strikeouts, going 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA in 11 starts after
Houston acquired him from Seattle on July 31. The Astros have said
they want to re-sign him, but the 35-year-old left-hander hasn't
said whether he wants to stay. The Diamondbacks are interested
because he lives in the Phoenix area.
	   In other free-agent news, the San Diego Padres exercised their
dlrs 1.9 million option on postseason hero Jim Leyritz.
	   Philadelphia center fielder Doug Glanville, who would not have
been eligible for salary arbitration until after next season,
agreed to a three-year contract worth dlrs 5,575,000.
	   Glanville, who led the National League with 678 at-bats last
season, will make dlrs 525,000 in 1999, up from a dlrs 260,000 base
this year. He gets dlrs 2 million in 2000, dlrs 3 million in 2001
and a dlrs 50,000 signing bonus.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government tanks rolled along a
Kosovo highway Thursday, while U.S. and European envoys urged
ethnic Albanian rebels not to take over checkpoints vacated by
police and to begin talks as soon as possible.
	   At least 15 tanks and five other vehicles were seen heading
north of here, perhaps toward a military base as part of the
on-going redeployment of government forces demanded by NATO and the
U.N. Security Council.
	   An agreement reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
required Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to remove or
redeploy forces in Kosovo, which were increased dramatically after
he launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists Feb. 28.
	   As the redployment of forces continues, rebels of the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army have been milling around positions vacated
by Serb police and Yugoslav troops. Scores of uniformed KLA
guerrillas marched in formation at a funeral Wednesday for a KLA
fighter at Dragobilje, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   That was unthinkable three days earlier, when Serb police manned
a checkpoint on the road to Dragobilje.
	   U.S. and European diplomats are concerned that any KLA efforts
to exploit the Serb draw-down might complicate efforts to bring
Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians to the conference table to
negotiate the longterm future of the province, part of Yugoslavia's
main republic Serbia.
	   Special U.S. mediator Christopher Hill urged the rebels
Wednesday not to increase tensions by taking over former Serb
checkpoints and bunkers.
	   Hill told reporters that the Americans and Europeans are
insisting that the KLA not try to exploit the situation created by
the departure of virtually all the special police and troops sent
to Kosovo after Milosevic launched his crackdown on the rebels Feb.
28.
	   ``It is our strong view that the KLA should not try to take
advantage of the reconfiguration, the withdrawal of Serbian
forces,'' Hill said. ``We are looking for this withdrawal to
contribute to stability, to contribute to the peacefulness out
there and to facilitate the return of people to their villages. And
we're very pleased that the return of people to their villages will
accelerate.''
	   Reinforcing that demand, the special European Community envoy
for Kosovo, Wolfgang Petritsch, urged the Kosovo Albanians to begin
a ``constructive dialogue'' with Milosevic on self-rule for the
majority Albanian province, which is part of Yugoslavia's main
republic Serbia.
	   ``It is true they have moved into some of the positions,''
Petritsch said of the rebels. ``Fortunately there were no fights
going on because the Serb security forces at least Wednesday were
acting in a responsible way and we can only appeal to the Albanians
to do the same. Otherwise new problems will be built up and that
will definitely not help the international mission here in
Kosovo.''
	   Petritsch said it was of ``particular importance'' for the
Kosovo Albanians to take advantage of this ``historical moment'' to
resolve the crisis.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people. Most want independence. The Americans and Europeans,
however, do not support independence, fearing it would lead to
similar demands by ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in the
southern Balkans.
	   ``It's the position of the United States that we do not support
Kosovo's independence,'' Hill said. ``We do not feel that this
would be a stabilizing factor in the region.''
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, NATO has announced plans to
begin spy flights over Kosovo this weekend to make sure Milosevic
is sticking by the agreement.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also
hopes that most of the 2,000 people which it will send to the
province to verify the agreement will be in Kosovo in the next few
weeks.
	   That should enable most of the thousands of refugees still
camped in the hills to return home and avoid the humanitarian
disaster which had been widely predicted before the
Milosevic-Holbrooke deal.

Australia picks experimental team to play U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian soccer coach Raul Blanco
will take an experimental team to play the United States in San
Jose on Nov. 6 following the Socceroos' failure to make the
Confederations Cup.
	   Blanco's team is focussed on the players likely to take part in
the 2000 Olympic Games tournament rather than being a full-strength
outfit.
	   Australia was a surprise loser to New Zealand in Confederations
Cup qualifying and the U.S. game had been arranged before that
defeat as an expected warm-up for the Cup competition in Mexico.
	   Although 13 of the 18 players in the squad are from the under-23
Olympic squad, Blanco has included some top-line talent.
	   Croatia Zagreb striker Mark Viduka, who has been linked to
Glasgow Celtic, will lead the attack and will be partnered by the
Australian domestic league's top scorer Damian Mori.
	   Veteran defender Alex Tobin will skipper the side after having
the job during the failed World Cup campaign late last year.
	   ``We're giving a lot of young players a chance to prove
themselves; it's a brave move but sometimes you have to be prepared
to take a chance,'' Blanco said Thursday. ``You can't always play
it safe but I believe there is a lot of quality in this young
brigade.''
	   The U.S. will have Bruce Arena at the helm for the first time,
and he too has a fresh squad, with nine newcomers.
	   The match at Spartan Stadium is the first for the U.S. team
since its first-round exit at the World Cup.
	   Australian squad: Alex Tobin, Tansel Baser, Raphael Bove, Marco
Bresciano, Simon Colosimo, Jason Culina, Michael Curcija, Brett
Emerton, Hayden Foxe, Danny Milosevic, Damian Mori, Lucas Neill,
Jason Petkovic, Sebastian Sinozic, Josip Skoko, Mark Viduka, Kasey
Wehrman, Ivan Zelic.

Crew members await charges for transporting 175 illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANIA, Greece (AP) _ Prosecutors planned Thursday to charge two
crew members of a fishing boat that transported 175 Iraqi Kurds to
the Greek island of Crete.
	   The two men were identified by Chania port authorities as
Mustafa al Abdul Fatah, the ship's 46-year-old Libyan captain, and
Mohammed el Hamsa, 28, a Syrian.
	   They were arrested Wednesday when port authorities stopped the
Lebanese-flagged Santa Maria. The illegal immigrants, including
about 130 children, were huddled on board the 19-meter (62-foot)
wooden vessel.
	   According to media reports, the Santa Maria had set sail from
Lebanon about two weeks ago and was heading for Italy but was
forced to turn towards Crete when it ran into bad weather.
	   The immigrants are being temporarily housed in a Chania hotel.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants try to reach Greece each
year from Turkey and the Middle East.

Indonesian rioters attack Chinese-owned house used for Christian
</HEADLINE>
worship &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of stone-throwing rioters
rampaged through an Indonesian town in a protest against the use of
a Chinese-owned home as a place for Christian worship, police said
Thursday.
	   The mob damaged at least 10 shops and houses and one ethnic
Chinese man was beaten in the riot Wednesday in Ciamis, 200
kilometers (125 miles) southeast of the capital, Jakarta.
	   The ethnic Chinese minority has been the target of widespread
unrest this year, as rioters angry over price increases have
targeted their shops and homes.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades, and
relatively well-off Chinese entrepreneurs are natural scapegoats
for the hardship suffered by millions of people.
	   The unrest helped oust former President Suharto in May, but
there have been few recent reports of violence tied to religious
differences. Nearly 90 percent of Indonesia's 200 million people
are Muslim, and ethnic Chinese are mostly Christian or Buddhist.
	   Religious tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy and
constitution, but Christians often have difficulty obtaining
permits to build churches. So they sometimes worship illegally at
home.
	   The makeshift church in Ciamis was set up on the second floor of
a house owned by a Chinese businessman. His shop, which was damaged
in the riot, fills the first floor.
	   A local police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said by telephone that damaged property included a bank, a pharmacy
and several cars.
	   He said the rioters beat up a man believed to be a relative of
the owner of the house used for prayer.
	   The riot prompted the military to tighten security in the
neighboring town of Tasikmalaya, where protesters burned Christian
churches during unrest that left at least three people dead in
1996.

Report: Chinese activist allowed to run for village office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A dissident who was detained in July for
trying to join an illegal opposition party has been allowed to
register to run for mayor of a village in southeastern China, a
human rights group said Thursday.
	   Yu Tielong received permission Tuesday to run in an election
next Monday in Wangshanding in Zhejiang province, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   Such elections have been held since 1987 in some 930,000
villages throughout China. Committees picked through nonpartisan
voting decide how to spend government money and implement national
policies on birth control and other matters.
	   Yu was detained for 10 hours on July 9 by police in Hangzhou,
his hometown and the capital of Zhejiang, after trying to join the
China Democracy Party.
	   Authorities in at least nine provinces have rejected attempts to
register the party, which would challenge the Communist Party
monopoly on political activity.
	   Yu was one of at least a dozen dissidents detained recently by
police. At least three of those detained were associated with the
China Democracy Party.
	   ``If he is successful in the Nov. 2 vote ... this will symbolize
a small step forward for the China Democracy Party,'' the
Information Center said.
	   Yu also has campaigned publicly against corruption. He announced
plans in August to circulate a petition demanding a new, public
trial for former Mayor Chen Xitong of Beijing. Chen was sentenced
this year to 16 years in prison for corruption, but critics
complained that the trial was held in secret.
	   The Information Center also said three opposition candidates in
Beijing will defy an official order not to run for the city
legislature in elections next month.
	   The trio said in September that police had told them they
couldn't run, tore down campaign posters and tried to talk them out
of running.
	   The group includes Gao Hongming, who spent two years in a labor
camp after the 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy
demonstrations.

Dominique Moceanu no longer a child _ legally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with new quotes from Moceanu and her
lawyer &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRI LANGFORD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Dominique Moceanu, her childhood now legally
behind her, plans to meet with an accountant _ her first act as an
official adult _ before returning to gymnastics training.
	   ``I'll be looking into my finances,'' the solemn 17-year-old
vowed Wednesday, minutes after state District Judge John D.
Montgomery declared her a legal adult.
	   The ruling came after her parents Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu
reluctantly gave up a challenge to their daughter's bid for legal
adulthood.
	   Moceanu's father broke into tears during a 20-minute hearing
before Montgomery. He had to be asked three times if he agreed with
the settlement before he finally uttered a low, ``Yes,'' and signed
the document.
	   ``This wasn't very easy for me,'' Miss Moceanu said afterward.
``This was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. It was
something I felt I had to do.''
	   ``I sincerely wish you all the best of luck,'' Montgomery told
Moceanu and her parents. ``It's not a pleasant situation to come
down to a court like this, since the three of you probably would
rather be just about anywhere else doing something else than
standing here today.''
	   The settlement gave the 1996 gold medalist her freedom, a
hard-won victory after months of quarreling with her parents about
how her earnings were being spent.
	   Moceanu's attorney, Roy W. Moore, said he was already setting up
a meeting with an accountant.
	   ``The first thing I do is put her with a family office division
of a good accounting firm,'' he said.
	   As for Moceanu's legal plans, everything is up in the air, Moore
said.
	   ``At this point, I flat don't know,'' he said. ``I want her to
get back to training and doing what she does best.''
	   Moceanu said she no longer will live in her parents'
Houston-area home.
	   ``This is a great day, but a sad day,'' she said. ``I want to
get one thing straight: I'm not living at home, I'm not going back
home.''
	   Instead, she will remain at a newly rented apartment. She ran
away from home just over a week ago.
	   In her initial petition to the court, Moceanu claimed earnings
in her trust fund bankrolled unauthorized risky investments and a
dlrs 4 million gym bearing her name.
	   It is not known how much was in the trust or how much has been
spent. Moceanu now, as an adult, has the legal right to ask for an
accounting of her fortune.
	   But the trust is structured so even with the new adult
declaration, it remains out of her hands until she is 35.
	   Coincidently, the court handling the Moceanu case is the same
one that took an identical request from then-underaged gymnast Mary
Lou Retton.
	   In 1985, Retton, then 17, asked the same 309th District Court to
declare her an adult so she could invest earnings following her
1984 Olympic gold medal performance.
	   Retton's parents _ Lois and Ronnie Retton of Fairmont, West
Virginia _ never opposed their daughter's request, and it was
granted without question four days after the petition was filed.

One Chinese man killed in street fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Chinese man was fatally stabbed
during a street brawl involving 40 Chinese nationals, police said
Thursday.
	   Armed with swords, axes and knives, Chinese nationals brawled
Tuesday afternoon in eastern Bucharest where they have wholesale
business interests, said Cpt. Ovidiu Draghici.
	   The fight was prompted when a partner in a business group was
said to be angered that one of his partners was underselling him
and collecting protection money from other wholesalers.
	   The dead man was identified Wang Xinguo, 31. It was not known if
he had any connection to the origin of the fight.
	   Four men in their 30s are being treated for stab wounds at
Bucharest's Emergency Hospital.
	   Since 1989 when communism ended, tens of thousands of Chinese
have moved to Romania. Most are employed in the wholesale business,
importing cheap Chinese clothes.
	   There are occasional killings between rival gangs which have
shocked Romanians.
	   Police are investigating the killing and have named a suspect, a
leader of Chinese business interests. Nobody has been arrested.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Handing the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal only its third conviction, a Bosnian Serb Thursday pleaded
guilty to 14 murders.
	   Goran Jelisic, 30, faces a maximum life prison term for the
killings. Because he pleaded innocent to a genocide charge he will
still face trial at the U.N. court. Only then will he be officially
convicted of the murders, presiding judge Claude Jorda said.

France recruits handicapped to help deter reckless drivers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RELEDES to clarify, show that 1998 is expected to bring a
higher highway death toll than last year &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Speeding drivers caught in the act will find
themselves confronting not only police but handicapped victims of
auto accidents _ a test to see if reality can deter reckless
driving.
	   The weekend, which marks the end of the All Saints Day holiday,
is traditionally a high-risk weekend on French roads, with 26-30
deaths a day, instead of the 20-22 deaths usually counted at this
time of year.
	   The test operation will be limited to three regions around Paris
-- Seine-et-Marne in the east, Yvelines in the west and Essonne in
the south. If successful, it is to be put into effect around
France, according to Isabelle Massin, in charge of road security.
	   ``Young handicapped people won't be there to give lessons,''
Massin was quoted as saying in Thursday's edition of Le Parisien,
``but to serve as witnesses to their own daily lives and say,
`Tomorrow don't become like us.'''
	   The wish, Massin told the daily, is that such dramas will speak
more loudly than the statistics -- 8,000 dead and 30,000 injured on
French highways last year.
	   She said that 1998 is proving to be a particularly murderous
year, with an additional 300 deaths expected.
	   The handicapped will accompany police who stop cars for speeding
and other infractions like drunken driving. They will then meet
with the drivers along the side of the road.
	   The handicapped involved in the operation belong to the
Association of the Paralyzed of France and the National Union of
Families of Cranial Trauma.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey and four Caspian states signed a
declaration Thursday in support of an oil pipeline crossing through
Turkey as the main export route to carry oil from Caspian's rich
oil fields.
	   The declaration was a triumph for Turkey, which got most of the
countries involved in the project _ apart from Russia and
Turkmenistan _ to declare their support for a pipeline running from
the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan via Georgia.
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardon witnessed the signing
ceremony in a show of Washington's commitment to the project.
	   The declaration was signed by the presidents of Turkey,
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakistan and Uzbekistan. Turkmen President
Saparmurad Turkmenbasi refused to sign the declaration but gave no
reason.
	   ``Now the issue is not whether Baku-Ceyhan is going to happen,
because it is going to happen. The issue is how,'' Richardson told
The Associated Press following the signing ceremony.
	   The United States has repeatedly pledged its backing for the
proposed 1,730-kilometer (1,075-mile) pipeline. Last week,
Washington announced a Trade Development Agency aid of dlrs 823,000
for the pipeline.
	   Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev said the declaration sealed
the future of the Caspian oil to flow through Baku-Ceyhan despite
there being ``opposing parties to the project and circles that want
to block its realization.''
	   He added the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan was the original route planned
when Azerbaijan signed a 1994 agreement with 11 international oil
companies.
	   ``As an independent country, we are free to chose the route for
our oil,'' he said.
	   Caspian oil reserves provide one of the world's richest oil
resources. There has been a great battle to get the oil flow
through Turkey against plans by international companies to use more
routes that would carry the oil through the narrow Turkish Straits.
	   In the declaration, the presidents strongly confirmed their
determination ``in realizing the Caspian-Mediterranean
(Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) project as the main export pipeline.''
	   They also instructed ``their related authorities regarding the
creation of all necessary conditions for the realization of the
east-west energy corridor and within this the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline.''
	   Turkey has been lobbying energy companies to choose the Caspian
route. The companies are expected to announce their decision Nov.
12.
	   The main alternative is an existing pipeline from Baku to the
Georgian Black Sea of Supsa. Oil companies reportedly have been
favoring that route, showing reluctance to invest in the estimated
dlrs 2.5 billion cost of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.
	   Turkey's main argument against other routes is the heavy oil
tanker traffic through the Bosporus strait, which has led to
hundreds of accidents.
	   ``This is the most environmentally sound, economically rational
project for the export of Caspian oil,'' said Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ British colonialism is history in Hong Kong,
but the last governor, Chris Patten, got a hero's welcome Thursday
from hundreds of people who see him as a symbol of the good old
times when money was easy to come by and unemployment was close to
nil.
	   Hong Kong has slipped into recession since the handover to
Chinese rule in July 1997 _ a casualty of Asia's crisis rather the
political transition _ but some of Patten's fans say the
sharp-witted and politically savvy Briton might have had the right
stuff for saving the territory.
	   ``He's charismatic and eloquent,'' said Paul Leung, an insurance
salesman who came to greet Patten and get a signed copy of the
ex-governor's new book, ``East and West.''
	   ``He has a way to pump people up,'' Leung said. ``I think people
are convinced that things would have been OK with him at the helm.
That's why people miss him so much.''
	   Patten's visit has drawn the inevitable comparisons between
Patten and his successor, the Beijing-picked Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa.
	   Tung is highly regarded for his diligence and sincerity, but
many people say he just doesn't have the natural charm to lead a
dispirited people out of their economic doldrums.
	   Patten is here on a four-day private trip to promote his book, a
memoir of his five years as governor. This is his first visit since
Britain handed over Hong Kong's sovereignty.
	   In a sharp contrast to the old-fashioned and reserved Tung,
whose aversion to publicity has cost him much of his popularity,
Patten has rolled through town on a trademark charm offensive,
chatting with admirers and walking the streets at ease, waving to
supporters and teasing small children.
	   ``You're the best, and you're one of the finest,'' said Annie
Wan, a marine policewoman.
	   Patten gave her a big smile.
	   Another fan, Annie Li, got up before 6 a.m. for the hourlong
commute from her apartment in the rural New Territories, just so
she could be the first in line.
	   Lin didn't mind the four-hour wait: She has all the time in the
world since she was fired from her job as a sales clerk a year ago.
	   ``If Patten were still the governor, things wouldn't be so bad
now,'' Li said. Tung ``has a lot to learn from Patten. He has
direction. He has a vision.''
	   ``Even though Patten is a foreigner, he's more open to our views
than the Chinese leaders,'' said Kelvin Wan, a technician for the
Mass Transit Railway.
	   Patten is endearingly known here as ``Fat Pang,'' a reference to
his love for food and bulging belly, and people fondly remember his
casual walkabouts in dilapidating neighborhoods, where he shared
laughs and tales with the underprivileged.
	   But his stubborn arm-wrestlings with China also made him no
darling to many political conservatives. To protest the democratic
reforms he engineered without its approval, Beijing dismantled an
elected legislature and replaced it with a handpicked body in 1997.
	   Yi Chung-yiu, a doctor who spent most of his life in Britain,
gave Patten a small picture with a line saying: ``The truly
well-bred advocate equality.''
	   ``Mr. Patten was instrumental in bringing democracy to Hong
Kong,'' Yi said. ``People felt a bit insecure when he left.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite winning his first battle against
extradition to Spain, Gen. Augusto Pinochet's hopes of being
whisked home to Chile immediately must wait.
	   The High Court on Wednesday rejected two arrest warrants from a
Spanish magistrate seeking Pinochet's extradition to face charges
of murder, torture and kidnapping of political opponents during his
17-year rule. The court said the former dictator is immune from
criminal prosecution in Britain because the alleged crimes occurred
while he was head of state. Pinochet also won repayment of his
legal costs, estimated to be 350,000 pounds (dlrs 560,000).
	   Lord Chief Justice Thomas Bingham said, however, that Pinochet
must remain in custody pending an appeal by prosecutors to the
House of Lords, Britain's highest court.
	   Prosecutors said they will file an urgent appeal Monday. It is
uncertain how long the ruling will take. Predictions in the British
media ranged from next week to several weeks.
	   Pinochet's lawyers, meanwhile, asked for his release on bail. A
bail hearing was scheduled for Friday. Magistrates said they would
consider holding the hearing at the private London Clinic where
Pinochet is recovering from back surgery Oct. 9.
	   But the general was moved to another London hospital on Thursday
morning, police said. Scotland Yard confirmed Pinochet had been
moved after an ambulance was seen leaving the London Clinic under
police escort, but would not say where he had been taken.
	   Pinochet was arrested etc. graf 7 pvs.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government tanks rolled back to
barracks Thursday, and U.S. and European envoys urged ethnic
Albanian rebels not to take over checkpoints vacated by police so
that diplomacy can lead to talks on the province's future.
	   At least 15 T-55 tanks and five other vehicles were seen
rumbling down the highway from central Kosovo to the Pristina
barracks Thursday morning as part of the on-going redeployment of
government forces demanded by NATO and the U.N. Security Council.
	   An agreement reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
required Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to remove or
redeploy forces in Kosovo, which were increased dramatically after
he launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists Feb. 28.
	   As the redeployment continues, rebels of the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army have been seen at positions vacated by Serb police
and Yugoslav troops. Scores of uniformed KLA guerrillas marched in
formation at a funeral Wednesday for a KLA fighter at Dragobilje,
some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   That was unthinkable three days earlier, when Serb police manned
a checkpoint on the road to Dragobilje.
	   U.S. and European diplomats are concerned that any KLA efforts
to exploit the Serb draw-down might complicate efforts to bring
Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians to the conference table to
negotiate the longterm future of the province, part of Yugoslavia's
main republic Serbia.
	   ``It is our strong view that the KLA should not try to take
advantage of the reconfiguration, the withdrawal of Serbian
forces,'' special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said here Wednesday.
	   ``We are looking for this withdrawal to contribute to stability,
to contribute to the peacefulness out there and to facilitate the
return of people to their villages,'' Hill added. ``And we're very
pleased that the return of people to their villages will
accelerate.''
	   The special European Community envoy for Kosovo, Wolfgang
Petritsch, urged the Kosovo Albanians to begin a ``constructive
dialogue'' with Milosevic on self-rule for the majority Albanian
province.
	   ``It is true they have moved into some of the positions,''
Petritsch said of the rebels. ``Fortunately, there were no fights
going on because the Serb security forces at least Wednesday were
acting in a responsible way and we can only appeal to the Albanians
to do the same. Otherwise new problems will be built up and that
will definitely not help the international mission here in
Kosovo.''
	   Petritsch said it was of ``particular importance'' for the
Kosovo Albanians to take advantage of this ``historical moment'' to
resolve the crisis.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people. Most want independence. The Americans and Europeans,
however, do not support independence, fearing it would lead to
similar demands by ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in the
southern Balkans.
	   ``It's the position of the United States that we do not support
Kosovo's independence,'' Hill said. ``We do not feel that this
would be a stabilizing factor in the region.''
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, NATO has announced plans to
begin spy flights over Kosovo this weekend to make sure Milosevic
is sticking by the agreement.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also
hopes that most of the 2,000 people which it will send to the
province to verify the agreement will be in Kosovo in the next few
weeks.
	   That should enable most of the thousands of refugees still
camped in the hills to return home and avoid the humanitarian
disaster which had been widely predicted before the
Milosevic-Holbrooke deal.

	   THE HAGUE: Jorda said:
	   Jelisic, who called himself ``The Serb Adolf'' in reference to
Adolf Hitler, said he had admitted the murders of Muslims and
Croats to cleanse his soul.
	   ``It was my good will that I admitted the crime and cleanse my
soul,'' he calmly told the three-judge panel. ``There is no reason
for me to keep it within myself.''
	   During the 40-minute hearing, Jelisic, dressed in jeans and a
striped sweater, looked calm. As he entered guilty pleas to a total
of 31 charges covering the murders, three beatings and the plunder
of property, Jelisic looked down at his indictment.
	   Jelisic was entering pleas to a new indictment containing 20
fewer charges than the original but still featuring a chilling list
of cold-blooded murders.
	   At an earlier hearing, prosecutors said they would drop some
charges to speed up Jelisic's trial.
	   At his first arraignment in January, Jelisic called the
allegations ``all lies and fabrications.''
	   Jelisic admitted systematically shooting Muslims and Croats to
death at the Luka camp in northern Bosnia in 1992, then ordering
fellow inmates to collect the bodies.
	   He is the third war criminal convicted by the U.N. court.
	   In 1997, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic was sentenced to 20 years for
killing and torturing Muslims and Croats in 1992 and last year
Bosnian Croat Drazen Erdemovic was given a five-year sentence for
taking part in a Bosnian Serb Army mass execution of Muslims
following the fall of Srebrenica in 1995.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The unusual case of a Chinese airline
captain who hijacked his own flight to Taiwan had officials on both
sides grappling Thursday with the touchy question of how they
should deal with such cross-border crimes.
	   Taiwanese leaders called for a fresh dialogue, while China
demanded the return of renegade Air China pilot Yuan Bin, saying
that would help to deter future hijackings and keep the skies safer
for travelers.
	   Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of Taiwan's government Mainland
Affairs Council, said Wednesday's sensational diversion of Air
China flight CA905 highlights an urgent need to restart talks
between the rival sides on safety concerns.
	   ``We should resume the talks and sign an agreement as soon as
possible,'' Sheu told a news conference.
	   But China was calling for swift action and not words, saying the
Taiwanese should return Yuan to China, where Wednesday's hijacking
took place.
	   ``There have been precedents for the mutual repatriation of
hijackers, which is feasible,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang told reporters in Beijing. ``The Taiwan authorities should
act accordingly and repatriate Yuan Bin and other hijackers from
the mainland at an early date so as to safeguard the safety of air
passengers.''
	   Yuan's flight from Beijing to the southwestern Chinese city of
Kunming ended up instead at Taipei's international airport after
the disgruntled captain changed course to protest pay and working
conditions at the state-owned carrier. The flight had been
scheduled to proceed from China to Yangon, Myanmar.
	   Yuan, 30, was accompanied by his wife, Xu Mei, 27. Both have
been taken into custody by Taiwanese authorities, who have not yet
said what charges might be filed.
	   Taiwanese newspapers said Yuan complained that the airline did
not provide pilots with necessary safety training and that the
company had failed to allocate him a large house but instead gave
houses to people with better connections.
	   But in Beijing, an Air China spokesman said Yuan earned enough
money to buy his own car, while sharing a spacious three-room
apartment with his wife.
	   Yuan's gripes that he lacked good relations and good prospects
with the company made no sense, said the Air China spokesman, who
identified himself only by his surname, Liu.
	   Air China's decision to put Yuan in charge of international
flights reflected the carrier's trust in him, the spokesman said.
	   Angelica Cheung, a prominent aviation journalist from Hong Kong,
said Yuan's frustrations are common in the airline, despite
attempts at reform.
	   Pilots' salaries hover around U.S. dlrs 1,000 per month, high
pay by Chinese standards but a pittance compared to what foreign
pilots can earn, she said.
	   And management at Air China, similar to that in most Chinese
state enterprises, can be distant and rigid, with pilots locked
into employment contracts that prevent them from transferring to
jobs at better-paying startup airlines, Cheung said.
	   While Yuan's job protest made for an unusual type of hijacking _
some reports have even raised questions about whether a captain of
a jet can be charged with hijacking if no force was used _ it also
resurrected an issue that has been a sore point between Taiwan and
China.
	   Taiwan used to greet hijackers from China almost as heroes,
before cracking down after tense Taiwan-China relations began
thawing in the 1980s.
	   During a string of air piracies in 1993 and 1994, Taiwan
arrested 16 Chinese hijackers and sentenced them to prison for up
to 12 years.
	   Two were paroled and sent back to China last year. But China
refused to tell Taiwan about their fate in the mainland, and Taiwan
then declined to repatriate six others who have since been paroled.
	   Taiwan and China were close to signing an agreement on
repatriating the hijackers in 1995 when China broke off the talks
in anger over a Taiwanese drive to gain international recognition.
	   Taiwan had agreed to send back all hijackers except those who
could face political prosecution in China, and China had agreed not
to retry the hijackers.

Bosnian Serb pleads guilty to 14 murders at U.N. tribunal

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Handing the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal its third conviction, a Bosnian Serb pleaded guilty
Thursday to 14 murders.
	   Goran Jelisic, 30, faces a maximum life prison term. Because he
pleaded innocent to a genocide charge, he still faces trial before
the U.N. court. Presiding Judge Claude Jorda said Jelisic will be
officially convicted of the 14 murders in that trial.

	   Jelisic, who called himself ``The Serb Adolf'' in reference to
Adolf Hitler, said he admitted to the murders of Muslims and Croats
to ``cleanse his soul.''
	   ``It was my good will that I admitted the crime and cleanse my
soul,'' he calmly told the three-judge panel. ``There is no reason
for me to keep it within myself.''
	   During the 40-minute hearing, Jelisic, dressed in jeans and a
striped sweater, entered guilty pleas to 31 charges covering the
murders, three beatings and the plunder of property.
	   Jelisic entered the pleas to a new indictment containing 20
fewer charges than the original, but still featured a chilling list
of cold-blooded murders. At an earlier hearing, prosecutors said
they would drop some charges to speed up Jelisic's trial.
	   At his first arraignment in January, Jelisic called the
allegations ``all lies and fabrications.''
	   Jelisic admitted systematically shooting Muslims and Croats to
death at the Luka camp in northern Bosnia in 1992, then ordering
fellow inmates to collect the bodies.
	   He is the third war criminal convicted by the U.N. court.
	   In 1997, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic was sentenced to 20 years for
killing and torturing Muslims and Croats in 1992. Last year,
Bosnian Croat Drazen Erdemovic was given a five-year sentence for
taking part in a Bosnian Serb Army mass execution of Muslims
following the fall of Srebrenica in 1995.

Turkey, Caspian countries sign declaration backing oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey and four Caspian states signed a
declaration Thursday in support of an oil pipeline crossing through
Turkey as the main export route to carry oil from Caspian's rich
oil fields.
	   The declaration was a triumph for Turkey, which got most of the
countries involved in the project _ apart from Russia and
Turkmenistan _ to declare their support for a pipeline running from
the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan via Georgia.
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson witnessed the signing
ceremony in a show of Washington's commitment to the project.
	   The declaration was signed by the presidents of Turkey,
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan. Turkmen President
Saparmurad Turkmenbasi refused to sign the declaration but gave no
reason.
	   ``Now the issue is not whether Baku-Ceyhan is going to happen,
because it is going to happen. The issue is how,'' Richardson told
The Associated Press following the signing ceremony.
	   The United States has repeatedly pledged its backing for the
proposed 1,730-kilometer (1,075-mile) pipeline. Last week,
Washington announced a Trade Development Agency aid of dlrs 823,000
for the pipeline.
	   Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev said the declaration sealed
the future of the Caspian oil to flow through Baku-Ceyhan despite
there being ``opposing parties to the project and circles that want
to block its realization.''
	   He added that Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan was the original route planned
when Azerbaijan signed a 1994 agreement with 11 international oil
companies.
	   ``As an independent country, we are free to chose the route for
our oil,'' he said.
	   Caspian oil reserves provide one of the world's richest oil
resources. There has been a great battle to get the oil flow
through Turkey against plans by international companies to use more
routes that would carry the oil through the narrow Turkish Straits.
	   In the declaration, the presidents strongly confirmed their
determination ``in realizing the Caspian-Mediterranean
(Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) project as the main export pipeline.''
	   They also instructed ``their related authorities regarding the
creation of all necessary conditions for the realization of the
east-west energy corridor and within this the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline.''
	   Turkey has been lobbying energy companies to choose the Caspian
route. The companies are expected to announce their decision Nov.
12.
	   The main alternative is an existing pipeline from Baku to the
Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa. Oil companies reportedly have
been favoring that route, showing reluctance to invest in the
estimated dlrs 2.5 billion cost of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.
	   Turkey's main argument against other routes is the heavy oil
tanker traffic through the Bosporus strait, which has led to
hundreds of accidents.
	   ``This is the most environmentally sound, economically rational
project for the export of Caspian oil,'' said Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel.

Suzuki takes first round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATO, Japan (AP) _ Toru Suzuki shot a 6-under-par 66 Thursday
and took a one-stroke first-round lead in the 200 million yen (dlrs
1.7 million) Philip Morris Championship golf tournament.
	   The 32-year-old Suzuki, seeking his second victory this season
and fifth overall, shot six birdies on the 7,176-yard, par-72 ABC
Golf club course in western Japan.
	   Seven golfers were just one shot behind at 67 _ American David
Ishii from Hawaii, Dinesh Chand of Fiji and five Japanese,
including Shigeo Maruyama, Tateo ``Jet'' Ozaki and last week's
tournament winner Nobuhito Sato.
	   Jet Ozaki, younger brother of Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, is
seeking his first victory in more than five years and 15th overall.
	   ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, seeking his third victory this season and fifth
consecutive season money winner title, shot a 75 and was tied with
Australia's Stewart Ginn, Taiwan's Chen Tze-ming and five Japanese,
including veteran Tsuneyuki ``Tommy'' Nakajima, seeking his first
victory since 1995.
	   A total of 90 players, including 19 non-Japanese, teed off in
clear weather.
	   The winner will receive 36 million yen (dlrs 310,000).

Indonesian students, workers stage anti-government protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment by armed forces commander &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of students protested outside
Parliament and workers rallied for the release of a comrade
Thursday in a second day of anti-government demonstrations.
	   The protest at the legislature came one day after 8,000 students
gathered there in the biggest rally in the capital since violent
unrest forced former President Suharto to quit in May.
	   The students, many of them women wearing Islamic head scarves,
warned they will step up demonstrations ahead of a government
assembly next month that will shape guidelines for 1999 elections.
	   The government has said that 30,000 police, soldiers and
civilian volunteers will be deployed to safeguard the People's
Consultative Assembly.
	   Armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto urged protesters to obey a
law enacted last week that regulates demonstrations, requiring for
example that organizers obtain special permits.
	   ``The security forces are not there to prevent demonstrations as
long as they are conducted in accordance with the law,'' Wiranto
said.
	   Meanwhile, about 100 workers demonstrated for the release of a
jailed labor activist who was convicted of organizing a strike
while the authoritarian Suharto was in power.
	   Like the students, the workers who gathered outside the attorney
general's office demanded an end to the Indonesian military's big
role in politics and said that the armed forces always favored
employers in labor disputes.
	   Their main demand was the release of Dita Indah Sari, who was
convicted last year of organizing a 1996 strike by 20,000 workers
in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city.
	   She was arrested in a nationwide crackdown on opposition
activists and sentenced to six years in prison.
	   ``We want the release of our hero,'' said Gimin, a worker. ``She
was put in jail by the Suharto regime because she defended our
rights and our struggle.''
	   The workers, who came from diamond, electronics and shoe
factories, demanded that the government lower food prices.
Inflation has soared and millions of people have lost their jobs as
Indonesia endures its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The students who gathered near the legislature Thursday also
urged the government to revoke the national philosophy, Pancasila,
which mandates social tolerance. Suharto jailed many opponents
after accusing them of violating the creed.
	   On Wednesday, student activists demanded that Suharto be put on
trial for alleged corruption and that his successor, President B.J.
Habibie, quit over continuing political and economic turmoil.
	   They want the government to abandon plans to convene the
assembly, which will cast regulations in November for elections
next year.
	   Student leaders claim the assembly won't push for real change
and is filled with holdovers from the Suharto era.
	   Habibie has taken steps to implement democracy, freeing some
political prisoners and allowing banned magazines to reopen and
political parties to form. Critics, however, say he is not moving
fast enough.
	   Also Thursday, about 30 women protested on Jakarta's main street
against violence against women that they claim has been
state-sponsored.
	   Karlina Laksono, a spokeswoman for the group, said rape had been
used as a method of intimidation against women in areas such as
East Timor and Aceh where separatists have been fighting for
independence from Indonesia.
	   An inquiry now is being held into allegations that mass rapes
were committed during rioting in May.
	   The government has vehemently denied using rape as an instrument
to cow its opponents.

	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant on
Thursday drove an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep
escorting a bus with 40 elementary school students, killing himself
and an Israeli soldier.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
suicide attack that also injured three Israelis. The children,

land-for-security agreement to proceed as scheduled. Arafat
promised to track down those behind the bombing.
	   The 12-week West Bank troop pullback is to begin Monday, and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense pressure
from Israeli hardliners to call off the deal.
	   The terror attack, the second this week, makes it increasingly
difficult for Netanyahu to fend off hard-line criticism. Even
before the bombing, Netanyahu had accused the Palestinians of not
living up to security pledges, raising U.S. concerns that
implementation of the deal could be delayed.
	   Thursday's explosion went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 gmt) at
the Gush Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time,
the Israeli school bus convoy guarded by two jeeps was passing by.
	   ``I saw one Israeli jeep blow up and burn completely,'' said
Palestinian witness Jaber Yamawi. ``I saw them take out two
soldiers in ambulances.''
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb was so powerful that the jeep flipped over on its side.
The jeep and the bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in the
nearby town of Khan Yunis, were scorched and mangled.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler who prepares bodies for
burials, said the jeep was still burning an hour after the
explosion. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered all over. There is
oil, gas, blood,'' Kirshenzach told Israel radio.
	   Pieces of black debris were scattered over a 50-yard radius. A
black, scorched shoe lay in the middle of the road.
	   The armored school bus was damaged, but the children were not
hurt. After the attack, the children were taken to their school in
Gush Katif bloc of Jewish settlements rather than being returned
home to nearby Kfar Darom settlement.
	   In school, the children talked to teachers and counselors about
their experience. The children spoke of the big boom and flames and
many asked about their friends on a second bus, school officials
said.
	   In a call to Israel radio, a man who said he spoke for Hamas
read a claim of responsibility. ``It's a revolution until
victory,'' the caller said, suggesting the attacks would continue.
	   The spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was evasive
when asked whether Hamas was responsible. Yassin said the group
wanted to avoid Palestinian civil war and would not react violently
to a possible crackdown by the Palestinian Authority.
	   In a first response, the Israel army sealed the Gaza Strip.
	   Arafat insisted that despite the attack, Israel stick to its
side of the peace agreement and withdraw from land and release
Palestinian prisoners. He said the Palestinian Authority would
track down those involved in plotting the attack and ``try them for
deliberately harming the Palestinians' national interests.''
	   Samia, the Israeli commander, said the identity of the suicide
bomber was known and that he was a resident of the nearby
Palestinian town of Khan Yunis.
	   Palestinian officials, however, said they only had the name of
the car's owner, a man from Khan Yunis.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Israel would
watch the Palestinian Authority's response closely.
	   ``The basis for progress in the (peace) process depends first
and foremost on intensive action against terrorism,'' Mordechai
said. ``If this is done, we will make progress.''
	   Implementation of the new peace agreement is to begin Monday.
Under the accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants.

Rwandan genocide suspects end hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The last of 25 Rwandan genocide
suspects, who were on a hunger strike in solidarity with a
convicted former mayor, started eating again at a U.N. prison.
	   The detainees ate Wednesday dinner at the jail in Arusha,
northern Tanzania, the U.N. Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said in a
statement.
	   ``We are pleased that the hunger strike has been called off,''
said Agwu Ukiwe Okali, tribunal registrar. ``It is a victory for
truth and common sense.''
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus, were killed between April and July 1994 in a genocide
orchestrated by the former Hutu government. The slaughter ended
when Tutsi rebels overthrew the government.
	   The detainees said in a letter to tribunal officials that they
had ended their hunger strike, but still has concerns about the
judicial process.
	   When they began their hunger strike on Monday they accused the
tribunal of bias, indifference to their complaints and an inability
to understand arguments made in their defense. They also complained
they were not always given their choice of defense lawyers.
	   Okali defended the tribunal's program for assigning defense
attorneys as ``very fair and indeed generous.''
	   Jean-Paul Akayesu, the convicted ex-mayor, continued to refuse
solid food. He stopped eating on Oct. 22 because the tribunal
refused to pay for the Canadian lawyer he wanted for his defense.
	   The tribunal lets suspects choose from a list of approved
defense attorneys at no cost. Suspects can hire other attorneys,
but the court will not pay for them.
	   Akayesu drank a lot of milk Wednesday and was under close
medical supervision, the tribunal said.
	   Akayesu is one of two Rwandans sentenced to life imprisonment
for their roles in the genocide. Both are appealing.
	   Another 30 suspects are in the tribunal's prison.

Bosnian Serb pleads guilty to 12 murders at U.N. tribunal

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Handing the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal only its third conviction, a Bosnian Serb Thursday pleaded
guilty to 12 murders.
	   Goran Jelisic, 30, faces a maximum life prison term for the
killings. Because he pleaded innocent to a genocide charge he will
still face trial at the U.N. court. Only then will he be officially
convicted of the murders, presiding judge Claude Jorda said.
	   Jelisic, who called himself ``The Serb Adolf'' in reference to
Adolf Hitler, said he had admitted the May 1992 murders of Muslims
and Croats to cleanse his soul.
	   ``It was my good will that I admitted the crime and cleanse my
soul,'' he calmly told the three-judge panel. ``There is no reason
for me to keep it within myself.''
	   During the 40-minute hearing, Jelisic, dressed in jeans and a
striped sweater, looked calm. As he entered guilty pleas to a total
of 31 charges covering the murders, three beatings and the plunder
of property, Jelisic looked down at his indictment.
	   Jelisic was entering pleas to a new indictment containing 20
fewer charges than the original but still featuring a chilling list
of cold-blooded murders.
	   Although prosecutors named 14 victims, the charges in Jelisic's
indictment say he actually murdered 12 people during a two-week
killing spree.
	   At an earlier hearing, prosecutors said they would drop some
charges to speed up Jelisic's trial.
	   At his first arraignment in January, Jelisic called the
allegations ``all lies and fabrications.''
	   Jelisic admitted systematically shooting Muslims and Croats to
death at the Luka camp in northern Bosnia in 1992, then ordering
fellow inmates to collect the bodies.
	   He is the third war criminal convicted by the U.N. court.
	   In 1997, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic was sentenced to 20 years for
killing and torturing Muslims and Croats in 1992 and last year
Bosnian Croat Drazen Erdemovic was given a five-year sentence for
taking part in a Bosnian Serb Army mass execution of Muslims
following the fall of Srebrenica in 1995.
	   No date was immediately set for Jelisic's genocide trial. At it,
prosecutors will have to prove that Jelisic intended to wipe out an
entire section of an ethnic group.
	   Jelisic's victims included a woman and an elderly man, in the
indictment, but also charge that Jelisic ``killed countless
detainees, whose identities are unknown.''
	   Jelisic used to boast to inmates about how many Muslims he
killed. Most of his victims were killed at close range with gun
shots while others were beaten to death.
	   Hundreds of Muslim and Croats were detained at Luka, a former
port complex on the banks of the Sava River, after being forced
from their homes by rebel Serbs.
	   According to Jelisic's indictment, prisoners were sometimes
ordered to kneel with their heads over a duct that drained into the
river, where Jelisic and other camp guards would shoot them in the
back of the head.
	   The bodies were later dumped in a mass grave outside Brcko.
	   The war crimes tribunal was set up by the U.N. Security Council
in 1993 to punish those responsible for atrocities in the wars that
raged in the former Yugoslavia after its split.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tanks seen entering Pristina barracks, CORRECTS
number of tanks seen, ADDS new quotes; TRIMS outdated material. &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Government tanks rolled back to
their barracks Thursday, and U.S. and European envoys urged ethnic
Albanian rebels not to take over checkpoints vacated by Serb police
so that diplomacy can lead to talks on the province's future.
	   At least 15 T-55 tanks and five other vehicles were seen
rumbling down the highway from central Kosovo to the Pristina
barracks Thursday morning as part of the on-going redeployment of
government forces demanded by NATO and the U.N. Security Council.
	   An agreement reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
required Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to remove or
redeploy forces in Kosovo, which were increased dramatically after
he launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists on Feb. 28.
	   As the redeployment continues, rebels of the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army have been seen at positions vacated by Serb police
and Yugoslav troops. Scores of uniformed KLA guerrillas marched in
formation at a funeral Wednesday for a KLA fighter at Dragobilje,
some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   That was unthinkable three days earlier, when Serb police manned
a checkpoint on the road to Dragobilje.
	   U.S. and European diplomats are concerned that any KLA efforts
to exploit the Serb draw-down might complicate efforts to bring
Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians to the conference table to
negotiate the long-term future of the province, part of
Yugoslavia's main republic Serbia.
	   ``It is our strong view that the KLA should not try to take
advantage of the reconfiguration, the withdrawal of Serbian
forces,'' special U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said here Wednesday.
	   ``We are looking for this withdrawal to contribute to stability,
to contribute to the peacefulness out there and to facilitate the
return of people to their villages,'' Hill added. ``And we're very
pleased that the return of people to their villages will
accelerate.''
	   The special European Community envoy for Kosovo, Wolfgang
Petritsch, urged the Kosovo Albanians to begin a ``constructive
dialogue'' with Milosevic on self-rule for the majority Albanian
province.
	   ``It is true they have moved into some of the positions,''
Petritsch said of the rebels. ``Fortunately, there were no fights
going on because the Serb security forces at least Wednesday were
acting in a responsible way and we can only appeal to the Albanians
to do the same. Otherwise new problems will be built up and that
will definitely not help the international mission here in
Kosovo.''
	   Petritsch said it was of ``particular importance'' for the
Kosovo Albanians to take advantage of this ``historical moment'' to
resolve the crisis.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people. Most want independence. The Americans and Europeans,
however, do not support independence, fearing it would lead to
similar demands by ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in the
southern Balkans.
	   ``It's the position of the United States that we do not support
Kosovo's independence,'' Hill said. ``We do not feel that this
would be a stabilizing factor in the region.''
	   With Yugoslav forces drawing back, NATO has announced plans to
begin spy flights over Kosovo this weekend to make sure Milosevic
is sticking by the agreement.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also
hopes that most of the 2,000 people which it will send to the
province to verify the agreement will be in Kosovo in the next few
weeks.
	   That should enable most of the thousands of refugees still
camped in the hills to return home and avoid the humanitarian
disaster which had been widely predicted before the
Milosevic-Holbrooke deal.

Deutsche Bank reports low third-quarter operating profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank operating profits were
lower than expected for the first nine months of the year, the bank
announced Thursday, citing a ``difficult market climate.''
	   Operating profits over the first three quarters of the year for
Germany's biggest commercial bank were 3.13 billion marks (dlrs
1.95 billion,) down 24 percent compared to figures for the same
period last year.
	   Calculations based on first-half trading profits showed the bank
sustained trading losses in the third quarter of 224 million marks
(dlrs 140 million.) The losses surprised analysts expecting a
modest trading profit, despite the economic crises in Russia and
Asia.
	   ``Maybe (the bank) had to write off some financial
investments,'' said Volker von Kruechten, an analyst at BHF Bank in
Frankfurt. He also said Deutsche Bank's recent earnings were weak,
as expected given the tremendous volatility of markets in recent
months.
	   Deutsche Bank said it ``remains confident we will be able to
attain a satisfactory full-year result despite the difficult market
climate.''

87 South Korean tour guides to make field trip in North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's largest conglomerate
will send 87 tour guides to North Korea Friday to prepare for
sightseeing tours of a scenic mountain in the communist nation.
	   Hyundai group has obtained North Korean approval to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships for four-day tours
of Diamond Mountain on the North's east coast.
	   Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of Hyundai, is in
North Korea this week, putting the final touches to the tourism
project.
	   Chung met with Kim Yong Nam, head of the North's parliament, in
Pyongyang Wednesday and discussed the project, the North's Korean
Central News Agency said.
	   ``Tourism of Mount Kumgang (Diamond) proceeds from our warm
compatriotic feelings,'' KCNA quoted the parliamentary speaker as
telling Chung.
	   The speaker hoped that the venture would help promote ``national
reconciliation, unity and reunification'' between the two Koreas,
divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945.
	   Hyundai officials said the exact date of the first tour will be
decided when Chung returns from a four-day visit to the North on
Friday. They hope that the first ship can sail before Nov. 20.
	   The tour is the first major joint venture project between the
two Korean states, which still remain technically at war, with no
peace treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   Hyundai officials said the tour guides, mostly in their 20s and
30s, will stay in North Korea for four days, making a field trip to
the mountain, located close to the Korean border, the world's most
heavily armed.
	   Seoul officials said North Korea can expect to earn up to dlrs
150 million a year from the tours.
	   The sightseeing tours are among several joint venture projects
being pushed by Hyundai in North Korea. Others include offshore oil
exploration, car assembly and a ship repair yard.
	   The Hyundai ventures have the blessings of the Seoul government,
which is actively pushing non-governmental exchanges with North
Korea under its ``sunshine policy'' aimed at opening up the North's
closed society.
	   As part of his efforts to do business in the North, the Hyundai
chief has donated 1,001 cattle and 20 Hyundai cars to the
impoverished nation.
	   Hyundai plans to set up a permanent office in Pyongyang, the
North's capital, to support its ventures.

Report: Brian Laudrup to quit Chelsea for FC Copenhagen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Chelsea's Danish striker Brian
Laudrup is set to leave the English Premier League team to join Cup
Winners Cup rival FC Copenhagen, Danish news media said Thursday.
	   According to the B.T. newspaper, FC Copenhagen manager Flemming
Oestergaard had ``a super secret meeting'' Tuesday with Chelsea
director Colin Hutchinson in London.
	   Agreement was reached on Laudrup's departure but the move was
not yet official, the TV2 channel said.
	   Laudrup, who has expressed frustration with his role at Chelsea,
wants to return to Denmark mainly because his two children don't
feel comfortable in London, TV2 said.
	   FC Copenhagen declined comment, while Chelsea officials did not
confirm the reports.
	   ``I don't know anything about it, so I can't comment,'' Chelsea
chairman Ken Bates said.
	   ``It's news to me,'' said assistant manager Graham Rix.
	   Coincidentally, the two clubs are due to meet next Wednesday in
Copenhagen in the second round, second leg of the Cup Winners Cup.
Chelsea is the reigning Cup Winners Cup champion.
	   The Daily Mail quoted unidentified Danish sources as saying
Laudrup had been offered a three-year playing contract at
Copenhagen, plus a further seven years as general manager of the
club where his father is in charge of merchandising.
	   Laudrup has criticized Chelsea player-manager Gianluca Vialli's
rotation system, in which he has often found himself relegated to
the bench. Chelsea's other strikers are Vialli, Gianfranco Zola and
Norway's Tor Andre Flo.
	   Laudrup did not play in Chelsea's 4-1 League Cup win Wednesday
night over Premier League leader Aston Villa.
	   Laudrup, who played for the Danish team which stunned the soccer
world by winning the 1992 European Championship, quit international
soccer after Denmark was ousted by Brazil in the World Cup
quarterfinals this summer.
	   Laudrup began his professional career with Danish club Broendby
and moved on to Germany where he played for Bayer 05 Uerdingen and
FC Bayern Munchen. He later played for Italian powerhouses
Fiorentina and Milan before joining the former Scottish champions
of Glasgow Rangers.
	   Laudrup joined the Danish side in 1987 and scored 21 goals in 82
matches.
	   His elder brother, Michael Laudrup, retired after the World Cup
following a standout 17-year career.

England makes winning start to tour

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with England winning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Former captain Mike Atherton scored 88
as England scraped home for a winning start to its Ashes cricket
tour of Australia on Thursday.
	   England scored a far from convincing one-run victory after the
opposing Australian Cricket Board XI was dismissed from the final
ball of the match.
	   Against an attack featuring former Australian test players
Dennis Lillee and Bruce Reid, England made 297 for five off 50
overs at the Lilac Hill ground.
	   ACB XI tailender Jo Angel was run out off the final ball as he
sought the tying run.
	   A crowd of about 10,000 turned out for England's first game of a
five-test tour.
	   Atherton survived a dropped catch while 15 and scored his runs
off 108 balls, hitting 13 fours. Captain Alec Stewart was also in
good form on the ground where he spent several seasons playing
grade cricket and made 74.
	   Lillee, the world's premier paceman during the 1970s and early
80s, finished his six overs with 0-22.
	   The ACB XI was ahead of the required run rate early thanks to a
dazzling knock from opener Ryan Campbell, who hit 74 off 60 balls
including three sixes and eight fours.
	   His opening partner Michael Hussey (32), test hopeful Matthew
Elliott (39) and ACB skipper Simon Katich (27) all failed to make
the most of promising starts.
	   England newcomer Alex Tudor claimed two wickets and bowled with
plenty of fire.
	   England plays Western Australia in a four-day match starting at
the WACA Ground on Saturday.
	   The opening test will be in Brisbane on Nov. 20.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A smile will get you a smile. But if
you're a Bulgarian waiter or chambermaid, a frown will get you a
fine.
	   To combat the surly image of the country's tourism industry, the
Bulgarian hotel and restaurant association announced Thursday that
it will fine surly waiters and chambermaids 300,000 (dlrs 180).
	   The average monthly salary in Bulgaria is the equivalent of
about dlrs 100.
	   Management better clean up its act too.
	   The chairman of the Union of Hotel and Restaurant Owners, Blagoi
Ragin, said hotel and restaurant owners who ``spoil the image of
private tourist business'' will lose their licenses.
	   Bulgaria, once a favorite vacation destination in the former
Soviet bloc, is trying to regain its position in the international
tourism market which it lost during years of economic decline after
the fall of communism in 1989.
	   More than half of vacation facilities are already in private
hands and the government expects to complete privatization by the
end of next year.
	   Strong competition from neighboring Turkey and Greece has forced
Bulgarian businessmen to try to improve the quality of service,
which was low under state management.
	   So far this year, Bulgaria, with a population of 8.2 million,
has hosted 1.9 million foreign tourists, an increase of about 2
percent from the same period last year.
	   Foreign vacationers are mainly from Germany, Russia and Britain.
	   The Balkan country offers a Black Sea coast and mountains for
skiing, hiking and hunting. Bulgaria has the third richest
archaeological heritage in Europe after Italy and Greece and is
reputed for its wines and exotic cuisine.

Woman's limbs found in garbage bag
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Workers sorting out refuse in a landfill
found a woman's severed limbs _ two arms and a leg _ in a garbage
bag, the Gulf Daily News newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The discovery set off a search by police for other body parts in
the Askar landfill, some 30 kilometers (19 miles) southeast of the
capital Manama, the English-language newspaper said. The garbage
bag containing the limbs was found Tuesday.
	   ``The features of the limbs and the leg point to the fact that
they were of a young woman,'' the newspaper said, quoting
unidentified sources.
	   Inside the bag, the arms were wrapped in a blanket while the
leg, severed just below the pelvis, was wrapped in an undergarment,
the newspaper said. A gold chain and bits of grass were also found
in the bag.
	   Garbage from all over Bahrain is dumped in the landfill area in
Askar.

Philippine stock index surges 4.2 percent to 3-month high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose sharply
Thursday as a stable peso encouraged investors to continue a buying
streak, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index jumped 66.73
points, or 4.2 percent, to 1,668.96, its highest level in three
months. On Wednesday it had climbed 9.73 points, or 0.6 percent.
	   Thursday's rally brought the index's total gain to 201.27
points, or 14 percent, since Oct. 21.
	   The peso edged slightly lower against the U.S. dollar, breaking
a six-day run of gains on profit taking and position squaring ahead
of a long weekend, dealers said.
	   Traders admitted they were caught off guard by the way the stock
market sustained its gains.
	   ``The only fundamental reason we see supporting the market is
the stable peso,'' said Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales
of Abacus Securities Corp.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone, the day's most active stock,
closed 30 pesos, or 3.1 percent, higher at 985 pesos on continuing
rumors of a takeover.
	   Siao said investors are expected to continue to brave the market
for as long as the peso remains stable. ``As we see the peso
appreciating against the dollar in the coming sessions, confidence
of buyers in the stock market won't go down,'' he said.
	   The gains posted by the market since last week have also
bolstered investor confidence in Manila shares, he said.
	   ``Investors have been encouraged by the profits they have
realized in the past sessions and it seems like they intend to go
after more profits,'' he said.
	   Gainers trounced decliners 116 to 16, while 22 issues were
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 40.838 pesos for the
day, up from 40.790 pesos Wednesday. It reached a day's high of
40.950 pesos and closed at 40.790 pesos.
	   Despite its slight decline, the peso was still trading around
four-month highs, buoyed by foreign currency inflows into the stock
market and remittances from overseas Filipino workers.
	   Dealers said the stable regional currency situation is also
underpinning the peso.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said the peso's failure to breach
40.75 pesos to the dollar triggered some profit taking, with the
Philippine currency likely to weaken Friday as the market goes into
a long weekend. Next Monday is a public holiday for All Saints'
Day.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Handing the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal its third conviction, a Bosnian Serb pleaded guilty
Thursday to 12 murders.
	   Goran Jelisic, 30, faces a maximum life prison term. Because he
pleaded innocent to a genocide charge, he still faces trial before
the U.N. court. Presiding Judge Claude Jorda said Jelisic will be
officially convicted of the 12 murders in that trial.
	   Jelisic, who called himself ``The Serb Adolf'' in reference to
Adolf Hitler, said he admitted to the May 1992 murders of Muslims
and Croats to ``cleanse his soul.''
	   ``It was my good will that I admitted the crime and cleanse my
soul,'' he calmly told the three-judge panel. ``There is no reason
for me to keep it within myself.''
	   During the 40-minute hearing, Jelisic pleaded guilty to a total
of 31 charges covering the murders, three beatings and the plunder
of property in a new indictment that contained 20 fewer charges
than the original.
	   Although prosecutors named 14 victims, the charges in the
indictment say he murdered 12 people during a two-week killing
spree. At an earlier hearing, prosecutors said they would drop some
charges to speed up Jelisic's trial.
	   At his first arraignment in January, Jelisic called the
allegations ``all lies and fabrications.''
	   Jelisic admitted systematically shooting Muslims and Croats to
death at the Luka camp in northern Bosnia in 1992, then ordering
fellow inmates to collect the bodies.
	   He is the third war criminal convicted by the U.N. court.
	   In 1997, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic was sentenced to 20 years for
killing and torturing Muslims and Croats in 1992. Last year,
Bosnian Croat Drazen Erdemovic was given a five-year sentence for
taking part in a Bosnian Serb Army mass execution of Muslims
following the fall of Srebrenica in 1995.
	   No date was immediately set for Jelisic's genocide trial, when
prosecutors will have to prove he intended to wipe out an entire
section of an ethnic group.
	   Jelisic's victims included a woman and an elderly man, according
to the indictment that also said Jelisic ``killed countless
detainees, whose identities are unknown.''
	   Jelisic used to boast to inmates about how many Muslims he
killed. Most of his victims were shot at close range while others
were beaten to death.
	   Hundreds of Muslim and Croats were detained at Luka, a former
port complex on the banks of the Sava River, after being forced
from their homes by rebel Serbs.
	   According to Jelisic's indictment, prisoners were sometimes
ordered to kneel with their heads over a duct that drained into the
river. Jelisic and other camp guards would shoot them in the back
of the head. The bodies were later dumped in a mass grave.
	   The war crimes tribunal was set up by the U.N. Security Council
in 1993 to punish those responsible for atrocities in the wars that
raged in the former Yugoslavia after its split.

	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission called on the now-ruling
African National Congress and its allies to apologize for torturing
and killing enemies in exile. It appealed to whites to make
gestures of reconciliation, but without giving specifics.
	   The report came down hard on P.W. Botha, the last hardline
apartheid president, saying he ``contributed to and facilitated a
climate in which ... gross violations of human rights could and did
occur and as such is accountable for such violations.''
	   But the five-volume, 3,500-page document did not recommend
individual prosecutions.
	   The release was a major event in South Africa's efforts to deal
with its violent past. It culminated more than two years of
hearings of apartheid's victims and perpeptrators.
	   The commission was established to lay bare the record of 34
years of abuses as a necessary step before the country's races
could live together in harmony.

	   As expected, it found the main culprits in violating human
rights were the former state and its security forces. The
commissioners implicated white governments in the killings,
beatings and torture of political opponents inside and outside the
country.
	   Without naming names, the report said the nation's highest
officials meant to kill black activists when they told subordinates
to ``neutralize'' or ``eliminate'' the opposition. Top ministers
have always denied this, saying they meant arrest or detain.
	   The commission said it ``cannot accept'' that the officials did
not know such commands equaled death sentences.
	   The apartheid system of racial separation was a crime against
humanity, it said.
	   Release of the report to journalists was delayed by several
hours when the ANC unsuccessfully sought to block the court's
release in court. The party was angry about harsh findings against
it.

	   ANC security officals ``routinely used torture'' against
suspected spies and dissidents, the report said. The organization
planted land mines that killed farm laborers and their families and
killed innocent civilians in bomb blasts, it said.
	   It pointed out that the ANC itself provided much of the
information. The party has always argued that it was fighting a
just war against a towering evil -- apartheid -- and that it was
wrong to equate its actions with that of the white security forces.
	   But the commissioners, in effect, said the end did not justify
the means, and that the ANC and other liberation movements were
``morally and politically accountable'' for gross violations of
human rights.
	   Specifically condemned was Winnie Madzikela-Mandela, President
Nelson Mandela's former wife. The report found she had known about
and possibly participated in the killing and torture of suspected
dissidents by her gang of personal bodyguards, known as the Mandela
United Football Club.
	   The commission was established in 1995, a year after all-race
elections ended apartheid. It has the power to grant amnesty to
those who fully detail the truth and provide a political motive.
	   The commission will continue to consider amnesty applications
into next year, and Parliament must still decide on a final plan to
pay reparations to victims of abuses.
	   Most of the report is taken up by accounts of individual cases
of suffering, lengthy discussions of the roles of the media,
religion, business and the legal community in white-ruled South
Africa and a historical review of apartheid and the struggle
against it.

Primakov: Russian government wants more control over economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government has ``resolutely opted'' to
take more control over the economy to pull it out of its worst
crisis since the Soviet collapse, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Thursday.
	   Primakov was commenting on the government's long-awaited plan
for coping with the crisis, which was presented to the
International Monetary Fund on Wednesday.
	   The government hoped the plan would persuade the IMF to release
another installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan frozen after the
Russian economy fell apart in mid-August.
	   The IMF said it wanted to study the plan, the Russian media
reported. Visiting IMF officials were scheduled to leave Moscow on
Thursday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``They realized that the situation in Russia is very difficult,
but not hopeless,'' Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin told the
Interfax news agency.
	   The plan calls for tighter currency controls, price controls on
medicines and some basic foods, a food reserve to help the country
through the winter and indexing wages and pensions to compensate
Russians for rising inflation.
	   It tackles the tax system, lowering some income, property and
profit tax rates but tightening the rules in hopes of making more
people pay. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has
left it consistently short on cash and helped contribute to the
current crisis.
	   Primakov said Thursday the government also wanted to restore
``order and discipline'' in contracts, an apparent reference to
loopholes in export-import regulations that allows money to be
illegally sent abroad. Russian companies are believed to have
stashed billions of dollars overseas.
	   ``The state must (also) determine the parameters and trends in
industrial restructuring,'' Primakov said in the southern Russian
city of Vladikavkaz, where he was holding talks with leaders of
restive regions in the Caucasus Mountains.
	   He did not elaborate, but was presumably referring to a renewed
emphasis on Russia's manufacturing sector, particularly the huge
military-industrial complex. Western analysts have long urged many
of those companies be closed or converted to other uses because,
while they employ many people, there is no market for their goods
and they are unprofitable.
	   Vyugin, the deputy finance minister, said the main emphasis of
the talks with the IMF was on the budget for the last three months
of this year and for 1999.
	   ``The IMF insists that the budget for the fourth quarter be made
very rigorous,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko reiterated
his opposition to any limits on the circulation of U.S. dollars and
other foreign currencies in Russia. Russian media had previously
reported that was to have been part of the plan to cope with the
crisis, on the grounds that it would strengthen the ruble.
	   ``The dollar must not be banned,'' Gerashchenko said. ``It's
impossible.''

Swissair parent announces stake in Italian charter firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair parent SAirGroup said
Thursday it is acquiring a 45 percent holding in Italian charter
airline Air Europe.
	   The two airlines will collaborate in long-haul holiday flights,
expand international lines, and build a domestic network in Italy,
the Swiss company said in a statement.
	   The group, which already has a 34 percent stake in Italian
short-haul charter airline Volare, ``hopes to strengthen its
presence in the key Italian market.'' Terms of the transaction
weren't disclosed.
	   The majority of shares in Air Europe, based at Milan's Malpensa
airport, will remain with the Italian firm's top management.
	   Air Europe, founded in 1989, has 500 employees and operates a
fleet of seven Boeing 767 jetliners. It plans to strengthen its
long-haul operations next year by putting into service two new
Boeing 777s, the statement said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Russian oil tankers collided early Thursday in
bad weather in the Gulf of Finland, but no oil was spilled, Russian
news agencies reported.
	   A big wave knocked one of the anchored tankers into another, the
head of the naval department of the Transportation Ministry, Sergei
Palekhov, told Interfax. Both tankers were filled with heavy oil,
he said.
	   The collision left holes in both tankers above the water line,
but no oil was spilled and no one was injured, the St. Petersburg

Hamas claims responsibility for car bomb explosion in Gaza

<TEXT>
	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant on
Thursday drove an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep
escorting a bus with 40 elementary school students, killing himself
and an Israeli soldier.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
suicide attack that also wounded three Israelis. The children,
ranging in age from six to 14, were unharmed.
	   Israel warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that he would
have to take tough steps against the militants if he wanted the new
land-for-security agreement to proceed as scheduled. Arafat
promised to track down those behind the bombing.
	   The 12-week West Bank troop pullback is to begin Monday, and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense pressure
from Israeli hard-liners to call off the deal.
	   The terror attack, the second this week, makes it increasingly
difficult for Netanyahu to fend off hard-line criticism. Even
before the bombing, Netanyahu had accused the Palestinians of not
living up to their security pledges, raising U.S. concerns that
implementation of the deal could be delayed.
	   Thursday's explosion went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) at
the Gush Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time,
the Israeli school bus convoy guarded by two jeeps was passing by.
	   ``I saw one Israeli jeep blow up and burn completely,'' said
Palestinian witness Jaber Yamawi. ``I saw them take out two
soldiers in ambulances.''
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb was so powerful that the jeep flipped over on its side.
The jeep and the bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in the
nearby town of Khan Yunis, were scorched and mangled.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler who prepares bodies for
burials, said the jeep was still burning an hour after the
explosion. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered all over. There is
oil, gas, blood. Things we see too often lately,'' Kirshenzach told
Israel radio.
	   Pieces of black debris were scattered over a 50-yard (meter)
radius. A black, scorched shoe lay in the middle of the road.
	   The armored school bus was damaged, but the children were not
hurt. After the attack, the children were taken to their school in
the Gush Katif bloc of Jewish settlements rather than being
returned home to the nearby Kfar Darom settlement.
	   In school, the children talked to teachers and counselors about
their experience. The children spoke of the big boom and flames and
many asked about their friends on a second bus, school officials
said.
	   In a call to Israel radio, a man who said he spoke for Hamas
read a claim of responsibility. ``It's a revolution until
victory,'' the caller said, suggesting the attacks would continue.
	   The spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was evasive
when asked whether Hamas was responsible. Yassin said the group
wanted to avoid Palestinian civil war and would not react violently
to a possible crackdown by the Palestinian Authority. Hamas opposes
the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
	   In a first response, the Israeli army sealed the Gaza Strip,
barring Palestinians from entering and leaving.
	   Arafat insisted that despite the attack, Israel stick to its
side of the peace agreement and withdraw from land and release
Palestinian prisoners. He said the Palestinian Authority would
track down those involved in plotting the attack and ``try them for
deliberately harming the Palestinians' national interests.''
	   Samia, the Israeli commander, said the identity of the suicide
bomber was known and that he was a resident of the nearby
Palestinian town of Khan Yunis.
	   Palestinian officials, however, said they only had the name of
the car's owner, a man from Khan Yunis.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Israel would
watch the Palestinian Authority's response closely.
	   ``The basis for progress in the (peace) process depends first
and foremost on intensive action against terrorism,'' Mordechai
said. ``If this is done, we will make progress.''
	   Implementation of the new peace agreement is to begin Monday.
Under the accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey and four Caspian states signed a
declaration Thursday in support of an oil pipeline crossing through
Turkey as the main export route to carry oil from Caspian's rich
oil fields.
	   The declaration was a triumph for Turkey, which got most of the
countries involved in the project _ apart from Russia and
Turkmenistan _ to declare their support for a pipeline running from
the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan via Georgia.
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson witnessed the signing
ceremony in a show of Washington's commitment to the project.
	   The declaration was signed by the presidents of Turkey,
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan. Turkmen President
Saparmurad Turkmenbasi refused to sign the declaration but gave no
reason.
	   Also Thursday, Turkey and Turkmenistan signed an agreement to
build a pipeline for the export of Turkmen natural gas across the
Caspian sea to Turkey.
	   Details of this agreement were not immediately available, but
under a preliminary agreement reached earlier this month Turkey
agreed to buy and transport up to 16 billion cubic meters (560
billion cubic feet) of Turkmen gas each year.
	   ``Now the issue is not whether Baku-Ceyhan is going to happen,
because it is going to happen. The issue is how,'' Richardson told
reporters following the signing ceremony.

China accuses U.S. Congress of meddling, undermining ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Beijing accused the U.S. Congress Thursday of
meddling in China's affairs and obstructing economic, trade and
other contacts between the two countries.
	   In a statement, China's Foreign Ministry said two budget acts
passed recently by Congress included ``anti-China'' clauses that
``seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.''
	   Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang, who read the statement, did
not provide specifics about the funding packages. But he accused
Congress of supporting Tibetan separatists, of including Taiwan in
a missile defense system and of backing continued arms sales to
Taiwan, an island China regards as a rebel province.
	   In recent years, Congress has approved about dlrs 2 million
annually in funding for Tibetan exiles in India. The United States
and Japan also have agreed to research a regional missile defense
system, a move China also has criticized.
	   Tang stopped short of threatening retaliatory action. But he
said Congress obstructed ``the normal cooperation between China and
the United States in economic, trade and other areas.''
	   ``By passing these acts, the U.S. Congress has gravely violated
the fundamental norms of international relations,'' Tang said at a
twice-weekly briefing for reporters. ``The Chinese side hereby
expresses its strong resentment and firm opposition.''
	   His complaints injected a sour note into what has otherwise been
a more positive Chinese attitude toward the United States following
U.S. President Bill Clinton's nine-day visit to China this summer.
	   Tang called on Clinton's government to ``explicitly oppose
anti-China'' clauses of the funding acts and phase out U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan ``so as not to hinder the improvement of
Sino-American relations.''
	   China and Taiwan have been ruled by separate governments since
the Chinese civil war in 1949. China has largely succeeded in
isolating Taiwan diplomatically and has repeatedly urged Washington
to abide by a commitment to phase out arms sales to the island.
	   Tang said development of U.S.-China ties ``would be impossible
if the principles of mutual respect for each other's sovereignty
and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs are not observed.''

Public schoolteachers strike to demand better pensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ About 4,000 teachers at state-run high
schools began a two-day strike Thursday to protest the government's
failure to meet their demands for improved pensions.
	   The strike by the teachers affected 190 high schools and forced
more than 65,000 students to stay home.
	   The affected students were only a fraction of the total of 1
million students in Lebanon because lower level public schools as
well as private institutions and universities did not join the
strike.
	   The union representing teachers in public secondary schools is
demanding end-of-service compensation to be calculated on the basis
of their last full salaries, as opposed to the 85 percent of the
last income proposed by the government and adopted by Parliament.
	   After nearly four years of wrangling between Parliament and the
government, lawmakers on Wednesday approved a bill for new pay
scales and pensions for civil servants, including those for public
school teachers.
	   Union leader Fuad Saab said Thursday the strike was to protest
the ``unfair legislation.''
	   In earlier statements, the union vowed to escalate the protest
if its demands were not met.
	   The government, strapped by a budget deficit and debt, has
already said it cannot afford to meet the demands.
	   The new law will cost the treasury about 500 billion pounds
(dlrs 330 million) and goes into effect in January, retroactive
from January 1996. It covers 131,000 civil servants, teachers of
state-run schools, university professors, judges and the military.
	   Teachers' pay varies greatly depending on education and
experience. Monthly salaries run from dlrs 250 to dlrs 1,000 in
public schools and from dlrs 550 to dlrs 1,000 in private ones.

Truth panel's findings on top figures and liberation groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-South Africa-Truth Commission &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The Truth and Reconciliation
Commission's final report makes findings on several top figures and
movements from apartheid governments and the black liberation
struggle.
	   _ P.W. Botha. During his rule as president from 1978 to 1989,
Botha presided over an increasingly authoritarian regime where
state-sponsored abuses were common, it said. The commission found
Botha was personally responsible for ordering the bombing of a
Johannesburg building which housed an anti-apartheid group.
	   _ Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Bodyguards for the former wife of
President Nelson Mandela, killed and tortured suspected opponents.
The commission ruled Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela knew of and may have
participated in these actions by the so called Mandela United
Football Club.
	   _ F.W. de Klerk. A last-minute legal challenge by white South
Africa's last president resulted in his findings being blacked out.
The commission initially named him as an ``accessory after the
fact'' for knowing about but not reporting two bombings against
anti-apartheid targets in the late 1980s.
	   _ Steve Biko. The report does not name those who killed the
black consciousness leader in 1977 due to ongoing amnesty
applications by the policemen who interrogated him. However, the
commission did find it was likely he died of injuries sustained
while in custody.
	   _ Inkatha Freedom Party. The report condemns the Zulu
nationalist group, which fought a bloody turf war with the African
National Congress in the late
	   1980s and early 1990s in KwaZulu-Natal province. The party
colluded with apartheid security forces, established hit sqauds and
killed opponents, the report said. The finding could be politically
explosive ahead of next year's general elections.
	   _ Pan Africanist Congress. The report rejected claims from the
radical black party that its policy of killing white farmers was an
act of war. It judged the party's leaderhip to be ``morally and
politically responsible'' for human rights abuses.
	   _ Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB). The extremist white group,
headed by
	   Eugene Terreblanche, was condemned by the report for inciting
followers to randomly attack blacks and a campaign of bombings
ahead of 1994's all race elections. Terreblanche and Gen. Constand
Viljoen, head of the right wing Freedom Front party, are
accountable for human rights abuses, it said. Viljoen's party, the
fourth largest in parliament, boycotted the report's handover
ceremony.

watch, editing to tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The unusual case of a Chinese airline
captain who hijacked his own flight to Taiwan had officials on both
sides grappling Thursday with the touchy question of how they
should deal with such cross-border crimes.
	   Taiwanese leaders called for a fresh dialogue, while China
demanded the return of renegade Air China pilot Yuan Bin, saying
that would help deter future hijackings and keep the skies safer
for travelers.
	   Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of Taiwan's government Mainland
Affairs Council, said Wednesday's sensational diversion of Air
China flight CA905 highlights an urgent need to restart talks
between the rival sides on safety concerns.
	   ``We should resume the talks and sign an agreement as soon as
possible,'' Sheu told a news conference.
	   But China called for swift action and not words, saying the
Taiwanese should return Yuan to China, where Wednesday's hijacking
took place.
	   ``There have been precedents for the mutual repatriation of
hijackers, which is feasible,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang told reporters in Beijing. ``The Taiwan authorities should
act accordingly and repatriate Yuan Bin and other hijackers from
the mainland at an early date so as to safeguard the safety of air
passengers.''
	   Yuan's flight from Beijing to the southwestern Chinese city of
Kunming ended up instead at Taipei's international airport after
the disgruntled captain changed course to protest pay and working
conditions. The flight had been scheduled to proceed from China to
Yangon, Myanmar.
	   Yuan, 30, was accompanied by his wife, Xu Mei, 27. Both are now
in custody, although Taiwanese authorities have not yet said what
charges might be filed.
	   State radio quoted prosecutor Hsu Pin-wen as saying Yuan was
depressed and refused to eat Thursday after he learned he might be
sent back to China after a trial. Yuan apparently had thought he
could stay in Taiwan after serving a few years in prison, Hsu said.
	   The official Central News Agency reported Yuan also was
depressed because he and his wife were in separate jails. Prison
wardens put Yuan on suicide watch, Hsu said.
	   Taiwanese newspapers said Yuan complained that Air China did not
provide pilots with necessary safety training and that the company
would not give him a large house, while good housing went to people
with better connections.
	   An Air China spokesman in Beijing said Yuan earned enough money
to buy his own car and lived in a spacious three-room apartment.
	   Yuan's gripes that he lacked good prospects with the company
made no sense, said the spokesman, who identified himself only by
the surname Liu.
	   Air China put Yuan in charge of international flights because
bosses trusted him, Liu said.
	   Angelica Cheung, a prominent aviation journalist from Hong Kong,
said Yuan's frustrations are common at the airline, despite
attempts at reform.
	   Pilots' salaries hover around U.S. dlrs 1,000 per month, high
pay by Chinese standards but a pittance compared to what foreign
pilots can earn, she said.
	   And management at Air China, similar to that in most Chinese
state enterprises, can be distant and rigid, with pilots locked
into employment contracts that prevent them from transferring to
jobs at better-paying startup airlines, Cheung said.
	   The case resurrected hijacking as an issue that has been a sore
point between Taiwan and China.
	   Taiwan used to greet hijackers from China almost as heroes,
before cracking down after tense Taiwan-China relations began
thawing in the 1980s.
	   During a string of air piracies in 1993 and 1994, Taiwan
arrested 16 Chinese hijackers and sentenced them to prison for up
to 12 years.
	   Two were paroled and sent back to China last year. But China
refused to tell Taiwan about their fate in the mainland, and Taiwan
then declined to repatriate six others who have since been paroled.
	   Taiwan and China were close to signing an agreement on
repatriating the hijackers in 1995 when China broke off the talks
in anger over a Taiwanese drive to gain international recognition.

Primakov: Russian government wants more control over economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 2 new grafs at end, one of biggest banks losing
license, government reserves up. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government has ``resolutely opted'' to
take more control over the economy to pull it out of its worst
crisis since the Soviet collapse, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Thursday.
	   Primakov was commenting on the government's long-awaited plan
for coping with the crisis, which was presented to the
International Monetary Fund on Wednesday.
	   The government hoped the plan would persuade the IMF to release
another installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan frozen after the
Russian economy fell apart in mid-August.
	   The IMF said it wanted to study the plan, Russian media
reported. Visiting IMF officials were scheduled to leave Moscow on
Thursday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``They realized that the situation in Russia is very difficult,
but not hopeless,'' Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin told the
Interfax news agency.
	   The plan calls for tighter currency controls, price controls on
medicines and some basic foods, a food reserve to help the country
through the winter and indexing wages and pensions to compensate
Russians for rising inflation.
	   It tackles the tax system, lowering some income, property and
profit tax rates but tightening the rules in hopes of making more
people pay. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has
left it consistently short on cash and helped contribute to the
current crisis.
	   Primakov said Thursday the government also wanted to restore
``order and discipline'' in contracts, an apparent reference to
loopholes in export-import regulations that allow money to be
illegally sent abroad. Russian companies are believed to have
stashed billions of dollars overseas.
	   ``The state must (also) determine the parameters and trends in
industrial restructuring,'' Primakov said in the southern Russian
city of Vladikavkaz, where he was holding talks with leaders of
restive regions in the Caucasus Mountains.
	   He did not elaborate, but was presumably referring to a renewed
emphasis on Russia's manufacturing sector, particularly the huge
military-industrial complex. Western analysts have long urged many
of those companies be closed or converted to other uses because,
while they employ many people, there is no market for their goods
and they are unprofitable.
	   Vyugin, the deputy finance minister, said the main emphasis of
the talks with the IMF was on the budget for the last three months
of this year and for 1999.
	   ``The IMF insists that the budget for the fourth quarter be made
very rigorous,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko reiterated
his opposition to any limits on the circulation of U.S. dollars and
other foreign currencies in Russia. Russian media had previously
reported that was to have been part of the plan to cope with the
crisis, on the grounds that it would strengthen the ruble.

Asian markets close mostly higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets closed mostly higher Thursday, as
the big Tokyo exchange snapped a four-day losing streak and
investors in many other markets bought shares despite dismal
corporate earnings forecasts.
	   Japanese blue chips rose on buying by public funds, but worries
over upcoming corporate earnings reports kept trading subdued.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 152.65 points,
or 1.13 percent, closing at 13,668.72. Over the previous four
trading days, the index had fallen a total of 779.49 points.
	   ``It looks as if there has been a fresh injection of public
funds into the market,'' said Akira Nakamura, manager at Chuo
Securities in Tokyo.
	   But overall sentiment remained poor amid worries about corporate
earnings and the direction of emerging markets, including Brazil
and Russia.
	   Sony Corp., considered one of Japan's strongest companies,
lowered its group earnings forecast Wednesday for the fiscal year
ending next March.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar bought 116.36 yen, down 1.52 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
overnight of 117.82 yen.
	   In Hong Kong, share prices were little changed Thursday, after
futures traders pushed the blue chip index back and forth in
moderate trading.
	   The Hang Seng Index fell 4.4 points, or 0.04 percent, closing at
9,931.46. On Tuesday, the index had risen 148.14 points, or 1.5
percent, to 9,927.05, its highest close since May 12. Hong Kong
markets had been closed Wednesday for a public holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Prices ended higher as traders continued to buy bank
and finance stocks speculatively. The SET index rose 14.62 points,
or 4.4 percent, closing at 345.07.
	   TAIPEI: Shares were buoyed by purchases of index-related stocks,
following gains in the Nasdaq Composite Index overnight in the
United States. The Weighted Price Index rose 54.80 points, or 0.78
percent, to 7,016.89.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices continued their downward drift in
more directionless trading. The Composite Index fell 4.14 points,
or 1 percent, to 406.35.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed slightly higher after relinquishing
early gains. The STI climbed 5.43 points, or 0.46 percent, closing
at 1,185.65.
	   SYDNEY: Shares gained slightly in a reasonably slow session. The
All Ordinaries index was up 2.1 points, or 0.08 percent, at
2,617.3.
	   SEOUL: Shares surged on the yen's sharp rise versus the U.S.
dollar. The KOSPI was up 6.39 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at
370.30.
	   JAKARTA: Shares closed lower amid worries over the domestic
political situation. The JSX Index closed down 2.878 points, or
0.93 percent, at 309.412.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares finished lower as investors cashed in on
recent gains. The NZSE-40 capital index was down 6.66 points, or
0.35 percent, closing at 1,864.60.
	   MANILA: Stocks rose sharply as a stable peso encouraged
investors to continue a buying spree. The PSE Index jumped 66.73
points, or 4.2 percent, to 1,668.96, its highest level in three
months.

Cambodian opposition party sets conditions for negotiations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's main opposition party
said Thursday it needed written guarantees for the safety and free
movement of all opposition politicians before it would rejoin
stalled talks to form a new government.
	   The statement from Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party
followed appeals from Hun Sen's ruling party and King Norodom
Sihanouk for negotiations to resume inside Cambodia.
	   Ranariddh and his political ally Sam Rainsy led a slow exodus of
opposition lawmakers to Bangkok after the ceremonial opening of
parliament in September.
	   Citing threats of arrest from Hun Sen, they have claimed it is
impossible for the opposition to negotiate freely inside Cambodia.
	   ``It is fundamental that the Phnom Penh authorities give a
written guarantee that all opposition MPs and party officials will
be free to undertake their legitimate political activities and able
to move in, out and within the country without hindrance,''
FUNCINPEC stated.
	   The party added that after the guarantees are endorsed by the
king, it would submit an already prepared document for discussion,
calling for a list of reforms to be implemented by the next
government.
	   ``Any coalition government that has not reached agreement on
these substantive issues prior to its formation is bound to be
unrepresentative of the Cambodian people's will and, thus,
short-lived,'' the party said.
	   Ruling party president Chea Sim has offered security guarantees
to the opposition and on Wednesday announced his party was ready to
give an ``appropriate concession'' to the opposition if talks
resumed.
	   The ruling party narrowly won a majority in July's parliamentary
elections, but the opposition, claiming widespread fraud and
intimidation, has denied it the two-thirds vote in parliament
necessary to approve a new government.
	   Hun Sen threatened the opposition with arrest after two alleged
attempts on his life. Travel restrictions were imposed on
opposition members, but they were lifted after parliament opened.
	   However, at least one outspoken opposition politician, the
former parliament's human rights commission chairman Kem Sokha, has
been unable to leave the country as a Phnom Penh court investigates
his role in anti-government demonstrations that followed the
election.
	   Kem Sokha has since gone into hiding.

Britain's poet laureate Ted Hughes dies after battle with cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's poet laureate Ted Hughes, whose stormy
marriage to American poet Sylvia Plath dogged his reputation after
her suicide, has died, his publisher said Thursday. He was 68.
	   Hughes died Wednesday at his home in Devon after a 18-month
battle with cancer, which he had kept secret, said Matthew Evans,
chairman of the publisher Faber and Faber.
	   ``The loss to his family is inestimable,'' Evans said.
	   A collection of poems published by Hughes this year called
``Birthday Letters'' shed new light on his difficult marriage to
Plath, brought him sympathy and won him rave reviews.
	   The reclusive Hughes chose not to defend himself against a
hailstorm of abuse from Plath's admirers. He made few public
appearances and, until the publication of the 88 poems in
``Birthday Letters,'' no pronouncements on his six-year marriage to
Plath.
	   The troubled Plath gassed herself in her oven on Feb. 11, 1963,
months after Hughes left her for another woman.
	   Some Plath fans called him a murderer and his name has been
repeatedly hacked off of her gravestone in Yorkshire, northern
England.
	   Hughes, who has been poet laureate since 1984, refused to be
interviewed about the poems, which span 25 years from the late
1960s.
	   Hughes and Plath married in 1956 after meeting at Cambridge,
where she was studying on a Fulbright Scholarship. They went to the
United States in 1957, where she taught at Smith College and he
taught at the University of Massachusetts. They returned to England
in 1959, continued to write and publish poetry, and had two
children.
	   Plath had had a history of mental problems and had first
attempted suicide three years before meeting Hughes.
	   Poet Andrew Motion, writing in The Times of London, said reading
``Birthday Letters'' was ``like being hit by a thunderbolt.''
	   ``Anyone who thought Hughes's reticence was proof of his hard
heart will immediately see how stony they have been themselves,''
Motion wrote.
	   ``Hughes is one of the most important poets of the century, and
this is his greatest book. It closes in a heart of darkness, a
black hole of grief and regret'' we stare into it feeling changed
and enriched.''
	   In January, Hughes won the Whitbread Book of the Year award for
``Tales of Ovid,'' his reworking of Ovid's ``Metamorphosis,'' which
the judges described as a work of ``greatness and sublimity.''

Spanish judge to persist with Pinochet case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish judge who issued the order for
Pinochet's arrest will continue to seek his extradition if the
judge gets the backing of National Court colleagues considering the
issue Thursday.
	   News reports said Judge Baltasar Garzon had no intention of
dropping his case against Pinochet despite England's High Court
ruling that the former Chilean leader was entitled to immunity from
prosecution.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if he gets the backing of
fellow judges on Spain's National Court, he will maintain his
petition to interrogate Pinochet and file an extradition demand as
long as he is detained in London, the daily newspaper El Pais
reported.
	   A panel of magistrates from the National Court meets Thursday to
consider whether crimes such as genocide and terrorism committed
outside of Spain fall under the jurisdiction of its magistrates. A
decision is expected Friday.
	   Garzon and another National Court judge have been gathering
evidence for two years to support charges of murder, torture and
the disappearance of thousands during the military juntas that
ruled Chile and Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s. The two judges
believe that Spanish law allows such crimes to be tried in Spain.
	   The order for Pinochet's arrest Oct. 16 was part of these probes
and cited charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   The judges will act on a petition from National Court
prosecutors who insist that Garzon does not have the authority to
undertake the investigation.
	   If the panel agrees with the prosecutors, Garzon almost
certainly would have no choice but to abandon the investigations
and the probe against Pinochet, lawyers close to the case have
said.
	   The British court decision was heavily criticized by many
Spanish newspapers.
	   ``With such an interpretation, the allies would not have been
able to try Hitler if he had been caught alive,'' El Pais said in
an editorial. ``If he had known in time, Pol Pot might have sought
refuge in London.''
	   The daily El Mundo said that if ``if this decision is not
rejected by the House of Lords, then anyone who becomes a head of
state, no matter how, will enjoy lifelong immunity in Britain even
if he has robbed, tortured or killed on a wholesale scale.''

Report: Brian Laudrup to quit Chelsea for FC Copenhagen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 5th graf with Chelsea calling news conference

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Chelsea's Danish striker Brian
Laudrup is set to leave the English Premier League team to join Cup
Winners Cup rival FC Copenhagen, Danish news media said Thursday.
	   According to the B.T. newspaper, FC Copenhagen manager Flemming
Oestergaard had ``a super secret meeting'' Tuesday with Chelsea
director Colin Hutchinson in London.
	   Agreement was reached on Laudrup's departure but the move was
not yet official, the TV2 channel said.
	   Laudrup, who has expressed frustration with his role at Chelsea,
wants to return to Denmark mainly because his two children don't
feel comfortable in London, TV2 said.
	   FC Copenhagen declined comment, while Chelsea called a news
conference later Thursday to address the Laudrup situation.

Costs of debt are hindrance to basic services
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The costs of servicing foreign debt are a
major impediment to developing countries spending more on basic
social services, a U.N.-sponsored conference said Thursday.
	   Wrapping up a three-day meeting on the ``20/20 Initiative,''
officials from 72 countries and international donor agencies said
they have renewed their commitments to the program despite the
fallout from the global economic crisis.
	   The initiative says governments should allocate 20 percent of
their budgets _ and donors 20 percent of their aid _ to ensure
basic education, primary health care, reproductive health and
population programs, nutrition programs and safe water and
sanitation.
	   ``Governments must not only devote financial resources, but must
also demonstrate a strong political commitment to ensuring the
quality, equity and efficiency with which services are provided,''
said a news release issued by the conference.
	   ``However, it is clear that many countries are unlikely to reach
the agreed goals for social development by the end of the first
decade of the 21st century.''
	   A study of 30 countries showed that governments are allocating
an average of 12 to 14 percent of their budgets for basic social
services. A major problem is the cost of debt.
	   ``Statistics show that in some countries, the amount of debt
servicing is five to 10 times higher that the amount spent on basic
social services,'' Koos Richelle, a Dutch foreign affairs official,
told a news conference.
	   How to deal with the situation was one of the final sticking
points in a consensus agreement that was to be issued Friday.
Another was how to ensure that women and children, who often have
less access to services than men, get their fair share.
	   ``Let us not forget that they (developing countries) have
internal debts ... to women and children,'' said Rima Saleh, the
Hanoi representative of UNICEF. ``Therefore, political will is very
important. Let us ensure that the unreached are reached.''
	   The meeting was a follow-up to a conference in Norway 2 1/2
years ago that forged the initiative. Delegates heard that progress
in reaching the goals has been slow, complicated by the economic
crisis that began in Southeast Asia and a rash of natural
disasters.
	   The cost of achieving universal coverage of basic social
services is estimated at around dlrs 206 billion to dlrs 216
billion per year _ less than 1 percent of global economic output
and less than half the amount spent on tobacco. Actual spending is
only about dlrs 136 billion.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ In a major milestone on South
Africa's road to reconciliation, a human rights panel Thursday
condemned the apartheid state for a range of atrocities but also
apportioned blame to the black movements fighting for freedom.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission called on the now-ruling
African National Congress and its allies to apologize for torturing
and killing enemies in exile. It appealed to whites to make
gestures of reconciliation, but without giving specifics.
	   The report came down hard on P.W. Botha, the last hardline
apartheid president, saying he ``contributed to and facilitated a
climate in which ... gross violations of human rights could and did
occur and as such is accountable for such violations.''
	   The five-volume, 3,500-page document did not recommend
individual prosecutions.
	   But in accepting the report at a ceremony on Thursday, President
Nelson Mandela said the report would not produce instant
reconciliation with the troubled past.
	   ``Its release is bound to reawaken many of the difficult and
troubling emotions that the hearings themselves brought,'' Mandela
said.
	   The release was a major event in South Africa's efforts to deal
with its violent past. It culminated more than two years of
hearings of apartheid's victims and perpetrators.
	   ``Accept this report as an indispensible way to healing,'' said
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission chairman, before handing
the report to Mandela. ``Let the waters of healing flow from
Pretoria today.''
	   Tutu said the report should ``cleanse'' South Africans and
``bring unity and reconciliation.''
	   The commission was established to lay bare the record of 34
years of abuses as a necessary step before the country's races
could live together in harmony.
	   As expected, it found the main culprits in violating human
rights were the former state and its security forces. The
commissioners implicated white governments in the killings,
beatings and torture of political opponents inside and outside the
country.
	   Without naming names, the report said the nation's highest
officials meant to kill black activists when they told subordinates
to ``neutralize'' or ``eliminate'' the opposition. Top ministers
have always denied this, saying they meant arrest or detain.
	   The commission said it ``cannot accept'' that the officials did
not know such commands equaled death sentences.
	   The apartheid system of racial separation was a crime against
humanity, it said.
	   Release of the report to journalists was delayed by several
hours when the ANC unsuccessfully sought to have a court block
release of the report.
	   The legal maneuvering outraged Tutu, who won the Nobe Peace
Prize in 1984 for his anti-apartheid struggle.
	   ``I have struggled against a tyranny. I didn't to that in order
to substitute it with another,'' he told journalists. ``If there is
a tyranny, an abusive power ... I will oppose it with ev3ery fiber
of my being.''
	   ANC officials were angry about harsh findings in the report that
said party security officials ``routinely used torture'' against
suspected spies and dissidents, the report said. The organization
planted land mines that killed farm laborers and their families and
killed innocent civilians in bomb blasts, it said.
	   It pointed out that the ANC itself provided much of the
information. The party has always argued that it was fighting a
just war against a towering evil -- apartheid -- and that it was
wrong to equate its actions with that of the white security forces.
	   But the commissioners, in effect, said the end did not justify
the means, and that the ANC and other liberation movements were
``morally and politically accountable'' for gross violations of
human rights.
	   Specifically condemned was Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, President
Mandela's former wife. The report found she had known about and
possibly participated in the killing and torture of suspected
dissidents by her gang of personal bodyguards, known as the Mandela
United Football Club.
	   The commission was established in 1995, a year after all-race
elections ended apartheid. It has the power to grant amnesty to
those who fully detail the truth and provide a political motive.
	   The commission will continue to consider amnesty applications
into next year, and Parliament must still decide on a final plan to
pay reparations to victims of abuses.
	   Most of the report is taken up by accounts of individual cases
of suffering, lengthy discussions of the roles of the media,
religion, business and the legal community in white-ruled South
Africa and a historical review of apartheid and the struggle
against it.

Justice chief says final appeal unlikely to save Philippine convict
</HEADLINE>
from execution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Justice officials said Thursday a
final appeal filed by the lawyers of the first man sentenced to die
in the Philippines in two decades is unlikely to save him from
execution.
	   Prison authorities said they are waiting for a lower court to
set the date for the execution by lethal injection of Leo
Echegaray, a poor house painter convicted of repeatedly raping his
10-year-old stepdaughter.
	   Echegaray, 38, is the first of more than 700 death-row inmates
scheduled to die under a law that restored capital punishment in
1994. His impending execution has triggered a debate on the death
penalty that has divided many Filipinos.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the final appeal recently
filed by Echegaray's lawyers would likely be rejected by the
Supreme Court.
	   Lawyer Theodore Te, who represents Echegaray, said in the appeal
that the government has failed to execute him within the time frame
prescribed by law.
	   Under the 1994 law, an execution should be carried out not
earlier than one year or later than 18 months after a death
sentence has been declared final by the Supreme Court.
	   The Supreme Court, which automatically reviews all death
sentences, declared Echegaray's death sentence final on Feb. 27,
1997, thereby setting the date of his execution between February
and August this year.
	   However, the execution was delayed because of several petitions
filed by Echegaray's lawyers at the Supreme Court.
	   Cuevas said Echegaray's petitions forced the court to order a
delay in the execution until it resolved them. A government lawyer
has said the court should reject Echegaray's final appeal because
if it succeeds ``it will be easy for every death convict to
circumvent the death penalty by simply delaying their execution.''
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for crimes such as murder,
kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Proponents say the death penalty would deter crimes because it
would frighten would-be criminals. They said crimes remain rampant
because no one among the death row convicts has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposing the death
penalty say there is no proof of that and the poor are
disadvantaged because they cannot afford good lawyers for their
defense.
	   President Joseph Estrada has rejected an appeal from the bishops
to change his decision not to pardon Echegaray. He said he would
only reconsider if new evidence is produced proving Echegaray is
innocent.

Britain's poet laureate Ted Hughes dies after battle with cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from queen; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British poet laureate Ted Hughes, whose stormy
marriage to American poet Sylvia Plath dogged his reputation after
her suicide, has died, his publisher said Thursday. He was 68.
	   Hughes died Wednesday at his home in Devon after a 18-month
battle with cancer, which he had kept secret, said Matthew Evans,
chairman of the publisher Faber and Faber.
	   ``The loss to his family is inestimable,'' Evans said.
	   A collection of poems published by Hughes this year called
``Birthday Letters'' shed new light on his difficult marriage to
Plath, brought him sympathy and won him rave reviews.
	   The reclusive Hughes chose not to defend himself against a
hailstorm of abuse from Plath's admirers. He made few public
appearances and, until the publication of the 88 poems in
``Birthday Letters,'' no pronouncements on his six-year marriage to
Plath.
	   His last appearance in public was 13 days ago when he accepted
the Order of Merit, a rare honor, from Queen Elizabeth II at
Buckingham Palace.
	   ``The queen was informed this morning of the death of Ted
Hughes,'' a palace statement said. ``She was very saddened and will
be in touch with his family. She was grateful for the opportunity
to recognise his work and achievements, before he died, through the
award of the Order of Merit.''
	   The troubled Plath gassed herself in her oven on Feb. 11, 1963,
months after Hughes left her for another woman.
	   Some Plath fans called Hughes a murderer and his name has been
repeatedly hacked off of her gravestone in Yorkshire, northern
England.
	   Hughes, who has been poet laureate since 1984, refused to be
interviewed about the poems, which span 25 years from the late
1960s.
	   Hughes and Plath married in 1956 after meeting at Cambridge,
where she was studying on a Fulbright Scholarship. They went to the
United States in 1957, where she taught at Smith College and he
taught at the University of Massachusetts. They returned to England
in 1959, continued to write and publish poetry, and had two
children.
	   Plath had had a history of mental problems and had first
attempted suicide three years before meeting Hughes.
	   Poet Andrew Motion, writing in The Times of London, said reading
``Birthday Letters'' was ``like being hit by a thunderbolt.''
	   ``Anyone who thought Hughes's reticence was proof of his hard
heart will immediately see how stony they have been themselves,''
Motion wrote.
	   ``Hughes is one of the most important poets of the century, and
this is his greatest book. It closes in a heart of darkness, a
black hole of grief and regret'' we stare into it feeling changed
and enriched.''
	   In January, Hughes won the Whitbread Book of the Year award for
``Tales of Ovid,'' his reworking of Ovid's ``Metamorphosis,'' which
the judges described as a work of ``greatness and sublimity.''

Primakov: Russian government wants more control over economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 2 new grafs at end, one of biggest banks losing
license, government reserves up. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government has ``resolutely opted'' to
take more control over the economy to pull it out of its worst
crisis since the Soviet collapse, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Thursday.
	   Primakov was commenting on the government's long-awaited plan
for coping with the crisis, which was presented to the
International Monetary Fund on Wednesday.
	   The government hoped the plan would persuade the IMF to release
another installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan frozen after the
Russian economy fell apart in mid-August.
	   The IMF said it wanted to study the plan, Russian media
reported. Visiting IMF officials were scheduled to leave Moscow on
Thursday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``They realized that the situation in Russia is very difficult,
but not hopeless,'' Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin told the
Interfax news agency.
	   The plan calls for tighter currency controls, price controls on
medicines and some basic foods, a food reserve to help the country
through the winter and indexing wages and pensions to compensate
Russians for rising inflation.
	   It tackles the tax system, lowering some income, property and
profit tax rates but tightening the rules in hopes of making more
people pay. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has
left it consistently short on cash and helped contribute to the
current crisis.
	   Primakov said Thursday the government also wanted to restore
``order and discipline'' in contracts, an apparent reference to
loopholes in export-import regulations that allow money to be
illegally sent abroad. Russian companies are believed to have
stashed billions of dollars overseas.
	   ``The state must (also) determine the parameters and trends in
industrial restructuring,'' Primakov said in the southern Russian
city of Vladikavkaz, where he was holding talks with leaders of
restive regions in the Caucasus Mountains.
	   He did not elaborate, but was presumably referring to a renewed
emphasis on Russia's manufacturing sector, particularly the huge
military-industrial complex. Western analysts have long urged many
of those companies be closed or converted to other uses because,
while they employ many people, there is no market for their goods
and they are unprofitable.
	   Vyugin, the deputy finance minister, said the main emphasis of
the talks with the IMF was on the budget for the last three months
of this year and for 1999.
	   ``The IMF insists that the budget for the fourth quarter be made
very rigorous,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko reiterated
his opposition to any limits on the circulation of U.S. dollars and
other foreign currencies in Russia. Russian media had previously
reported that was to have been part of the plan to cope with the
crisis, on the grounds that it would strengthen the ruble.
	   ``The dollar must not be banned,'' Gerashchenko said. ``It's
impossible.''
	   The Central Bank announced Thursday it had revoked the license
of Inkombank, which had been one of the country's biggest retail
banks, because it was practically insolvent.
	   The Central Bank also said that its gold and foreign currency
reserves rose by dlrs 200 million in the fourth week of October to
dlrs 13.3 billion.

Excerpts from Ted Hughes' `Birthday Letters' poems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Obit-Ted Hughes &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Excerpts from Ted Hughes' poetry about his marriage to American
poet Sylvia Plath, who committed suicide in 1963 at age 30. Hughes
died Wednesday at age 68 after an 18-month battle with cancer.
	   ``St. Botolph's.'' (Their first meeting, Cambridge University,
1956.)
	   First sight. First snapshot isolated
	   Unalterable, stilled in the camera's glare.
	   Taller
	   Than you ever were again. Swaying so slender
	   It seemed your long, perfect, American legs
	   Simply went on up. That flaring hand,
	   Those long, balletic, monkey-elegant fingers.
	   And the face _ a tight ball of joy.
	   I see you there, clearer, more real
	   Than in any of the years in its shadow _
	   As if I saw you that once, then never again.
	   ``18 Rugby Street.'' (Plath visits Hughes in London in April
1956.).
	   We walked across south London to Fetter Lane
	   And your hotel. Opposite the entrance
	   On a bombsite becoming a building site
	   We clutched each other giddily
	   For safety and went in a barrel together
	   Over some Niagara. Falling
	   In the roar of soul your scar told me _
	   Like its secret name, or its password _
	   How you had tried to kill yourself. And I heard
	   Without ceasing for a moment to kiss you
	   As if a sober star had whispered it
	   Above the revolving, rumbling city: stay clear.

Bosnian Serb pleads guilty to 12 murders at U.N. tribunal

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb who called himself
``The Serb Adolf'' pleaded guilty Thursday at the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in a two-week
killing spree in 1992.
	   Goran Jelisic, 30, faces a maximum life prison term for the
killings.
	   Because he also pleaded innocent to a genocide charge he will
still stand trial at the U.N. court. Only then will he be
officially convicted of the murders, presiding judge Claude Jorda
said.
	   Jelisic, who called himself ``The Serb Adolf'' in reference to
Adolf Hitler, said he was admitting the May 1992 murders to cleanse
his soul.
	   ``It was my good will that I admitted the crime and cleanse my
soul,'' he calmly told the three-judge panel. ``There is no reason
for me to keep it within myself.''
	   Jelisic, dressed in jeans and a striped sweater, looked calm
during the 40-minute hearing.
	   He looked down at his indictment as he entered guilty pleas to a
total of 31 war crimes and crimes against humanity charges covering
the murders, three beatings and the plunder of property.
	   His attorney Veselin Londrovic told the court, ``Mr. Jelisic
decided to reveal his soul ... to this honorable trial chamber _ to
cleanse his soul and to sincerely repent for what he has done.''
	   Jelisic, a former farm machinery mechanic, was entering pleas to
a new indictment containing 20 fewer charges than the original but
still featuring a chilling list of cold-blooded murders.
	   Although the indictment named 14 victims, the text of the
charges indicate he actually murdered 12 people.
	   At an earlier hearing, prosecutors agreed to drop some charges
to speed up Jelisic's trial.
	   At his first arraignment in January, Jelisic called the
allegations ``all lies and fabrications.''
	   But on Thursday, he admitted systematically shooting Muslims and
Croats to death at the Luka camp in northern Bosnia in 1992, then
ordering fellow inmates to collect the bodies.
	   He will become the third war criminal convicted by the U.N.
court.
	   In 1997, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic was sentenced to 20 years for
killing and torturing Muslims and Croats in 1992 and last year
Bosnian Croat Drazen Erdemovic was given a five-year sentence for
taking part in a Bosnian Serb Army mass execution of Muslims
following the fall of Srebrenica in 1995.
	   No date was immediately set for Jelisic's genocide trial where
prosecutors will have to prove that he intended to wipe out an
entire section of an ethnic group.
	   Jelisic's victims included a woman and an elderly man. The
genocide charge he denied alleges he ``killed countless detainees,
whose identities are unknown.''
	   Jelisic used to boast to inmates about how many Muslims he
killed. He killed most of his victims with close-range gun shots
and beat others to death.
	   Hundreds of Muslim and Croats were detained at Luka, a former
port complex on the banks of the Sava River, after being forced
from their homes by rebel Serbs.
	   According to Jelisic's indictment, prisoners were sometimes
ordered to kneel with their heads over a duct that drained into the
river, where Jelisic and other camp guards would shoot them in the
back of the head.
	   The bodies were later dumped in a mass grave outside Brcko.
	   The war crimes tribunal was set up by the U.N. Security Council
in 1993 to punish those responsible for atrocities in the wars that
raged in the former Yugoslavia after its split.

Cambodian public toilet demolished in deference to royal

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's annual Water Festival
next week will see riverside parks in the capital fill with
celebrants guzzling sugar cane juice, soft drinks and beer to stave
off the heat.
	   But they will have nowhere to turn for relief: the city has
demolished the country's only public toilet.
	   The toilet had been the sole tangible result of a campaign by
outgoing First Prime Minister Ung Huot to improve the image and
hygiene of Phnom Penh. Its destruction coincides with the end of
his brief tenure as strongman Hun Sen's malleable co-prime
minister.
	   Ung Huot, who is also foreign minister, was picked to replace
Prince Norodom Ranariddh after Hun Sen ousted the prince last year
in a violent coup.
	   The dlrs 20,000 toilet facility was constructed in June near the
banks of the Tonle Sap River, and was quickly occupied by several
homeless families.
	   Municipal Cabinet Chief Mann Chhoeun said Ung Huot approved the
toilet's removal last week after whisperings that King Norodom
Sihanouk did not appreciate its close proximity to the Royal
Palace.
	   ``Ung Huot allowed the municipality to do whatever it wants with
the toilet in order not to upset his majesty the king,'' Mann
Chhoeun said. ``We are now replacing it with a garden.''
	   Sihanouk recently returned to the capital for his first stay at
the palace in nine months. The monarch has mostly kept his distance
from a turbulent political crisis in the capital, preferring to
reside at his more modest home in the northwestern town of Siem
Reap.
	   Municipal authorities also moved out of palace view a number of
wooden stalls recently constructed for vendors at next week's
festival.
	   The Water Festival celebrates the annual reversal of the current
of the Tonle Sap River. The holiday's main attraction is
traditional boat races that clog the parks and streets near the
riverbank with spectators.
	   Fed by the Mekong River, the Tonle Sap flows north during the
monsoon season, filling up a large lake with the same name, and
south during the dry season.
	   Mann Chhoeun said the municipality plans to build more public
toilets _ albeit in less prominent locations _ in hopes the
facilities will eventually change Cambodians' habits of relieving
themselves in public at any convenient spot.
	   ``With more toilets available, we will be able to tell the
people where it is appropriate for them to relieve themselves when
they need to _ in the toilets, but not on the trees,'' he said.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch cut through the
Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds
whirling for a second day through resort islands and mainland
communities. At least 32 people were killed and widespread flooding
prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground.
	   Mitch, once among the century's most powerful hurricanes,
weakened Thursday as it blasted this Central American nation,
bringing downpours that flooded at least 50 rivers. It also kicked
up huge waves that pounded seaside communities.
	   The storm's power was easing and by 0900 GMT, it had sustained
winds of 85 mph (136 kph), down from 100 mph (160 kph) around
midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of early
Tuesday.
	   After remaining virtually stationary for more than a day, the
U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center of the
350-mile (563-kilometer)-wide storm had moved slightly to the south
but remained just off the Honduran coast. Hurricane-force winds
whirled up to 60 miles (96 kilometers) from the center, with
rain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that.
	   Caught near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about
25 miles (40 kilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with
divers and beachcombers.
	   ``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike
Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off
the coast. ``Few houses have remained standing.''
	   Honduran officials said 14 people had died on that small island
alone, and at least nine had died elsewhere in the country. More
than 72,000 people had been evacuated to shelters.
	   Nine other deaths had been reported elsewhere in the region by
early Thursday _ more than a day after Mitch drifted to just off
the coast and seemed to park there. Robert Gates, 55, of Niantic,
Connecticut, was thrown from his boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on
Monday and was presumed dead.
	   Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had
been isolated by the storm, left without power, telephones or clean
drinking water.
	   Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain,
citrus and banana crops had been damaged ``and the economic future
of Honduras is uncertain.''
	   Rain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La
Cieba, a coastal city of 40,000 people 80 miles (128 kilometers)
from the Bay Islands. About 10,000 residents fled to crowded
shelters in schools, churches and firehouses.
	   While supplies of food and gasoline seemed to hold up, drivers
worried about the coming days formed long lines to fill their tanks
at gas stations and some supermarkets took measures to limit panic
buying.
	   La Ciega officials appealed for pure water for those in shelters
and some residents set out plastic buckets to collect rainwater.
Only a few hotels and offices with their own generators had
electricity.
	   Wind-whipped waves almost buried some houses near the shore.
People evacuated low-lying houses by wading through chest-deep
water with sodden bags of belongings on their heads.
	   In neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 residents of coastal
Belize City had left by Wednesday, turning the country's largest
city into a ghost town.
	   Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few people
wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company
was broadcasting only The Weather Channel.
	   With the storm seemingly anchored off Honduras, officials in
Mexico to the north eased emergency measures on the Caribbean coast
of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds of people remained in
shelters as a precaution Wednesday night.
	   More than 20,000 tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort
areas, leaving hotels at about 20 percent of capacity.
	   Houston accountant Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend
Nina Devries had tried to leave Cancun but found all the flights
full.
	   ``It's been horrible,'' said Montgomery, as she and her friend
drank cocktails at an outdoor restaurant. ``We couldn't go out on a
boat, we couldn't go snorkeling.
	   ``Even Carlos' N Charlie's and Senor Frog's are closed,'' she
said dejectedly, referring to two restaurants. ``Some vacation.''
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development sent two
helicopters each to Belize and Honduras to help in search, rescue
and relief efforts.
	   At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane
in this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the
Labor Day hurricane of 1935.

Unrelenting rain triggers flooding in eastern and northern
</HEADLINE>
Netherlands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Days of relentless rain have
triggered flooding in eastern and northern Netherlands, forcing the
Dutch to fight their perennial battle to stave off floodwaters.
	   Five hundred soldiers and engineers were deployed to the
provinces of Groningnen and Drenthe to shore up soggy dikes
weakened by rain-swollen canals and rivers, Dutch Army spokesman
Hans Hardenbol said Wednesday.
	   ``Things are stabilizing, but the weather forecast is not
good,'' added Hardenbol.
	   Evacuations in those mainly agricultural provinces have so far
been limited to livestock, but the army has readied two military
barracks in the region should local officials call for an
evacuation of flooded villages.
	   Farmers have been hit the hardest with crops submerged in
flooded fields. Dutch media reported damages so far at around 260
million guilders (dlrs 130 million).
	   Torrential rain and strong winds swept through the Netherlands
earlier this week, causing major traffic jams and closing off
roads. No weather-related deaths have been reported.
	   While the northern and eastern provinces faced floodwaters,
other areas in the Netherlands like Amsterdam enjoyed brief
sunshine and clear skies Wednesday for the first time in days.
	   But meteorologists at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological
Institute expected more rain in the coming days for all parts of
the country, said spokesman Harry Geurts, adding the flooded areas
were closely monitored.
	   ``Every drop is important,'' Geurts added.
	   For this low-lying country, the fight against floodwaters is
almost a way of life. In 1995, widespread flooding of the Maas,
Waal and Rhine Rivers forced the evacuation of up to 250,000 people
in the Netherlands.

European Commission president arrives in China for 6-day visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Santer speech, meeting, Xinhua
commentary &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ European Commission President Jacques Santer
opened a visit to China Thursday with a call for more open Chinese
markets and offers of European help in strengthening China's legal
system.
	   Santer, the first EC president to visit in 12 years, said
transparent, stable legal systems with clear rules and independent
judges were needed to win investors' confidence.
	   In a speech to China's National School of Administration, he
offered European expertise to help train Chinese judges, lawyers
and prosecutors, and announced the launch of a joint program on
judicial cooperation.
	   Santer also met Thursday with China's central bank chief, Dai
Xianglong, and was to confer Friday with Premier Zhu Rongji, who
directs China's economic reforms.
	   Discussions on China's bid to join the World Trade Organization
were likely to be on the agenda. Senior EU officials previously
have tried to coax Beijing into concessions to further its bid to
enter the global trade rules-making body.
	   Santer's meetings were also to include discussion on the euro,
which will become the common currency of 11 of the 15 EU nations on
Jan. 1, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said.
	   In his speech, Santer urged China to cut tariffs, dismantle
barriers to trade and to take ``clear and concrete'' market-opening
measures to make WTO entry possible.
	   ``Europe is prepared to carry on absorbing Chinese exports if we
can be assured of China's determination to progressively and
resolutely open its market further to our investors and
exporters,'' he said.
	   ``All too often, European entrepreneurs still regard China as a
market that's difficult to penetrate,'' he added.
	   The EU is China's fourth largest trading partner, with bilateral
trade topping U.S. dlrs 43 billion last year, a 17-fold increase
over the level in 1975 when the two sides opened diplomatic ties,
the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua said.
	   In a commentary released on the eve of Santer's arrival, Xinhua
predicted that his six-day visit would ``inject new vitality into
the growth momentum of China-EU relations.''
	   Ties have been warmed by the EU's decision earlier this year not
to condemn China at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva and
to remove China from a list of non-market economies _ a policy
change making it more difficult to bring anti-dumping cases against
Chinese companies.
	   ``People have every reason to believe that President Santer's
visit will turn a new page in the growth of China-EU relations,''
Xinhua said.

Estonia seeking new markets due Russian instability
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ As its huge eastern neighbor, Russia,
plunges from one crisis to the next, Estonia is increasingly being
forced to find new markets in Western Europe and elsewhere, the
country's new foreign minister said Thursday.
	   ``We have to find new markets,'' said Foreign Minister Raul
Malk. ``There are some parts of the Estonian industry (which) are
very interested to find new markets to replace those which have
been lost in Russia _ especially in foods, fish and the chemical
industries.''
	   On Wednesday, Estonian industrialists and government trade
officials met to discuss ways of increasing trade between Estonia
and other countries, including the European Union, eastern and
central Europe and South America, Malk told a news conference.
	   ``It is now a challenge for the industrialists, a challenge for
all the structures in the Estonian adminisration who have to
support our economic interests,'' he said.
	   Since Estonia and the other two Baltic states, Latvia and
Lithuania, broke away from the Soviet Union seven years ago, they
have been actively finding new markets.
	   In 1992, the Soviet republics, mainly Russia, accounted for more
than 90 percent of Estonia's foreign trade. Now, the European
Union, which accounts for 60 percent of Estonian foreign trade, has
become this Baltic republic's chief trading partner.
	   Before the latest economic crisis in Moscow, some 13 percent of
Estonian exports went to Russia but now some sectors, particularly
in dairy products, are reporting a fall in exports to Russia by as
much as 50 percent.
	   Malks said, however, that problems in Moscow would not throw
Estonia's economy into crisis.
	   ``It is difficult to forecast exactly how the Estonian economy
will behave, but all forecasts are clearly positive,'' he said.
	   Russia remains an important partner both economicaly and
politically for this country of 1.6 million people, Malk said.
	   ``Both on the economic and political sides ... there is reason
to say that the situatioin in Russia will not interfere (with
Estonia) in a serious, negative way,'' Malk said.
	   Malk also said that the two countries had made ``positive small,
steps, including in border talks.''
	   ``We hope to, very soon, have full-scale border talks
completed,'' Malk said. ``The borders have been agreed. It's now
just a question of drawing lines and making maps.''
	   Malk, 46, a former ambassador to Britain, was appointed the
country's new foreign minister two weeks ago when Toomas Ilves
resigned to devote time to campaigning for national elections in
March.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British poet laureate Ted Hughes, whose stormy
marriage to the anguished American poet Sylvia Plath dogged his
reputation after her suicide, has died, his publisher said
Thursday. He was 68.
	   Hughes died Wednesday at his home in Devon after a 18-month
battle with cancer, which he had kept secret, said Matthew Evans,
chairman of the publisher Faber and Faber.
	   ``The loss to his family is inestimable,'' Evans said.
	   A collection of searingly intense poems published by Hughes this
year called ``Birthday Letters'' shed new light on his difficult
marriage to the tortured Plath, brought him sympathy and won him
rave reviews.
	   Some Plath fans called Hughes a murderer and his name has been
repeatedly hacked off of her gravestone in Yorkshire, northern
England.
	   But the reclusive Hughes chose not to defend himself after
Plath's suicide on Feb. 11, 1963, months after he had left her for
another woman.
	   Hughes made few public appearances and, until the publication of
the 88 poems in ``Birthday Letters'' _ which chronicle the couple's
meeting, marriage and separation _ no pronouncements on his
six-year marriage to Plath.
	   The poems surprised many with their startling intimacy and the
depth of the love they revealed. Of the first time the couple made
love, Hughes wrote: ``You were slim and lithe and smooth as a
fish./ You were a new world. My new world./So this is America, I
marveled./ Beautiful, beautiful America.''
	   Hughes, who has been poet laureate since 1984, refused to be
interviewed about the poems, which span 25 years from the late
1960s.
	   Hughes and Plath married in 1956 after meeting at Cambridge,
where she was studying on a Fulbright Scholarship. They went to the
United States in 1957, where she taught at Smith College and he
taught at the University of Massachusetts. They returned to England
in 1959, continued to write and publish poetry, and had two
children.
	   Plath had had a history of mental problems and had first
attempted suicide three years before meeting Hughes.
	   Poet Andrew Motion, writing in The Times of London, said reading
``Birthday Letters'' was ``like being hit by a thunderbolt.''
	   ``Anyone who thought Hughes's reticence was proof of his hard
heart will immediately see how stony they have been themselves,''
Motion wrote.
	   ``Hughes is one of the most important poets of the century, and
this is his greatest book. It closes in a heart of darkness, a
black hole of grief and regret'' we stare into it feeling changed
and enriched.''
	   The book was dedicated to the couple's children, Nicholas and
Frieda.
	   At the time of its publication, Frieda, a 34-year-old artist,
said in a newspaper interview that she had lived under the burden
of her mother's suicide.
	   ``I never read my parents' poetry until a couple of years ago,''
she said. ``I even rejected the chance to study my father's work
for school exams. It was too close to home.''
	   Hughes, who remarried in 1970, published more than 35 poems and
collections of verse, three works of prose, two opera libretti and
four stage plays. He was a successful children's writer as well,
publishing five poetic works for young people and seven stories
including the popular ``The Iron Man'' _ published in 1968 in the
United States as ``The Iron Giant.''
	   In January, he won the Whitbread Book of the Year award for
``Tales of Ovid,'' his reworking of Ovid's ``Metamorphosis,'' which
the judges described as a work of ``greatness and sublimity.''
	   Hughes' last appearance in public was 13 days ago when he
accepted the Order of Merit, a rare honor, from Queen Elizabeth II
at Buckingham Palace.
	   ``The queen was informed this morning of the death of Ted
Hughes,'' a palace statement said. ``She was very saddened and will
be in touch with his family. She was grateful for the opportunity
to recognise his work and achievements, before he died, through the
award of the Order of Merit.''

Hamas claims responsibility for car bomb explosion in Gaza
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat speaking with Netanyahu by phone, army
lifting closure of Gaza, three Palestinian girls injured when roof
of their shack collapsed from the force of the blast; changes

<TEXT>
	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant
rammed an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep that was
escorting a bus full of elementary school students Thursday. The
powerful blast killed the attacker and a soldier.
	   The anti-Israeli group Hamas claimed responsibility and Israel
warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that he would have to take
tough steps against the militants if he wanted the new
land-for-security agreement to proceed as scheduled.
	   Arafat spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin by phone,
denounced the attack and promised to track down those responsible.
	   The suicide attack also injured three Israelis and three
Palestinan girls. The 40 Israeli children on the bus, ranging in
age from six to 14, were unharmed.
	   The 12-week West Bank troop pullback is to begin Monday, and
Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Israeli hard-liners to
call off the deal.
	   The terror attack, the second this week, makes it increasingly
difficult for Netanyahu to fend off hard-line criticism. Even
before the bombing, Netanyahu had accused the Palestinians of not
living up to security pledges, raising U.S. concerns that
implementation of the deal could be delayed.
	   Thursday's explosion went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 gmt) at
the Gush Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time,
the Israeli school bus convoy guarded by two jeeps was passing by.
	   ``I saw one Israeli jeep blow up and burn completely,'' said
Palestinian witness Jaber Yamawi. ``I saw them take out two
soldiers in ambulances.''
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb was so powerful that the jeep flipped over on its side.
The jeep and the bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in the
nearby town of Khan Yunis, were scorched and mangled.
	   The roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed from the force of the
explosion and three Palestinian girls were injured, their relatives
said. Two girls were hospitalized and a third, an 8-year-old,
remained at home with cuts to the back and hand.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler, said the jeep was still
burning an hour after the blast. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered
all over. There is oil, gas, blood,'' Kirshenzach told Israel
radio.

U.N. envoy meets for second time with Myanmar opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A day after a U.N. report sharply
criticized Myanmar's ruling junta, a U.N. envoy on Thursday met for
the second time with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in an
effort to promote a dialogue between government and opposition.
	   The meeting between Alvaro de Soto, a special representative of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and Suu Kyi, head of the
National League for Democracy, followed the envoy's meeting
Wednesday with a top junta official.
	   De Soto had a previous meeting with Suu Kyi on Tuesday, the day
he arrived.
	   U.N., government and opposition sources have been generally
closemouthed about the details of de Soto's mission.
	   The new U.N. report, whose release in New York was unrelated to
de Soto's visit, expressed deep concern about the continued
harassment of political leaders and the detention of political
prisoners in Myanmar.
	   It said serious human rights violations by Myanmar's armed
forces were continuing in the ethnic minority areas, including
arbitrary executions _ not sparing women and children _ rape,
torture, inhuman treatment, forced labor and denial of freedom of
movement.
	   ``These violations have been so numerous and consistent over the
past years as to suggest that they are not simply isolated or the
acts of individual misbehavior by middle- and lower-rank officers
but are rather the result of policy at the highest level, entailing
political and legal responsibility,'' it said.
	   The report was one of a series of country-by-country human
rights reports by special rapporteurs presented to the General
Assembly this year.
	   A faxed request to the Myanmar government for a response to the
charges went unanswered.
	   A government press release Thursday said Khin Nyunt, Secretary-1
of the ruling junta, ``clarified the current political social and
economic situation of Myanmar'' in his meeting Wednesday with de
Soto. It said de Soto had conveyed Secretary-General Annan's
position, and ``the meeting was reported to be constructive and
fruitful.''
	   De Soto is on his fifth visit as a U.N. envoy since 1995. Since
he last visited Myanmar in January, relations between the
government and the opposition have deteriorated sharply, with the
military increasing its repression of the pro-democracy movement
and Suu Kyi's party increasing its challenges to the government's
legitimacy.
	   In the past few months, almost 1,000 members of Suu Kyi's party
have been detained in an effort to block its activities. More than
100 have reportedly been released in the past few weeks, including
15 Thursday, according to the government press release.
	   State-owned newspapers Thursday reported a mass rally in the
Irrawaddy Division capital of Bassein calling for ``action to
counter neo-colonialists ... and denouncing destructive elements.''
	   About 17 government-organized mass rallies have been held all
over the country since Sept. 24, with speakers making almost
identical speeches demanding tough action against Suu Kyi and her
party.

Taylor says Australia can win without Warne
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's series win in Pakistan has
convinced captain Mark Taylor that his team can beat England in the
Ashes tests even if star spinner Shane Warne is missing because of
injury.
	   Taylor said he would prefer to have Warne in the side but the
form shown by rookie Stuart MacGill during Australia's 1-0 victory
over Pakistan meant the world's best spinner was not essential.
	   Warne has a shoulder injury but bowled 40 balls at an MCG net
session Wednesday and remains hopeful of playing the first test in
Brisbane on Nov. 20.
	   ``It's a luxurious position I've got with someone like Shane
Warne hopefully coming back during the summer,'' Taylor said on
arrival home Thursday. ``But we've got Stuart MacGill who has just
taken 15 wickets in Pakistan so we are lucky in Australia to have
two top leg-spin bowlers.''
	   Taylor said it would be ``nice to have Warney back'' because he
had such a strong competitive streak.
	   ``But I don't think it's paramount to our success, I think we've
proven that in Pakistan,'' Taylor said. ``Some people mightn't have
given us much of a chance of winning against Pakistan without
Warney but we showed we could do it.''
	   Warne, still recovering from a major shoulder operation in
April, hopes to play a one-day match for Victoria against New South
Wales at the MCG on Sunday week.
	   However, it remains doubtful whether the Australian selectors
will risk him in the first test.
	   ``I've been telling everyone I can that we should play two
spinners in Brisbane,'' MacGill said, before admitting his test
spot depended on Warne's fitness. ``I've always thought Shane Warne
was the best spin bowler in history and I'm more than happy to play
second fiddle.''
	   Taylor, who was Australia's top batsman as it won in Pakistan
for the first time since 1959, refused to speculate on when his
test career might finish.
	   He said he would continue leading his country as long as his
form warranted an opening batting position and the side kept
winning.

Bulgaria introduces alternative military service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria will introduce an alternative
military service program for conscripts who don't want to carry
arms, the parliament decided Thursday.
	   Beginning next Jan 1, conscripts who conscripts who object to
using weapons will have the option to serve in non-combat army
units, or work in public health and social care centers. The
alternative service will be an option only in times of peace, and
will be twice as long as standard military service.
	   Bulgarian males aged 18 and older must serve 18 months in the
army, while university students serve 12 months.
	   Last year, Bulgaria began recruiting professional service men
and women, as part of a program to reform its, mostly conscript
army to meet NATO standards.

Swissair switches off MD-11 entertainment systems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Two months after the crash of Flight
111, Swissair said Thursday it is switching off an entertainment
system on its remaining MD-11 aircraft as a precautionary measure.
	   The ``Interactive Flight Entertainment Network'' in first and
business class will be disconnected from a power supply network
that is routed through the cockpit, Philippe Bruggisser, chief
executive of Swissair parent SAirGroup, told a news conference.
	   The measure, which Bruggisser stressed is purely precautionary,
was taken in agreement with Canadian crash investigators,
manufacturer Boeing and U.S. and Swiss aviation authorities.
	   Swissair made the move because the Canadian investigation into
the cause of the crash are concentrating on the cockpit area,
Bruggisser said. The system affected is nonessential, he added.
	   The inflight entertainment system is available on individual
video screens in all first and business class seats. The measure is
being applied to three Swissair Boeing 747s as well as to its
remaining 15 MD-11s.
	   ``The system, which is certified by the Federal Aviation
Administration, has not been identified as a cause of the
accident,'' a Swissair statement said.
	   Standard video and audio entertainment system are unaffected, it
added.
	   The Sept. 2 crash off the coast of Nova Scotia killed all 229
people aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight. Sixteen minutes before
the crash, the pilots detected smoke in the aircraft's cockpit.
	   A complete explanation for the disaster is still elusive. But
Canadian officials said earlier this week that about 60 percent of
the plane has now been retrieved from the Atlantic Ocean floor.
	   Some debris from the cockpit area shows signs of extreme heat,
but investigators have yet to uncover any indication of the cause
or the extent of a possible fire on board.

After NBA cancels rest of November, talks last 8 hours
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They canceled more games, held more talks and
finally walked into the chilly early-morning air with long faces
and no deal.
	   It was one of the most eventful, if not productive, days of the
NBA lockout Wednesday. But when it was over, 16 hours of talking
and tinkering hadn't moved NBA owners and players much closer to a
deal.
	   ``There's still a pretty wide gap that separates the sides,
despite the statements of good faith intentions,'' commissioner
David Stern said after talks ended at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT)
Thursday. ``But at least we identified the sizes of the gaps
between us.''
	   Some 12 hours earlier, Stern announced the cancellation of two
more weeks of the season, although he did admit there was a
possibility of ``recapturing'' games that will be missed.
	   In all, 194 games have been lost, with the latest cancellation
of 95 games. Each team's 82-game schedule has now been whittled to
about 68 games, and the players have lost about dlrs 200 million in
salaries.
	   ``In terms of how close and how far away we are, that's hard to
determine right now,'' said Michael Jordan, who sat in on the talks
for the first time. ``At least we've got some great dialogue
happening and in some ways we're starting to understand each
other's position. Is that improvement? Yes, I would say so.''
	   Still, the sides made little or no movement on the monetary
specifics of their offers. The owners are still asking for a
scaleback of the percentage of revenues devoted to salaries from 57
to 48 percent, while the players remained stuck on holding off on
their concessions until the number reaches 63 percent.
	   ``Both sides are still locked in,'' union director Billy Hunter
said. ``We spent a lot of time talking, but no progress. I don't
think their people are willing to move.''
	   Hunter, looking haggard and weary when he left the talks,
expected to receive a phone call Thursday morning from Stern or
deputy commissioner Russ Granik to discuss what each side thinks
the next step should be.
	   No further talks have been scheduled, but the sides said they
could be back at the bargaining table Thursday or Friday.
	   The cancellations, which wiped out the rest of the November
schedule, came after the league's Board of Governors and about 100
players held separate meetings during the day. The owners'
negotiating committee then spoke to the assembly of players for 90
minutes, and formal talks began at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT) and lasted
for eight hours.
	   ``I think we just have different ideas as to what's a workable
economic system,'' said Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief
attorney. ``This will take more time. We're just still not able to
find common ground on how the thing's going to work.''
	   The league had already canceled two week's worth of games, and
now the season won't start before Dec. 1 at the earliest.
	   Until this labor dispute, the league had never lost a game to a
work stoppage.
	   Wednesday's meetings were the third straight day of talks, and
the sides have moved closer to an agreement on the framework _ or
``skeleton,'' as Stern said _ of the next agreement. For the first
two or three years, there would be a luxury tax on the highest
contracts. If that system did not reduce the amount of revenues
being devoted to salaries, a modified hard cap would be implemented
under which players would put 10 percent of their salaries into an
escrow fund.
	   ``The main point is having the skeleton. We think that is
significant, since we had not agreed on a skeleton before,'' union
attorney Jeffrey Kessler said. ``The issue is now about dollars.''
	   ``All we have to do now is agree on the numbers,'' Ewing said.
	   But agreeing on the numbers will not be easy.
	   Players received 57 percent of revenues last season, and the
owners want to scale that back 9 percent by the 2002-03 season.
	   ``In a nutshell, our problem tonight, both sides, is we are not
able to go as high as they are willing to come down low,'' Stern
said.
	   ``We're basically still at the same place,'' said Antonio Davis
of the Indiana Pacers, a member of the union's negotiating
committee. ``We try to give them something, they give us one thing
and take something else away. We just want the fans to know that
we're not sitting up there saying nothing. We're saying a lot, it's
just not getting done.''

Arson attack destroys Jordanian diplomatic car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An arson attack Thursday destroyed a car
belonging to a Jordanian embassy official in the latest incident in
a spree of firebombings and other strikes against foreigners.
	   There were no injuries in the attack on the embassy car, which
had diplomatic plates and was parked outside the diplomat's home,
police said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   A range of self-proclaimed leftist and anarchists groups have
said they carried out the attacks, which have been mostly aimed at
foreign and diplomatic targets.
	   But Greek government offices, police and media have also been
hit.
	   On Monday, four parked police cars were burned in Athens.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets closed mostly higher Thursday, as
the big Tokyo exchange snapped a four-day losing streak and
investors in many other markets bought shares despite dismal
corporate earnings forecasts. Japanese blue chips rose on buying by
public funds, but worries over upcoming corporate earnings reports
kept trading subdued. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 152.65 points, or 1.13 percent, closing at 13,668.72. But
overall sentiment remained poor amid worries about corporate
earnings and the direction of emerging markets, including Brazil
and Russia. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar bought 116.36 yen, down 1.52
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo. In Hong Kong, share prices were
little changed Thursday, the day after it reached its highest close

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government has ``resolutely opted'' to
take more control over the economy to pull it out of its worst
crisis since the Soviet collapse, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Thursday. Primakov was commenting on the government's
long-awaited crisis plan, which was presented Wednesday to the
International Monetary Fund. The government hoped the plan would
persuade the IMF to release another installment of a dlrs 22.6
billion loan frozen after the Russian economy fell apart in
mid-August. The plan calls for tighter currency controls, price
controls on medicines and some basic foods, a food reserve to help
the country through the winter and indexing wages and pensions to
compensate Russians for rising inflation. It tackles the tax
system, lowering some income, property and profit tax rates but
tightening the rules in hopes of making more people pay. The IMF
said it wanted to study the plan, Russian media reported.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey and four Caspian states signed a
declaration Thursday in support of an oil pipeline crossing through
Turkey as the main export route to carry oil from the Caspian Sea's
rich oil fields. The declaration was a triumph for Turkey, which
got most participating countries _ except Russia and Turkmenistan _
to declare their support for a pipeline running from the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port of
Ceyhan via Georgia. The declaration was signed by the presidents of
Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan. The United
States has repeatedly pledged its backing for the proposed
1,730-kilometer (1,075-mile) pipeline and last week announced dlrs
823,000 aid for the pipeline. Also Thursday, Turkey and
Turkmenistan signed an agreement to build a pipeline to export
Turkmen natural gas across the Caspian to Turkey. (TURKEY-CASPIAN

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ New data show Singapore's economy shrinking for
the first time since the 1980s and unemployment rising. Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong said Thursday that gross domestic product
shrank 1.5 percent in the third quarter, Singapore's first such
contraction since its recession in the mid-1980s. ``Every now and
then, a people is faced with a crucial test,'' Goh told a gathering
of union leaders. Early data show that unemployment rose to a
seasonally adjusted rate of 4.5 percent in September, nearly double
the 2.3 percent in June. About 20,000 workers lost their jobs in
the first nine months of the year, equaling the record number of
layoffs during Singapore's last recession. Goh blamed three
factors: shrinking regional demand for its products and services; a
global downturn in industries like electronics, which accounts for
77 percent of Singapore's domestic manufacturing exports; and
slumping demand hurting corporate earnings, which have on average
plunged 55 percent in the first half of 1998. (SINGAPORE-ECONOMY)
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's long-awaited plan to confront
its financial crisis faces an uphill battle in congress, the
finance minister warned. The dlrs 24-billion plan offers a mix of
spending cuts and higher taxes that will affect corporations, civil
servants and almost anyone with a bank account, the goverment
announced Wednesday. It hopes the austerity plan will qualify
Brazil for a dlrs 30-billion rescue package being assembled by the
International Monetary Fund, which insisted Brazil tackle its
budget deficit. The IMF, in a statement issued Wednesday in
Washington, said Brazil's measures ``represent important progress
in the implementation of Brazil's stabilization and reform program,
which will be supported by the IMF and other members of the
international community.'' Still, the more controversial steps,
including an unprecedented tax on social security pensions, face an
uphill battle in Brazil's congress. ``Our destiny is in our own
hands,'' Finance Minister Pedro Malan said in a nationally
televised address Wednesday. (BRAZIL-ECONOMY)

Ukraine hands suspected criminal over to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Security Service has handed over
to Russia a Russian citizen suspected of stealing dlrs 3 million
from a bank where he was working, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Valentin Mazukhin was detained in late July in the northeastern
Ukrainian city of Kharkiv after Russian authorities launched a
nationwide search for him and requested international help, the
daily Fakty said.
	   Mazukhin, a former branch manager for Novotroitsk-bank, is
suspected of stealing dlrs 3 million from the bank in 1995.
	   He then disappeared. While in Ukraine, he used counterfeit
passports and conducted illegal financial activities using false
documents, said the deputy head of the security service's regional
anti-corruption department, Serhiy Rodionov, according to Fakty.
	   Authorities in Ukraine filed a criminal case against him, but it
was dropped as part of an amnesty declared this summer to coincide
with Ukraine's independence anniversary.

Bosnian Serb pleads guilty to 12 murders at U.N. tribunal

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb who called himself
``The Serb Adolf'' pleaded guilty Thursday at the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in a two-week
killing spree in 1992.
	   Goran Jelisic, 30, faces a maximum life prison term for the
killings.
	   Because he also pleaded innocent to a genocide charge, he will
stand trial before the U.N. court, where he will be officially
convicted of the murders, presiding Judge Claude Jorda said.
	   Jelisic, who called himself as ``The Serb Adolf'' in reference
to Adolf Hitler, said he was admitting to the May 1992 murders to
``cleanse his soul.''
	   ``It was my good will that I admitted the crime and cleanse my
soul,'' he calmly told the three-judge panel. ``There is no reason
for me to keep it within myself.''
	   Jelisic, who looked calm during the 40-minute hearing, looked
down at his indictment as he entered guilty pleas to a total of 31
war crimes and crimes against humanity charges covering the
murders, three beatings and the plunder of property.
	   ``Mr. Jelisic decided to reveal his soul ... to this honorable
trial chamber ... to cleanse his soul and to sincerely repent for
what he has done,'' his attorney Veselin Londrovic told the court.
	   Jelisic, a former farm machinery mechanic, pleaded to a new
indictment containing 20 fewer charges than the original. Although
the indictment named 14 victims, the text of the charges indicate
he murdered 12 people. At an earlier hearing, prosecutors agreed to
drop some charges to speed up Jelisic's trial.
	   At his first arraignment in January, Jelisic called the
allegations ``all lies and fabrications.''
	   On Thursday, however, he admitted systematically shooting
Muslims and Croats to death at the Luka camp in northern Bosnia in
1992, then ordering fellow inmates to collect the bodies.
	   He will become the third war criminal convicted by the U.N.
court.
	   In 1997, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic was sentenced to 20 years for
killing and torturing Muslims and Croats in 1992. Last year,
Bosnian Croat Drazen Erdemovic was given a five-year sentence for
taking part in a Bosnian Serb Army mass execution of Muslims
following the fall of Srebrenica in 1995.
	   No date was immediately set for Jelisic's genocide trial, when
prosecutors will have to prove he intended to wipe out an entire
section of an ethnic group.
	   Jelisic's victims included a woman and an elderly man. The
genocide charge he denied alleges he ``killed countless detainees,
whose identities are unknown.''
	   Jelisic used to boast to inmates about how many Muslims he
killed. Most of his victims were shot at close range, and others
were beaten to death.
	   Hundreds of Muslim and Croats were detained at Luka, a former
port complex on the banks of the Sava River, after being forced
from their homes by rebel Serbs.
	   According to Jelisic's indictment, prisoners were sometimes
ordered to kneel with their heads over a duct that drained into the
river. Jelisic and other camp guards would shoot them in the back
of the head. The bodies were later dumped in a mass grave.
	   The war crimes tribunal was set up by the U.N. Security Council
in 1993 to punish those responsible for atrocities in the wars that
raged in the former Yugoslavia after its split.

New German defense chief wants stronger Europe in NATO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new defense minister said
Thursday he wants Europe to form a stronger, more united presence
within NATO.
	   For now, a European pillar ``in the desirable strength'' was
lacking in the alliance, said Rudolf Scharping.
	   ``I wish that we in Europe would finally overcome our weaknesses
and formulate a common foreign and defense policy,'' he told
Southwest Radio.
	   Scharping, a Social Democrat who took office Wednesday in the
new government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, also offered
assurances that a new commission to review the German army's
structure wouldn't reach any hasty decisions.
	   ``These are long-term projects, and nothing for the next two,
three or four years,'' he said.
	   The Social Democrats' junior coalition partners, the Greens,
have predicted the new commission will recommend cutting the
340,000-strong military to 200,000.
	   Scharping said any decisions would be made with the greatest
care and with the military's agreement.

EU inflation rate falls to 1.2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's annual inflation
rate fell to 1.2 percent in September, down from 1.3 percent in
August, the EU's statistics agency reported Thursday.
	   Inflation fell from 1.8 percent in September 1997, Eurostat said
in its monthly report.
	   In the 11 countries that join the single European currency on
Jan. 1, inflation was down to 1 percent in September, from 1.2
percent in August.
	   Inflation has fallen over the year in most EU nations, but is
creeping upwards in places, notably Ireland, Portugal and Italy.
Ireland's rate rose to 2.8 percent from 0.6 percent in September
1997.
	   Greece continued to have the EU's highest inflation at 5
percent.
	   At the other end of the scale, Sweden slipped into deflation,
with prices falling 0.1 percent. Belgium, Germany, France, Austria,
and Luxembourg all recorded inflation rates below 1 percent.
	   Eurostat gave the following rates for September 1998, with
September 1997 in brackets:
	   Sweden, -0.1 (2.6); France, 0.5 (1.5); Germany, 0.6 (1.6);
Austria, 0.6 (1.2); Luxembourg, 0.7 (1.7); Belgium, 0.8 (1.6
percent); Denmark, 1.1 (1.9); Netherlands, 1.3 (2.5); Finland, 1.4
(1.6); Britain, 1.5 (1.8); Spain, 1.6 (1.9); Italy, 2.1 (1.6);
Portugal, 2.2 (1.5); Ireland, 2.8 (0.6); Greece, 5 (4.9).

Heavy rains swell rivers, cause floods in northern Europe

<TEXT>
	   BADEN-BADEN, Germany (AP) _ Heavy rains flooded low-lying areas
Thursday across northern Europe, including this historic spa town
where elegant tree-lined boulevards once strolled by kings and
queens were under water.
	   Flood alarms sounded in Baden-Baden just after midnight. By
Thursday morning, German soldiers were sandbagging the swollen Oos
River that runs through the center of the luxurious resort, located
in the Black Forest near the southwest border with France. The
train station also was flooded.
	   Harsh storms that started late Tuesday have killed two people _
one in Germany and one in the Czech Republic, both in vehicles hit
by trees uprooted by wind. Power cuts, traffic snarls, highway
closings were reported Thursday in Austria and the Netherlands as
well as in Germany.
	   About 500 soldiers and engineers were deployed to the Dutch
province of Groningnen and Drenthe to shore up dikes sodden by
rain-swollen canals and rivers, Dutch army spokesman Hans Hardenbol
said Thursday.
	   The Linz area of upper Austria and some Vienna suburbs were
flooded, and some Austrian towns were without electricity after
gusts blew down power lines.
	   In northern Germany, residents in the flooded town center of Bad
Gandersheim fled their homes in rubber dinghies. About 1,000 police
and firefighters from the nearby city of Braunschweig arrived
during the night to pump out basements after the Leine River
swiftly rose about a meter (three feet). Fifteen people were
treated for hypothermia or shock.
	   The Mosel River, which meets the Rhine in southwest Germany,
also was rising, and smaller rivers in the area _ the Glan, the
Nahe and the Sieg _ had flooded into several small towns.
	   Police closed a section of the autobahn outside the town of
Pforzheim, south of Baden-Baden. Mudslides in the town of Rastatt,
in the same area, destroyed three houses, according to the interior
ministry in nearby Stuttgart.

Britain's poet laureate Ted Hughes dies after battle with cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new comment from publisher, excerpts from Hughes
letter upon winning a poetry prize for `Birthday Letters'; makes
minor editing changes throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British poet laureate Ted Hughes, whose stormy
marriage to the anguished American poet Sylvia Plath dogged his
reputation after her suicide, has died, his publisher said
Thursday. He was 68.
	   Hughes died Wednesday at his home in Devon after a 18-month
battle with cancer, which he had kept secret, said Matthew Evans,
chairman of the publisher Faber and Faber.
	   ``Not only was he one of the greatest poets of the 20th century,
but he was the most extraordinary man,'' Evans said. ``The loss to
his family is inestimable.''
	   A collection of searingly intense poems published by Hughes this
year called ``Birthday Letters'' shed new light on his difficult
six-year marriage to the tortured Plath, brought him sympathy and
won him rave reviews.
	   Some Plath fans called Hughes a murderer and his name has been
repeatedly hacked off of her gravestone in Yorkshire, northern
England.
	   But the reclusive Hughes chose not to defend himself after
Plath's suicide on Feb. 11, 1963, months after he had left her for
another woman.
	   Evans noted that there was ``a great deal of understanding''
after Hughes put forth his story for the first time _ and revealed
the obvious depth of his love for Plath _ in the 88 poems that make
up ``Birthday Letters,'' chronicling the couple's meeting, marriage
and separation.
	   ``He wanted `Birthday Letters' to be published because he knew
he was seriously ill. He wanted to publish the work before he
died,'' the publisher said. ``He regarded it as being of personal
importance. It was the nearest thing to an autobiography.''
	   The poems surprised many with their startling intimacy. Of the
first time the couple made love, Hughes wrote: ``You were slim and
lithe and smooth as a fish./ You were a new world. My new world./So
this is America, I marveled./ Beautiful, beautiful America.''
	   Hughes, who has been poet laureate since 1984, refused to be
interviewed about the poems, which span 25 years from the late
1960s.
	   But in a letter read by his editor, Christopher Reid, who
accepted the Forward Poetry prize for ``Birthday Letters'' on
Hughes' behalf this year, Hughes called the book ``a gathering of
the occasions _ written with no plan over about 25 years _ in which
I tried to open a direct, private, inner contact with my first
wife, not thinking to make a poem, thinking mainly to evoke her
presence to myself and to feel her there listening.
	   ``Except for a handful, I never thought of publishing these
pieces until last year, when quite suddenly I realised I had to
publish them, no matter what the consequences.''

Excerpts from the Truth Commission final report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-South Africa-Truth Commission

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Excerpts from the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission's final report on abuses committed by all
sides during the fight against white rule.
	   _ From Retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu's foreward: ``However
painful the experience has been we remain convinced that there can
be no healing without truth. My appeal to South Africans as they
read this report is not to use it to attack others, but to add to
it, correct it and ultimately to share in the process that will
lead to national unity through truth and reconciliation.''
	   _ Primary finding: ``The predominant portion of gross violations
of human rights was committed by the former state through its
security and law enforcement agencies. Moreover the South African
state ... from the late 1970s to early 1990s became involved in
activities of a criminal nature when ... it knowingly planned,
undertook, condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful acts,
including the extra-judicial killing of political opponents inside
and outside South Africa.''
	   _ On P.W. Botha: ``Mr. Botha was responsible for ordering former
Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok and former police
Commissioner Johan van der Merwe unlawfully to destroy Khotso House
(which housed anti-apartheid groups).''
	   _ On the African National Congress: It ``perpetrated gross
violations of human rights in that the distinction between civilian
and military targets was blurred ... resulting in ... civilian
injury and loss of life.''
	   _ On the media: English language media ``often adopted a policy
of appeasement toward the state, ensuring a large measure of
self-censorship.'' The Afrikaans-language media ``with rare
exceptions chose to provide direct support for apartheid and the
activities of the security forces, many of which led directly to
gross violations of human rights.''
	   _ On the judiciary: ``The judiciary and the magistracy as well
as the ... legal profession were locked into an overwhelmingly
passive mindset which characterized the judgements of the bench in
the face of the injustices of apartheid.''
	   _ On business: ``The business sector failed ... to take
responsibility for its involvement in state security initiatives
... specifically designed to sustain apartheid rule.''
	   _ On religion: South African Christianity ``promoted the
ideology of apartheid in a range of different ways that included
Biblical and theological teaching.'' Ethical failures by religious
communities ``contributed to a climate within which apartheid was
able to survive.''
	   _ On accountability: ``Prosecution should be considered where
evidence exists that an individual has committed a gross human
rights violation'' unless they have asked for amnesty.
	   _ On reconciliation: ``Reconciliation is a process which is
never-ending, is costly and often painful. For this process to
develop it is imperative that democracy and a human rights culture
be consolidated. Reconciliation is centered on the call for a more
decent, more caring and more just society.''

	   condemnation of Buthelezi; no pickup
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ In a major milestone on South
Africa's road to reconciliation, a human rights panel Thursday
condemned the apartheid state for a range of atrocities but also
apportioned blame to the black movements fighting for freedom.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission called on the now-ruling
African National Congress and its allies to apologize for torturing
and killing enemies in exile. It appealed to whites to make
gestures of reconciliation, but without giving specifics.
	   The report came down hard on P.W. Botha, the last hardline
apartheid president, saying he ``contributed to and facilitated a
climate in which ... gross violations of human rights could and did
occur and as such is accountable for such violations.''
	   The five-volume, 3,500-page document did not recommend
individual prosecutions, but said said ``prosecution should be
considered where evidence exists that an individual has committed a
gross human rights violation.''
	   But in accepting the report at a ceremony on Thursday, President
Nelson Mandela said the report would not produce instant
reconciliation with the troubled past.
	   ``Its release is bound to reawaken many of the difficult and
troubling emotions that the hearings themselves brought,'' Mandela
said.
	   The release was a major event in South Africa's efforts to deal
with its violent past. It culminated more than two years of
hearings of apartheid's victims and perpetrators.
	   ``Accept this report as an indispensible way to healing,'' said
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission chairman, before handing it
to Mandela. ``Let the waters of healing flow from Pretoria today.''
	   Tutu said the report should ``cleanse'' South Africans and
``bring unity and reconciliation.''
	   The commission was established to lay bare the record of 34
years of abuses as a necessary step before the country's races
could live together in harmony.
	   As expected, it found the main culprits in violating human
rights were the former state and its security forces. The
commissioners implicated white governments in the killings,
beatings and torture of political opponents inside and outside the
country.
	   Without naming names, the report said the nation's highest
officials meant to kill black activists when they told subordinates
to ``neutralize'' or ``eliminate'' the opposition. Top ministers
have always denied this, saying they meant arrest or detain.
	   The commission said it ``cannot accept'' that the officials did
not know such commands equaled death sentences.
	   The apartheid system of racial separation was a crime against
humanity, it said.
	   Release of the report to journalists was delayed by several
hours when the ANC unsuccessfully sought to have a court block
release of the report.
	   The legal maneuvering outraged Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1984 for his anti-apartheid struggle.
	   ``I have struggled against a tyranny. I didn't do that in order
to substitute it with another,'' he told journalists. ``If there is
a tyranny, an abusive power ... I will oppose it with every fiber
of my being.''
	   ANC officials were angry about harsh findings in the report that
said party security officials ``routinely used torture'' against
suspected spies and dissidents. The organization planted land mines
that killed farm laborers and their families and killed innocent
civilians in bomb blasts, it said.
	   It pointed out that the ANC itself provided much of the
information. The party has always argued that it was fighting a
just war against a towering evil -- apartheid -- and that it was
wrong to equate its actions with that of the white security forces.
	   But the commissioners, in effect, said the end did not justify
the means, and that the ANC and other liberation movements were
``morally and politically accountable'' for gross violations of
human rights.
	   Specifically condemned was Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, President
Mandela's former wife. The report found she had known about and
possibly participated in the killing and torture of suspected
dissidents by her gang of personal bodyguards, known as the Mandela
United Football Club.
	   Also named was Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the home affairs minister
and long-time leader of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party.
The report said Buthelezi in his role as IFP leader was responsible
for abuses committed by his followers, who engaged in a bloody turf
war with local ANC supporters.
	   The commission was established in 1995, a year after all-race
elections ended apartheid. It has the power to grant amnesty to
those who fully detail the truth and provide a political motive.
	   The commission will continue to consider amnesty applications
into next year, and Parliament must still decide on a final plan to
pay reparations to victims of abuses.
	   Most of the report is taken up by accounts of individual cases
of suffering, lengthy discussions of the roles of the media,
religion, business and the legal community in white-ruled South
Africa and a historical review of apartheid and the struggle
against it.

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz reported
higher-than-expected profits over the first nine months of the
year, and said Thursday it expects annual sales to exceed its own
forecasts.
	   Daimler made a net profit of 3.28 billion marks (dlrs 2.05
billion) during the first three quarters. It is the first time the
company has released nine-month and third-quarter profit data for
the group and its divisions.
	   As well as producing automobiles, Daimler has an aerospace and a
rail systems division.
	   Sales in the first nine months grew by 17.5 percent to 102.9
billion marks (dlrs 64.3 billion.) Daimler said it expects group
sales to exceed its original forecast of 140 billion marks (dlrs
87.5 billion) for the year.
	   Daimler said it expected to sell a record 850,000-plus vehicles
this year, with 653,736 sold already, a rise of 28 percent over
last year.
	   Daimler is expected to finalize its merger with the U.S.
automaker Chrysler next month.

Hakkinen, Schumacher head into showdown for world championship

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Racing for his third Formula One world
title, Michael Schumacher not only needs to win the season-ending
Japan Grand Prix on Sunday, he also needs at least one other driver
to beat Mika Hakkinen.
	   Who better than Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine?
	   ``I expect, basically, for him to do as good a job as he has
already done at several races this year, and also during testing,''
Schumacher said Thursday.
	   McLaren driver Hakkinen, leading Schumacher by four points,
needs only a second-place finish Sunday to clinch his first world
title.
	   ``There's a clear target,'' said Schumacher. ``So, you want to
do everything you can do to achieve the target.''
	   Irvine said that if he gets ahead of Hakkinen, passing him won't
be easy.
	   ``If Mika is trying to overtake me, he's got to be more careful
than if he is overtaking somebody else, because I have nothing to
lose,'' said Irvine.
	   But he dismissed any idea of dirty driving tactics.
	   ``I wouldn't want to take Mika off _ or anybody else off for
that matter _ so that Michael could win the championship because I
wouldn't want somebody to do it to me,'' Irvine said.
	   Hakkinen had said earlier, ``I believe it will be a completely
fair fight this time. That's what everybody wants, and everyone in
the world will be watching.''
	   Recent season-ending races have been marred by rough-and-tumble
tactics.
	   In the Grand Prix last year in Jerez, Spain, Schumacher rammed
Jacques Villeneuve in what was widely viewed as a deliberate
attempt to knock him out of the race and win the title. But it was
Schumacher who slid out of the race and Villeneuve went on to
clinch the title.
	   In 1989 at Suzuka, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost collided, and a
year later, Senna drove Prost off the track at the first corner to
clinch the title. In 1994 in Adelaide, Schumacher collided with
Damon Hill to win the title.
	   Hakkinen was making no predictions Thursday of how Sunday's race
might develop, or whether he would go all-out to win.
	   ``It's unrealistic for me to sit here and say whether I am going
to be second, third, first or whatever,'' said the 30-year-old
Finn. ``That decision is for Sunday.''
	   Hakkinen's McLaren teammate, David Coulthard, said that on
Sunday, ``it is going to be a hard, close race between McLaren and
Ferrari. I think our McLaren will be good round this circuit, and
maybe it will all depend on differences between the tires.''
	   Irvine said that how he can help Schumacher on Sunday all
depends on where he and his teammate qualify, and where the
McLarens qualify.
	   ``Even though we'll know all that on Saturday night, it could
all change at the first corner. Last year, Michael and I were very
lucky the way things worked out. With Michael going slow, I was
able to go round the outside of him, and that put things into our
hands.
	   ``That doesn't mean to say it will happen like that again. This
time, if the McLarens are one second a lap quicker and start from
the front row of the grid, there won't be much that Michael and I
can do about it. We have to suss it as it happens,'' Irvine added.
	   Hakkinen said earlier, ``Michael cannot take any risks. He has
to finish the race because if we both retired I'd still have more
points than him and win.''

Turkey celebrates 75th anniversary of modern, secular republic

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Carrying portraits of their national hero
and pledging to stay secular, thousands gathered at their late
leader's mausoleum Thursday before a night of balls, banquets and
fireworks to celebrate Turkey's 75th anniversary as a secular
republic.
	   ``Turkey is secular and will remain so,'' the crowds shouted in
chorus walking through the entrance of the mausoleum of modern
Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
	   Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel laid a wreath, while
Britain's Duke of York and other dignitaries from around the world
paid their respects to the man who created the secular republic
from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire on Oct. 29, 1923.
	   Aiming to create an up-to-date, Westward-looking state, Ataturk
curtailed religion's role in the predominantly Muslim society and
made secularism the new republic's official ideology.
	   Today, the nation is faced with a widening divide between those
determined to keep it on a secular path and supporters of an
Islamic political movement.
	   The all-powerful military _ the self-appointed guardians of the
secular system _ used the occasion to show its might, parading
tanks and artillery before the nation and the foreign guests. The
military pressured an Islamic-led government into resigning last
year. The Islamic party later was forced to disband.
	   As Demirel laid the wreathThursday, hundreds of flag-waving
youths and military officers stood still chanting the Turkish
national anthem.
	   ``I was so excited because I was coming here that I was not able
to sleep,'' said Fadime Aktug as she witnessed the opening of the
day-long celebrations.
	   Two elderly men, bearing war medals awarded to their fathers who
fought for Turkey's independence after World War I, saluted
journalists and passer-bys at the mausoleum. A blimp, floated over
the capital, its sign declaring: ``Ataturk, we are following in
your footsteps.''
	   Foreign leaders, including Israeli President Ezer Weizman, and
six ex-Soviet presidents, joined Turkish military brass and leaders
to watch the parade. Ordinary Turks were to celebrate with
state-organized dances, fireworks and concerts in streets.
	   In the only overt reminder of Turkey's mighty Ottoman Empire, a
band dressed as the feared janissaries, who used to announce the
arrival of Ottoman troops in conquered lands, was to parade.
	   Prodded by the pro-secular government, millions throughout the
country marched Sunday to kick off the celebrations and to protest
Islam's influence in national politics.
	   Still, to many Turks, the pride in the anniversary was genuine,
not orchestrated.
	   ``These celebrations are what we feel as Turks,'' declared Deniz
Pekcan, a sales manager in Ankara. ``We are not making a show for
others.''

 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ In a major milestone on South
Africa's road to reconciliation, a human rights panel Thursday
condemned the apartheid state for a range of atrocities but also
apportioned blame to the black movements fighting for freedom.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission called on the now-ruling
African National Congress and its allies to apologize for torturing
and killing enemies in exile. It appealed to whites to make
gestures of reconciliation, but without giving specifics.
	   The report came down hard on P.W. Botha, the last hardline
apartheid president, saying he ``contributed to and facilitated a
climate in which ... gross violations of human rights could and did
occur and as such is accountable for such violations.''
	   The five-volume, 3,500-page document did not recommend
individual prosecutions, but said said ``prosecution should be
considered where evidence exists that an individual has committed a
gross human rights violation.''
	   But in accepting the report at a ceremony on Thursday, President
Nelson Mandela said the report would not produce instant
reconciliation with the troubled past.
	   ``Its release is bound to reawaken many of the difficult and
troubling emotions that the hearings themselves brought,'' Mandela
said.
	   The release was a major event in South Africa's efforts to deal
with its violent past. It culminated more than two years of
hearings of apartheid's victims and perpetrators.
	   ``Accept this report as an indispensible way to healing,'' said
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission chairman, before handing it
to Mandela. ``Let the waters of healing flow from Pretoria today.''
	   Tutu said the report should ``cleanse'' South Africans and
``bring unity and reconciliation.''
	   The commission was established to lay bare the record of 34
years of abuses as a necessary step before the country's races
could live together in harmony.
	   As expected, it found the main culprits in violating human
rights were the former state and its security forces. The
commissioners implicated white governments in the killings,
beatings and torture of political opponents inside and outside the
country.
	   Without naming names, the report said the nation's highest
officials meant to kill black activists when they told subordinates
to ``neutralize'' or ``eliminate'' the opposition. Top ministers
have always denied this, saying they meant arrest or detain.
	   The commission said it ``cannot accept'' that the officials did
not know such commands equaled death sentences.
	   The apartheid system of racial separation was a crime against

	   Release of the report to journalists was delayed by several

	   The legal maneuvering outraged Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace

 &UR; Excerpts from the Truth Commission final report
 &UR; With BC-South Africa-Truth Commission

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Excerpts from the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission's final report on abuses committed by all
sides during the fight against white rule.
	   _ From Retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu's foreward: ``However
painful the experience has been we remain convinced that there can
be no healing without truth. My appeal to South Africans as they
read this report is not to use it to attack others, but to add to
it, correct it and ultimately to share in the process that will
lead to national unity through truth and reconciliation.''
	   _ Primary finding: ``The predominant portion of gross violations
of human rights was committed by the former state through its
security and law enforcement agencies. Moreover the South African
state ... from the late 1970s to early 1990s became involved in
activities of a criminal nature when ... it knowingly planned,
undertook, condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful acts,
including the extra-judicial killing of political opponents inside
and outside South Africa.''
	   _ On P.W. Botha: ``Mr. Botha was responsible for ordering former
Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok and former police
Commissioner Johan van der Merwe unlawfully to destroy Khotso House
(which housed anti-apartheid groups).''
	   _ On the African National Congress: It ``perpetrated gross
violations of human rights in that the distinction between civilian
and military targets was blurred ... resulting in ... civilian
injury and loss of life.''
	   _ On the media: English language media ``often adopted a policy
of appeasement toward the state, ensuring a large measure of
self-censorship.'' The Afrikaans-language media ``with rare
exceptions chose to provide direct support for apartheid and the
activities of the security forces, many of which led directly to
gross violations of human rights.''
	   _ On the judiciary: ``The judiciary and the magistracy as well
as the ... legal profession were locked into an overwhelmingly
passive mindset which characterized the judgements of the bench in
the face of the injustices of apartheid.''
	   _ On business: ``The business sector failed ... to take
responsibility for its involvement in state security initiatives
... specifically designed to sustain apartheid rule.''
	   _ On religion: South African Christianity ``promoted the
ideology of apartheid in a range of different ways that included
Biblical and theological teaching.'' Ethical failures by religious
communities ``contributed to a climate within which apartheid was
able to survive.''
	   _ On accountability: ``Prosecution should be considered where
evidence exists that an individual has committed a gross human
rights violation'' unless they have asked for amnesty.
	   _ On reconciliation: ``Reconciliation is a process which is
never-ending, is costly and often painful. For this process to
develop it is imperative that democracy and a human rights culture
be consolidated. Reconciliation is centered on the call for a more
decent, more caring and more just society.''

Sakhalin government condemns campaign to lease Kurils
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government of the Sakhalin region in Russia's
Far East has condemned a petition drive to lease the disputed Kuril
Islands to Japan, the Interfax news agency said Thursday.
	   Residents in the Kurils are collecting signatures urging their
local administrations to lease the islands to Japan or other
foreign investors for 99 years.
	   The first deputy governor of the Sakhalin region, which includes
the islands, called the campaign ``irresponsible,'' Interfax said.
	   Such actions will ``hardly encourage an inflow of investments in
Sakhalin region in general and in the Kuril Islands in
particular,'' Vladimir Shapoval said.
	   The head of the South Kuril administration, Vladimir Zema, has
also written to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov asking him to take the
Kurils under his patronage and draw investors' attention to the
islands, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The Soviet Union seized the Kuril Islands from Japan at the end
of World War II, and the dispute has prevented the Russia and Japan
from signing a peace treaty.

Kenyans consider costly retirement package for Moi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ An opposition legislator has proposed a
retirement package for President Daniel arap Moi that would cost
taxpayers 24 million Kenyan shillings (dlrs 400,000) per year.
	   Moi, 74, is serving his fifth _ and he has said final _
five-year term, which expires in 2003.
	   The generous package proposed Wednesday includes a lifetime
salary of 75 percent of his last monthly paycheck, a permanent
staff of 27, three limousines and a state funeral.
	   Anyang' Nyongo, who drafted the plan, said the package was
designed to encourage presidents to retire, rather than cling to
power.
	   In 1992, Kenya limited presidents to serving two consecutive
five-year terms.
	   Parliament asked the government to draft legislation on the
package for debate and action.
	   The proposal came days after Moi reneged on a promise to pay
200-percent raises to teachers over five years, which he had
promised during his reelection campaign. Moi said the government
has ``no money'' to give teachers.
	   The International Monetary Fund has blamed Kenya's economic
problems on high-level corruption and mismanagement, and last year
canceled a dlrs 200 million loan.
	   Under the proposal, the same retirement benefits would be
available to any future presidents who retire. Kenya's first
independence president, Jomo Kenyatta, died in office.
	   Retired presidents would be banned from participating party
politics. Nothing would be paid to a president who is impeached.

	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant
rammed an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep that was
escorting a bus full of elementary school students Thursday. The
powerful blast killed the attacker and an Israeli soldier.
	   The anti-Israeli group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack. Israel warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that he
would have to take tough steps against the militants if he wanted
the new land-for-security agreement to proceed as scheduled.
	   Arafat spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by
phone, denounced the attack and promised to track down those
responsible.
	   The suicide attack also injured three Israelis and three
Palestinian girls. The 40 Israeli children on the bus, ranging in
age from six to 14, were unharmed.
	   The 12-week West Bank troop pullback is to begin Monday, and
Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Israeli hard-liners to
call off the deal.
	   The terror attack, the second this week, makes it increasingly
difficult for Netanyahu to fend off hard-line criticism. Even
before the bombing, Netanyahu had accused the Palestinians of not
living up to security pledges, raising U.S. concerns that
implementation of the deal could be delayed.
	   Thursday's explosion went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) at
the Gush Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time,
the Israeli school bus convoy guarded by two jeeps was passing by.
	   ``I saw one Israeli jeep blow up and burn completely,'' said
Palestinian witness Jaber Yamawi. ``I saw them take out two
soldiers in ambulances.''
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb was so powerful that the jeep flipped over on its side.
The jeep and the bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in the
nearby town of Khan Yunis, were scorched and mangled.
	   The roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed from the force of the
explosion and three Palestinian girls were injured, their relatives
said. Two girls were hospitalized and a third, an 8-year-old,
remained at home with cuts to the back and hand.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler, said the jeep was still
burning an hour after the blast. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered
all over. There is oil, gas, blood. Things we see too often
lately,'' Kirshenzach told Israel radio.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A Russian-made Antonov 12 aircraft with 14
people on board has disappeared in Angola's diamond-rich northeast,
officials said Thursday.
	   The plane, owned by Angolan company Mavewa and crewed by four
Russians, disappeared Monday shortly after take-off from Nzaji
airfield, about 700 kilometers (434 miles) east of the capital
Luanda, according to Angola's civil aviation director, Branco
Ferreira.
	   The identities of those aboard was not immediately known.
	   The aircraft, bound for the capital Luanda, was thought to have
crashed in Lunda Norte or neighboring Malanje province, about 500
kilometers (310 miles) east of Luanda, Ferreira said.
	   Searches started Wednesday and were continuing, Ferreira added.
	   The government and former rebel group UNITA have clashed in the
Lunda Norte area in recent months.
	   Four Russian-crewed Antonov planes, following the same route,
have crashed this year.
	   --
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The military junta has ordered a series of
steps to try to alleviate Nigeria's acute gas shortages, including
surveillance of the country's pipelines, increased imports and the
rehabilitation of oil refineries.
	   Helicopters, patrols vans and bicycles will be used to monitor
Nigeria's thousands of miles (kilometes) of oil and gasoline
pipelines, Aret Adams, the presidential advisor on petroleum, said
Wednesday.
	   Adams said the junta has also made funds abailable to
rehabilitate oil refineries in the southeastern cities of Port
Harcourt and Warri. Both refineries operate at only about 50
percent capacity because of poor maintenance.
	   Adams said the junta will also begin enforcing military decrees
punishing
	   people for hoarding or diverting petroleum products.
	   The junta regularly announces campaigns to ease the shortages,
though none have had long-lasting effect. Many Nigerians have to
wait days in line for gasoline.
	   Oil companies say the situation will change only if the junta
frees gasoline prices and breaks the monopoly of the state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in the importation and
supply of refined products.
	   --
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ A group of 92 men, some armed with
automatic assault rifles, have sought asylum in Botswana after
fleeing from Namibia's northern Caprivi Strip, a diplomat said
Thursday.
	   Namibian High Commissioner to Botswana Joshua Hoebeb said the
group had crossed the northern Botswana border on Tuesday. The
group had indicated to the Botswana Police that they were seeking
protection from unspecified persecution in Namibia.
	   The group was being held by the Botswana police pending a
decision on their status, Hoebeb said.
	   ``We have no idea of who or what they are. That's the big
question we are trying to unravel now,'' Hoebeb said in a
telephonic interview.
	   The incident comes amid reports of unrest in the Caprivi Strip,
a 300-kilometer-long area that joins Namibia with Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Botswana and Angola.
	   Namibian security forces have been searching for a paramilitary
training camp in the area for the last two weeks.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Bank of Uganda will issue coins in
January to substitute small denomination paper bills that are
quickly tattered, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   Walugembe Musoke said the coins will be minted for values of 50,
100 and 500 shillings.
	   ``The coins will be distributed by commercial banks alongside
the currency notes until these notes are phased out. We hope the
public will accept the coins once they see the value in them,'' he
said.
	   Coins already in circulation are recognized as legal tender, but
Ugandans do not use them due to their bulkiness and the growing
double-digit inflation.
	   The Ugandan shilling is falling against the dollar and currently
stands at around 1,300 to the U.S. currency.
	   No item in Uganda sells for less than 50 shillings.
	   --
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The World Bank has approved dlrs
100 million help fund the first five-year phase of Ethiopia's
20-year plan to improve health services, a radio report said.
	   The main objective of the program is to improve health services
and provide more coverage to more Ethiopians, Radio Ethiopia said
Thursday.
	   The program will focus on the prevention and treatment of
communicable diseases, environmental health and hygiene,
reproductive health care, control and treatment of epidemic
diseases and the control of sexually transmitted diseases,
especially HIV/AIDS.

Blast aimed against far right party damages concert hall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VITROLLES, France (AP) _ A blast early Thursday heavily damaged
the electrical unit at a concert hall on the outskirts of this
southern French town controlled by the far-right National Front,
police said.
	   No one was injured in the blast at the Stadium concert hall.
	   A small group known to have carried out anti-far right attacks
in the past initially claimed responsibility for the blast, then
backed down.
	   Francs-Tireurs et Partisans, which takes its name from a World
War II Resistance group, sent a statement denying it carried out
the attack.
	   Police linked the bombing to a planned rock concert at the
Stadium sponsored by City Hall, run by Mayor Catherine Megret, wife
of the National Front's No. 2 leader, Bruno Megret.
	   Vitrolles, north of Marseille, is one of four towns controlled
by the National Front, all located in southern France. The party,
whose slogan is French First, is often accused of espousing racist
and anti-Semitic policies.
	   In a statement protesting the attack, Bruno Megret denounced
inaction by authorities in tracking down those who commit ``these
odious acts'' and for refusing special police protection to
National Front leaders and Vitrolles facilities.
	   Megret, who serves as spokesman for the municipality, blamed
political opponents of the National Front for the violence, saying
that ``calls to hate launched against the National Front ... have
been concretely put into action.''
	   There have been several attacks in the Bouche-du-Rhone region
where Vitrolles is located, apparently aimed at National Front
targets. The latest previous attack occurred early Saturday and
targeted the National Front's regional accounting offices in
Marseille.

Malaysia's PM tells regional leaders to mind own business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad warned Thursday against Southeast Asian leaders
meddling in the domestic affairs of their neighbors.
	   He said leaders who begin sniping at each other would end up
undermining the unity of the nine-nation Association of Southeast
Asian Nations.
	   ``I think if we start doing that, then that will be very bad
because we all have got a lot of things to criticize about each
other,'' he told reporters after meeting with Brunei's Sultan
Hassanal Bolkiah at his palace.
	   Mahathir is in Brunei for a two-day visit to promote trade amid
the Asian economic crisis.
	   He said any gripes between ASEAN members should be taken up
``one-to-one.''
	   Mahathir's comments were clearly directed at Philippine
President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, who
have spoken out against Malaysia's treatment of ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar, 51, after the two differed on economic
policy. Anwar began rallying opposition to Mahathir and was
arrested Sept. 20. He appeared at court hearings with a black eye,
bruises and a neck brace, saying he was beaten in police custody.
	   Anwar has pleaded innocent to 10 charges of sexual misconduct
and corruption. He goes on trial next Monday.
	   Mahathir, Asia's longest-serving ruler, has heaped scorn on
Habibie and Estrada, both in office for barely five months, for
openly discussing Anwar.
	   When Nurul Izzah, Anwar's daughter, met with both presidents, it
was shown on television around Asia. And Estrada sent her home with
a message for her father.
	   The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are founding members of
ASEAN, and Mahathir acknowledged Thursday there were problems
between member nations due to the Anwar affair. But he dismissed
those as ``hiccups.''
	   Later Thursday, Mahathir was to attend a dinner given by Sultan
Hassanal, one of the world's richest men.
	   He also was to join the sultan for breakfast before heading home
Friday. The two leaders have met for trade talks several times this
year.
	   Trade between Brunei and Malaysia has reached nearly 600 million
ringgit (dlrs 158 million) so far this year, compared to 830
million ringgit (dlrs 218 million) for 1997.
	   Although Brunei is one of the wealthiest countries in the world
_ its citizens pay no taxes and medical care and education are free
_ it has not been immune to the economic turmoil that has swept the
region.
	   Brunei's absolute monarchy is embroiled in a family feud that is
believed to have cost it some dlrs 16 billion with the collapse of
its international flagship company, Amadeo.

ANC court challenge sped up release of negative facts

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A failed court challenge by the
African National Congress on Thursday hastened rather than slowed
down the release of details about human rights abuses it was trying
to block.
	   Documents presented during an early morning court hearing showed
that the ANC killed innocent farmworkers with landmines and killed
informers during its decades-long struggle against white minority
rule.
	   President Nelson Mandela's ruling party wanted the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission to delay Thursday's scheduled release of
the 3,500-page report.
	   The ANC said it was fighting a just war against oppression and
that the panel did not give the party enough time to put forward
its defense.
	   The last-minute maneuvers by the ANC to delay the report
outraged panel chairman, retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
The former anti-apartheid leader compared the ANC to the white
government it ousted.
	   ``I have struggled against a tyranny. I didn't do that in order
to substitute it with another,'' he told journalists on Thursday.
	   Judge Wilfred Thring in Cape Town turned down the court bid and
released the report to waiting journalists.
	   The report mainly condemned the apartheid state for a range of
atrocities but also apportioned blame to the black movements
fighting for freedom.
	   The report said the ANC was involved in torturing and killing.
	   Among the abuses:
	   _ There was ``blurring of the lines'' between military and
civilian targets, causing loss of innocent lives in bomb attacks.
	   _ An ANC landmine campaign on border farms killed innocent
people, including farm laborers and their families.
	   _ Informers, defectors and mutineers were killed.
	   _ Torture was widely used by ANC security officials in their
military camps abroad. Methods included regular beatings with
sticks, being tied to a log ``like a pig on a spit,'' starvation
and lengthy periods in solitary confinement.

Australia, EU shaping up at loggerheads at next climate change

meeting &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia on Thursday again declared
itself at odds with the European Union over ways to stop the threat
of global warming.
	   The two sides first squabbled over the issue ahead of a climate
change conference in Kyoto, Japan, last year.
	   They are now bickering ahead of the next session of the United
Nations conference on climate change, to be held in Buenos Aires,
Argentina.
	   In Kyoto, Australia led forces that scuttled a European plan to
cut the developed world's greenhouse gas emissions to a level 15
percent below those of 1990 by the year 2010.
	   The Australian government's position was adopted to protect the
nation's coal industry, its second biggest export earner, which
netted 8.8 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.4 billion) last
year.
	   This time, technical issues such as the quantitative and
qualitative limits that the EU wants on emissions trading are in
dispute.
	   Many scientists say emissions of carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide and other industrial gases are important contributors
to global warming.
	   Several low-lying Pacific Island states, like Kiribati, fear
that a melting of polar ice caps, which could accompany a rapid
acceleration of global warming, might raise sea levels high enough
to obliterate them.
	   Australia is not prepared to accept either the quantitative or
the qualitative limits that the EU is suggesting on emissions
trading.
	   Senior officials, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity,
said such limits would serve no good purpose.
	   Environment Minister Robert Hill said Australia accepts its
responsibility to help protect the global environment.
	   Developed countries, including Australia, agreed in Kyoto to
reduce their collective greenhouse gas emissions by more than 5
percent from 1990 levels over a five-year period starting in 2008.
	   The Buenos Aires meeting will attempt to find practical ways to
make all that work.
	   Australia's carbon dioxide levels are still 19 percent above its
1990 base line.
	   Officials insist Australia has made solid progress in areas such
as reductions in emissions by the country's aluminum industry.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian filmmaker offered Monica Lewinsky dlrs 5
million on Thursday to play herself in a sexually explicit movie
about her relationship with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   If she refuses, director Alexander Sorokin says he still plans
to go ahead with his project using a Russian actress. No one has
been chosen yet to play Clinton.
	   Sorokin, who has written a dozen thrillers and science fiction
novels and directed several movies, said his new flick will be
sympathetic to both Clinton and Lewinsky.
	   ``It's a story of a man who can't express his normal human
feelings, falling hostage to his family, society and position,''
Sorokin said.
	   He said the movie will closely follow special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's report.
	   ``Their first serious talk only comes during their sixth sexual
contact,'' Sorokin said. ``They are constantly in haste, hiding in
a corner of the Oval Office.''
	   Sorokin said he already has Russian and foreign financial
backers lined up, including companies that finance ultranationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky's party. Most of the backers are Clinton
opponents, he said.
	   ``These people want to have a negative picture of Clinton, but I
just want to do an honest movie,'' he said at a news conference in
a parliamentary office used by Zhirinovsky's party.
	   Sorokin, 37, said he may offer Zhirinovsky a role in the movie,
which he described as a drama containing ``elements of
pornography.'' He said Zhirinovsky, who he called ``an excellent
actor for small parts'' would not play Starr.
	   Sorokin said he believes the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship
exemplifies the problems of today's world.
	   ``Today we have sex rather than love,'' he said. ``In effect, we
are having less and less sex too. Top officials are constantly
followed by cameras and can't express their feelings.''
	   Sorokin said he expects to distribute the movie mainly in the
United States and Europe, since there are few movie theaters left
in Russia and many Russians now prefer to watch videotapes at home.
	   ``I'm sure the movie will be a success. It would be interesting
for them to see how Russians perceive the story,'' he said.

Cambodia's king champions liberal democracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk, who ruled
Cambodia in the 1950s and 60s with autocratic authority, championed
liberal democracy as the best form of governance for Asian nations
in a birthday statement released Thursday.
	   Sihanouk, who turns 76 years old Saturday, wrote in a message to
the newspaper The Cambodia Daily that age had provided the wisdom
that a wide distribution of power made for more stable governance
and that so-called ``Asian values'' should not be used as an excuse
to deny Asians democracy.
	   ``In the early stages of my life as prince, I was overconfident
I knew all the answers and could judge better than our people what
is good and bad for them,'' the king wrote.
	   ``I realize now _ and recent events in the world bear me out _
that it is dangerous to place so much power into the hands of one
person,'' he said.
	   Sihanouk hailed Cambodians' eager participation in the country's
recent election as proof that Asians will embrace democracy if
given the chance.
	   ``(Liberal democracy) is the universal desire of most people
everywhere who wish to be masters of their and their children's
fate,'' the king wrote. ``Such a wish does not threaten `Asian
values' as some might argue.''
	   The message reaffirmed a change of heart over the years by the
aging head of state, who maintained close friendships with the late
communist leaders Mao Tse-tung of China and Kim Il Sung of North
Korea.
	   Sihanouk has been a fixture in Cambodian politics since he led
his country to independence from the French in 1953. After almost
two decades of unchallenged rule, he was ousted from power in 1970
in a U.S.-supported coup.
	   A disgruntled Sihanouk then lent his credibility and popularity
to a band of communist rebels that seized power in 1975 and grew to
notoriety as the fearsome Khmer Rouge, held responsible for the
deaths of nearly 2 million Cambodians in the nearly four years it
held power.
	   After a series of border disputes, the Khmer Rouge was expelled
from Phnom Penh by an invading Vietnamese army, touching off a
second civil war that dragged on until a 1991 U.N.-brokered peace
agreement.
	   Elections were held in 1993 and a coalition government of former
battlefield enemies was formed, with Sihanouk placed in a mostly
figurehead role as king.
	   But the coalition broke apart in 1997 when strongman Hun Sen
affirmed his de facto control of the country by ousting his
co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son, in a
violent coup.
	   A second election held in July saw Hun Sen claim a narrow
majority over Ranariddh, but the prince and his allies have denied
Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament necessary to approve the
next administration.

NATO's Europe Commander meets newly elected Bosnian Serbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO's military commander,
Gen. Wesley Clark, arrived on a surprise visit Thursday to meet
newly elected Bosnian Serb leaders.
	   General Clark told reporters he was here to meet the newly
elected Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, and the
Serb-member of Bosnia's three-member presidency, Zivko Radisic.
	   ``I just wanted to assure them that the members of SFOR and
international community want to work with them in a cooperative way
as we all work together to support the continued implementation of
the Dayton peace agreement,'' Clark said. SFOR refers to the
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
	   The victory by the ultranationalist Poplasen over the
Western-backed incumbent in Bosnia's September general elections
came as a blow to the international community.
	   It fears Poplasen, based on his war-time record as paramilitary
leader, may work against the Dayton peace agreement which ended the
3 1/2-year war in Bosnia.
	   ``There is no alternative to Dayton agreement and that's what we
are all working to support,'' Clark told reporters.
	   Clark was due to meet both hardline Poplasen and moderate
Radisic.

Report: Brian Laudrup to quit Chelsea for FC Copenhagen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with denial from FC Copenhagen, details;
CORRECTS days of Cup Winners Cup game to Thursday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ FC Copenhagen on Thursday denied
media reports that Chelsea's Danish striker Brian Laudrup is set to
leave the English Premier League team to join its Danish Cup
Winners Cup rival.
	   ``No agreement has been made with the Chelsea Football Club,''
FC Copenhagen manager Flemming Oestergaard said in a statement.
	   Speculation that at a deal was in the works continued, however,
as Chelsea called a news conference later Thursday to address the
Laudrup situation.
	   Trading in FC Copenhagen shares was suspended briefly on the
Copenhagen Stock Exchange following the reports of Laudrup's
transfer. The shares soared 14 percent.
	   According to the B.T. newspaper, Oestergaard had ``a super
secret meeting'' Tuesday with Chelsea director Colin Hutchinson in
London.
	   Agreement was reached on Laudrup's departure but the move was
not yet official, the TV2 channel said.
	   Laudrup, who has expressed frustration with his role at Chelsea,
wants to return to Denmark mainly because his two children don't
feel comfortable in London, TV2 said.
	   Oestergaard confirmed that representatives of the two clubs had
met. But he said the meeting was to discuss preparations for next
Thursday's Cup Winners Cup game in Copenhagen between the two
	   British and Danish media quoted unidentified Danish sources as
saying Laudrup had been offered a three-year playing contract at
Copenhagen, plus a further seven years as general manager of the
club where his father is in charge of merchandising.
	   Laudrup has criticized Chelsea player-manager Gianluca Vialli's
rotation system, in which he has often found himself relegated to
the bench. Chelsea's other strikers are Vialli, Gianfranco Zola and
Norway's Tor Andre Flo.
	   Laudrup did not play in Chelsea's 4-1 League Cup win Wednesday
night over Premier League leader Aston Villa.
	   Laudrup, who played for the Danish team which stunned the soccer
world by winning the 1992 European Championship, quit international
soccer after Denmark was ousted by Brazil in the World Cup
quarterfinals this summer.
	   Laudrup began his professional career with Danish club Broendby
and moved on to Germany where he played for Bayer 05 Uerdingen and
FC Bayern Munchen. He later played for Italian powerhouses
Fiorentina and Milan before joining the former Scottish champions
of Glasgow Rangers.
	   Laudrup joined the Danish side in 1987 and scored 21 goals in 82
matches.
	   His elder brother, Michael Laudrup, retired after the World Cup
following a standout 17-year career.

Britain's poet laureate Ted Hughes dies after battle with cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details of Plath's death, background on
Hughes' origins, comment from prime minister &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British poet laureate Ted Hughes, whose stormy
marriage to the anguished American poet Sylvia Plath dogged his
reputation after her suicide, has died, his publisher said
Thursday. He was 68.
	   Hughes died Wednesday at his home in Devon after a 18-month
battle with cancer, which he had kept secret, said Matthew Evans,
chairman of the publisher Faber and Faber.
	   ``Not only was he one of the greatest poets of the 20th century,
but he was the most extraordinary man,'' Evans said. ``The loss to
his family is inestimable.''
	   A collection of searingly intense poems published by Hughes this
year called ``Birthday Letters'' shed new light on his difficult
six-year marriage to the tortured Plath, brought him sympathy and
won him rave reviews.
	   Some Plath fans called Hughes a murderer and his name has been
repeatedly hacked off of her gravestone in Yorkshire, northern
England.
	   But the reclusive Hughes chose not to defend himself after
Plath's suicide on Feb. 11, 1963, months after he had left her for
another woman. She gassed herself in the kitchen, leaving milk and
cookies for the couple's two children in the next room.
	   Evans noted that there was ``a great deal of understanding''
after Hughes put forth his story for the first time _ and revealed
the obvious depth of his love for Plath _ in the 88 poems that make
up ``Birthday Letters,'' chronicling the couple's meeting, marriage
and separation.
	   ``He wanted `Birthday Letters' to be published because he knew
he was seriously ill. He wanted to publish the work before he
died,'' the publisher said. ``He regarded it as being of personal
importance. It was the nearest thing to an autobiography.''
	   The poems surprised many with their startling intimacy. Of the
first time the couple made love, Hughes wrote: ``You were slim and
lithe and smooth as a fish./ You were a new world. My new world./So
this is America, I marveled./ Beautiful, beautiful America.''
	   Hughes, who has been poet laureate since 1984, refused to be
interviewed about the poems, which span 25 years from the late
1960s.
	   But in a letter read by his editor, Christopher Reid, who
accepted the Forward Poetry prize for ``Birthday Letters'' on
Hughes' behalf this year, he called the book ``a gathering of the
occasions _ written with no plan over about 25 years _ in which I
tried to open a direct, private, inner contact with my first wife,
not thinking to make a poem, thinking mainly to evoke her presence
to myself and to feel her there listening.
	   ``Except for a handful, I never thought of publishing these
pieces until last year, when quite suddenly I realised I had to
publish them, no matter what the consequences.''
	   Hughes and Plath married in 1956 after meeting at Cambridge,
where she was studying on a Fulbright Scholarship. They went to the
United States in 1957, where she taught at Smith College and he
taught at the University of Massachusetts. They returned to England
in 1959, continued to write and publish poetry.
	   Plath had a history of mental problems and had first attempted
suicide three years before meeting Hughes.
	   Poet Andrew Motion, writing in The Times of London, said reading
``Birthday Letters'' was ``like being hit by a thunderbolt.''
	   ``Anyone who thought Hughes's reticence was proof of his hard
heart will immediately see how stony they have been themselves,''
Motion wrote.
	   ``Hughes is one of the most important poets of the century, and
this is his greatest book. It closes in a heart of darkness, a
black hole of grief and regret'' we stare into it feeling changed
and enriched.''
	   The book was dedicated to the couple's children, Nicholas and
Frieda.
	   At the time of its publication, Frieda, a 34-year-old artist,
said in a newspaper interview that she had lived under the burden
of her mother's suicide.
	   ``I never read my parents' poetry until a couple of years ago,''
she said. ``I even rejected the chance to study my father's work
for school exams. It was too close to home.''
	   Ted Hughes was the son of a carpenter, born Aug. 17, 1930, in
the bleak mill town of Mytholmroyd in Yorkshire, northern England.
	   He began writing poems in grammar school, under the tutelage of
an English teacher. After studying English, archaeology and
anthropology at England's Cambridge University, he took a number of
part-time jobs to support his writing.
	   His first volume of poems, ``Hawk in the Rain,'' was published
in 1957 and set the scene for his later work with its unsentimental
and savage view of the natural world.
	   Hughes, who remarried in 1970, published more than 35 poems and
collections of verse, three works of prose, two opera libretti and
four stage plays. He was a successful children's writer as well,
publishing five poetic works for young people and seven stories
including the popular ``The Iron Man'' _ published in 1968 in the
United States as ``The Iron Giant.''
	   In January, he won the Whitbread Book of the Year award for
``Tales of Ovid,'' his reworking of Ovid's ``Metamorphosis,'' which
the judges described as a work of ``greatness and sublimity.''
	   Hughes' last appearance in public was 13 days ago when he
accepted the Order of Merit, a rare honor, from Queen Elizabeth II
at Buckingham Palace.
	   ``The queen was informed this morning of the death of Ted
Hughes,'' a palace statement said. ``She was very saddened and will
be in touch with his family. She was grateful for the opportunity
to recognise his work and achievements, before he died, through the
award of the Order of Merit.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a statement saying, ``He was a
towering figure in 20th-century literature who even in his last
years was producing great works, and his contribution to the body
of great British poetry was immense.''

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch cut through the
Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds
whirling for a second day through resort islands and mainland
communities. At least 32 people were killed and widespread flooding
prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground.
	   Mitch, once among the century's most powerful hurricanes,
weakened today as it blasted this Central American nation, bringing
downpours that flooded at least 50 rivers. It also kicked up huge
waves that pounded seaside communities.
	   The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, it had sustained
winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 kph) around
midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of early
Tuesday.
	   After remaining virtually stationary for more than a day, the
U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center of the
350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly to the
south but remained just off the Honduran coast. Hurricane-force
winds whirled up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with
rain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that.

a herd of cows that had wandered onto the track, injuring the

Criminal charges brought against independent radio director
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Charges were brought against the
director of an independent Belgrade radio station for defying a
government ban by broadcasting without a license, media reported
Thursday.
	   The charges against Nenad Cekic, director of the small but
influential Radio Index, represent continued crackdown against
independent Serbian media by President Slobodan Milosevic's
government.
	   Cekic could be sentenced to up to eight years in jail if found
guilty. His radio, often critical of Milosevic's hard-line
policies, was banned on Oct. 8 for not having a broadcast license.
	   Radio Index and other members of an independent electronic media
organization have been denied licenses for years, giving the
government leverage to shut down them when their broadcasts become
critical of authorities.
	   Defying the ban, Radio Index continued its one-hour daily
broadcast over the airwaves of another popular independent Belgrade
radio station, B 92.
	   Last week, Serbian parliament passed a new media law severely
restricting press freedom and instituting heavy fines for media
publishing or broadcasting ``anti-patriotic'' and
``anti-government'' stories.
	   As the result, four major independent Belgrade newspapers
stopped publishing out of fear of the huge fines that would force
them to close down indefinitely.
	   Over the weekend, a Belgrade court fined the Evropljanin, or
European, weekly dlrs 246,000 for publishing articles that accused
Milosevic of leading Serbia into political and economic chaos.
	   On Wednesday, the court ordered the chief editor of the weekly,
Dragan Bujosevic, to pay a third of his salary to the state each
month until his part of the roughly dlrs 40,000-fine was settled.

Report: Malaysia delaying massive highway projects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has mothballed two
massive highway projects worth dlrs 1 billion in favor of building
low-income housing, a news report said Thursday.
	   Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed said the funds allotted
for the South Klang Valley Expressway and a new airport highway
would be channeled toward constructing cheaper accommodations.
	   ``We have enough highways for now and can make do without the
new highway projects for the time being,'' he was quoted as saying
in Thursday editions of the New Straits Times.
	   He said the Cabinet decided to defer the projects because it
didn't receive any complaints from drivers who commuted to and from
the newly built Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
	   The government had initially agreed to supply soft loans worth 1
billion ringgit (dlrs 260 million) for these projects, which had a
33-year concession period. The rest of funding was supposed to have
come from the private sector and other sources.
	   Malaysia has fallen victim to a prolonged regional economic
crisis and recently announced it was in recession, forcing it to
delay numerous big-ticket building projects.

Uzbek president bans excessively lavish celebrations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of Uzbekistan has banned excessively
lavish celebrations, be they weddings, family reunions or funerals.
	   ``Such prejudices of the past as vanity, pomp and excessive
spending permeate weddings, family celebrations and funerals,''
says the decree by President Islam Karimov.
	   ``The deservedly reproachable behavior of some conceited
individuals harms ordinary people, their self-esteem, faith in
justice and state authorities,'' the decree said, according to the
Interfax news agency on Thursday.
	   Karimov said the money could be better spent on charities or for
building roads and bridges.
	   Interfax did not say how Karimov proposed to enforce the ban or
give any other details.

Visitors pleased with Thailand's preparation for Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand showed its nearly complete
facilities for the Asian Games to a tough jury Thursday _ the heads
of the organizing committees from the 43 nations competing in the
December event.
	   Thailand won host rights for the quadrennial games in 1995, but
setbacks in preparations led officials of the Olympic Council of
Asia late last year to threaten to move the games to another
country. They complained that the Thai organizers were behind in
constructing facilities and had failed to keep them informed.
	   It appeared that Thursday's tour was successful in reassuring
everyone.
	   ``We have a strong of sense of relief,'' said Abdul Muttaleb
al-Ahmad, director general of the Kuwait-based Olympic Council of
Asia and a frequent critic of Thailand's organizing committee.
``Everything is 99 percent completed.''
	   In a welcoming speech, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai
Rattakul, also chairman of the Thai organizing committee, told
delegation members to cast aside any doubts over whether the Dec.
6-20 games will be a success.
	   ``I can hereby confirm that regardless of what Thailand has
faced, we ... have tried to accommodate all requests for the 13th
Asian Games,'' said Bhichai.
	   Since the Thai organizers began their preparations, they have
faced many difficulties, most of them resulting from the country's
financial crisis, he said. But the country was able to pull it
through, he added.
	   ``This is an example of Asia's resiliency. We have financial
problems in all of Asia but still we are able to prepare
commendably,'' said Manuel Veguillas, head of the Philippine
delegation.
	   ``I am impressed,'' said Tu Mingde, secretary-general of China's
Olympic Committee. ``The games will be a success.''
	   Still, Bangkok's infamous traffic jams did not go overlooked.
	   ``My only concern now is the road construction leading to the
site,'' said Kenji Ono from Japan.
	   Construction workers are trying to ensure that the road leading
to the stadium, including a flyover at a key intersection, will be
completed on time for the games.
	   The Olympic Council of Asia, meanwhile, is working with the
Bangkok Organizing Committee to come up with a contingency plan in
case of any possible emergency, said its director general,
Muttaleb.
	   ``You cannot really anticipate anything,'' he said, as he toured
the main stadium of the Sports Authority of Thailand. ``Any venue
can have a problem, such as electrical failure.''

Turkey, Caspian countries sign pact backing oil pipeline

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey and four Caspian states signed a
declaration Thursday backing the construction of an oil pipeline
across Turkey as the main export route to carry oil from Caspian
Sea's rich oil fields.
	   The declaration was a triumph for Turkey, which got most of the
countries involved in the project _ apart from Russia and
Turkmenistan _ to declare their support for a pipeline running from
the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Turkish Mediterranean port
of Ceyhan. The route also crosses Georgia.
	   ``This is the most environmentally sound, economically rational
project for the export of Caspian oil,'' Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said.
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson witnessed the signing
ceremony in a show of Washington's commitment to the project.
	   The declaration was signed by the presidents of Turkey,
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan. Turkmen President
Saparmurad Turkmenbasi refused to sign the declaration but gave no
reason.
	   ``Now the issue is not whether Baku-Ceyhan is going to happen,
because it is going to happen. The issue is how,'' Richardson told
The Associated Press following the signing ceremony.
	   The United States favors the 1,730-kilometer (1,075-mile)
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline because it would help bind Azerbaijan, Georgia
and Turkey closer to the West, and it would not pass through either
Russia or Iran, which have proposed routes of their own.
	   Last week, Washington announced a Trade Development Agency aid
of dlrs 823,000 for the pipeline.
	   Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev said the declaration sealed
the future of the Caspian oil to flow through Baku-Ceyhan despite
``circles that want to block its realization.''
	   Caspian oil reserves provide one of the world's richest oil
resources. There has been a great battle to get the oil flow
through Turkey against plans by international companies to use
shorter routes that would carry the oil through the narrow Turkish
Straits.
	   In the declaration, the presidents strongly confirmed their
determination to make the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan project the main
export pipeline.
	   Turkey has been lobbying energy companies to choose the Caspian
route. The companies are expected to announce their decision Nov.
12.
	   The main alternative is an existing pipeline from Baku to the
Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa. Oil companies reportedly have
been favoring that route, showing reluctance to invest in the dlrs
2.5 billion cost of the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.
	   Turkey's main argument against other routes is the heavy oil
tanker traffic through the Bosporus strait, which has led to
hundreds of accidents.

Hamas claims responsibility for car bomb explosion in Gaza

<TEXT>
	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant
rammed an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep that was
escorting a bus full of elementary school students Thursday. The
powerful blast killed the attacker and a soldier.
	   The anti-Israeli group Hamas claimed responsibility and Israel
warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that he would have to take
tough steps against the militants if he wanted the new
land-for-security agreement to proceed as scheduled.
	   Arafat spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin by phone,
denounced the attack and promised to track down those responsible.
	   The suicide attack also injured three Israelis and three
Palestinan girls. The 40 Israeli children on the bus, ranging in
age from six to 14, were unharmed.
	   The 12-week West Bank troop pullback is to begin Monday, and
Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Israeli hard-liners to
call off the deal.
	   The terror attack, the second this week, makes it increasingly
difficult for Netanyahu to fend off hard-line criticism. Even
before the bombing, Netanyahu had accused the Palestinians of not
living up to security pledges, raising U.S. concerns that
implementation of the deal could be delayed.
	   Thursday's explosion went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 gmt) at
the Gush Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time,
the Israeli school bus convoy guarded by two jeeps was passing by.
	   Nine-year-old Eran Ayoubi, who was on the bus, said he had just
finished his daily traveler's prayer and said ``amen'' when he
heard a loud boom and the windows around him were shattered.
	   His 10-year-old sister Adar said she and many of the other
children began to cry and were ordered by the driver to drop to the
floor of the bus for cover.
	   ``There was terrible smoke everywhere. I thought I was going to
be burned,'' Adar said, sitting on her bicycle parked on a sidewalk
outside her home in the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom.
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb was so powerful that the jeep flipped over on its side.
The jeep and the bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in the
nearby town of Khan Yunis, were scorched and mangled.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler, said the jeep was still
burning an hour after the blast. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered
all over. There is oil, gas, blood,'' Kirshenzach told Israel
radio.
	   Pieces of black debris were scattered over a 50-yard radius. A
black, scorched shoe lay in the middle of the road.
	   The roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed from the force of the
explosion and three Palestinian girls were injured, their relatives
said. Two girls were hospitalized and a third, an 8-year-old,
remained at home with cuts to the back and hand.
	   After the attack, the Israeli children were taken to their
school in in Gush Katif settlement bloc before returning home to
Kfar Darom. In school, the children talked about their experience.
The children spoke of the big boom and flames and many asked about
their friends on a second bus, said Principal Yitzhak Amitai.
	   In a call to Israel radio, a man who said he spoke for Hamas
read a claim of responsibility. ``It's a revolution until
victory,'' the caller said, suggesting the attacks would continue.
	   The spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was evasive
when asked whether Hamas was responsible. Yassin said the group
wanted to avoid Palestinian civil war and would not react violently
to a possible crackdown by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The army sealed to Gaza Strip for about five hours in response
to the attack.
	   Arafat insisted that despite the attack, Israel stick to its
side of the peace agreement and withdraw from land and release
Palestinian prisoners. He said the Palestinian Authority would
track down those involved in plotting the attack and ``try them for
deliberately harming the Palestinians' national interests.''
	   Samia, the Israeli commander, said the identity of the suicide
bomber was known and that he was a resident of the nearby
Palestinian town of Khan Yunis.
	   Palestinian officials, however, said they only had the name of
the car's owner, a man from Khan Yunis. The man was detained for
questioning by Palestinian police.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Israel would
watch the Palestinian Authority's response closely.
	   ``The basis for progress in the (peace) process depends first
and foremost on intensive action against terrorism,'' Mordechai
said. ``If this is done, we will make progress.''
	   Implementation of the new peace agreement is to begin Monday.
Under the accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants.

Bank sale to start in first half of 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The sale of the ailing bank Credit Lyonnais will go
ahead in the first half of next year, markets willing, French
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn announced Thursday.
	   But he made clear that France's Socialist-led government has
built in a protection structure against hostile suitors.
	   A careful shareholder structure ``is the best way to guarantee
the interests of the state, the bank, employees and tax payers,''
Strauss-Kahn told a news conference.
	   The government plans to construct a core minority share holding
group in the bank, holding less than a one-third stake and made up
of Credit Lyonnais' current commercial partners, or any new
investors who want to set up commercial ties with the bank, he
said.
	   These shareholders will underwrite an 8-billion franc (about
dlrs 1.5 billion) capital increase in the bank in early 1999.
	   The government intends to retain a 10 percent stake in Credit
Lyonnais, the minister said. Taken with the core share holding
group, this would create a blocking minority interest in the group.
	   The rest of Credit Lyonnais's shares will be floated to the
public in the first half of 1999, market conditions permitting,
Strauss-Kahn said. He expressed optimism that the current global
financial crisis will have ebbed by then.
	   The announcement on Credit Lyonnais' privatization follows the
decision May 20 by the European Union to approve a French
government rescue package for the bank. In return, the French
government agreed the bank had to shed 620 billion francs (about
dlrs 112 billion) in assets and be privatized before October 1999.
	   The French arrangement implies there is unlikely to be a repeat
of the events of last year when Italian insurer Assicurazione
Generalli made a hostile takeover bid for formerly state-owned
Assurances Generales de France.
	   That move was stymied by German insurer Allianz, encouraged by
the French government, which made a friendly counter bid for AGF
that included a commitment to respect the French insurer's
autonomy.
	   Allianz is one of three companies which has voiced its interest
in taking a small stake in Credit Lyonnais as part of a core share
holding group. French insurer AXA and investment bank Paribas, both
with close commercial ties to Credit Lyonnais, have also said they
would like to do the same.
	   Strauss-Kahn said that Societe Generale was the only major
French bank that he had not heard express an interest in Credit
Lyonnais.

Rail fire revives memories of '87 disaster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Thousands of commuters were delayed Thursday after
an early morning fire closed the Kings Cross railway station and
revived memories of a 1987 blaze that killed 31 at the busy central
city terminal.
	   Firefighters responded after gas cylinders exploded at a freight
yard north of the Kings Cross station at about 3:30 a.m. (0330
GMT), police said. Five tons of trash and debris were ablaze at the
yard and firefighters were on the scene well into the morning rush
hour after more cylinders were discovered.
	   No one was injured.
	   A dropped match started the Nov. 17, 1987, fire at the end of
evening rush hour in one of the terminal's subway stations. An
official inquiry said haphazard staff response and complacency
among managers contributed to the disaster, the worst in the
130-year history of the city's rail system.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Fire swept through a cold storage
plant under construction, killing at least 25 workers and injuring
15 others Thursday in the southern port city of Pusan, police said.
	   Police said the fire, believed to have been ignited by welding
sparks, engulfed the three upper floors of the eight-story
structure, trapping dozens of people inside.
	   Most of the dead suffocated in toxic gas that filled parts of
the building, they said. Clusters of bodies were found in the
stairways leading to the rooftop.
	   The blaze was put out in two hours but firefighters had
difficulty moving into the building because of the gas.
	   Fifteen people, including 10 workers and five firefighters, were
hospitalized with burns and other injuries, police said. Some
suffered broken legs and back injuries after jumping from the
building.
	   About a half dozen workers escaped to the roof, where they were
later rescued by helicopter, police said.

Ukraine, U.S., Poland launch new joint cooperation program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Senior government officials from the United
States, Ukraine and Poland announced a joint program Thursday aimed
at helping Ukraine use Poland's experience in implementing market
reforms.
	   Stephen Sestanovich, an adviser to the U.S. Secretary of State,
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tyhypko and his Polish
counterpart, Przemyslaw Grudzinski, praised the program as another
step in developing relations among the three countries.
	   ``We received U.S. support at a difficult phase of our
transformation, and we want to share this experience with
Ukraine,'' Grudzinski told a news conference.
	   Tyhypko said Ukraine could greatly benefit from the
implementation of macroeconomic reforms, development of small
businesses and reform of local government envisaged by the
initiative.
	   He said that Poland's per capita income, which equaled that of
Ukraine eight years ago, now exceeds Ukraine's three times as a
result of radical economic reforms implemented over the period.
	   ``This proves once again that Ukraine must pursue reform
policies,'' Tyhypko said.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development is to provide much
of the funding for the program's projects, including training for
local government officials, educational seminars and projects to
assist small businesses.

German, British foreign ministers share concern over Kosovo,
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, in
Britain for introductory meetings with the government, said
Thursday that the two countries were committed to finding peace in
Kosovo and shared concern about Russian stability.
	   Fischer, a member of the Green Party, was sworn in Tuesday as
part of Gerhard Schroeder's new leftist government.
	   After his meeting with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the
two men said they would encourage closer cooperation within the
European Union, particularly on environmental issues _ including
the disposal by Russia of nuclear waste on its western borders.
	   Both countries also made a commitment to provide 200 members for
the verification team in the Serb province of Kosovo to help
enforce the Holbrooke agreement, under which Serbia has agreed to
withdraw troops from the war-torn province.
	   On Wednesday, shortly before setting off on his trip to France,
Britain and Poland, Fischer called France ``the most important
partner'' in Europe, but he also singled out British Prime Minister
Tony Blair as an ally.
	   He voiced concern then about Russia's stability in view of the
country's financial crisis.
	   At a news conference here Thursday, Cook said Germany and
Britain had agreed Europe could not afford to stand by and watch
its vast neighbor plunge further into chaos.
	   ``We are both agreed that the urgent priority for the security
policy is to develop a common position addressing both the
political and the economic situation in Russia,'' he said.
	   Cook and Fischer committed themselves to meeting at least every
six months and for their European ministers to hold talks every
three months.
	   Earlier this week, Fischer said the new German government would
seek continuity in foreign policy but also put more stress human
rights and economic development.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Primakov quote in grafs 4-5, ADDS new grafs 9-13
on release of hostages, rally in Chechnya. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov flew Thursday to
the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia where he met with the
leaders of several restive regions, including secessionist
Chechnya.
	   Primakov arrived in Vladikavkaz, capital of North Ossetia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   ITAR-Tass said he met the presidents of North Ossetia and
Ingushetia and discussed a permanent settlement to 1992 fighting
between ethnic Ingush and Ossetians.
	   Primakov said he hoped his presence would help ease turmoil in
the troubled region.
	   The trip ``offers a real chance to stabilize the socio-political
and economic situation in the region, to promote cooperation
between the federal authorities and leaders of the region,''
Primakov said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   The Interfax news agency said Primakov also met with Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov, who wants Russia to help repair damage
caused during their 1994-96 war.
	   Maskhadov's press secretary, Mairbek Vachagayev, said they would
also discuss hostage-takings and other crimes, which have been
rampant in Chechnya since the end of the war.
	   Chechen law enforcement officials are in the midst of a
crackdown on hostage-takings. More than 100 people, including five
foreigners, are believed to be held.
	   Police raided two criminal groups Thursday morning, releasing
five hostages and arresting 14 people, said Chechen Security
Minister Aslanbek Arsayev, according to Interfax.
	   The five released hostages were an Armenian, a Cherkessian and
three Chechens.
	   Law enforcement officials from North Ossetia also freed an
additional three men who had been held for more than eight months
in Chechnya on Wednesday night, ITAR-Tass said. The men were from
Ukraine, North Ossetia, and Azerbaijan.
	   Despite the releases, about 2,000 heavily armed soldiers
gathered at a rally in the Chechen capital of Grozny on Thursday,
and again called that Maskhadov face trial for alleged violations
of the constitution.
	   Participants at the rally, which was led by former rebel leader
Shamil Basayev, also criticized Maskhadov for meeting with
Primakov.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war, but no country has recognized its independence claim. Moscow
insists the territory remains part of Russia.

West Indies set Pakistan a stiff total of 290
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ West Indies have set Pakistan a stiff
target of 290 runs in their stipulated 50 overs in the last quarter
final match of the $400,000 Wills International Cup at the
Bangabandhu national stadium Thursday.
	   Though the West Indies lost an early wicket of opener Stuart
Williams for 14 runs to Azhar Mahmood's ball, they kept a brisk
scoring rate with Philo Wallace scoring the fastest fifty in the
tournament.
	   Wallace was eventually run out for 79. Skipper Brian Lara was
dismissed for 16 runs caught by Saqlain Mushtaq to the bowling of
Arshad Khan.
	   Shivnaraine Chanderpaul, who scored a solid 49, and Carl Hooper
with 33 runs were the other notable contributors for the West
Indies.

Primakov: Russian government wants more control over economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with agriculture minister comments, grafs. 11-12 &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government has ``resolutely opted'' to
take more control over the economy to pull it out of its worst
crisis since the Soviet collapse, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said Thursday.
	   Primakov was commenting on the government's long-awaited plan
for coping with the crisis, which was presented to the
International Monetary Fund on Wednesday.
	   The government hoped the plan would persuade the IMF to release
another installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan frozen after the
Russian economy fell apart in mid-August.
	   The IMF said it wanted to study the plan, Russian media
reported. Visiting IMF officials were scheduled to leave Moscow on
Thursday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``They realized that the situation in Russia is very difficult,
but not hopeless,'' Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin told the
Interfax news agency.
	   The plan calls for tighter currency controls, price controls on
medicines and some basic foods, a food reserve to help the country
through the winter and indexing wages and pensions to compensate
Russians for rising inflation.
	   It tackles the tax system, lowering some income, property and
profit tax rates but tightening the rules in hopes of making more
people pay. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has
left it consistently short on cash and helped contribute to the
current crisis.
	   Primakov said Thursday the government also wanted to restore
``order and discipline'' in contracts, an apparent reference to
loopholes in export-import regulations that allow money to be
illegally sent abroad. Russian companies are believed to have
stashed billions of dollars overseas.
	   ``The state must (also) determine the parameters and trends in
industrial restructuring,'' Primakov said in the southern Russian
city of Vladikavkaz, where he was holding talks with leaders of
restive regions in the Caucasus Mountains.
	   He did not elaborate, but was presumably referring to a renewed
emphasis on Russia's manufacturing sector, particularly the huge
military-industrial complex. Western analysts have long urged many
of those companies be closed or converted to other uses because,
while they employ many people, there is no market for their goods
and they are unprofitable.
	   Meanwhile, Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor Semyonov
rejected speculation that Russia may face food shortages this
winter, but warned that in food prices may become too high in some
regions for the low-income people.
	   He also called for greater state control over agricultural
markets to ensure deliveries of inexpensive food to troubled
regions.
	   Vyugin, the deputy finance minister, said the main emphasis of
the talks with the IMF was on the budget for the last three months
of this year and for 1999.
	   ``The IMF insists that the budget for the fourth quarter be made
very rigorous,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko reiterated
his opposition to any limits on the circulation of U.S. dollars and
other foreign currencies in Russia. Russian media had previously
reported that was to have been part of the plan to cope with the
crisis, on the grounds that it would strengthen the ruble.
	   ``The dollar must not be banned,'' Gerashchenko said. ``It's
impossible.''
	   The Central Bank announced Thursday it had revoked the license
of Inkombank, which had been one of the country's biggest retail
banks, because it was practically insolvent.
	   The Central Bank also said that its gold and foreign currency
reserves rose by dlrs 200 million in the fourth week of October to
dlrs 13.3 billion.

Cruise gets libel damages, but can't rent a video
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Actor Tom Cruise and his wife Nicole Kidman
accepted ``substantial'' libel damages on Thursday from a British
newspaper that reported he was gay and that their marriage was a
sham to cover it up.
	   Dressed in a gray suit, the 36-year-old star of ``Top Gun'' and
``Jerry McGuire'' showed up in court to hear a public apology for
the publication of a ``highly offensive'' article in the Oct. 5,
1997, Express on Sunday Magazine, which also said he was impotent
and sterile.
	   ``I don't take a whole lot of pleasure in being here today,''
Cruise said afterward. ``It is the last recourse against those that
published vicious lies about me and my family. I have to protect
them. This was certainly not about money. Every penny of this very
substantial sum will be donated to charities.''
	   The amount of the settlement was undisclosed, but Express
Newspapers is believed to have paid damages in excess of 100,000
pounds (dlrs 167,000) to each of the two actors and their legal
costs of 150,000 pounds (dlrs 250,500).
	   The movie star, flanked by lawyers and police, was mobbed by
fans and female court staff as he left the courtroom, in contrast
to his treatment recently when he tried to rent a video at a
Blockbuster outlet north of London.
	   Although employees at the store in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire,
recognized him immediately, Cruise was denied a membership because
he didn't have the required two forms of identification.
	   ``For security and mailing purposes we need to know where our
customers are,'' said a Blockbuster spokesman, who declined to give
his name. ``There is no special dispensation _ even if you are a
household name.''
	   Cruise, who has lived in Britain for two years with Kidman and
their two adopted children, understood that ``rules are rules,''
the spokesman said.
	   Kidman currently is enjoying rave reviews for her performance in
``The Blue Room'' on the London stage.

Yugoslav army calls on draft dodgers to turn themselves in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army has invited tens
of thousands draft dodgers to turn themselves in to avoid court
martial, an army official was quoted as saying Thursday.
	   Lt. Gen. Ratomir Ristic of the Yugoslav Army General Staff said
young men evading their compulsory, 12-month military duty have
until Dec. 1 to turn themselves in and join the forces. After that
date, the army would initiate lawsuits against all dodgers, an army
magazine Vojska quoted Ristic as saying.
	   An estimated 200,000 young Yugoslavs, many of them of military
age, have fled for the West since 1991, when the country started
disintegrating in a bloody civil war.
	   Thousands of them have reportedly dodged the draft since
February, when the Serbs launched a crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists in the troubled province of Kosovo.
	   As the old Yugoslav federation began to break apart, President
Slobodan Milosevic used the Yugoslav People's Army to intervene in
the republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia.
	   ``We are giving these young men a chance to correct their
mistake and not suffer any legal repercussions,'' said Ristic.
	   He said the warning was sent to draft dodgers at home and
abroad. Those living outside of the country were advised to contact
Yugoslav embassies and consular departments.
	   The legal age for military service in Yugoslavia is between 18
and 35, although it is common practice for young men to join the
army immediately after high school.
	   Ristic also said the dodgers would have to present viable
excuses for not answering the army's call, adding that police have
carefully listed all those who evaded the service.
	   ``Cowards and deserters can not hope for perpetual amnesty from
the state,'' Ristic said.

Greg Norman disappointed in Bill Clinton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Golf star Greg Norman, a friend of Bill
Clinton, said Thursday he was disappointed in the U.S. president
because of the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   ``Yes I am disappointed in him,'' Norman said in an interview on
Australian pay-television network Foxtel. ``I'll tell you why:
because I carry the Constitution of the United States around in my
briefcase with me and every now and then I like to read it because
I live there and I like to understand the rules I live under.
	   ``I pay taxes over there, so to me a person in that position
should always abide by, or should even be a little bit above, the
Constitution of the United States because purely and simply he is a
role model; people all look up to him because of the position he's
in.''
	   Norman also said Clinton did a ``terrible job'' in his speech to
the American public in August admitting to an inappropriate
relationship with Lewinsky.
	   He said Clinton should ``just get out there and express to the
public and the people of America just how (he) feels,'' Norman
said. ``On the other side of the fence, taking away the personal
side of it, he's been a phenomenal president.''
	   A friendship has developed in recent years between Norman and
Clinton. Norman was unwittingly drawn into the Lewinsky saga on his
last visit to Australia earlier this year.
	   He was forced to deny media reports that Lewinsky had
accompanied Clinton on a visit to Norman's Florida house in March
1997, when the president injured his ankle falling down a flight of
stairs.

Kangaroo attack prompts compensation claim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A 15-year-old boy who claims a kangaroo
tried to maul him to death is suing the golf club where he was
attacked for 750,000 Australian dollars (U.S dlrs 450,000), a court
heard Thursday.
	   Steven Shorten of Grafton, north of Sydney, described his horror
when the large male kangaroo grabbed him around the waist, knocked
him down and jumped on him, gouging a wound in his right cheek,
fracturing his cheekbone and slashing his abdomen, back and legs.
	   Ross Letherbarrow, the lawyer representing the boy's father,
Rodney Shorten, presented to the Sydney District Court a
bloodstained and torn T-shirt and pair of shorts the boy was
allegedly wearing at the time of the attack on Oct. 27, 1996.
	   Letherbarrow told the court the boy, who was 13 at the time, was
attacked near the fourth hole while searching for his friend's golf
ball in long grass.
	   The boy heard a ``tut, tut, tut'' noise, then a ``weird
growling.''
	   He turned around to find a large gray kangaroo standing upright
on its tail. He began backing away from the animal, then ran when
it came hopping toward him.
	   ``He tried to fend it off with his golf club but it knocked him
to the ground. The kangaroo effectively tried to kill him,''
Letherbarrow said.
	   The boy was rescued by a local primary school principal, Robert
Ellison, who was playing nearby and came running when he heard the
boy's screams.
	   Ellison told the court he sprinted to the scene and found the
kangaroo standing over Steven. He said he hit it in the head with
his driver and it hopped away.
	   The boy continues to suffer nightmares, sleep deprivation and
nervousness around animals, and has been taunted at school, where
he has been called Skippy, the court heard.
	   Shorten contends the golf club was negligent in failing to erect
a kangaroo fence around the course, failing to warn golfers not to
go near the animals and failing to monitor the kangaroo population
and remove aggressive animals.
	   The case continues.

New German foreign minister to meet Polish leaders

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish leaders are looking for an outline
of Germany's new policy toward its eastern neighbors as well as its
position on European integration during a visit here Thursday by
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
	   Warsaw is the final step of Fischer's three-nation trip, his
first since he was sworn in Tuesday. He visited Paris on Wednesday
and spent the night in London.
	   The trip was aimed at reassuring European partners the new
German government will stress continuity, but the Fischer's
comments Wednesday about ``realism'' in accepting new EU members
like Poland, have put Poles, accustomed to former Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's open support for EU expansion, on alert.
	   Shortly after arriving Thursday afternoon, Fischer is meeting
his Polish counterpart Bronislaw Geremek, Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek and President Aleksander Kwasniewski, during nearly seven
hours in Warsaw.
	   ``We are very happy that minister Fisher is coming to Warsaw at
the very start of his (government) career,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Pawel Dobrowolski said.
	   He said Geremek, who has expressed reservations about the future
of Polish-German relations under the new Social Democratic-led
government, is looking forward to establishing a direct contact
with Fischer, a member of the Greens party, junior partner in the
German government.
	   Polish leaders would like to hear answers on ``certain questions
that have appeared in the first days'' of the new Bonn coalition,
concerning ``the new German Ostpolitik,'' Dobrowolski said.
	   Let's also see what this new realism means, he added.
	   Dobrowolski said German officials have requested two additional
points on the busy agenda. Fisher will stop at two World War II
memorials in Warsaw commemorating the 1943 Jewish Ghetto struggle
and the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis.
	   ``It is a splendid initiative of the German side,'' Dobrowolski
said.
	   The a gesture is expected to underline Germany's continuing
commitment to forging a special bond with Poland. Having turned
France from foe to friend in the decades since World War II,
Germany has sought to repeat the process eastward with Poland since
the end of the Cold War.

Philippine president donates one-year salary to typhoon victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Thursday
donated 600,000 pesos (dlrs 15,000), the equivalent of his salary
for one year, to a fund for victims of recent typhoons in the
Philippines, the presidential palace said.
	   Estrada gave the money to start off a fund-raising campaign, and
asked other Filipinos to help.
	   At least two Chinese-Filipino associations immediately donated 3
million pesos (dlrs 75,000), the palace said.
	   Estrada also ordered officials of the government-run national
sweepstakes office to set up six special lotteries and donate the
proceeds to victims of the four typhoons that have ravaged the
country since September. The storms left at least 370 people dead,
more than 200,000 others homeless and millions of dollars worth of
crops and property destroyed.
	   On Wednesday, the Philippine Red Cross sought help from its
international counterparts for the victims. The international Red
Cross said it is launching an appeal for 3 million Swiss francs
(about dlrs 2.2 million) ``in urgent humanitarian assistance.''
	   The last time the Philippine Red Cross sought international help
was in 1995, when Typhoon Angela devastated the northern
Philippines. It also requested help following the eruption of Mount

Sudan urges immediate food supplies for southern province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A Sudanese government aid agency pleaded
for immediate help on Thursday for a southern province it said
faced possible famine.
	   The Humanitarian Aid Commission said in a written statement that
current food supplies in Bahr el-Ghazal province would only last
four weeks. It said food is badly needed arrives to battle
malnutrition.
	   ``Renewing of extended food supplies should be speeded up,''
said the statement carried by the official Sudanese News Agency.
	   Hunger is a persistent problem in southern Sudan, where a
15-year civil war often has led to famine because rebels or
government-backed militias burned or stole crops that their enemy
or civilians rely on.
	   About 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and resultant
famines.
	   Aid workers estimate an equal number of million people are
facing severe food shortages in southern Sudan, mainly in Bahr
el-Ghazal, as a result of drought and fighting.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is dropping 9,500 tons of food a
month at a cost of dlrs 30 million into the south in the world's
largest aid operation.
	   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting the
Muslim government in the north since 1983 to demand more autonomy
for Christian and animist people in the south.
	   Both sides declared a cease-fire to allow international aid
agencies work in the southern provinces. The government has said it
applies to all of the south, while the SPLA said it is restricted
to Bahr el-Ghazal, where the famine is concentrated.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ West Indies have set Pakistan a stiff
target of 290 runs in their stipulated 50 overs in the last quarter
final match of the $400,000 Wills International Cup at the
Bangabandhu national stadium Thursday.
	   Though the West Indies lost an early wicket of opener Stuart
Williams for 14 runs to Azhar Mahmood's ball, they kept a brisk
scoring rate with Philo Wallace scoring the fastest fifty in the
tournament.
	   Wallace was eventually run out for 79. Skipper Brian Lara was
dismissed for 16 runs caught by Saqlain Mushtaq to the bowling of
Arshad Khan.
	   Shivnaraine Chanderpaul, who scored a solid 49, and Carl Hooper
with 33 runs were the other notable contributors for the West
Indies.

<TEXT>
	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch cut through the
Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds
whirling for a third day through resort islands and mainland
communities. At least 32 people were killed and widespread flooding
prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground.
	   Mitch, once among the century's most powerful hurricanes,
weakened today as it blasted this Central American nation, bringing
downpours that flooded at least 50 rivers. It also kicked up huge
waves that pounded seaside communities.
	   The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, it had sustained
winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 kph) around
midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of early
Tuesday.
	   After remaining virtually stationary for more than a day, the
U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center of the
350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly to the
south but remained just off the Honduran coast. Hurricane-force
winds whirled up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with
rain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that.
	   Caught near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about
25 miles (40 kilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with
divers and beachcombers.
	   ``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike
Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off
the coast. ``Few houses have remained standing.''
	   Honduran officials said 14 people had died on that small island
alone, and at least nine had died elsewhere in the country. More
than 72,000 people had been evacuated to shelters.
	   Nine other deaths had been reported elsewhere in the region by
early Thursday _ more than a day after Mitch drifted to just off
the coast and seemed to park there. An American was thrown from his
boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on Monday and was presumed dead.
Eight others died in Nicaragua in flooding.
	   Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had
been isolated by the storm, left without power, telephones or clean
drinking water.
	   Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain,
citrus and banana crops had been damaged ``and the economic future
of Honduras is uncertain.''
	   Rain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La
Ceiba, a coastal city of 40,000 people located 80 miles (128
kilometers) from the Bay Islands. About 10,000 residents fled to
crowded shelters in schools, churches and firehouses.
	   While supplies of food and gasoline seemed to hold up, drivers
worried about the coming days formed long lines to fill their tanks
at gas stations and some supermarkets took measures to limit panic
buying.
	   La Ceiba officials appealed for pure water for those in shelters
and some residents set out plastic buckets to collect rainwater.
Only a few hotels and offices with their own generators had
electricity.
	   Wind-whipped waves almost buried some houses near the shore.
People evacuated low-lying houses by wading through chest-deep
water with sodden bags of belongings on their heads.
	   In neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 residents of coastal
Belize City had left by Wednesday, turning the country's largest
city into a ghost town.
	   Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few people
wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company
was broadcasting only The Weather Channel.
	   With the storm seemingly anchored off Honduras, officials in
Mexico to the north eased emergency measures on the Caribbean coast
of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds of people remained in
shelters as a precaution Wednesday night.
	   More than 20,000 tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort
areas, leaving hotels at about 20 percent of capacity.
	   Houston accountant Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend
Nina Devries had tried to leave Cancun but found all the flights
full.
	   ``It's been horrible,'' said Montgomery, as she and her friend
drank cocktails at an outdoor restaurant. ``We couldn't go out on a
boat, we couldn't go snorkeling.
	   ``Even Carlos' N Charlie's and Senor Frog's are closed,'' she
said dejectedly, referring to two restaurants. ``Some vacation.''
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development sent two
helicopters each to Belize and Honduras to help in search, rescue
and relief efforts.
	   At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane
in this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the
Labor Day hurricane of 1935.

Murdoch's bid to be referred to Monopolies Commission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ BSkyB's 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid to
buy Manchester United received a setback Thursday when the
government referred the proposed deal for a full investigation by
its Monpolies and Mergers Commission.
	   Trade and Industry Secretary Peter Mandelson issued a statement
saying the MMC would decide whether the deal would break the rules
of fair trading.
	   ``The decision to a make a reference does not in any way
prejudge the question of whether or not the merger would be against
the public interest,'' the statement said. ``It is for the MMC to
report on this after its investigation.''
	   The MMC is due to issue its findings by March 12.
	   BSkyB, owned by Australian-born media magnate Rupert Murdoch,
had hoped that Mandelson would not hold up the deal by sending it
to the MMC.
	   Many Manchester United fans and lawmakers argue that BSkyB's
takeover of Europe's richest club would increase Rupert Murdoch's
already huge stake in TV coverage of soccer in Britain and create a
monopoly.
	   One of the leading campaigners against the bid, Manchester
United Independent Supporters' Association spokesman Andy Walsh,
said the referral gave opponents time to gather more opposition.
	   ``I am absolutely delighted,'' he said. ``This is what we've
been working for over the last two months and it's exactly what we
wanted.
	   ``The referral to the MMC will give football fans from
Manchester United and other clubs the opportunity to discuss for
the first time how football should be structured in this country.
	   ``We expect the MMC to look at all aspects of the game, not just
the BSkyB-Man United takeover,'' Walsh said. ``Hopefully they will
ensure the situation caused by the Sky attempt to take over our
club is a thing of the past.''
	   Mark Booth, the American chief executive of BSkyB, and Martin
Edwards, chief executive of Manchester United, issued a joint
statement on the MMC referral.
	   ``We will put our case strongly to the MMC that the proposed
transaction will not operate against the public interest and should
be allowed to proceed,'' the statement said.
	   ``The boards of both companies firmly believe that the
acquisition of Manchester United by BSkyB would be good for the
club, the players and the fans and will bring together two
companies whose skills complement each other and have demonstrated
their commitment to football.''
	   Thursday's announcement comes two days after BSkyB, which
exclusively shows live Premier League games in England, said it had
not yet won control of the majority of shares.
	   The satellite broadcasting company said it had received valid
acceptances from shareholders representing 33.5 percent of the
club's shares.
	   Combined with shares that BSkyB has been buying directly, the
broadcaster has a total ownership just under 45 percent and needs
to have more than 50 percent to gain a controlling stake in the
club.

Priest defrocked for affair with strip tease dancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Greek Orthodox priest who left his
family for a Romanian strip-tease dancer was defrocked Thursday by
the Holy Synod of the Cyprus Church.
	   The affair is the latest scandal to hit the church following
allegations that a high-ranking cleric, Bishop Chrysanthos of
Limassol, is involved in fraud running to millions of dollars.
	   A statement by the Synod said Father Papayiannis was defrocked
after admitting to the charges against him.
	   The priest's affair with the stripper was front page news last
week after a TV channel showed a photograph of two black-bearded
priests dressed in traditional ankle-length black cassocks leaving
a brothel in the western town of Paphos.
	   This provoked public calls for discipline in the church.
	   A church investigation revealed the photograph was taken several
months ago when Father Papayiannis was visiting his girlfriend, a
Romanian dancer. He had had left his wife and four children for the
stripper but has since returned to his family.
	   The second priest in the photograph was suspended pending
further investigations after claiming that he only went to a small
hotel to pick up Papayiannis and drive back to their village with
him.
	   The synod was also expected to consider a report by a committee
of three bishops who have investigated the fraud allegations
against Bishop Chrysanthos. The police are also investigating the
fraud case.

Environmental protesters end their occupation of oil refinery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Greenpeace protesters on Thursday
ended a 36-hour occupation of an under-construction oil shale plant
co-owned by Canadian company Suncor.
	   Eight members of the environmentalist group Greenpeace entered
the Stuart Oil Shale Project plant, north of Gladstone on the
central coast of Queensland state, at dawn Wednesday.
	   One climber scaled a construction crane while others chained
themselves to a giant kiln in which the shale is to be processed. A
third team locked on to a smokestack.
	   Greenpeace, which ended the protest at 4 p.m. Thursday (0400
GMT), said the protest had immobilized construction equipment and
prevented heavy equipment work.
	   Peter Hopkins, managing director of Suncor Energy Australia Pty
Ltd., said that while the protest did not cause a halt to
construction, it resulted in some disruption.
	   ``Our biggest concern during the incident was always the safety
of our employees and protesters,'' said Hopkins. ``We are extremely
pleased that the incident has been able to be resolved safely.''
	   Greenpeace says plants such as the Stuart project emit up to 64
percent more carbon dioxide than conventional oil production, and
that carbon dioxide emissions from extraction and production of oil
shale are about 10 times higher than conventional oil production.
	   Suncor is co-owner and a 50 percent partner in the Stuart
project with Australia's Southern Pacific Petroleum and Central
Pacific Minerals. Suncor will operate the project while the
Australian companies are the developers.
	   The pilot plant, 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Gladstone, is
about 85 percent complete. It is expected to begin operating early
next year, producing 4,500 barrels a day.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Declaring the Roman Catholic Church isn't
afraid of history's judgment, the Vatican on Thursday opened a
symposium on one of its most troubling institutions: The
Inquisition.
	   Scores of the world's top Inquisition scholars are taking part
in the three-day meeting, which is part of the church's countdown
to the year 2000.
	   Pope John Paul II wants the church to begin the millennium with
a clear conscience and is expected to make some sort of
pronouncement in 2000 on the its past sins.
	   ``The church cannot cross the threshold of the new millennium
without pressing its children to purify themselves in repentance
for their errors, infidelity, incoherence and slowness,'' Cardinal
Roger Etchegaray said, opening the symposium.
	   For many, the Inquisition stands as one of the church's darkest
chapters and a symbol of supreme religious intolerance. For
centuries, ecclesiastic ``thought police'' tried, tortured and
burned thousands, perhaps even millions, of people at the stake for
heresy and other crimes.
	   The symposium is designed to examine the organization,
procedures and historical context of the Inquisition, which lasted
from the 13th to the 19th centuries.
	   ``The church is not afraid to submit its past to the judgment of
history,'' said Etchegaray, a Frenchman who heads the Vatican's
Commission for the Grand Jubilee.
	   The pope is scheduled to meet with the participants on Saturday,
the final day of the conference.

	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant
rammed an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep that was
escorting a bus full of elementary school students Thursday. The
powerful blast killed the attacker and a soldier.
	   The anti-Israeli group Hamas claimed responsibility and Israel
warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that he would have to take
tough steps against the militants if he wanted the new
land-for-security agreement to proceed as scheduled.
	   Arafat spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin by phone,
denounced the attack and promised to track down those responsible.
	   The suicide attack also injured three Israelis and three
Palestinan girls. The 40 Israeli children on the bus, ranging in
age from six to 14, were unharmed.
	   The 12-week West Bank troop pullback is to begin Monday, and
Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Israeli hard-liners to
call off the deal.
	   The terror attack, the second this week, makes it increasingly
difficult for Netanyahu to fend off hard-line criticism. Even
before the bombing, Netanyahu had accused the Palestinians of not
living up to security pledges, raising U.S. concerns that
implementation of the deal could be delayed.
	   Thursday's explosion went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) at
the Gush Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time,
the Israeli school bus convoy guarded by two jeeps was passing by.
	   Nine-year-old Eran Ayoubi, who was on the bus, said he had just
finished his daily traveler's prayer and said ``amen'' when he
heard a loud boom and the windows around him were shattered.
	   His 10-year-old sister Adar said she and many of the other
children began to cry and were ordered by the driver to drop to the
floor of the bus for cover.
	   ``There was terrible smoke everywhere. I thought I was going to
be burned,'' Adar said, sitting on her bicycle parked on a sidewalk
outside her home in the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom.
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb was so powerful that the jeep flipped over on its side.
The jeep and the bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in the
nearby town of Khan Yunis, were scorched and mangled.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler, said the jeep was still
burning an hour after the blast. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered
all over. There is oil, gas, blood,'' Kirshenzach told Israel
radio.
	   Pieces of black debris were scattered over a 50-yard (50-meter)
radius. A black, scorched shoe lay in the middle of the road.
	   The roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed from the force of the
explosion and three Palestinian girls were injured, their relatives
said. Two girls were hospitalized and a third remained at home with
cuts to the back and hand.
	   After the attack, the Israeli children were taken to their
school in Gush Katif settlement bloc before returning home to Kfar
Darom. In school, the children talked about their experience. The
children spoke of the big boom and flames and many asked about
their friends on a second bus, said Principal Yitzhak Amitai.
	   In a call to Israel radio, a man who said he spoke for Hamas
read a claim of responsibility. ``It's a revolution until
victory,'' the caller said, suggesting the attacks would continue.
	   The spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was evasive
when asked whether Hamas was responsible. Yassin said the group
wanted to avoid Palestinian civil war and would not react violently
to a possible crackdown by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The army sealed to Gaza Strip for about five hours in response
to the attack.
	   Arafat insisted, despite the attack, that Israel stick to its
side of the peace agreement and withdraw from land and release
Palestinian prisoners. He said the Palestinian Authority would
track down those involved in plotting the attack and ``try them for
deliberately harming the Palestinians' national interests.''
	   Samia, the Israeli commander, said the identity of the suicide
bomber was known and that he was a resident of the nearby
Palestinian town of Khan Yunis.
	   Palestinian officials, however, said they only had the name of
the car's owner, a man from Khan Yunis. The man was detained for
questioning by Palestinian police.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Israel would
watch the Palestinian Authority's response closely.
	   ``The basis for progress in the (peace) process depends first
and foremost on intensive action against terrorism,'' Mordechai
said. ``If this is done, we will make progress.''
	   Implementation of the new peace agreement is to begin Monday.
Under the accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West
Bank over 12 weeks in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants.

Yemeni tribesmen abduct two Belgians

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesmen have kidnapped two Belgians
and refused to negotiate their release before the kidnappers'
demands are met, officials said Thursday.
	   The two were kidnapped in Abyan province, about 280 kilometers
(175 miles) south of the capital San`a, by five armed members of
the al-Bakazim tribe, a Yemeni security official said.
	   The two kidnap victims were initially reported to be Austrians,
but diplomats said they were Belgians. ``The two men are not
Austrians. They are Belgians,'' said Abdul Jaleel Radman, the
Austrian honorary consul in the capital San`a.
	   A Belgian official in Brussels also confirmed Thursday that
Yemeni tribesmen kidnapped two Belgian tourists on Tuesday.
However, the security official in Yemen said the two men were
kidnapped Wednesday.
	   ``The two were just tourists. We know this happens there. This
is not an isolated case. The Belgian honorary consul is taking this
up with police and authorities,'' said Hubert Cooreman, the Belgian
Foreign Affairs spokesman.
	   The tourists' names were not given, and Belgian diplomats in
Yemen could not be reached for comment.
	   The security official, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the al-Bakazim tribe kidnapped the two men to
pressure the government to rescind a court order condemning three
fellow tribesmen to death for armed robbery and murder.
	   Security officials traveled late Wednesday from Zinjibar, the
capital of Abyan, to al-Mahfad where the men were being held to
negotiate for the release of the tourists but their attempts were
turned down by the tribesmen, the official said.
	   In August, Yemen's president approved a law that imposes a
possible death penalty for people carrying out kidnappings.
	   Since 1991, tribesmen have kidnapped more than 250 foreigners to
pressure the government to meet demands for better services or
money. So far, government efforts to stop the abductions, including
sending armed guards with tourists, have not fully succeeded.
	   Large swaths of Yemen are ruled by tribesmen armed with
everything from rifles to artillery. But the hostages _ often oil
workers, diplomats or tourists _ are usually treated as guests and
emerge from the ordeal inconvenienced but unhurt.
	   The last kidnapping occurred July 22 when tribesmen abducted two
Belgian tourists. They were released the next day.

Australia's defense ties with Indonesia solid: minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Planned military exercises involving
elite units of the Indonesian and Australian defense forces have
been deferred, not abandoned, Australian Defense Minister John
Moore said Thursday.
	   Moore said budget cuts in Indonesia were behind a decision to
delay two planned joint military exercises, not the bad human
rights record of Indonesia's elite Kopassus unit, as reported in
some Australian media.
	   Moore, who took over the defense post earlier this month after a
national election, said Australia's defense relationship with
Indonesia was unchanged.
	   The newspaper Australian reported Thursday the exercises had
been abandoned after a decision at ministerial level in Australia.
	   The newspaper linked the decision to what it said were months of
bad publicity over the poor human rights record of the elite
Kopassus unit in Indonesia's armed forces.
	   However, Moore said the decision had come from Australia's armed
forces, not the Australian government.
	   Adm. Chris Barrie, the chief of Australia's defense forces, had
advised the government that planned exercises had been deferred by
mutual agreement with the Indonesian government, Moore said.
	   Exercise Night Falcon, an Australian Special Air Services
exercise, was scheduled in Indonesia in May 1998.
	   Moore said the exercise had been deferred due to the
deteriorating political and economic situation in Indonesia.
	   Exercise Kookaburra and Exercise Komodo, scheduled for November,
had also been postponed to a date yet to be decided.
	   ``I am advised that the exercises have been deferred in the
light of the budget cuts imposed by the Indonesian government on
(the Indonesian armed forces) ABRI training and by ABRI's priority
requirement for the restructuring of Kopassus,'' Moore said.
	   ``These are internal matters for the Indonesian government and
its defense force.''
	   He said the Indonesian government was also concerned about
improving the ``professional standards and accountability'' of its
special forces.
	   Moore said it was expected that training exercises involving
Australian defense forces and Kopassus would resume once
Indonesia's internal reform processes had been completed.
	   Two former Kopassus commanders, including former President
Suharto's son Prabowo Subianto, have been sacked from Indonesia's
armed forces over their role in political kidnapping and torture.

Unrelenting rain triggers flooding in east, north

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Days of relentless rain have
triggered flooding in the eastern and northern Netherlands, forcing
the Dutch to fight their perennial battle to stave off floodwaters.
	   Five hundred soldiers and engineers were deployed to the
provinces of Groningen and Drenthe to shore up soggy dikes weakened
by rain-swollen canals and rivers, Dutch Army spokesman Hans
Hardenbol said Wednesday.
	   ``Things are stabilizing, but the weather forecast is not
good,'' Hardenbol said.
	   Evacuations in those mainly agricultural provinces have so far
been limited to livestock. The army has readied two military
barracks in the region should local officials call for an
evacuation of flooded villages.
	   But that appeared unlikely. By Wednesday afternoon, floodwaters
had began to recede in most of Drenthe, said Albert Smit of the
local flood prevention team. Heaps of sandbags remained in place to
reinforce canal and river banks.
	   Major roads that were flooded earlier have also been reopened.
	   In the city of Meppel, about 90 kilometers (50 miles) northeast
of Amsterdam, up to 250 homes were flooded overnight, Smit said. As
the water level continued to drop, cleanup work also began for
homeowners.
	   Farmers have been hit the hardest with their crops submerged in
flooded fields. Dutch media reported damages so far at around 260
million guilders (dlrs 130 million).
	   Torrential rain and strong winds swept through the Netherlands
earlier this week, causing major traffic jams and closing off
roads. No weather-related deaths have been reported.
	   While the northern and eastern provinces faced floodwaters,
other areas in the Netherlands, such as Amsterdam, enjoyed brief
sunshine and clear skies Wednesday for the first time in days.
	   But the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute expected more
rain in the coming days for all parts of the country, said
spokesman Harry Geurts, adding the flooded areas were being closely
monitored.
	   ``Every drop is important,'' Geurts added.
	   For this low-lying country, the fight against floodwaters is
almost a way of life. In 1995, widespread flooding of the Maas,
Waal and Rhine Rivers forced the evacuation of up to 250,000 people
in the Netherlands.

Australia bans U.S. fruit imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government on Thursday
banned all fresh fruit imports from the United States to protect
the local industry from the Mexican fruit fly.
	   Government spokeswoman Judith Troeth said the ban was
precautionary, pending further technical information.
	   ``Any outbreak of Mexican fruit fly in Australia could pose a
threat to the horticultural industry,'' Troeth said.
	   She said fruit from the United States already on its way to
Australia would be held in quarantine.
	   Australia imported 45.3 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
27.8 million) worth of fruit in 1997.

Slovene supreme court recommends election reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ The Slovene supreme court ruled
Thursday that the present electoral law be amended from a
proportional to majority election system.
	   Although a 1996 national referendum which favored a change to
the majority system failed to muster an absolute support, the court
judged that a shift would benefit the development of a more stable
political environment.
	   Janez Jansa, the leader of the opposition Social Democrats who
proposed the reform in 1996, hailed the decision as a breakthrough
which would prevent smaller parties from siphoning enough power to
stall simple parliamentary procedures.
	   Analysts believe the ruling will bisect the Slovenian political
landscape between Jansa's party and the Liberal Demoratic Party.
	   To become effective, the legislation needs to be approved by
two-thirds of deputies in parliament.
	   Slovenian general elections are scheduled for the year 2000. The
decision will not affect local elections planned for Nov. 22.

Bavarian leader says new government's policies will botch country's
</HEADLINE>
future &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ The Bavarian state leader, a staunch
conservative, attacked key policy goals set by the country's new
center-left government Thursday, saying they will botch Germany's
future.
	   In his inaugural speech to the state parliament, Edmund Stoiber,
reelected governor of Bavaria two months ago, criticized the Social
Democratic-Greens coalition government's proposed changes in
citizenship laws, plans shut down nuclear energy plants, tax reform
plan, among others.
	   Stoiber's conservative party, the Christian Social Union, was a
partner in former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government.
	   Bavaria's Social Democratic leader Renate Schmidt, addressing
the state legislature, warned Stoiber not to try to turn Bavaria
into a bastion of opposition to the new national government.
	   The government plans to relax Germany's nationality law, which
is based on bloodline, not place of birth, making it easier for
some of the country's 7 million resident foreigners to become
Germans.
	   Stoiber said the plan would divide Germany, instead of uniting
it, as the government hopes.
	   ``Nationality cannot be bestowed. Nationality must be earned
from within,'' said Stoiber.
	   He attacked as ``ideological nonsense'' the government's plan to
wean the country off nuclear power, calling it ``Germany's most
gigantic anti-technology and anti-jobs program ever.''
	   The Social Democrats' Schmidt said Stoiber's comments threatened
to further isolate Bavaria from the German and European mainstream,
and accused him of ``fundamentalism'' by deliberately equating
foreigners with criminals.

Taliban and opponents to release 2,000 prisoners

<TEXT>
	   HUSSAIN KOT, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army and
its opponents have agreed to release 2,000 prisoners in a phased
exchange ``very soon,'' a Taliban spokesman said Thursday.
	   According to Abdul Hai Muttmayan, the Taliban's spokesman in
southern Kandahar, both sides will release 150 prisoners a day
until 2,000 men are freed.
	   The exchange was brokered by Said Jalal, a close confidante of
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who also negotiated a
one-week cease-fire between Afghanistan's fierce combatants.
	   During the week, which began on Wednesday, Jalal will shuttle
between the Taliban and the northern-based alliance leader, Ahmed
Shah Massood, in search of a compromise to end the relentless
bloodletting.
	   At Hussain Kot, on the front line 25 kilometers (15 miles) north
of the Afghan capital of Kabul, 170 prisoners huddled together
waiting for the exchange to begin.
	   ``This is a happy day,'' said Abdul Rasool a soldier in
Massood's army. He wasn't allowed to speak further to reporters.
	   Muttmayan wouldn't say when the exchange would begin, except to
say ``we will begin soon.''
	   It was not immediately possible to reach a spokesman for
Massood, Afghanistan's former defense chief.
	   The Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, while the
northern-based alliance rules the remaining 10 percent.
	   The fighting is restricted to northern Afghanistan, where
soldiers battle on at least three fronts. The Taliban threw out
Massood and President Burhanuddin Rabbani from Kabul in September
1996.
	   Since then the Taliban has been trying to consolidate its hold
on the entire country. In areas it controls, the Taliban has
imposed a strict version of Islam that bars women from working,
girls from attending school and forces men to wear beards, a head
covering and pray in the mosque.
	   The International Red Cross has not been asked to assist or
monitor the prisoner exchanges.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines resumed
international flights after more than a month Thursday with a party
for passengers leaving on a flight for Los Angeles.
	   Colorful bunting, Philippine cuisine and a live native band in
the departure area awaited more than 200 passengers flying on PAL
flight PR102, company officials said.
	   ``This feels like a rebirth. We felt so bad before and now we're
happy that we're back,'' said Maria Lourdes Afzelius, PAL manager
for special services.
	   ``It's hard to put something good down, as they say,'' said
Capt. Julio Hernandez, who headed the flight crew of the PAL plane
that left Manila Thursday night.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after a union
representing ground personnel turned down a management-proposed
recovery plan that included a 10-year suspension of collective
bargaining in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown.
	   The airline resumed domestic flights on Oct. 7. On Thursday, it
began thrice-weekly flights between Manila and Los Angeles, with
stopovers in San Francisco. The two U.S. destinations will be
served with separate flights from Manila starting Nov. 11.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, said it plans to gradually expand
its international operations to cash in on an expected influx of
Filipino overseas workers coming home for the Christmas holidays.
	   It plans to resume flights on Dec. 1 to the Saudi Arabian cities
of Dhahran and Riyadh, with service three times a week. Both cities
have large numbers of Filipino construction workers and housemaids.
	   Asian flights will resume Nov. 11, including daily flights to
Tokyo and 14 flights a week to Hong Kong, the airline said. Service
to Singapore, Taipei, Fukuoka and Osaka will begin later in
November.
	   PAL initially planned to use Airbus A340-300 planes on the U.S.
flights but said Thursday it decided to use a bigger Boeing 747-400
for the flight to Los Angeles because of an unexpected surge in
demand for seats.
	   Two of PAL's four Boeing 747-400 planes were seized earlier by
authorities in Hong Kong and Los Angeles at the request of the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, which financed them. Manila's Securities and
Exchange Commission has since asked the Ex-Im Bank to return the
planes.
	   The seizures have made PAL officials wary of deploying the
remaining 747-400s on foreign routes.
	   PAL said a federal court in San Francisco has ordered the Ex-Im
Bank to return the planes.
	   The airline has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion
in debt after being devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by
Asia's continuing financial crisis, which reduced passenger numbers
and inflated costs.
	   PAL's top officials, led by its chief stockholder and chairman
Lucio Tan, have been talking with two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific Airways and Northwest Airlines of the United States,
over selling a possible 40 percent stake in the airline.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A parked truck laden with steel scaffolding
rolled into a group of students seated on a lawn Thursday, killing

Two more Ethiopian editors arrested, press watchdog says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two more Ethiopian editors have been arrested,
bringing to 13 the number of journalists now in jail, a press
freedom watchdog said Thursday.
	   Reporters Without Borders urged Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi to release all of the journalists immediately and
unconditionally.
	   Samson Seyum, editor of Goh, was arrested for unknown reasons,
and Tilahum Bekele, editor of Felash, was arrested for an allegedly
defamatory article about a new water-bottling factory, Reporters
Without Borders said in a statement.
	   Both publications are weeklies in the Amharic language.
	   The editors have been held at an unknown location since
September, the Paris-based group said.
	   Another 11 journalists were previously incarcerated in Ethiopia,
some of whom have been held since 1995.
	   Reporters Without Borders wrote to Meles that the United Nations
considers that ``detention, as punishment for the peaceful
expression of an opinion, is one of the most reprehensible ways to
enjoin silence and, as a consequence, a grave violation of human
rights.''
	   The group is an independent organization working to defend press
freedom worldwide.

Russian cosmonauts applaud Glenn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian space pioneers cheered Thursday over John
Glenn's return to the launchpad and agreed that age should be no
obstacle to space flight. They also conceded a touch of envy.
	   ``Age increases a person's value as an expert,'' said Valery
Polyakov, 56, who has spent more time in space than anyone _ a
total of 678 days on several missions.
	   The example of Glenn, 77, will attract popular attention and
boost interest in space research, Polyakov said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The cosmonaut added that he and Glenn are friends who once spoke
of flying to Mars together.
	   When a flight to Mars becomes a reality, the crew should consist
of people closer to 60, ``experienced professionals, enthusiasts
who can sacrifice everything, including their lives,'' Polyakov
said.
	   ``When I turn 70, I would also ask to send me to space,'' he
added.
	   Russia's oldest living cosmonaut, Konstantin Feoktistov, 72,
also said he would like to fly to space again. ``I envy him in the
best sense of the word,'' Feoktistov said of Glenn, according to
the Moscow Times newspaper.
	   Feoktistov flew in space for a little more than 24 hours in
October 1964.
	   Russia's first cosmonaut _ and the world's first man in space _
was Yuri Gagarin, who first orbited the earth on April 12, 1961, 10
months before Glenn. He died while piloting a jet in 1968 at age
34.
	   The Russian space agency is now so short of funds that it has to
discard its Mir space station next June, six months ahead of
schedule. While it has many space veterans of Glenn's generation,
sending them into orbit isn't an option.
	   While voicing enthusiasm about Glenn's flight, Feoktistov
conceded that space flight can be more dangerous in old age.
	   ``There is more risk for people of my age ... especially if we
try to test where the limit is on ourselves, but that is, after
all, what this profession is all about,'' he said. ``I wish Glenn
will come back safe and sound.''

<TEXT>
	   MT. ZVIJEZDA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The frontline, the
people and the hatreds are the same as during the Bosnian war. Only
now, the weapons are axes and clubs instead of rifles. And the
clash is over a rare export product - timber.
	   Before the Bosnian war began in 1992, Croat and Muslim timbermen
all worked for the same company, harvesting timber on this central
Bosnian mountain near the town of Vares.
	   Like almost everything else in this country, the company split
during the war along ethnic lines. Croat woodcutters work for a
Croat company, Muslims for a Muslim-run firm.
	   Since the war ended in 1995, the two companies recognized the
old wartime frontline. Each harvested timber on his own side of the
line.
	   Last week, however, Muslim woodcutters say the Croats encroached
on their portion of the forest. The Muslims, suspecting the Croats
have depleted their own timber supply, mobilized right away,
chasing away the intruders with clubs and axes.
	   The Croats returned a second time, only to be driven off again.
Now, a yellow truck blocks the only road to the nearby village
preventing the Croats to transport timber from the contested area.
	   The dispute prompted American troops of the NATO-led
peacekeeping force to begin regular patrols in the area as of
Monday. That has prevented any new flareups. But resentment between
the two groups remains.
	   ``I also have to work. It is the only way for my family to
survive,'' says Anto Knezevic, 56, a Croat who has been a
woodcutter for 32 years. His monthly 600 German Marks (dlrs 353) is
the only income for his seven member-family.
	   One of Knezevic's fellow Croats, unwilling to give his name,
said he was willing to take up arms to defend what he considers the
Croats' right to cut timber where they want.
	   The dispute on this mountain is a small part of the pattern of
ethnic hatred which remains in this country three years after the
Dayton peace agreement ended fighting.
	   Despite international efforts to encourage reconciliation, each
of the three communities -- Croat, Serb and Muslim -- flies its own
flag. The weak central government barely functions and is incapable
of regulating timber cutting or resolving the dispute here.
	   Like most poor countries, Bosnia relies on natural resources
such as timber for most of its exports. The unemployment rate here
is 70 percent. Some officials have expressed concern about the
rapid disappearance of Bosnia's forests.
	   For others, however, timber means life. Even after working
hours, both Muslim and Croat woodcutters usually stay on in the

More grave diggers seized in Crimea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU)
detained three young men who were conducting an illegal
archaeological dig, trying to get to an ancient grave on the
Crimean peninsula, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The three grave diggers from Sevastopol only managed to dig a
large hole but failed to reach the grave by the time they were
detained earlier in the week in Crimea's Bakhchysarai region,
regional SBU spokeswoman Iryna Novikova said, according to the
daily Kievskiye Vedomosti.
	   The site involved has numerous 6th to 8th century graves of
nomads who populated Crimea at the time.
	   Last month, SBU detained a group of Crimeans on suspicion of
conducting illegal digs in the same region of the Black Sea
peninsula.
	   The grave robbers' finds included well-preserved jugs, cups,
rare glass goblets and silver and bronze jewelry decorated with
semi-precious stones, SBU said.
	   SBU says grave-diggers in Crimea are well organized, with some
groups carrying out the actual digs, others supplying them with
food and instruments and separate groups engaged in illegal sales
of the finds.

Report critical of efforts to recruit employers to Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's Industrial
Development Board spends disproportionately high amounts to entice
foreign investors to the British-ruled province _ and too often
doesn't get what it paid for, a government report concluded
Thursday.
	   The Northern Ireland Audit Office report came as the development
board completed its most high-profile campaign ever to woo North
American businesses, an 11-city tour from New York to San Jose,
California, designed to capitalize on April's peace accord.
	   The report concluded that from 1988 to 1997, the
government-funded agency usually failed to meet its yearly goals
for creating jobs. And scrutiny of the employment records of 37
surveyed firms showed that only about two-fifths of the promised
jobs ever materialized, it said.
	   The development board declined comment on the report, which
found that its hefty training subsidies and capital grants meant
that each job created cost 2,800 pounds to 53,800 pounds (dlrs
4,700 to dlrs 91,000) in taxpayers' money.
	   Sean Farren, economy spokesman for the Catholic-supported Social
Democratic and Labor Party, said the report ``raises the questions:
How much should you spend on a job that may not last, and what
value is it actually adding to the economy?''
	   Employment is a burning issue in Northern Ireland, where
Catholic joblessness traditionally runs far higher than in
Protestant areas. Unemployment currently runs at about 8 percent, a
20-year low.

Priest defrocked for affair with striptease dancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Greek Orthodox priest who left his
family for a Romanian striptease dancer was defrocked Thursday by
the Holy Synod of the Cyprus Church.
	   The affair is the latest scandal to hit the church since
allegations that a high-ranking cleric, Bishop Chrysanthos of
Limassol, was involved in fraud running to millions of dollars.
	   A statement by the Synod said Father Papayiannis was defrocked
after admitting to the charges against him.
	   The priest's affair with the stripper was front page news last
week after a TV channel showed a photograph of two black-bearded
priests dressed in traditional ankle-length black cassocks leaving
a brothel in the western town of Paphos.
	   This provoked public calls for discipline in the church.
	   A church investigation revealed the photograph was taken several
months ago when Father Papayiannis was visiting his girlfriend, a
Romanian dancer. He had had left his wife and four children for the
stripper but has since returned to his family.
	   The second priest in the photograph was suspended pending
further investigations after claiming that he only went to a small
hotel to pick up Papayiannis and drive back to their village with
him.
	   The synod was also expected to consider a report by a committee
of three bishops who have investigated the fraud allegations
against Bishop Chrysanthos. The police are also investigating the
fraud case.

Ukrainian government paying to free ships seized abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government has allocated dlrs 2.7
million to the country's largest shipping company to help it free
the ships seized in foreign ports over the company's debts, a news
agency reported Thursday.
	   Nine Ukrainian ships with 147 crew members are currently
detained abroad and their owners do not have the money to free
them, Ukrainian News said.
	   Most of the ships belong to the Black Sea Shipping Company, once
Ukraine's largest sea fleet operator, as well as the country's
three other state-owned shipping companies.
	   Ukraine's Transport Ministry said recently that the former
Soviet republic's sea fleet has been reduced by nearly a third in
the past six years due to a lack of funds to repair old ships and
purchase new ones.
	   A large decrease in the volume of commodities shipped through
Ukrainian ports and the loss of many clients have left the shipping
companies struggling with debts, and sometimes leaving their ships
stranded in foreign ports.
	   A total of 130 Ukrainian ships have been detained abroad so far
this year, Ukrainian News said.
	   Ukrainian shipping companies collectively owed dlrs 123.5
million to their foreign clients, including ports and port service
companies, as of this summer, according to the Transport Ministry.

Forest group's nine-month profit up to dlrs 1.5 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Europe's largest forest products
company, UPM-Kymmene, increased its nine-month pretax profit 62
percent this year to 7.57 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.51 billion),
mainly because of higher paper prices and capital gains.
	   Last year, the group's pretax profit for the same period was
4.68 billion markkaa, the company said Thursday.
	   Net sales from January to September fell slightly to 37.47
billion markkaa (dlrs 7.49 billion), from 37.73 billion markkaa in
1997.
	   The company warned that uncertainty over ``future economic
trends'' has started to reduce demand for paper, and that demand
for packaging material and special products is expected to weaken
as a result of economic difficulties in Asia and Russia.
	   UPM-Kymmene was formed in May 1996 from the merger of two
leading Finnish forest companies, Kymmene and Repola. It employs
33,200 people in more than 80 countries, down from 33,000 a year
earlier.

Cuban leader says Salvadoran arrested in terror attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ A Salvadoran charged with
planning to plant bombs in Cuban tourist hotels should be given a
fair trial, El Salvador's president says.
	   President Armando Calderon Sol says Cuba has the right to try
Rene Rodriguez Llerena, who was arrested in June on terrorism
charges, but urged a fair trial. He is the second Salvadoran
arrested by the Cubans since a spate of deadly bombings.
	   ``If there are actions or criminal deeds committed by
Salvadorans abroad, any country has the right to judge them for the
crime committed,'' he told reporters Wednesday.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro told a group of U.S. newspaper
executives on Saturday that authorities there that Llerena was
planning to plant bombs at Cuban hotels. His remarks were broadcast
Wednesday by Cuban state television.
	   Castro claimed that the bombing attempt was organized by Luis
Posada Carriles, a Cuban exile that officials on the island accuse
of responsibility for the bombing of a Cubana airliner in 1976 that
killed 73 people.
	   Posada was twice acquitted of that action, but spent nine years
in a Venezuelan prison before escaping in 1985.
	   Another Salvadoran awaiting trial, Raul Cruz Leon was detained
in September 1997 on charges of planting bombs at Havana hotels and
restaurants. One Italian tourist was killed.
	   Castro also said three Guatemalans were in custody on terrorism
charges.
	   The Cuban leader urged the U.S. editors to pursue reports about
terrorist actions against Cuba and offered to help, according to
Prensa Latina, the Cuban government news agency.
	   The New York Times reported in July that Posada Carriles had
admitted backing attempts to bomb Cuban tourist facilities and that
he said they were financed by an influential exile group in the
United States.
	   Posada Carriles later said he had lied about the involvement of
the exile group but did not deny involvement in the hotel bombings.

After NBA cancels rest of November, talks last 8 hours
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS; REPEATING to RESTORE remainder of slug, editor's
note. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They canceled more games, held more talks and
finally walked into the chilly early-morning air with long faces
and no deal.
	   It was one of the most eventful, if not productive, days of the
American National Basketball Association lockout Wednesday. But
when it was over, 16 hours of talking and tinkering hadn't moved
NBA owners and players much closer to a deal.
	   ``There's still a pretty wide gap that separates the sides,
despite the statements of good faith intentions,'' commissioner
David Stern said after talks ended at 1 a.m. (0600 GMT) Thursday.
``But at least we identified the sizes of the gaps between us.''
	   Some 12 hours earlier, Stern announced the cancellation of two
more weeks of the season, although he did admit there was a
possibility of ``recapturing'' games that will be missed.
	   In all, 194 games have been lost, with the latest cancellation
of 95 games. Each team's 82-game schedule has now been whittled to
about 68 games, and the players have lost about dlrs 200 million in
salaries.
	   ``In terms of how close and how far away we are, that's hard to
determine right now,'' said Michael Jordan, who sat in on the talks
for the first time. ``At least we've got some great dialogue
happening and in some ways we're starting to understand each
other's position. Is that improvement? Yes, I would say so.''
	   Still, the sides made little or no movement on the monetary
specifics of their offers.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   So far in negotiations, the club owners are still asking for a
scaleback of the percentage of revenues devoted to salaries from 57
to 48 percent, while the players remained stuck on holding off on
their concessions until the number reaches 63 percent.
	   ``Both sides are still locked in,'' union director Billy Hunter
said. ``We spent a lot of time talking, but no progress. I don't
think their people are willing to move.''
	   Hunter, looking haggard and weary when he left the talks,
expected to receive a phone call Thursday morning from Stern or
deputy commissioner Russ Granik to discuss what each side thinks
the next step should be.
	   No further talks have been scheduled, but the sides said they
could be back at the bargaining table Thursday or Friday.
	   The cancellations, which wiped out the rest of the November
schedule, came after the league's Board of Governors and about 100
players held separate meetings during the day. The owners'
negotiating committee then spoke to the assembly of players for 90
minutes, and formal talks began at 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) and lasted for
eight hours.
	   ``I think we just have different ideas as to what's a workable
economic system,'' said Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief
attorney. ``This will take more time. We're just still not able to
find common ground on how the thing's going to work.''

Hamas claims responsibility for car bomb explosion in Gaza

gunfire immediately after explosion, Hamas leader questioned &QL;

	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant
rammed an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep that was
escorting a bus full of elementary school students Thursday. The
powerful blast killed the attacker and a soldier.
	   The anti-Israeli group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
suicide attack that also injured three Israelis and four
Palestinians.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and told him he must wage all-out war on
terrorism if he wants Israel to go pull back troops in the West
Bank over the next 12 weeks, as promised.
	   Arafat vowed to track down the masterminds of the bombing, and
in a first step Palestinian police questioned a Hamas leader,
Mahmoud Zahar, and arrested 15 men in the town of Khan Yunis.
	   Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Israeli hard-liners to
call off the deal and the terror attack, the second this week,
makes it increasingly difficult for him to defend sell the
land-for-security agreement at home.
	   The blast went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) at the Gush
Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time, the Israeli
school bus convoy guarded by two jeeps was passing by.
	   Nine-year-old Eran Ayoube, who was on the bus, said he had just
finished his daily traveler's prayer and said ``amen'' when he
heard a loud boom and the windows around him were shattered.
	   His 10-year-old sister Adar said children began to cry and were
ordered by the driver to drop to the floor of the bus for cover.
	   ``There was terrible smoke everywhere. I thought I was going to
be burned,'' Adar said, sitting on her bicycle parked on a sidewalk
outside her home in the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom.
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb was so powerful that the jeep flipped over on its side.
The jeep and the bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in the
nearby town of Khan Yunis, were scorched and mangled.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler, said the jeep was still
burning an hour after the blast. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered
all over. There is oil, gas, blood,'' Kirshenzach told Israel
radio.
	   Pieces of black debris were scattered over a 50-yard (50-meter)
radius. A black, scorched shoe lay in the middle of the road.
	   The Israeli army said that immediately after the blast, Israeli
soldiers chased what they thought were suspects fleeing the scene.
Troops opened fire, wounding one Palestinian man. Palestinian
police, in turn, fired on Israeli troops, but no one was injured in
the exchange that lasted several minutes, the army said.
	   The roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed from the force of the
explosion and three Palestinian girls were injured, their relatives
said. Two girls were hospitalized and a third remained at home with
cuts to the back and hand.
	   After the attack, the Israeli children were taken to their
school in Gush Katif settlement bloc before returning home to Kfar
Darom. In school, the children talked about their experience. The
children spoke of the big boom and flames and many asked about
their friends on a second bus, said Principal Yitzhak Amitai.
	   In a call to Israel radio, a man who said he spoke for Hamas
read a claim of responsibility. ``It's a revolution until
victory,'' the caller said, suggesting the attacks would continue.
	   The spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was evasive
when asked whether Hamas was responsible. Yassin said the group
wanted to avoid Palestinian civil war and would not react violently
to a possible crackdown by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Netanyahu said he expected an all-out crackdown on the militants
as a condition for implementation of the peace agreement. ``I told
him (Arafat) that the test will be ... the absolute enlistment of
the Palestinian Authority against terrorists,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``He told me he had just emerged from a meeting a meeting with
his security chiefs and had given them instructions in that
spirit,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Arafat condemned the bombing. He said he would arrest the
masterminds and ``try them for deliberately harming the
Palestinians' national interests.''
	   A senior Hamas figure, Mahmoud Zahar, was summoned to
Palestinian police headquarters, his wife said. Fifteen people were
arrested in Khan Yunis, but it was not immediately clear whether
they had ties to Hamas.
	   Palestinian police also questioned the owner of the car used in
the bombing, identified as Mohammed Abdallah who said he had sold
the vehicle a day earlier.

Criminal charges brought against independent radio director
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The director of an independent
Belgrade radio station has been charged with violating a government
ban by broadcasting without a license, media reported Thursday.
	   The charges against Nenad Cekic, director of the small but
influential Radio Index, are the latest in a crackdown on
independent media by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
government.
	   Cekic could be sentenced to up to eight years in jail if found
guilty. His radio, often critical of Milosevic's hard-line
policies, was banned on Oct. 8 for not having a broadcast license.
	   Radio Index and other independent broadcasters have been denied
licenses for years, opening the way for the government to shut them
down when their broadcasts become critical of authorities.
	   Defying the ban, Radio Index continued its one-hour daily
broadcast over the airwaves of another popular independent Belgrade
radio station, B 92.
	   Last week, the parliament in Serbia, Yugoslavia's most powerful
republic, passed a new media law severely restricting press freedom
and instituting heavy fines for media publishing or broadcasting
``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government'' stories.
	   The law was passed amid widespread anti-Western sentiment fueled
by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end the crisis in Kosovo.
Ethnic Albanian secessionists have been battling Yugoslav troops in
the southern Serbian province.
	   Four major independent Belgrade newspapers have stopped
publishing out of fear of huge fines.

shooting range for wealthy businessmen and launching honey
production.
	   The owners of licensed weapons would be able to use the range
for private practice, the daily Fakty reported Thursday.
	   It quoted Valentyn Bezrodny, police chief in the Zakarpattia
region, as saying plans also call for making one floor in a special
hospital for police officers a commercial ward.
	   Participants at a police news conference also suggested
appointing several traffic policemen as beekeepers, Fakty said.
	   It noted, however, that Zakarpattia currently remains the only
region in the financially troubled Ukraine where police officers
are receiving their salaries on time.

Parliament convenes for first time, Meciar steps down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Newly elected lawmakers convened for
the first time Thursday, opening an era of change in this former
communist country, with promises to put Slovaks back on track
toward NATO and European Union membership.
	   In a move underscoring the change, outgoing Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar announced he was relinquishing his parliamentary
seat.
	   Meciar, who had ruled the country with authoritarian power since
1993, earlier promised Slovaks he would not stay in parliament
``with the limited power of a deputy.''
	   Slovaks voted Meciar and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
out of power on Sept. 25-26, electing a broad-based, four-party
coalition bent on setting the country back on the road to
integration with Western Europe.
	   Under Meciar's rule, Slovakia was criticized by its neighbors
and the West for shunning free-market and democratic reforms. While
the Czech Republic and Hungary, moved toward NATO and EU ascension,
Meciar concentrated on consolidating his party's power.
	   Already Thursday, the party leaders in the new governing
coalition demonstrated their eagerness to return to the Western
fold.
	   In an open letter sent to NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
and President of the European Commission Jacques Santer, they
promised to ``introduce significant political and economic changes
in Slovakia.''
	   ``We are committed to forming a strong, stable and effective
government for the next four years, firmly devoted to the
democratic principles with full respect for the rule of law,'' they
said.
	   Mikulas Dzuinda, the most likely candidate for prime minister
when the government is elected later Thursday, is expected to pay
his first foreign visit to Brussels already next week.
	   Although the new governing coalition covers nearly every aspect
of the political spectrum _ including reformed Communists,
Christian Democrats, Liberals, Greens _ they found a common ground
in the fight against Meciar.
	   ``We want to be included in the first wave of countries for the
EU membership. It is our highest goal,'' said Jan Sigel, a
representative of the Slovak Democratic Coalition.
	   The Slovak parliament is expected to elect its chairman, vice
chairman and the members of parliamentary committees later in the
day. The coalition holds 93 of the 150 seats in parliament.
Meciar's party hold 43 seats.
	   The new chairman is most likely to be Josef Migas, leader of the
coalition's next largest party, the Democratic Left. Ludovit
Cernak, who is most likely to be the economics minister, said the
government has to bring ``social peace.''
	   ``We have to get the economy started and become one of the
countries running for EU membership (once) again,'' Cernak said.
	   ``Among the first things that have to be done is ... to become a
law-based state and that has to apply to everyone without
exception,'' said Sigel.
	   Under Meciar, certain members of the government and members of
his party seemed to be immune from several laws. This intention was
reflected in the party's decision to give Meciar's vacated seat to
Ivan Lexa, former director of Slovakia's secret service (SIS).
	   Lexa was dismissed from his position on Tuesday. He is suspected
to have been involved in the kidnapping of Michal Kovac Jr., son of
Slovakia's former President. But under existing law parliamentary
deputies cannot be tried in a court of law.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Poul Erik Hoyer
Larsen of Denmark breezed past Indonesian Bernandus Edo 15-3, 15-0
Thursday, advancing to the quarterfinals of the dlrs 120,000
Indonesian Open Badminton Championship.
	   In women's competition, Mona Santoso, who was not even included
among Indonesians training for the Asian Games in December, upset
Poland's Katarzyna Krasowska, ranked 26th in the world.
	   Santoso reached Friday's quarterfinals with an 11-4, 11-7
victory.
	   That left Denmark's Nete Sorensen as the only foreign player in
the women's quarterfinals. She beat Indonesian Diah Yenni 11-7 11-4
Thursday.
	   Economic crisis has prevented many countries, especially
badminton power China, from entering the five-day competition,
which started with 42 Indonesians and 27 foreign players.
	   Larsen, one of the few high-ranking foreign players in the
field, next meets Indonesian Nunung Subandoro, who eliminated
countryman Arief 15-13, 15-12.

Belarus says `sewer war' is over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The ``sewer war'' over diplomatic housing
in Minsk is over, the government declared Thursday. Foreign
ambassadors might disagree.
	   ``The compound incident is closed,'' said Foreign Minister Ivan
Antonovich, noting that the ambassador of Turkey has agreed to
return. ``I think if the rest of the ambassadors were to also
return, the problem would be resolved very quickly.''
	   Earlier this year, President Alexander Lukashenko's government
said it needed to repair the plumbing and sewage system in the
Drozdy diplomatic compound on the outskirts of the capital, Minsk,
and the ambassadors had to move.
	   The United States and several European countries recalled their
ambassadors to protest the move, which they said violated
international law.
	   Antonovich said all ambassadors could return to their
residences, except for diplomats from the United States, France,
and Germany. Their residences have been absorbed into Lukashenko's
nearby residence, and they will be given other housing options, he
said.
	   The Interfax news agency said a European Union official was in
Minsk to discuss the problem, but provided no further details about
negotiations.
	   The European Union and nearly a dozen other countries imposed
travel restrictions on Belarusian officials over the dispute, which
has only heightened tensions between Belarus and the West, long
critical of Lukashenko's authoritarian policies.

EU inflation rate falls to 1.2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's annual inflation
rate fell to 1.2 percent in September, down from 1.3 percent in
August, the EU's statistics agency reported Thursday.
	   Inflation fell from 1.8 percent in September 1997, Eurostat said
in its monthly report.
	   In the 11 countries that join the single European currency on
Jan. 1, inflation was down to 1 percent in September, from 1.2
percent in August.
	   Inflation has fallen over the year in most EU nations, but is
creeping upwards in places, notably Ireland, Portugal and Italy.
Ireland's rate rose to 2.8 percent from 0.6 percent in September
1997.
	   Greece continued to have the EU's highest inflation at 5
percent.
	   At the other end of the scale, Sweden slipped into deflation,
with prices falling 0.1 percent. Belgium, Germany, France, Austria,
and Luxembourg all recorded inflation rates below 1 percent.
	   Eurostat gave the following rates for September 1998, with
September 1997 in brackets:
	   Sweden, -0.1 (2.6); France, 0.5 (1.5); Germany, 0.6 (1.6);
Austria, 0.6 (1.2); Luxembourg, 0.7 (1.7); Belgium, 0.8 (1.6
percent); Denmark, 1.1 (1.9); Netherlands, 1.3 (2.5); Finland, 1.4
(1.6); Britain, 1.5 (1.8); Spain, 1.6 (1.9); Italy, 2.1 (1.6);
Portugal, 2.2 (1.5); Ireland, 2.8 (0.6); Greece, 5 (4.9).

Hamas claims responsibility for car bomb explosion in Gaza

<TEXT>
	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant
rammed an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep that was
escorting a bus full of elementary school students Thursday. The
powerful blast killed the attacker and a soldier.
	   The anti-Israeli group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
suicide attack, which also injured three Israelis and four
Palestinians.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and told him he must wage all-out war on
terrorism if he wants Israel to carry out its agreement to withdraw
troops from the West Bank over the next 12 weeks.
	   Arafat vowed to track down the masterminds of the bombing, and
in a first step Palestinian police questioned a Hamas leader,
Mahmoud Zahar, and arrested 15 men in the nearby town of Khan
Yunis.
	   Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Israeli hard-liners to
call off the deal, signed last Friday in Washington. The terror
attack, the second this week, makes it increasingly difficult for
him to defend sell the land-for-security agreement at home.
	   The blast went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) at the Gush
Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time, the Israeli
school bus convoy, guarded by two jeeps, was passing by.
	   Nine-year-old Eran Ayoube, who was on the bus, said he had just
finished his daily traveler's prayer and said ``amen'' when he
heard a loud boom and the windows around him were shattered.
	   His 10-year-old sister Adar said other children began to cry and
were ordered by the driver to drop to the floor of the bus for
cover.
	   ``There was terrible smoke everywhere. I thought I was going to
be burned,'' Adar said, sitting on her bicycle parked on a sidewalk
outside her home in the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom.
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb flipped the jeep over on its side. The jeep and the
bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in Khan Yunis, were
scorched and mangled.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler, said the jeep was still
burning an hour after the blast. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered
all over. There is oil, gas, blood,'' he told Israel radio.
	   Pieces of black debris were scattered over a 50-yard (50-meter)
radius. A black, scorched shoe lay in the middle of the road.
	   The Israeli army said that immediately after the blast, Israeli
soldiers chased what they thought were suspects fleeing the scene.
Troops opened fire, wounding one Palestinian man. Palestinian
police, in turn, fired on Israeli troops, but no one was injured in
the exchange.
	   The roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed from the force of the
explosion and three Palestinian girls were injured, their relatives
said. Two girls were hospitalized and a third remained at home with
cuts to the back and hand.
	   After the attack, the Israeli children were taken to their
school in Gush Katif settlement bloc before returning home to Kfar
Darom. In school, the children talked about their experience. The
children spoke of the big boom and flames and many asked about
their friends on a second bus, said Principal Yitzhak Amitai.
	   In a call to Israel radio, a man who said he spoke for Hamas
read a claim of responsibility. ``It's a revolution until
victory,'' the caller said, suggesting the attacks would continue.
	   The spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was evasive
when asked whether Hamas was responsible. Yassin said the group
wanted to avoid Palestinian civil war and would not react violently
to a possible crackdown by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Netanyahu said he expected an all-out crackdown on the militants
as a condition for implementation of the peace agreement. ``I told
him (Arafat) that the test will be ... the absolute enlistment of
the Palestinian Authority against terrorists,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``He told me he had just emerged from a meeting a meeting with
his security chiefs and had given them instructions in that
spirit,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Arafat condemned the bombing. He said he would arrest the
masterminds and ``try them for deliberately harming the
Palestinians' national interests.''
	   In addition to the arrests, Palestinian police questioned the
owner of the car used in the bombing, identified as Mohammed
Abdallah, who said he had sold the vehicle a day earlier.

Ruling party loses partner in southern Sindh province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The ruling Pakistan Muslim League's
partner in the Sindh provincial government pulled out of the
coalition on Thursday after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif accused
them of harboring murderers.
	   The Muttahed Qami Movement or National People's Movement
withdrew its 28 lawmakers from the Sindh provincial Parliament
leaving the Muslim League scrambling for new partners.
	   However it seems unlikely that Sharif will be able to cobble
together another coalition given that the single largest party in
the provincial Parliament is his arch enemy Benazir Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party.
	   Ms. Bhutto's party holds 37 seats in the 109-seat legislature.
However her party and the MQM are archenemies making a coalition
government led by her party unlikely.
	   It's not clear how Sharif will deal with the crisis, but one of
his options, according to political analysts in southern Karachi,
the Sindh provincial capital, is to suspend the legislature and
declare governor's rule.
	   The falling out occurred after Sharif accused the MQM of
harboring the killers of Hakim Said, a prominent educator and
philanthropist of Karachi earlier this month.
	   On Wednesday Sharif issued an ultimatum to the MQM: Hand over
Said's killers or his Pakistan Muslim League would part company
with the MQM.
	   But at a news conference Thursday in Karachi, Aftab Sheikh, an
MQM spokesman, said his party will make the first move and leave
the coalition.
	   If governor's rule is imposed, the province will be effectively
governed from the federal capital of Islamabad.
	   Wracked by relentless violence between rival factions of the
MQM, many people in this port city believe Sharif will use the
increasing lawlessness as an excuse to impose governor's rule.
	   More than 1,000 people, many of them innocent by standers, have
been killed in the bitter feud for territory between rival factions
of the ethnic-based MQM party, which represents Indian Muslims who
settled in Pakistan in 1947 when British colonial rule of the
subcontinent ended.
	   There was n immediate comment from Sharif to the withdrawal of
his coalition partners.
	   Governor's rule if it is declared will require the signature of
the president, who is currently out of the country.

Bosnian Serb pleads guilty to 12 murders at U.N. tribunal

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A swaggering Goran Jelisic dubbed
himself Adolf as he helped Serb forces ``cleanse'' a northern
Bosnian town of Muslims and Croats in 1992.
	   On Thursday, he admitted mass murder and told U.N. judges he
wanted to cleanse his soul.
	   Jelisic, a 30-year-old Bosnian Serb, pleaded guilty to Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal charges that he murdered 12 Muslims and Croats
in May 1992 in Brcko. But he also pleaded innocent to a related
genocide count _ the tribunal's most serious charge.
	   ``It was my good will that I admitted the crime and cleanse my
soul,'' he calmly told the three-judge panel. ``There is no reason
for me to keep it within myself.''
	   Jelisic will be officially convicted of the murders at his
genocide trial, presiding judge Claude Jorda said. No date was
immediately set for the trial but it is expected to start in
December.
	   Dressed in jeans and a striped sweater, Jelisic, a former farm
machinery mechanic who called himself ``The Serb Adolf'' after
Hitler, showed no sign of remorse during Thursday's 40-minute
hearing.
	   He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for each
slaying.
	   ``At any expense I decided to admit these crimes and I know that
even life imprisonment may follow,'' Jelisic told judges. ``It is
up to you to decide.''
	   Jelisic killed most of his victims with close-range shots from a
machine pistol and beat to death others.
	   Although most of his victims were men, he also murdered one
woman in the same ruthless fashion: He took one woman out of a room
at the Serb-run Luka camp in Brcko, beat her with a police baton
and then shot and killed her.
	   He also admitted beating other prisoners at Luka and plundering
their property.
	   At his genocide trial, prosecutors will have to convince judges
that Jelisic intended to wipe out an entire section of an ethnic
group.
	   According to his indictment, Jelisic killed ``countless''
prisoners at Luka. Prosecutors say the slayings were part of a
campaign to rid Brcko of non-Serbs _ a practice euphemistically
known as ``ethnic cleansing.''
	   Arrested in January by U.S. troops serving in the NATO force in
Bosnia, Jelisic will be the third war criminal convicted by the
court since it was set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993.
	   In 1997, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic was jailed for 20 years for
killing and torturing Muslims and Croats in 1992. Tadic is
appealing the conviction.
	   Last year, Bosnian Croat Drazen Erdemovic was sentenced to five
years in prison for taking part in a Bosnian Serb Army mass
execution of Muslims following the fall of Srebrenica in 1995.

India, Bangladesh trade charges at border conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HASAN SAEED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Indian and Bangladeshi border generals
have accused each other of taking insufficient action against
insurgents setting up base on their territory and striking across
the border, officials say.
	   Bangladeshi officials said at the end of a conference on border
issues Wednesday Dhaka had tried to locate the camps of Indian
insurgents New Delhi said existed in Bangladesh, but none were
found.
	   Dhaka instead alleged there was a camp on Indian territory which
was training Bangladeshi insurgents opposing a peace accord reached
in December last year between the government and tribespeople in
the country's southern hill districts.
	   India alleged the United Liberation Front of Assam had set up
base in Bangladesh and pumped its money into Bangladeshi banks and
businesses.
	   Bangladeshi border officials said they had demonstrated their
resolve not to allow ULFA insurgents into the country with the
trial of Anup Chetia, general secretary of the outlawed
organization.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ With U.S. backing, Turkey and four former
Soviet republics signed a declaration Thursday in support of an oil
pipeline crossing through Turkey as the main export route from the
Caspian's rich oil fields.
	   The declaration was a clear message to oil companies, which are
expected to announce their preferred route in two weeks and
reportedly favor cheaper alternatives to the dlrs 2.5 billion
project.
	   Through the Ankara declaration, Turkey got most of the countries
involved in the project to declare their support for the pipeline,
which would run from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku through
Georgia and to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
	   Russia, which has proposed its own route for a pipeline, and
Turkmenistan did not back the deal.
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson witnessed the signing
ceremony in a show of Washington's commitment to the project.
	   ``Now the issue is not whether Baku-Ceyhan is going to happen,
because it is going to happen. The issue is how,'' Richardson said
after the ceremony.
	   The United States favors the 1,730-kilometer (1,075-mile)
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline because it would help bind Azerbaijan, Georgia
and Turkey closer to the West, and it would not pass through either
Russia or Iran, which also has its own proposed route.
	   The presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan and
Uzbekistan signed the declaration during the 75th anniversary
celebration of the Turkish republic.
	   Turkmen President Saparmurad Turkmenbasi refused to sign the
declaration but gave no reason.
	   Turkey also signed an agreement with Turkmenistan to build a
natural gas pipeline across the Caspian sea to Turkey. The pipeline
would transport 16 billion cubic meters (560 billion cubic feet) of
gas per year.
	   Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev said the declaration sealed
the future of the Caspian oil to flow through Baku-Ceyhan despite
``circles that want to block its realization.''
	   To counter oil companies' commercial concerns, the presidents
pledged to create ``all necessary conditions for the realization''
of the as-yet-unbuilt pipeline.
	   This includes serious tax and tariff incentives, Richardson
said.
	   The United States has announced a package of financial support,
including a dlrs 823,000 grant for the pipeline, and political risk
insurance for companies investing in the project.
	   The companies are expected to announce their decision Nov. 12.
	   The main alternative to Baku-Ceyhan is an existing pipeline from
Baku to the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa. The oil would be
transferred in tankers through the Bosporus.
	   Turkey opposes this route, saying already heavy oil tanker
traffic through the narrow strait has led to hundreds of accidents.

New aero device promises spectacular Indy-car finale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FONTANA, California (AP) _ Everybody is waiting to see if the
Indy-car season-ending Marlboro 500 at California Speedway can
match the excitement of July's U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway.
	   Thanks to the advent of the Handford Device, an aerodynamic
piece fitted to the rear wing of the Champ Cars to help contain
speeds at superspeedway events, the race at Michigan was
spectacular.
	   In its first and only race, the Handford Device, created by
PacWest Racing engineer Mark Handford, not only did what it was
intended to do _ slow the cars down _ it helped create what many
now call the greatest race in CART FedEx Series history.
	   There were a record 62 lead changes in the race on July 26
before Canadian Greg Moore won on the track that is an almost exact
duplicate of California's 3.265-kilometer (2.029-mile), high-banked
oval.
	   ``It was really an awfully intense race,'' Moore said. ``I've
never been in anything like that before, not for that long. It
seemed like we were running side-by-side almost all day.''
	   Not only was the race ultra-competitive, but, despite the
Handford Device, it was still very fast, with top speeds above 350
kph (220 mph).
	   ``You can't slow the cars down too much on the big tracks
because no matter what device you use on them or what rule you
change, the engineers, engine-builders and chassis people find some
way to get it back,'' said Michael Andretti, who has won two
800-kilometer (500-mile) races in his career.
	   The awesome and frightening speeds at last year's inaugural CART
event at the Fontana track were the single biggest reason the
Handford Device was designed.
	   A year ago, Brazil's Mauricio Gugelmin set a record for the
fastest qualifying speed in a motorsports event with a lap average
of 387.676 kph (240.942 mph). He completed the 3.265 kilometers
(2.029 miles) in 30.316 seconds.
	   In the race, won by PacWest teammate Mark Blundell of England,
speeds above 370 kph (230 mph) were common.
	   ``The Handford brings down the speeds some,'' Blundell
explained. ``But mostly, the device just makes the cars a little
easier to handle and allows you to draft up on the other cars....
It cuts this big hole in the air and you just get sucked right into
it.''
	   Although the on-track action will take most of the attention
this week, there will be some important off-track activities as
well.
	   On Sunday, CART will say goodbye to Italy's Alex Zanardi, the
two-time, reigning CART champion, who will race next season for
Team Williams in Formula One. Also getting out of his Champ Car for
the last time will be three-time CART champion Bobby Rahal, who is
retiring as a driver after a 17-year career.
	   ``Not that any race driver really needs a lot of extra
incentive, but I know that I'd like to finish with a win, and I'm
pretty sure that Alex feels the same way,'' Rahal said.
	   Actually, Zanardi owes this track a little payback after
crashing twice last year and winding up missing the race with a
concussion.
	   ``This year, I would like to stay away from the walls and be
here for the race,'' he said, grinning.
	   As if anyone needed more incentive to go for the win on Sunday,
there is a special dlrs 1 million payoff for the driver who takes
the checkered flag. Second-place pays its usual dlrs 60,000.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Trading levels rose on the Baghdad Stock
Exchange this week amid hopes for a peaceful solution to the
Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons inspections.
	   The number of shares traded climbed by 42 per cent from 35
million the previous week to 49.8 million, the exchange reported
Thursday. It said the value of shares traded increased 12.5 per
cent from 347 million Iraq dinars (dlrs 210,000) the previous week
to 390.6 million dinars (dlrs 236,000).
	   The 100-point index closed at 964.6, a rise of 2.5 per cent over
the previous week, the bulletin added.
	   The bulletin, reflecting activity for the three business days
ending Wednesday, said demand was high for the shares of industrial
companies. The value of industrial shares exchanging hands this
week reached 289 million dinars (dlrs 175,000).
	   Demand for government bonds dropped 24 per cent this week. The
bulletin said only 98 bonds worth 2.7 million dinars (dlrs 1,600)
were traded compared to 130 bonds worth 14.5 million (dlrs 8,800)
last week.
	   Shares of only 55 companies were traded out of 94 listed on the
stock exchange.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait bar
most trade with the country. U.N. weapons inspectors must certify
that Iraq has dismantled its programs to build weapons of mass
destruction before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   Iraq says it has cooperated with the inspectors. The weapons
inspectors repeatedly have accused Iraq of concealing information.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
tumbled by 111.1 points, or 5.53 percent this week, closing at
1,896.7 points, almost a two-year low, a report said Thursday.
	   Of the 68 companies that were traded this week, only one closed
higher, the National Investments Co. said in its weekly report.
Sixty-three closed lower, and the rest were unchanged.
	   The market has been suffering from a lack of liquidity for
weeks, but the company believes the index will not dive below 1,800
and prices are going to improve in the next two months.
	   Some 161.12 million shares changed hands this week, 32.7 percent
higher than the previous week. The value of these shares rose by 10
percent to 31.78 million dinars (dlrs 105.23 million).
	   The exchange lists 76 companies and is the country's main
investment venue.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices slipped but turnover rose on
the Amman stock exchange this week, with the stocks of commercial
banks trading the heaviest.
	   Brokers said Thursday that investors, mainly Jordanians
encouraged by a Palestinian-Israeli peace deal signed in Washington
last week, were gradually returning to the floor.
	   A stock market report showed that 76.3 percent of the total
volume of trading was in shares of commercial banks, which amounted
to 8.7 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 12.2 million).
	   The report, reflecting activity for the five business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
declined by 0.09 percent to 160.98 points.
	   Turnover nudged up by 153.3 percent to 11.4 million dinars (dlrs
16 million), the report said.
	   It said stocks of 88 firms were traded during the week.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's four government-owned banks made 703
million pounds (dlrs 206.7 million) in net profits in the fiscal
year 1997-98, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Thursday.
	   The profits represent an 11.2 percent increase over last year's
533 million pounds (dlrs 156.7 million) in profits, Central Bank
governor Ismael Hassan told the agency.
	   Deposits in the four banks rose by 5.6 billion pounds (dlrs 1.6
billion) to 133.5 billion pounds (dlrs 39.3 billion), an increase
of 4.4 percent, he said.
	   The banks have invested 8.4 billion pounds (dlrs 2.4 billion) in
financing industrial and construction projects, an increase of 21
percent from the previous year.
	   Loans extended by the banks rose by 5.5 billion pounds (dlrs 1.6
billion) to 75.8 billion ponds (dlrs 22.3 billion), he said.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Germany on Thursday agreed to grant 8
million marks (dlrs 4.8 million) to the Jordanian water department
to improve services.
	   The state-run Petra News Agency said the money will be used to
help restructure the water department, train employees and purchase
computers and other office equipment.
	   Germany is one the main contributors to Jordanian water
projects. It gave at least dlrs 100 million since last year to
improve water services in the Arab kingdom.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN. Jordan, (AP) _ A consortium of Jordanian and American
companies have launched a firm for producing suitcases that will be
exported tax-free to the United States.
	   Trade and Industry Minister Mohammed Saleh Hourani said Thursday
Boscan Co. was set up in an industrial zone in the northern city of
Irbid, 180 kilometers (110 miles) north of the Jordanian capital,
Amman.
	   He said the dlrs 7 million company will produce leather and
polyester suitcases of all sizes. Initial production is projected
at 1,000 suitcases a day.
	   The project is a joint venture between the International Company
Group, a consortium of private sector Jordanian investment firms,
and The Hong Kong-based U.S. Boscan Co., Hourani added.

Indonesian students, workers stage anti-government protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with number of soldiers, police, graf 5 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of students protested outside
Parliament and workers rallied for the release of a comrade
Thursday in a second day of anti-government demonstrations.
	   The protest at the legislature came one day after 8,000 students
gathered there in the biggest rally in the capital since violent
unrest forced former President Suharto to quit in May.
	   The students, many of them women wearing Islamic head scarves,
warned they will step up demonstrations ahead of a government
assembly next month that will shape guidelines for 1999 elections.
	   The government has said that 30,000 police, soldiers and
civilian volunteers will be deployed to safeguard the People's
Consultative Assembly.
	   They will include 11,800 policemen and 15,000 soldiers, and
2,800 of the total will be deployed around the Parliament building,
said Bagus Haryono, chief of socio-political affairs for the
Jakarta city government.
	   Armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto urged protesters to obey a
law enacted last week that regulates demonstrations, requiring for
example that organizers obtain special permits.
	   ``The security forces are not there to prevent demonstrations as
long as they are conducted in accordance with the law,'' Wiranto
said.
	   Meanwhile, about 100 workers demonstrated for the release of a
jailed labor activist who was convicted of organizing a strike
while the authoritarian Suharto was in power.
	   Like the students, the workers who gathered outside the attorney
general's office demanded an end to the Indonesian military's big
role in politics and said that the armed forces always favored
employers in labor disputes.
	   Their main demand was the release of Dita Indah Sari, who was
convicted last year of organizing a 1996 strike by 20,000 workers
in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city.
	   She was arrested in a nationwide crackdown on opposition
activists and sentenced to six years in prison.
	   ``We want the release of our hero,'' said Gimin, a worker. ``She
was put in jail by the Suharto regime because she defended our
rights and our struggle.''
	   The workers, who came from diamond, electronics and shoe
factories, demanded that the government lower food prices.
Inflation has soared and millions of people have lost their jobs as
Indonesia endures its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   The students who gathered near the legislature Thursday also
urged the government to revoke the national philosophy, Pancasila,
which mandates social tolerance. Suharto jailed many opponents
after accusing them of violating the creed.
	   On Wednesday, student activists demanded that Suharto be put on
trial for alleged corruption and that his successor, President B.J.
Habibie, quit over continuing political and economic turmoil.
	   They want the government to abandon plans to convene the
assembly, which will cast regulations in November for elections
next year.
	   Student leaders claim the assembly won't push for real change
and is filled with holdovers from the Suharto era.
	   Habibie has taken steps to implement democracy, freeing some
political prisoners and allowing banned magazines to reopen and
political parties to form. Critics, however, say he is not moving
fast enough.
	   Also Thursday, about 30 women protested on Jakarta's main street
against violence against women that they claim has been
state-sponsored.
	   Karlina Laksono, a spokeswoman for the group, said rape had been
used as a method of intimidation against women in areas such as
East Timor and Aceh where separatists have been fighting for
independence from Indonesia.
	   An inquiry now is being held into allegations that mass rapes
were committed during rioting in May.
	   The government has vehemently denied using rape as an instrument
to cow its opponents.

Serbian government decrees tax on foreign carriers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Counteracting a European flight ban
imposed last month on Yugoslavia's national airline, the Serbian
government decreed a tax on all foreign carriers flying into the
country, independent media reported Thursday.
	   In the future, all foreign carriers would be required to pay a
tax of dlrs. 30 per passenger, Beta news agency quoted a source
within the federal ministry of communications as saying.
	   The decree will come into effect once it is published in a
government gazette.
	   Last month, the European Union banned the Yugoslav state
carrier, JAT, from flying to Western European destinations, in
response to the crackdown by Serbian troops against ethnic Albanian
separatists in its troubled Kosovo province.
	   The ministry also told Beta that a temporary agreement with all
of the twelve foreign carriers expires at the end of November. In
order for these airlines to keep flying into the capital Belgrade,
they would have to sign a new contract with JAT.
	   Yugoslavia is made up of Montenegro and Serbia, where Belgrade
is located.

	   Excerpts of witness testimony against Goran Jelisic, a Bosnian
Serb who pleaded guilty Thursday in The Hague to slaying 12 Muslims
and Croats in 1992:
	   _ Describing how Jelisic summarily executed one prisoner who was
trying to escape from his custody, a U.N. witness identified only
as Witness B said:
	   ``Goran and six other policemen ran after the prisoner ... The
prisoner near the clothing store was cornered by the policemen and
Goran. Goran took out a pistol and pointed it at the prisoner. I
was about six meters (yards) away ... I heard the prisoner say,
`Please don't kill me _ I have a wife and children.' I watched as
Goran cocked the pistol and shot the prisoner. The first shot hit
the prisoner in the shoulder. After being shot, the prisoner spun
around and Goran shot him in the back. Then as the prisoner started
falling, Goran shot him once more in the back of the head.''
	   _ Describing the murder of two prisoners at Luka camp, Witness F
said:
	   ``Goran continued beating them for several minutes and then he
killed them. He made it look so easy. I watched as Goran took the
pistol from his belt with his right hand and aim the pistol at one
man's head. He then shot the man twice in the back of the head ...
The victim's body quivered.
	   ``Within seconds of shooting the first victim, Goran then shot
the man to his left in the same manner he had shot the first man,
except he only shot the second man in the head. Goran then watched
until they stopped quivering.''
	   Yugoslav war crimes tribunal prosecutors also presented judges
with written statements from other witnesses to support the
charges. Jelisic and his defense attorneys did not dispute the
statements.

Eritrea, Ethiopia trade artillery fire in border dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrean and Ethiopian troops exchanged
artillery fire across their disputed border, a government official
said Thursday.
	   Ethiopians initiated the shelling of Zala Ambessa, an Ethiopian
border town now controlled by Eritrean troops, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The two sides fought for about three hours Saturday, he said,
refusing to discuss casualties.
	   Ethiopian government spokeswoman Salome Tadesse denied the
report saying, ``There was no shelling by Ethiopia against Eritrean
forces or towns anywhere along the common border.''
	   Hostilities in the nearly six-month border dispute have
slackened since June. Repeated efforts by U.S. and African
officials to broker peace have failed.
	   Ethiopia blames Eritrea's invasion of two districts on the
960-kilometer (600-mile) border between the two countries in early
May for precipitating the crisis.
	   Eritrea, which claims rights to the disputed areas under
colonial-era agreements, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

Greece to bid for Archimedes manuscript in New York auction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece will bid for a one-of-a-kind copy
of a text by ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes in a New York
auction after a court refused to halt the bidding, the culture
minister said Thursday.
	   ``The Greek government and the institutional sponsors supporting
us will participate'' in the Christie's auction, Evangelos
Venizelos said.
	   Greece appealed earlier this month to Greek private and public
institutions for help in mounting a bid for the 1,000-year-old
manuscript, which includes copies of some of the only known
writings and calculations on geometry and physics by the 3rd BC
scientist and inventor.
	   The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem, which had claimed
the text was stolen from its library in present-day Istanbul after
World War I, had applied for an injunction against Christie's
auction house to stop the sale.
	   But the Federal Court of New York refused to halt the Thursday
auction. The manuscript, currently owned by a French family, was
expected to fetch between dlrs 800,000 and dlrs 1.2 million.
	   But Venizelos said the Patriarchate will continue with legal
action even after the auction.
	   ``Our aim is for the manuscript to be saved, to be revealed to
the scientific community, to stop being hidden,'' he said.
	   ``The Jerusalem Patriarchate has very important evidence which
perhaps could not have been judged in the phase of injunction,''
Venizelos added.
	   The 174-leaf manuscript is a palimpsest _ a text which has been
written on twice. When writing materials were in short supply, the
original text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful and
a new one written over it.
	   The manuscript was studied in 1907 by a Danish scientist, who
used only natural light and a magnifying light. Experts believe
modern methods such as ultra-violet light and digital scanning
could reveal as yet unknown workings of Archimedes.

Agassi stopped by Krajicek
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Richard Krajicek stopped Andre
Agassi's astonishing comeback when he upset the American 6-3, 6-4
in the third round of the dlrs 2.45 Eurocard Open on Thursday.
	   In a showdown between two former Wimbledon champions, Krajicek
used his serve-and-volley game to overpower Agassi and reach the
quarterfinals.
	   Tenth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov also advanced by beating Todd
Martin 6-4, 7-5, and Jan-Michael Gambill upset ninth-seeded Tim
Henman 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Krajicek, who is ranked No. 11 in the world, is trying to clinch
one of the last two places available for the eight-man World
Championship next month in Hanover, Germany.
	   Agassi already has qualified for Hanover and surged to No. 1 in
the world after winning last week's tournament in Ostrava, Czech
Republic. A former No. 1, Agassi was ranked No. 141 at this time
last year and playing challenger events. Now, he is in the Top 5
for the first time since July 15, 1996.
	   Winner of five titles this year, Agassi could not tame
Krajicek's monster serve. Agassi won only nine points on Krajicek's
serve.
	   ``When he serves that well, it's very difficult,'' Agassi said.
``He is a tough guy to develop any rhythm against. He likes the
court here. All he had to do was break my serve twice.''
	   Krajicek won the title here in 1995 and reached the final last
year.
	   ``I am very satisfied with the way I played today,'' he said.
	   ``I served very well from the start and I put a lot of pressure
on him. Eventually, he was going to miss a few passing shots,''
said Krajicek, who will have surgery on his left knee after the
indoor season.
	   ``It's a long road to Hanover, it doesn't seem that far away in
time but an eternity in points,'' said Krajicek, who hit nine aces.
	   The Dutchman trails three players _ Karol Kucera, Petr Korda and
Henman in points for Hanover. All three have lost here and Krajicek
could gain some ground if he does well in this tournament.

IAAF announces 1999 calendar; all Golden League meets on Wednesdays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRANADA, Spain (AP) _ Each of the IAAF's elite Golden League
track and field meetings next year will be held on Wednesday nights
to make the competition easier to package for television.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation on Thursday
announced its schedule of 42 outdoor meets for 1999, including the
World Championships in Seville, Spain, from Aug. 20-29.
	   The showcase Golden League, which was introduced last season,
will return this year with meets in the same six European cities _
plus the possible addition of Paris.
	   The series opens in Oslo on June 30, followed by Rome (July 7),
Monte Carlo (Aug. 4), Zurich (Aug. 11), Brussels (Sept. 1) and
Berlin (Sept. 8).
	   The Grand Prix meet in Paris on July 21 could be added to the
Golden League in the next few days, IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri
said.
	   The venue for the IAAF Grand Prix final on Sept. 11 still hasn't
been selected, although Cologne, Germany, is considered the
favorite.
	   IAAF president Primo Nebiolo has said he hopes to add meets in
England and possibly the United States to the Golden League
schedule in the future.
	   The major innovation for next season is that all Golden League
meets will take place on Wednesday nights, which the IAAF said
``will strengthen the series especially as a TV spectacle.''
	   ``This was not so easy,'' Reineri said. ``Some meets prefer to
be on Friday or Saturday. But in the end, all the organizers
accepted Wednesdsay to give consistency to the series. The goal is
give the best package to television and to establish some mental
habit with spectators.''
	   Television rights in Europe to the Golden League series are held
by the French network Canal Plus. The meets are broadcast in the
United States by Fox.
	   Just as last year, a dlrs 1 million jackpot is on offer for any
athlete or athletes going undefeated through the entire Golden
League season. The jackpot was shared last season by American
sprinter Marion Jones and distance runners Hicham El Guerrouj of
Morocco and Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia.
	   The men's disciplines which will count toward the jackpot in
1999 are: 200 meters, 800, steeplechase, 110 hurdles, long jump,
pole vault and javelin.
	   The women's events are: 200, 800, 3,000, 400 hurdles and high
jump.
	   In order to qualify for the dlrs 1 million, athletes must win
their events at all six meets and the Grand Prix final. If Paris is
added as a seventh Golden League meet, the requirement will still
be victories at six meets, not seven.
	   In addition, the IAAF said, in order to be eligible for the
jackpot, athletes must compete in the World Championships if
selected by their national federations. This was a move by the IAAF
to deter any top stars from skipping the Seville worlds.
	   Several leading athletes, notably American sprinter Maurice
Greene, complained last year that the Golden League system was
flawed. They argued it was virtually impossible to win seven
straight races in highly-competitive events.
	   But the IAAF decided to stick with the system.
	   ``We know there are some athletes who were not happy,'' Reineri
said. ``But in the opinion of the organizers, the system is working
and they decided not to change the structure.''
	   In addition to the worlds, key events in 1999 are the World
Indoor Championships in Maebashi, Japan, on March 5-7, and the
World Cross Country Championships in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on
March 27-28.
	   In the United States, where the sport continues to suffer from
lack of public interest, two meets are on the IAAF schedule: the
Oregon Track Classic in Portland on May 16 and the Prefontaine
Classic in Eugene on May 30.
	   The outdoor season will open in Australia with the Sydney Track
Classic on Feb. 20 and the Melbourne Track Classic on Feb. 25.

Former Olympic chief Pescante under investigation in doping probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The former president of the Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI) was notified Thursday he is under investigation in
connection with an ongoing probe into irregularities in
drug-testing procedures, news reports said.
	   Along with former Olympic chief Mario Pescante, prosecutors in
Ferrara were also investigating Francesco Conconi, the dean of
Italian sports doctors, and a CONI member, Michele Ferrari, the
reports said.
	   One of CONI's main medical centers is in Ferrara, a northern
city near Venice.
	   Prosecutors are seeking to determine whether risky medicines
were given to athletes.
	   Labs and archives in Ferrara have also been searched, the
Italian news agency ANSA reported.
	   Pescante resigned earlier this month amid allegations that
required doping tests of soccer players were not carried out fully
and positive tests were covered up.
	   The fallout of the doping scandal also included the firing of
the chief of CONI's drug-testing laboratory.
	   Meanwhile, Italy's Health Ministry decided to withdraw from
circulation and ban the production of erythropoietin, an omeopathic
substance which is at the base of the banned drug EPO.
	   The decision came after a French doctor, questioned by a
prosecutor in Turin, admitted to giving EPO to Serie A top players.
	   The doctor, Jerome Malzac, declined to provide names.
	   EPO, a synthetic hormone which boosts oxygen absorption in the
bloodstream, is the same substance that several cyclists in the
Tour de France are alleged to have taken.

Pilgrims commemorate Jesus' baptism at Jordan River

<TEXT>
	   KASSER EL-YAHUD, West Bank (AP) _ Roman Catholic pilgrims on
Thursday poured out of 20 tour buses and wound their way toward the
Jordan River to commemorate the baptism of Jesus.
	   In a normally closed-off military area six kilometers (four
miles) south of the biblical West Bank town of Jericho, they
celebrated a rare outdoor Mass near a spot revered in tradition as
the site of Jesus' baptism.
	   Having made their way past a bullet-scarred monastery, coils of
barbed wire and signs warning of land mines, the faithful gathered
on the riverbank, watched over by Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
police.
	   From the opposite riverbank, two Jordanian soldiers looked on as
the congregation sang and took communion.
	   Some of the pilgrims couldn't wait for the end of Mass to go to
baptismal site. They walked down steps leading to the edge of the
river and climbed over a rusty railing into the gray-green water.
	   They dipped their hands in and wet their faces and hair as
others videotaped them and took pictures.
	   Pascal Rodriguez returned from the spot with a large bottle
filled with greenish water. The Tel Aviv resident planned to send
the river water to his family in Bombay.
	   ``It's a holy place,'' he said.
	   Since at least Byzantine times, tradition has placed the site of
Jesus' baptism here, said Father Garret Edmunds, a Franciscan friar
who leads pilgrimages.
	   ``We know this is the right neighborhood if not the right
spot,'' he said. But commemorating the event is more important than
the exactness of the location, he said.
	   The site was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war along
with the rest of the West Bank. The area was off limits for many
years because Israel had laid mines along its new frontier with
Jordan.
	   Since 1983, the Israeli military had opened the site to pilgrims
four days a year. Thursday was the Roman Catholics' turn.
	   The site is also opened in January and at Easter.

Russian premier flies to troubled Caucasus for meeting with Chechen

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Primakov and Maskhadov speaking after
their meeting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov flew
Thursday to the Caucasus Mountains for an unexpected meeting with
the leader of breakaway Chechnya and other officials in the restive
region.
	   ``We did everything to bring the positions of Russia and
Chechnya closer, so that we finally overturn a tragic page in our
relations,'' Primakov said after a two-hour meeting with Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov in the southern city of Vladikavkaz.
	   The trip hadn't been announced in advance, apparently for
security reasons.
	   Primakov said that the Russian government would provide funds to
restore the war-shattered Chechen economy and help Chechen
officials combat a wave of kidnappings and other crime that has
swept the region.
	   He stressed that joint anti-crime efforts would not involve the
deployment of Russian forces in Chechnya. ``That will never
happen,'' Primakov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Despite repeated pledges, Maskhadov has achieved little in
fighting crime, having encountered strong resistance from numerous
warlords who abhor any government control. Some of them have
recently joined forces in a bid to overthrow Maskhadov.
	   Some 2,000 heavily armed men gathered at a rally in the Chechen
capital of Grozny on Thursday, demanding that Maskhadov face trial
for alleged violations of the constitution.
	   Participants at the rally, which was led by former rebel leader
Shamil Basayev, also criticized Maskhadov for meeting with
Primakov.
	   Speaking to reporters in Vladikavkaz, Maskhadov said he still
has broad popular support. ``The Chechen people support their
president, and the fact that several people demand my resignation
is a normal situation for any country,'' he said.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
1994-96 war with Russia, but no country has recognized its
independence claim. Moscow insists the territory remains part of
Russia.
	   Maskhadov, who was the top rebel commander during the war, is a
staunch proponent of independence, but the Kremlin supports him,
hoping he can stabilize the region.
	   ``Stability in Chechnya is vital not only for its residents, but
all Russians,'' Primakov said.
	   ``Chechnya must not be viewed as a part of Russia, but as a
territory suffering from serious problems following a war,''
Maskhadov said. ``We must strengthen mutual understanding between
Russia and Chechnya and fulfill earlier agreements.''
	   Chechen law enforcement officials, meanwhile, are in the midst
of a crackdown on hostage-takers. At least 100 people, including
five foreigners, are believed to be held.
	   Police raided two criminal groups Thursday morning, releasing
five hostages and arresting 14 people, said Chechen Security
Minister Aslanbek Arsayev, according to Interfax.
	   During their meeting on Thursday, Primakov and Maskhadov also
decided to set up a panel to search for those missing after the
war.
	   According to the ITAR-Tass, Primakov on Thursday also met the
presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia and discussed a
permanent settlement to 1992 fighting between ethnic Ingush and
Ossetians.

Report: settlements earmarked for isolation plan more housing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ More than 1,000 housing units will be built in
West Bank Jewish settlements that are to be isolated by Israel's
upcoming troop pullback, the Israeli paper Maariv reported
Thursday.
	   David Bar Illan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said the government did not discuss additional
housing construction, but that the units ``may very well be''
built, depending on demand.
	   Israel has claimed the right to expand settlements to allow for
``natural growth.''
	   Building within the settlements does not contradict the
agreement signed last week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, said
Bar Illan. He called it ``irrelevant.''
	   The accords do rule out unilateral actions by either side,
saying neither should take any step that will change the status of
the West Bank. Bar-Illan said internal construction does not change
the status of the settlements any more than building in Palestinian
village and cities does.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war, but has never annexed the territory.
	   The newspaper report said construction would be concentrated in
at least 11 settlements that will be virtually surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory after Israel turns over another
13.1 percent of the territory to Palestinian civilian control.
	   Most of the affected settlements are in the interior of the West
Bank, near Palestinian cities. The newspaper said sale of
apartments in those settlements has been frozen for months because
of uncertainty surrounding the Israeli withdrawal.
	   The paper reported that the Israeli government is considering
additional incentives and discounts to encourage contractors to
build housing units there, and to get Israelis to buy them.
	   Netanyahu has said no settlements would be isolated, because all
access roads to the settlements would remain under Israeli control.
	   Settlers say that does not ensure their security and charge the
pullback will leave them vulnerable to attacks by Palestinians.
	   The settlers and their backers are leading a drive to oust
Netanyahu from office through a parliamentary no-confidence vote.
	   Palestinians charge that Israeli settlements in the West Bank
are illegal and that expanding them is a violation of interim peace
accords.
	   The accord signed last week was the fifth pact signed by the
Israelis and Palestinians since 1993.

Jordanian orphans pray for King Hussein's recovery

<TEXT>
	   JEZA, Jordan (AP) _ More than 250 orphans opened their hands in
prayer under a cloud of dust in the desert.
	   The Muslim ritual is usually performed to beseech God for rain.
	   But this prayer ceremony at a desert town 50 kilometers (25
miles) south of Jordan's capital, Amman, had a different purpose.
	   ``It's a special prayer to implore (God) for the recovery of
King Hussein and his speedy return home,'' organizer Abdul-Razzak
Abu-Feilat said Thursday.
	   King Hussein, 63, has been receiving treatment for non-hodgkins
lymphoma cancer at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, since
July.
	   Israeli media have reported that Hussein's condition was
terminal. That drew widespread concern in the tiny Arab kingdom
which has known no other leader for the last 43 years.
	   But the Mayo Clinic issued a statement Wednesday saying the
king's doctors were ``very pleased with the progress of treatment,
as well as his positive response to the treatment.''
	   The prayers were the second case of national well-wishing to
Hussein this week. On Wednesday, a Jordanian group announced they
had collected more than 15,000 signatures on a
250-yard(228-meter)-long birthday card for the monarch, who turns
64 on Nov. 14. It is thought to be the longest birthday card ever
made.
	   The orphans _ mostly of the age group 5 to 10 _ have a special
bond with the king. After it came to his notice last year that they
lacked adequate facilities, he gave them one of his residences.
	   In the next Cabinet reshuffle, the king accused ministers of
``negligence in caring for our young angels.'' He has often visited
the orphans in their new home on the outskirts of Amman.
	   So when the orphans stepped off a train at Jeza on Thursday,
they were wearing white T-shirts with Hussein's portrait and the
slogan: ``Come back to us safely, you the father of all orphans.''
	   One of the children, Mutasem Hamdi, 10, said: ``I came here to
beg God for his recovery because I am very sad and worried that
he's sick.''
	   ``I love our king and can't imagine losing a father again,'' he
added with tears in his eyes.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch cut through the
Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds
whirling for a third day through resort islands and mainland
communities. At least 32 people have been killed and widespread
flooding prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground.
	   Mitch, once among the century's most powerful hurricanes,
weakened Thursday as it blasted this Central American nation,
bringing downpours that flooded at least 50 rivers. It also kicked
up huge waves that pounded seaside communities.
	   The storm's power was easing fast and by 1500 GMT, it had
sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), down from 100 mph (160 kph)
around 0600 GMT and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of early
Tuesday.
	   ``Mitch could weaken to tropical storm strength later today, but
restrengthening is possible if the center moves away from land,''
the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in a statement Thursday.
	   The center said that after remaining virtually stationary for
more than a day, the center of the 350-mile-wide
(560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly to the south but
remained just off the Honduran coast. Hurricane-force winds whirled
up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with rain-laden
tropical storm winds extending well beyond that.
	   Caught near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about
25 miles (40 kilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with
divers and beachcombers.
	   ``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike
Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (30 kilometers) off
the coast. ``Few houses have remained standing.''
	   Honduran officials said 14 people had died on that small island
alone, and at least nine had died elsewhere in the country. More
than 72,000 people had been evacuated to shelters.
	   Nine other deaths had been reported elsewhere in the region by
early Thursday _ more than a day after Mitch drifted to just off
the coast and seemed to park there. An American was thrown from his
boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on Monday and was presumed dead.
Eight others died in Nicaragua in flooding.
	   Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had
been isolated by the storm, left without power, telephones or clean
drinking water.
	   Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain,
citrus and banana crops had been damaged ``and the economic future
of Honduras is uncertain.''
	   Rain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La
Ceiba, a coastal city of 40,000 people located 80 miles (130
kilometers) from the Bay Islands. About 10,000 residents fled to
crowded shelters in schools, churches and firehouses.
	   While supplies of food and gasoline seemed to hold up, drivers
worried about the coming days formed long lines to fill their tanks
at gas stations and some supermarkets took measures to limit panic
buying.
	   La Ceiba officials appealed for pure water for those in shelters
and some residents set out plastic buckets to collect rainwater.
Only a few hotels and offices with their own generators had
electricity.
	   Wind-whipped waves almost buried some houses near the shore.
People evacuated low-lying houses by wading through chest-deep
water with sodden bags of belongings on their heads.
	   In neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 residents of coastal
Belize City had left by Wednesday, turning the country's largest
city into a ghost town.
	   Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few people
wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company
was broadcasting only The Weather Channel.
	   With the storm seemingly anchored off Honduras, officials in
Mexico to the north eased emergency measures on the Caribbean coast
of the Yucatan Peninsula.
	   More than 20,000 tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort
areas, leaving hotels at about 20 percent of capacity.
	   Houston accountant Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend
Nina Devries had tried to leave Cancun but found all the flights
full.
	   ``It's been horrible,'' said Montgomery, as she and her friend
drank cocktails at an outdoor restaurant. ``We couldn't go out on a
boat, we couldn't go snorkeling.
	   ``Even Carlos' N Charlie's and Senor Frog's are closed,'' she
said dejectedly, referring to two restaurants. ``Some vacation.''
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development sent two
helicopters each to Belize and Honduras to help in search, rescue
and relief efforts.
	   At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane
in this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the
Labor Day hurricane of 1935.

35 feared dead in boat capsize in eastern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ At least 35 people were feared drowned
Thursday when their crowded country boat capsized in a river in
eastern India, police said.
	   The boat was carrying 70 villagers to a weekly market across the
Puthimari river in Assam state when the boat sank. Thirty-five
people swam to safety but there was no trace of the rest, who were
presumed dead.
	   No rescue operations were launched immediately because the sun
had set and the area is too remote to send help after dark,
officials said. But police and local villagers were looking for
survivors and bodies.
	   No further details were available.
	   On Tuesday, 60 people were feared dead in a collision between
two boats in the Brahmaputra river near Assam's biggest town,
Gauhati.
	   By Thursday, rescue workers had located the boat 140 feet (42
meters) underwater on the river bed. But they recovered only three
bodies and there was no information about the other victims.
	   An army officer supervising rescue efforts said the undercurrent
appeared to be very strong and it was possible the bodies were
swept several miles (kilometers) away.
	   Thursday's accident is the fourth boat tragedy in Assam in two
months. Many of the boats were overcrowded and in remote areas
without safety monitors.

After League Cup triumph, Vialli's Chelsea meets Villa again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three days after his three goals knocked Aston
Villa out of the League Cup, Chelsea player-manager Gianluca Vialli
sends his team out against the same opponent in the Premier League
Saturday, with Villa top of the standings and four points clear.
	   With Chelsea also the defending Cup Winners Cup titlist and well
placed in the league, Vialli should be a happy man.
	   But the smiles turned to frowns even at the end of Wednesday's
4-1 crushing of Villa. The Chelsea manager saw his team captain,
Dennis Wise, sent off for a needless, two-footed tackle on Villa's
Darren Byfield and then received a yellow card himself for arguing
with the referee.
	   On top of that, Vialli has to deal with reports that Danish
striker Brian Laudrup could be leaving the club after only three
months. The Dane is apparently unhappy with the manager's system of
leaving players out even if they're playing well.
	   Clearly angry at the expulsion of Wise and his own yellow card,
Vialli declined to talk after Wednesday's League Cup game. But
coach Graham Rix explained Vialli's state of mind.
	   ``Luca thought straight away that Dennis would miss (four) key
games,'' Rix said ``He's an emotional man, Luca. Always on the
edge.
	   ``People get a little emotional, tempers were rising but it was
a little bit silly on our part when we were leading 4-1 with five
minutes to go.''
	   Vialli and Rix have to decide whether Wise, who has just
returned from a three-game ban, will face Villa again on Saturday
before he starts another four-match suspension for the expulsion.
	   Saturday's lineups likely will be far different from
Wednesday's. Chelsea rested eight first team regulars and Villa
left out Gareth Southgate, Stan Collymore, Paul Merson, Gareth
Barry and Lee Hendrie, who are all expected to play at Stamford
Bridge.
	   They are expected to face Marcel Desailly, Frank Leboeuf,
goalkeeper Ed de Goey, Roberto Di Matteo, Gianfranco Zola,
Pierluigi Casiraghi and Albert Ferrer, who are all in line for a
return after missing Wednesday's game. But Graeme Le Saux is still
suspended and there are doubts about Laudrup.
	   Another Chelsea victory Saturday and Villa's lead could be cut
to one point as the leading contenders apply the pressure.
	   Second place Manchester United goes to Everton while defending
titlist Arsenal, one point further behind in third place, visits
second from last Coventry.
	   Last weekend, Alex Ferguson's United was held to a 1-1 tie at
Derby while Arsene Wenger's Arsenal scored a 2-1 win at struggling
Blackburn.
	   Fourth-place Liverpool, which crushed Nottingham Forest 5-1 last
week with Michael Owen scoring four times, goes to Leicester, which
came away from Villa with a 1-1 tie.
	   Middlesbrough, holding steady at fifth after promotion, doesn't
play until Sunday but will expect three points from a home game
against next to last Forest, which may recall Dutch striker Pierre
van Hooydonk, who returned to the club this week after a
three-month, self-imposed absence.
	   Van Hooydonk returned to the Netherlands before the start of the
season saying he was angry that Forest had not strengthened the
playing squad with new signings. With Forest in the relegation
zone, the team needs his strike power and manager Dave Bassett may
include him on the lineup at the Riverside stadium.
	   Last place Southampton, three points adrift of the rest, gained
its first win of the season by beating another struggler, Coventry.
On Saturday, Dave Jones' team goes to another sliding club,
Sheffield Wednesday, hoping for three more points although, with 23
goals conceded and only six scored, it is still almost certain to
stay last.
	   Saturday's other games are Derby vs. Leeds, Newcastle vs. West
Ham and Wimbledon vs. Blackburn while Tottenham, improving under
new manager George Graham, hosts Charlton on Monday.
	   Division one leader Sunderland has a tough visit to Bolton on
Sunday so that either second place Birmingham, or Huddersfield,
which is third, can overtake on Saturday whichever team wins their
confrontation at St. Andrews.
	   Scottish Premier League leaders Rangers, surprisingly beaten by
last place Motherwell on Wednesday, should stay top by beating
Dundee United at home.
	   Second place Kilmarnock, one point behind, hosts third place
Celtic, which has three points to make up on its big Glasgow
neighbor.

Sappers defuse 121-year-old cannon ball
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Sappers in northern Bulgaria defused
Thursday a 121-year-old cannonball that didn't explode during a
Russian-Turkish war in the last century, the state news agency BTA
reported.
	   Civil Defense officials found the 100-millimeter (3.9-inch)
projectile in a rural area near the city of Pleven, 174 kilometers
(109 miles) northeast of Sofia, it said.
	   Pleven was one of the main battle scenes of the 1877-78
Russian-Turkish war which ended five centuries of Turkish rule in
Bulgaria.
	   The Civil Defense said the 3-kilogram (2.2 pound) ball had an
intact fuse and could have still exploded.

Pilgrims commemorate Jesus' baptism at Jordan River

<TEXT>
	   KASSER EL-YAHUD, West Bank (AP) _ Roman Catholic pilgrims poured
out of 20 tour buses and wound their way Thursday toward the Jordan
River to commemorate the baptism of Jesus.
	   In a normally closed-off military area six kilometers (four
miles) south of the biblical West Bank town of Jericho, they
celebrated a rare outdoor Mass near a spot revered in tradition as
the site of Jesus' baptism.
	   Having made their way past a bullet-scarred monastery, coils of
barbed wire and signs warning of land mines, the faithful gathered
on the riverbank, watched over by Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
police.
	   From the opposite riverbank, two Jordanian soldiers looked on as
the congregation sang and took communion.
	   Some of the pilgrims couldn't wait for the end of Mass to go to
baptismal site. They walked down steps leading to the edge of the
river and climbed over a rusty railing into the gray-green water.
	   They dipped their hands in and wet their faces and hair as
others videotaped them and took pictures.
	   Pascal Rodriguez returned from the spot with a large bottle
filled with greenish water. The Tel Aviv resident planned to send
the river water to his family in Bombay.
	   ``It's a holy place,'' he said.
	   Since at least Byzantine times, tradition has placed the site of
Jesus' baptism here, said Father Garret Edmunds, a Franciscan friar
who leads pilgrimages.
	   ``We know this is the right neighborhood if not the right
spot,'' he said. But commemorating the event is more important than
the exact location, he said.
	   The site was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war along
with the rest of the West Bank. The area was off limits for many
years because Israel had laid land mines along its new frontier
with Jordan.
	   Since 1983, the Israeli military had opened the site to pilgrims
four days a year. Thursday was the Roman Catholics' turn.
	   The site is also opened in January and at Easter.

Dutch software maker falls into red; cuts jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Trying to restore market
confidence, Dutch software manufacturer Baan Co. reshuffled its
management board and announced layoffs Thursday, measures that will
result in a substantial loss this year.
	   Baan fell into the red in the third quarter and said it plans to
cut up to 1,200 jobs, or 20 percent of its staff. The company will
take a charge of dlrs 110 million in the fourth quarter to pay for
the reorganization.
	   Mary Coleman, the chief executive and president of U.S. company
Aurum Software Inc., acquired by Baan in 1997, will join the
management board as president. Coleman will report to Chief
Executive Officer Tom Tinsley.
	   The third-quarter net loss was dlrs 31.7 million, compared to a
gain of dlrs 18.3 million in the same period in 1997.
	   The loss came even as sales rose 13 percent to dlrs 195 million,
but license revenue dropped a steep 20 percent to dlrs 86.6
million.
	   Earnings in the third quarter were mainly hurt by a slump in
information technology spending in the American manufacturing
sector, a major source of income for Baan.
	   The downturn caused a delay in orders from 30 clients, slashing
dlrs 60 million in potential sales.
	   Coleman said staff would be reduced at the companies Baan has
acquired in recent years. The job cuts will hit sales and marketing
and low-level management posts, she said, and maintenance and
research and development units will be spared.

Gazprom to raise gas output
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's giant natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, said
Thursday that it would increase its output by more than 15 billion
cubic meters (160 billion cubic feet) this year, a news agency
said.
	   A new pipeline has given Gazprom added capacity, allowing its
output to increase from 534 billion cubic meters (5.7 trillion
cubic feet) last year to at least 550 billion cubic meters (5.9
trillion cubic feet) this year, Interfax said, citing a Gazprom
official.
	   However, the official, Vasily Podyuk, said it is becoming
increasingly difficult for the company to continue increasing
production because many Russian customers are unable or unwilling
to pay their gas bills.

<TEXT>
	   Excerpts of written witness testimony against Goran Jelisic, a
Bosnian Serb who pleaded guilty Thursday in The Hague to slaying 12
Muslims and Croats in 1992:
	   _ Describing how Jelisic summarily executed one prisoner who was
trying to escape from his custody, a U.N. witness identified only
as Witness B said:
	   ``Goran and six other policemen ran after the prisoner ... The
prisoner near the clothing store was cornered by the policemen and
Goran. Goran took out a pistol and pointed it at the prisoner. I
was about six meters (yards) away ... I heard the prisoner say,
`Please don't kill me _ I have a wife and children.' I watched as
Goran cocked the pistol and shot the prisoner. The first shot hit
the prisoner in the shoulder. After being shot, the prisoner spun
around and Goran shot him in the back. Then as the prisoner started
falling, Goran shot him once more in the back of the head.''
	   _ Describing the murder of two prisoners at Luka camp, Witness F
said:
	   ``Goran continued beating them for several minutes and then he
killed them. He made it look so easy. I watched as Goran took the
pistol from his belt with his right hand and aim the pistol at one
man's head. He then shot the man twice in the back of the head ...
The victim's body quivered.
	   ``Within seconds of shooting the first victim, Goran then shot
the man to his left in the same manner he had shot the first man,
except he only shot the second man in the head. Goran then watched
until they stopped quivering.''
	   Yugoslav war crimes tribunal prosecutors also presented judges
with written statements from other witnesses to support the
charges. Jelisic and his defense attorneys did not dispute the
statements.

DELETES byline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite losing the court battle over the
extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Britain's foreign secretary
on Thursday defended the arrest of the former Chilean dictator on
warrants from Spain.
	   Robin Cook said the High Court's rejection of two arrest
warrants from a Spanish magistrate was not a slap in the face for
Britain, which had Pinochet arrested Oct. 16 as he recovered from
back surgery at the private London Clinic.
	   ``The Foreign Office has consistently taken the position that we
want to see due process of law carried out.'' he said. ``The ruling
that the divisional court gave in the context of international law
is now subject to appeal.''
	   The Spanish warrants sought Pinochet's extradition to face
charges of murder, torture and kidnapping of political opponents
during his 17-year rule. But the British court said Pinochet is
immune from criminal prosecution in Britain because the crimes
alleged in the warrant occurred while he was head of state.
	   Britain also was ordered to pay Pinochet's legal costs,
estimated to be 350,000 pounds (dlrs 560,000).
	   Lord Chief Justice Thomas Bingham said, however, that Pinochet
must remain in custody pending an appeal by prosecutors to the
House of Lords, Britain's highest court.
	   Prosecutors said they would file an urgent appeal Monday. It is
uncertain how long the ruling would take. Predictions in the
British media ranged from next week to several weeks.
	   A hearing was scheduled Friday on Pinochet's request to be
released on bail.
	   The general was moved Thursday to another facility, believed to
be the Grovelands Priory Hospital, a private psychiatric hospital
in north London, to recover from his surgery.
	   Scotland Yard confirmed Pinochet had been moved after an
ambulance was seen leaving the London Clinic under police escort,
but would not say where he had been taken. Grovelands would not
comment on whether Pinochet was there.
	   Bingham said he was giving British prosecutors permission to
appeal because of the ``obvious public importance and international
interest ... as to the outcome'' of the case.
	   In an editorial Thursday, The Times newspaper said ``the Lords
have a duty to issue an unambiguous judgment as swiftly as
possible.''
	   The Guardian newspaper predicted Thursday ``given the unanimity
of the High Court judges, it is unlikely that their view will be
overturned.''
	   The Spanish judge who issued the order for Pinochet's arrest
said he will continue to seek his extradition if the judge gets the
backing of National Court colleagues.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A swaggering Goran Jelisic dubbed
himself ``the Serb Adolf'' as he helped Serb forces rid a northern
Bosnian town of Muslims and Croats in 1992.
	   On Thursday, he admitted mass murder and told U.N. judges he
wanted to cleanse his soul.
	   Jelisic, a 30-year-old Bosnian Serb, pleaded guilty to Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal charges that he murdered 12 Muslims and Croats
in May 1992 in Brcko. But he also pleaded innocent to a related
genocide count _ the tribunal's most serious charge.
	   ``It was my good will that I admitted the crime and cleanse my
soul,'' he calmly told the three-judge panel. ``There is no reason
for me to keep it within myself.''
	   Jelisic will be officially convicted of the murders at his
genocide trial, presiding judge Claude Jorda said. No date was
immediately set for the trial, but it is expected to start in
December.
	   Dressed in jeans and a striped sweater, Jelisic, a former farm
machinery mechanic who likened himself to Hitler, showed no sign of
remorse during Thursday's 40-minute hearing. He was in court to
face a new indictment after prosecutors dropped several charges
from an earlier indictment to speed up his trial.
	   He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for each
slaying.
	   ``At any expense I decided to admit these crimes and I know that
even life imprisonment may follow,'' Jelisic told judges. ``It is
up to you to decide.''
	   Jelisic killed most of his victims with close-range shots from a
machine pistol and beat to death others.
	   Although most of his victims were men, he also murdered one
woman in the same ruthless fashion: He took one woman out of a room
at the Serb-run Luka camp in Brcko, beat her with a police baton
and then shot and killed her.
	   He also admitted beating other prisoners at Luka and plundering
their property.
	   At his genocide trial, prosecutors will have to convince judges
that Jelisic intended to wipe out an entire section of an ethnic
group.
	   According to his indictment, Jelisic killed ``countless''
prisoners while holding an unspecified position at Luka.
Prosecutors say the slayings were part of a campaign to rid Brcko
of non-Serbs _ a practice euphemistically known as ``ethnic
cleansing.''
	   Arrested in January by U.S. troops serving in the NATO force in
Bosnia, Jelisic will be the third war criminal convicted by the
court since it was set up by the U.N. Security Council in 1993.
	   In 1997, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic was jailed for 20 years for
killing and torturing Muslims and Croats in 1992. Tadic is
appealing the conviction.
	   Last year, Bosnian Croat Drazen Erdemovic was sentenced to five
years in prison for taking part in a Bosnian Serb Army mass
execution of Muslims following the fall of Srebrenica in 1995.

Iran's commerce minister in Iraq to boost trade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iranian Commerce Minister Mohammad
Shariatmadari arrived in Baghdad Thursday for talks on boosting
trade, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Shariatmadari will also attend the opening of the Baghdad
International Fair scheduled for Saturday. Representatives from 30
countries and 66 foreign companies are to take part.
	   ``We are looking forward to establishing an expanded program of
joint cooperation in the future,'' Shariatmadari told reporters
upon arrival.
	   Shariatmadari is expected to meet with Iraqi Trade Minister
Mohammad Medhi Saleh for talks on expanding trade under Iraq's
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations, the agency reported.
	   U.N. figures show that bilateral trade under the oil program has
totaled only dlrs 2 million since the deal started in December
1996.
	   The oil deal is an exemption from the U.N. trade sanctions
imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990. Under its current
six-month phase, Iraq is allowed oil sales of up to dlrs 5.2
billion.
	   Iran's pavilion at the Baghdad fair this year is among the
largest, exhibiting foodstuffs, medicines, household utensils, cars
and agricultural implements, the Iraqi agency reported.
	   Ties between the two former foes, which were at war from 1980 to
1988, slightly improved in July when Iraq opened its borders to
thousands of Iranians to visit Shiite holy shrines in the country.
	   Diplomats say at least 25,000 Shiite Muslims, including 15,000
Iranians, have been visiting religious sites in Iraq every month,
injecting some dlrs 480 million a year into the sanctions-hit
economy.
	   The 1980-1998 war left at least 1 million people dead or
wounded. The conflict ended with a U.N.-brokered cease-fire but the
two countries have not signed a peace treaty and relations remains
uneasy.

<TEXT>
	   JEREZ, Spain (AP) _ Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland shot a
5-under 67 Thursday to share the first-round lead in the
season-ending Volvo Masters as he tries to claim the European money
title over Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood.
	   Montgomerie and Westwood each shot 70 over the par-72
Montecastillo layout in southern Spain.
	   Tied with five others for the lead, Clarke notched his 67 with a
birdie on the 18th when he hit a 6 iron out of a fairway bunker to
6 feet (2 meters) and dropped the putt.
	   Also in at 67 were Alexander Cejka of Germany, Australians Peter
O'Malley and Greg Chalmers, Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin and England's
Gordon Brand Jr.
	   ``I hit a proper shot and picked it off the top,'' Clarke said
of his bunker shot.
	   ``A big three out of the trap certainly is a boost,'' he added.
``You can lose the tournament on the first day, but you can't win
it. Now I'm in a position, hopefully, to be in it.''
	   Montgomerie got his 70 with a 20-foot (7 meter) birdie putt on
the 18th and an eagle on the 12th.
	   ``Seventy is a fair result the way I played,'' Montgomerie said.
``I didn't putt very well and I'm still just three off the lead.''
	   I've done this before,'' he added. ``It's not as if this is
anything new. It's been going on since 1993.''
	   Going into the Europe's final event, Montgomerie leads the PGA
European Tour money list with winnings of 760,077 (dlrs 1,276,929).
Westwood is No. 2 at 714,812 (dlrs 1,200,884) followed by Clarke at
616,867 (dlrs 1,036,337).
	   This season-ending tournament is two events in one.
	   The winner of the tournament picks up 166,000 pounds (dlrs
278,880). In addition, there is a bonus payout for the top 15
finishers on the European money list _ beginning with 170,000
pounds (dlrs 285,600) for No. 1, 120,000 (dlrs 201,600) for No. 2
and so on.
	   If Montgomerie or Westwood win this final event, they would also
claim the overall money title. Westwood can also take the money
title by finishing second, provided Montgomerie is third or lower.
If Westwood finishes third, Montgomerie must finish 12th or lower.
	   For Clarke to top the money list, he must win the tournament and
hope that Westwood finishes no better than third and Montgomerie no
higher than ninth.
	   Montgomerie, Westwood or Clarke could all break the European
Tour season money record of 875,146 pounds (dlrs 1,470,245) set by
Montgomerie in 1996.

In unusual move, Arab minister visits Holocaust memorial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Arab foreign minister paid a rare visit
Thursday to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial, and expressed
hopes that ``humanity can learn a lesson'' from its horrors.
	   Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammad Khouna of the tiny African Arab
country of Mauritania was in Israel to discuss upgrading relations
and to express support for the peace process.
	   Khouna nodded attentively and asked frequent questions as he and
his entourage were led past the museum's displays. He examined
pictures of mass graves, walked on bricks from the Warsaw ghetto
and read grisly testimonies of German officers.
	   His head covered by a skullcap to show respect, Khouna later
laid a large wreath of red and white roses in the Hall of
Remembrance, a large dark chamber with an eternal flame in its
center.
	   With Arab-Jewish relations dominated by conflict, neither group
has traditionally had much interest the other side's past
sufferings.
	   Some in the Arab world simply don't acknowledge that the
Holocaust occurred. Others recognize it, but claim it is exploited
by Jews to justify Israel's existence.
	   ``It's always positive when an Arab leader is willing to learn,
understand, acknowledge and I think empathize with Jewish history
regarding the Holocaust,'' said John Lemberger, director of the
group AMCHA, which assists Holocaust survivors.
	   Khouna did not comment to reporters on his visit, but wrote in
the guestbook: ``We have made a visit today that reminded us of a
black page in history.
	   ``How odd is the ideology which led to this human catastrophe.
We hope humanity can learn a lesson from this shameful past so it
can live in brotherhood, cooperation and justice.''
	   Mordechai Paldiel, director of the memorial's Righteous Among
the Nations division, which honors non-Jews who risked their lives
to save Jews, led Khouna's tour.
	   ``I think it was an eye-opener for him,'' Paldiel said. ``He
expressed his shock and amazement at the scope and intensity of the
Holocaust.''
	   Speaking in French, Paldiel pointed out that rescuers of Jews
who were honored by Yad Vashem included Muslim Albanians and
Bosnians. He said Khouna was pleased that Muslim rescuers were
recognized.
	   Mauritania established low-level interest offices with Israel in
November 1995, angering other Arab League nations.

Truth panel slams Botha's rule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Former apartheid strongman P.W.
Botha was declared Thursday a perpetrator of gross human rights
violations during his rule as white South Africa's last hard-line
president.
	   Infirm and living in seaside retirement, P.W. Botha, 82, has
never apologized for his actions that a panel probing apartheid
abuses said included ordering bombings and an attempt to overthrow
a foreign government.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's findings could lead to
criminal prosecution of those deemed guilty of abuses who _ like
Botha _ did not apply to it for amnesty.
	   In its final report presented to President Nelson Mandela, the
Truth Commission said Botha ordered the 1988 bombing of Khotso
House, a Johannesburg building housing an anti-apartheid group.
	   The report also found Botha directly accountable for the 1987
bombing of the African National Congress' London headquarters.
	   A spokesman at Botha's house in the coastal resort of
Wilderness, about 240 miles (385 kilometers) east of Cape Town,
said Botha did not plan to make a statement.
	   Though Botha's age may make a criminal prosecution unlikely, he
has already stood trial once this year after refusing to appear
before the Truth Commission. Found guilty of contempt, Botha was
handed down a suspended one-year jail sentence and a 10,000 rand
(dlrs 5,700) fine. He has appealed the decision.
	   Botha, who once called the commission ``a circus,'' was
lambasted in the final report for his ``obduracy'' in not
testifying and forcing a trial by retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
the panel chairman.
	   ``We were faced with no choice but to lay charges,'' Tutu wrote
in his forward. ``Only a thoroughly biased person could accuse us
of harrassing a hapless old man.''
	   The commission wanted to quiz Botha about his role as chairman
of the State Security Council, a shadowy inner Cabinet that
coordinated a crackdown on anti-apartheid activists.
	   During his presidency in the 1980s thousands of people were
detained without trial. Many were tortured and others killed.
	   Even without testimony from Botha, the commission found senior
SSC members sanctioned the killing of opponents by ordering them
``neutralized'' or ``eliminated.'' Botha and others insist they
meant arrest or detain.
	   In one of the more bizarre episodes of the apartheid era, Botha
was also slammed for his role in a failed attempt to overthrow the
Seychelles government in 1981. The attack on the Indian Ocean
island state was carried out by South African soldiers and
mercenaries led by infamous dog of war Col. Mike Hoare.
	   In its findings the commission concluded South African
intelligence operatives organized the plot and Botha and senior
security ministers had to bear responsibility for the actions of
their juniors.

Schroeder pledges good relations with Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's new
chancellor, said Thursday he will work for closer ties between
Turkey and the European Union.
	   Schroeder's statement, two days after taking office, came at a
tense time in German-Turkish relations. Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz had blamed former Chancellor Helmut Kohl for leading
the EU's refusal to open membership talks with Turkey.
	   Schroeder stressed that the new Social Democrat-led government
plans to naturalize many Turkish residents with a change in German
citizenship law. He called it ``a big chance to deepen further the
traditional friendship between Germans and Turks, between Turkey
and Germany.''
	   Germany strongly supports ``bringing Turkey still closer to the
European Union,'' he said in a statement. He did not elaborate.
	   Since being rebuffed by the EU last year, Turkey _ a secular
Muslim country _ charges that the union wants to stay a Christian
club.
	   Yilmaz had made a thinly veiled appeal for Turks in Germany to
vote against Kohl in the Sept. 27 election that Schroeder won.
	   Schroeder's message was linked to Thursday's 75th anniversary of
the founding of modern, secular Turkey by Kemal Atatuerk.
	   ``I am convinced that Turkey will progress on its way into the
European family of nations also in future if it faces up to today's
challenges in the spirit of Atatuerk,'' he said.

Report: settlements earmarked for isolation plan more housing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ More than 1,000 housing units will be built in
West Bank Jewish settlements that are to be isolated by Israel's
upcoming troop pullback, the Israeli paper Maariv reported
Thursday.
	   David Bar Illan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said the government did not discuss additional
housing construction, but that the units ``may very well be''
built, depending on demand.
	   Israel has claimed the right to expand settlements to allow for
``natural growth.''
	   He said building within existing settlements does not contradict
the agreement signed last week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. He
called it ``irrelevant.''
	   Existing peace accords rule out unilateral actions by either
side that could change the status of the West Bank. Bar-Illan said
internal construction does not change the status of the settlements
any more than building in Palestinian village and cities does.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war, but has never annexed the territory.
	   The newspaper report said construction would be concentrated in
at least 11 settlements that will be virtually surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory after Israel turns over another
13.1 percent of the territory to Palestinian civilian control.
	   Most of the settlements are near Palestinian cities, it said.
	   The paper reported that the Israeli government is considering
additional incentives and discounts to encourage construction and
home sales there.
	   Netanyahu has said no settlements would be isolated, because all
access roads to the settlements would remain under Israeli control.
	   Settlers say that does not ensure their security and charge the
pullback will leave them vulnerable to attacks by Palestinians.
	   The settlers and their backers are leading a drive to oust
Netanyahu from office through a parliamentary no-confidence vote.
	   Palestinians charge that Israeli settlements in the West Bank
are illegal and that expanding them violates peace accords.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ They've dined together, partied together and even
vacationed together, but so far they haven't appeared in public
together.
	   Longtime paramours Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles
attended the wedding of society friends Santa Palmer-Tomkinson and
writer Simon Sebag-Montefiore on Thursday, but dashed hopes it
would mark their first appearance as a couple.
	   The pair crushed photographers' hopes by arriving 20 minutes
apart.
	   Charles, wearing a bright yellow waistcoat and morning suit,
waved to reporters and members of the public outside the north
London synagogue. His younger son, 14-year-old Harry, also waved
when people called out his name.
	   Mrs. Parker Bowles, who is divorced, already had arrived by then
with her two grown children.
	   The couple broke precedent on Sunday by issuing their first
joint statement to deny cooperating in a new royal book that
contains damaging allegations about Charles' former wife, the late
Princess Diana.
	   While Britons have warmed to Charles since Diana's death,
opinion polls show a majority of people still object to the
possibility of the heir to the throne marrying Mrs. Parker Bowles.

Has Aeroflot got a deal for you! Cheap flights, with a catch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Call it the airborne version of Russian roulette.
	   Aeroflot, Russia's largest airline, announced a great deal
Thursday on roundtrip tickets to and from the United States _ only
$260. The catch: Buyers have to agree to randomly selected dates of
departure.
	   As explained by the ITAR-Tass news agency, Aeroflot has
developed and patented a new ticket-selling technology that it
plans to begin using on flights between Moscow and Washington,
Chicago and New York.
	   The technology, called ``Z-tariff,'' uses an automatic booking
system in which customers are allowed to choose only their
destination and length of stay within a three-month period. The
computer then selects the departure date.
	   The system has obvious advantages for the airline, which can
fill otherwise underbooked flights. Airline officials noted, rather
obviously, that the system works best for customers who are
``insensitive'' to time pressures.

<TEXT>
	   CHANIA, Greece (AP) _ Prosecutors planned Thursday to charge two
crew members of a fishing boat that transported 275 Iraqi Kurds to
the Greek island of Crete.
	   The two men were identified by Chania port authorities as
Mustafa al Abdul Fatah, the ship's 46-year-old Libyan captain, and
Mohammed el Hamsa, 28, a Syrian.
	   They were arrested Wednesday when port authorities stopped the
Lebanese-flagged Santa Maria. The illegal immigrants, including
about 130 children, were huddled on board the 19-meter (62-foot)
wooden vessel.
	   According to media reports, the Santa Maria had set sail from
Lebanon about two weeks ago and was heading for Italy but was
forced to turn towards Crete when it ran into bad weather.
	   The immigrants are being temporarily housed in a Chania hotel.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants try to reach Greece each
year from Turkey and the Middle East.

In unusual move, Arab minister visits Holocaust memorial

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Arab foreign minister paid a rare visit
Thursday to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial, and expressed
hopes that ``humanity can learn a lesson'' from its horrors.
	   Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammad Khouna of the African Arab country
of Mauritania was in Israel to discuss upgrading relations and to
express support for the peace process.
	   Khouna nodded attentively and asked frequent questions as he and
his entourage were led past the museum's displays. He examined
pictures of mass graves, walked on bricks from the Warsaw ghetto
and read grisly testimonies of German officers.
	   His head covered by a skullcap to show respect, Khouna later
laid a large wreath of red and white roses in the Hall of
Remembrance, a large dark chamber with an eternal flame in its
center.
	   With Arab-Jewish relations dominated by conflict, neither group
has traditionally had much interest the other side's past
sufferings.
	   Some in the Arab world simply don't acknowledge that the
Holocaust occurred. Others recognize it, but claim it is exploited
by Jews to justify Israel's existence.
	   ``It's always positive when an Arab leader is willing to learn,
understand, acknowledge and I think empathize with Jewish history
regarding the Holocaust,'' said John Lemberger, director of the
group AMCHA, which assists Holocaust survivors.
	   Khouna did not comment to reporters on his visit, but wrote in
the guestbook: ``We have made a visit today that reminded us of a
black page in history.
	   ``How odd is the ideology which led to this human catastrophe.
We hope humanity can learn a lesson from this shameful past so it
can live in brotherhood, cooperation and justice.''
	   Mordechai Paldiel, director of the memorial's Righteous Among
the Nations division, which honors non-Jews who risked their lives
to save Jews, led Khouna's tour.
	   ``I think it was an eye-opener for him,'' Paldiel said. ``He
expressed his shock and amazement at the scope and intensity of the
Holocaust.''
	   Speaking in French, Paldiel pointed out that rescuers of Jews
who were honored by Yad Vashem included Muslim Albanians and
Bosnians. He said Khouna was pleased that Muslim rescuers were
recognized.
	   Mauritania established low-level interest offices with Israel in
November 1995, angering other Arab League nations.

Chinese runners climb skyscraper to mark ancient holiday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Updating an ancient tradition, runners
marked a Chinese hill-climbing holiday by racing to the top of the
country's tallest skyscraper.
	   Eighty competitors from Shanghai universities took part in the
race Tuesday up the stairs of the 88-story, 420-meter-tall
(1386-foot-tall) Jinmao Mansion in the Pudong financial district of
Shanghai, China's financial capital.
	   The date _ the ninth day of the ninth month in the Chinese lunar
calendar _ is traditionally marked by climbing outings to high
spots on mountains or hills.
	   Builders of the Jinmao Tower, which is to be completed later
this year, say it is surpassed in height only by the Petronas
Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the Sears Tower in Chicago.
	   Hua Xiao, winner with a time of 15 minutes, said he hadn't
realized how hard the climb would be.
	   ``It is really different from running on the flat field,'' Hua
said. ``The higher I got, the more exhausted I felt.''
	   Winners took home floral wreaths. Some of their competitors had
to stop for oxygen offered by paramedics.
	   But the winner among the women, Lin Xiaopei, already was looking
for her next chance to race.
	   ``I would definitely be interested to take part in a race to
climb the highest tower in the world,'' she said.

Polish pianist plans tour on 150th anniversary years of Chopin's
</HEADLINE>
death &QL;

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman said
Thursday he is forming an orchestra that he will lead next year on
a tour of Europe and the United states to mark the 150th
anniversary of Frederic Chopin's death.
	   After two weeks of rehearsals in Bologna, Italy, the orchestra
of mainly Polish musicians, will open the tour Aug. 21 with a
concert featuring both of Chopin's piano concertos at the renowned
music festival in Salzburg, Austria.
	   The orchestra is then to return to Poland for concerts and to
record the concertos, written by Poland's greatest composer before
he turned 20.
	   After performances in Germany, France, Great Britain, Belgium
the Netherlands and Spain, Zimerman's orchestra is to travel to the
United States for four weeks for a string of performances,
including in Philadelphia, New York and Newark.
	   Zimerman, 42, a leading pianist who was born and educated in
Poland but now resides in Switzerland, said he wants to form an
orchestra that is distinguished by its own sound and style at a
time when most orchestras sound alike.
	   Chopin was born in 1810 in Zelazowa Wola, some 60 kilometers (37
miles) west of Warsaw, to a Polish mother and French father who
arrived in Poland with Napoleon's army.
	   Chopin left Poland in 1830, settled in Paris the following year
and died there at the age of 39.
	   He wrote almost exclusively for the piano. Chopin's romantic
compositions are marked by beauty of melody and power of
expression.

Hamas claims responsibility for car bomb explosion in Gaza

	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant
rammed an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep that was
escorting a bus full of elementary school students Thursday. The
powerful blast killed the attacker and a soldier.
	   An Israeli commander said the jeep had swerved to keep the car
away from the children.
	   The anti-Israeli group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
suicide attack that also injured three Israelis and four
Palestinians.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and told him he must wage all-out war on
terrorism if he wants Israel to go pull back troops in the West
Bank over the next 12 weeks, as promised.
	   Arafat vowed to track down the masterminds of the bombing, and
in a first step dozens of Hamas activists, including several
leaders of the group, were arrested in Gaza.
	   Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Israeli hard-liners to
call off the deal and the terror attack, the second this week,
makes it increasingly difficult for him to defend sell the
land-for-security agreement at home.
	   The blast went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) at the Gush
Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time, the Israeli
school bus convoy guarded by two jeeps was passing by.
	   Nine-year-old Eran Ayoube, who was on the bus, said he had just
finished his daily traveler's prayer and said ``amen'' when he
heard a loud boom and the windows around him were shattered.
	   His 10-year-old sister Adar said children began to cry and were
ordered by the driver to drop to the floor of the bus for cover.
	   ``There was terrible smoke everywhere. I thought I was going to
be burned,'' Adar said, sitting on her bicycle parked on a sidewalk
outside her home in the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom.
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb was so powerful that the jeep flipped over on its side.
The jeep and the bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in the
nearby town of Khan Yunis, were scorched and mangled.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler, said the jeep was still
burning an hour after the blast. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered
all over. There is oil, gas, blood,'' Kirshenzach told Israel
radio.
	   Pieces of black debris were scattered over a 50-yard (50-meter)
radius. A black, scorched shoe lay in the middle of the road.
	   The Israeli army said that immediately after the blast, Israeli
soldiers chased what they thought were suspects fleeing the scene.
Troops opened fire, wounding one Palestinian man. Palestinian
police, in turn, fired on Israeli troops, but no one was injured in
the exchange that lasted several minutes, the army said.
	   The roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed from the force of the
explosion and three Palestinian girls were injured, their relatives
said. Two girls were hospitalized and a third remained at home with
cuts to the back and hand.
	   After the attack, the Israeli children were taken to their
school in Gush Katif settlement bloc before returning home to Kfar
Darom. In school, the children talked about their experience. The
children spoke of the big boom and flames and many asked about
their friends on a second bus, said Principal Yitzhak Amitai.
	   In a call to Israel radio, a man who said he spoke for Hamas
read a claim of responsibility. ``It's a revolution until
victory,'' the caller said, suggesting the attacks would continue.
	   A Hamas official in the West Bank said the group felt it was
being targeted by the new peace agreement and that it had nothing
to lose by launching attacks in hopes of derailing the accord.
	   The spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said the
group wanted to avoid Palestinian civil war and would not react
violently to a possible crackdown by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Palestinian policemen were posted outside Yassin's home Thursday
evening and searched those entering and leaving. Reporters were
barred from the area.
	   Netanyahu said he expected an all-out crackdown on the militants
as a condition for implementation of the peace agreement. ``I told
him (Arafat) that the test will be ... the absolute enlistment of
the Palestinian Authority against terrorists,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``He told me he had just emerged from a meeting a meeting with
his security chiefs and had given them instructions in that
spirit,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Arafat condemned the bombing. He said he would arrest the
masterminds and ``try them for deliberately harming the
Palestinians' national interests.''
	   In a first crackdown, dozens of Hamas activists were rounded up
and several leaders were summoned for questioning, including
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar.
	   Palestinian police also questioned the owner of the car used in
the bombing, identified as Mohammed Abdallah who said he had sold
the vehicle a day earlier.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) - Ending a cathartic exercise in
truth-telling Thursday, the panel probing apartheid's horror called
the system a crime against humanity. It also condemned the main
enemy of white rule, the African National Congress, for torture and
killings.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued a sprawling
report that spared few parties in South Africa's history from 1960
to 1994, when all-race elections ended white minority rule.
	   Publication of the five hard-cover volumes numbering 2,750 pages
was a major event in South Africa's efforts to deal with its
violent past. It culminated more than two years of hearings of
apartheid's perpetrators and victims, who produced some 21,000
statements.
	   The idea was to set the record straight after decades of
censorship and lies by white governments. But the hearings also
were like collective psychoanalysis, an emotional exploration of a
nation's pain.
	   ``Let the waters of healing flow from Pretoria today ... to
cleanse our land, its people and to bring unity and
reconciliation,'' Desmond Tutu, the retired Anglican archbishop who
headed the commission, told President Nelson Mandela in handing
over the report here.
	   ``We will have looked the beast in the eye. We will have come to
terms with our horrendous past and it will no longer keep us
hostage,'' he said.
	   The commission laid the heaviest burden of guilt, not
surprisingly, on white governments. The commissioners accused those
at the highest level of power -- top officials who served on the
secretive State Security Council -- of sanctioning killings,
torture and beatings of political opponents.
	   They also condemned lawyers, judges, church officials and
journalists who through collaboration or silence perpetuated the
apartheid system.
	   ``The recognition of apartheid as a crime against humanity
remains a fundamental starting point for reconciliation in South
Africa,'' the commissioners wrote.
	   It indirectly suggested prosecution for key figures, including
P.W. Botha, the last hardline apartheid president; Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, Mandela's ex-wife and an ANC official; and
Mangosuthu Buthulezi, leader of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha
Freedom Party and a member of government.
	   They were implicated in ``gross human rights violations.'' The
document said `prosecution should be considered where evidence
exists that an individual has committed a gross human rights
violation.''
	   Despite its conciliatory goal, the report's release seemed to
intensify division. F.W. de Klerk, the last white president who
negotiated his National Party from power, successfully sued to
strike critical comments.
	   The ANC had less luck. A judge Thursday morning blocked their
lawsuit to quash the report hours before the handover. The party
had backed the commission's creation, and most commissioners were
identified with the liberation struggle.
	   The legal maneuvering outraged Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1984 for his anti-apartheid efforts.
	   ``I have struggled against a tyranny. I didn't do that in order
to substitute it with another,'' he told journalists.
	   Mandela conceded the report would not produce instant
reconciliation.
	   ``Its release is bound to reawaken many of the difficult and
troubling emotions that the hearings themselves brought,'' Mandela
said.
	   Much of the report is taken up tales of torture, police
beatings, months in jail without trial, soldiers firing on peaceful
marches, the recovery of remains of state-slain activists.
	   It contains a lengthy historical review of apartheid and the
struggle against it. Historians consider the commission's work a
ready-made and vast national archive.
	   Among its findings:
	   _ Botha, prime minister and then president from 1978 to 1989,
``contributed to and facilitated a climate in which ... gross
violations of human rights could and did occur and as such is
accountable for such violations.''
	   _ ANC party security officials ``routinely used torture''
against suspected spies and dissidents. The organization planted
land mines that killed farm laborers and their families and killed
innocent civilians in bomb blasts.
	   The party has always argued that it was fighting a just war
against a towering evil -- apartheid -- and that it was wrong to
equate its actions with that of the white security forces.
	   But the commissioners, in effect, said the end did not justify
the means, and that the ANC and other liberation movements were
``morally and politically accountable'' for gross violations of
human rights.
	   _ Madikizela-Mandela knew and possibly participated in the
killing and torture of suspected dissidents by her gang of personal
bodyguards, known as the Mandela United Football Club.
	   _ Buthelezi, now home affairs minister, in his role as IFP
leader was responsible for abuses committed by his followers, who
engaged in a bloody turf war with local ANC supporters. The IFP was
second only to the state in bearing responsibility. Its leaders
were responsible for the killing of enemies and inciting violence.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian police sealed off the
area around the home of Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin on
Thursday, but it was not immediately clear whether he was under
house arrest.
	   A relative of the quadriplegic Yassin said the Hamas leader had
not been notified that he was barred from leaving his home. He said
Yassin's first appointment outside his home was Friday morning and
that he had not plans to leave his home in the meantime.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ordered a crackdown on Hamas
after the group claimed responsibility for Thursday's suicide
bombing in Gaza in which an Israeli soldier was killed.
	   Dozens of Hamas activists were arrested and several senior
members of the group summoned for questioning.
	   On Thursday evening, police sealed off the area around Yassin's
home and questioned those trying pass. Journalists were barred from
the area.

Lawyer sues Sunday Telegraph for article on Copts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian lawyer filed a suit against a
British Sunday newspaper Thursday, claiming 100 million sterling
pounds (dlrs 167 million) on grounds that an article on a police
swoop harmed Egypt's reputation.
	   Mustafa Raslan, who is known for high-profile suits in defense
of Egypt or Islam, is suing The Sunday Telegraph because it alleged
the police carried out a crackdown on Coptic Christians, police
officials said. He claims the Oct. 25 article harmed both Muslims
and Christians in Egypt.
	   The British Broadcasting Corporation is a co-respondent on the
grounds that it broadcast large portions of the article, the
officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   Egyptian human rights groups have accused the police of
arresting some 1,200 Coptic Christians, and torturing scores of
them, after the murder in August of two Copts in al-Kushh, a town
400 kilometers (240 miles) south of Cairo. The town's inhabitants
are predominantly Copts.
	   While rights groups have drawn attention to the swoop as a case
of police brutality, The Sunday Telegraph article said it was a
government crackdown on Christians and alleged instances of rape

Armenian World War II vets demand benefits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ More than a thousand World War II
veterans blocked traffic in front of the Armenian parliament
building Thursday, demanding special pension benefits.
	   The veterans said Armenia is the only country in the post-Soviet
Commonwealth of Independent States that doesn't have a law granting
special benefits to Soviet veterans of World War II.
	   A bill providing the benefits passed in its first reading in the
National Assembly last spring, but legislators put off a final
hearing until 2000.
	   A spokesman for the protesters said there are between 18,000 and
19,000 World War II veterans remaining in Armenia. They now receive
pensions ranging from 7,500 dram to 15,000 dram (dlrs 15 to 30) a
month.

Solidarity government wants new state TV board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Solidarity-led government asked the
national radio and television authority on Thursday to replace the
supervisory board of Poland's public television to include members
of the four major political parties.
	   The proposal by State Treasury Minister Emil Wasacz, is a part
of the government's effort to gain some control over public
television, whose board appointed under a previous government in
1993-97, is dominated by leftists.
	   The move follows Solidarity's criticism of the public television
news reports. Government officials and union leaders have accused
television directors of bias and support of leftist parties as well
as unfair treatment of the right-wing Cabinet of Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek.
	   It also follows dismissals last week of two television
journalists, considered as pro-Solidarity.
	   The government suggests that a new board should consist of four
members, representing Solidarity, its junior government coalition
partner Freedom Union and two main opposition groups _ Democratic
Left Alliance of the ex-communists and the Polish Peasants' Party.
	   It was not immediately known when the National Radio and
Television Council will act on the government proposal, according
to spokeswoman Anna Kowalewska. The council rejected a similar
motion in May.
	   Telewizja Polska S.A., which broadcasts two nationwide channels,
one regional channel and one satellite program for foreign viewers,
is owned by the government, but is run by the supervisory board,
which appoints TV management.
	   The current board has five members, representing the
ex-communists and peasants.
	   Solidarity has unsuccessfully fought for an equal representation
in TV management for the government and opposition since it won
parliamentary elections last fall.
	   In June, when the four-year management terms expired, the
leftists on the supervisory board appointed Robert Kwiatkowski, a
former media adviser to President Aleksander Kwasniewski as state
TV chairman and filled four remaining management board positions
with three other leftists and one rightist.
	   Despite a growing number of private networks in Poland, which
attract many viewers with popular films and shows, most Poles still
get their television news from state television.

Cocoa price drops to 8-month low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The price of cocoa _ a major export earner for
west African states such as Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Cameroon and
Nigeria _ has dropped to an eight-month low, according to data
released Thursday by the International Cocoa Organization.
	   The London-based intergovernmental agency's latest daily cocoa
market indicator price has fallen to dlrs 1,609.28 per metric ton
from dlrs 1,629.16 in February.
	   Traders said that the market's recent decline was due to worries
about consumption prospects caused by Russia's economic problems,
and improving new-season crop prospects in the key West African
producing region.

Airlines cry foul over Puerto Rico-American deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ U.S. airlines are protesting a
proposed hike in passenger fees at San Juan's international airport
that exempts Puerto Rico's largest carrier, American Airlines.
	   Puerto Rico's Ports Authority plans to raise fees in January by
5 percent to 6 percent, but American's 1-cent per passenger fee
will stay intact, the San Juan Star reported Thursday.
	   Airlines other than American currently pay dlrs 1.50 per
passenger for U.S. flights and dlrs 2.78 per passenger for foreign
flights. The fees help maintain terminals at the Luis Munoz Marin
International Airport.
	   Gus Rubio, general manager for United Airlines, said carriers
will be hesitant to raise air fares in order to stay competitive
with American.
	   ``Obviously, it's not fair. It puts us at a disadvantage,''
Rubio said.
	   ``It's outrageous, especially since American has turned its back
on the island by cutting back service and closing its (San Juan
hub),'' said Rob Kulat, spokesman for Kiwi International Air Lines.
	   American officials declined to comment Wednesday, the Star said.
	   Ports Authority spokesman Raul Torres said officials had to take
into consideration American Airlines' sale of a new terminal at the
airport to the government last year for dlrs 31 million. In all,
American has spent roughly dlrs 150 million in airport
improvements, the Star said.
	   Kulat said several airlines plan to object to the fee hike at a
public hearing on Nov. 24.

International conference on Albania to convene in Tirana
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Officials from 25 countries meet here
Friday to discuss further political and economic support for
Europe's poorest country. Hard questions are expected about where
the money which Albania received in the last 12 months went.
	   Albania is believed to have received over dlrs 200 million from
donor countries since the last such gathering took place in Rome on
Oct. 17, 1997.
	   At the Rome meeting, then-Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano
asked for dlrs 300 million, trying to convince the foreign
ministers' gathering that his country, at the mercy of armed gangs
earlier that year, had become stable enough politically to make
sure the aid was used properly.
	   Nano also promised his Cabinet would establish public order,
carry out economic reform, fight corruption, strengthen state
institutions and enact a constitution.
	   A year later, however, few of those promises have been kept.
This small Balkan country is deeply split between the ruling
Socialist Party of former Communists and the Democratic Party led
by former President Sali Berisha.
	   Public order is far from established, crime is high and the
economy is still in tatters, with foreign investment down to a
trickle because of lingering instability.
	   Several days of unrest last month, caused by the assassination
of an opposition leader, led to Nano's resignation and the
appointment of a new prime minister, 30-year-old Pandeli Majko.
	   Those attending the Friday conference will include the foreign
ministers of Italy and Greece, as well as representatives of the
United States, the European Union, Japan and the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been
monitoring events in Albania since last year.
	   While Albanian officials hope to receive more aid and
investments, government officials from a number of countries are
expected to ask them what was done with the aid given since last
year and why much of the country is still so unsafe.
	   Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo told reporters earlier
this week that he expects foreign criticism to be voiced at the
conference.
	   The economy is still suffering from the effects of last year's
collapse of pyramid schemes in which most Albanians lost their life
savings.
	   Corruption is rampant at all levels of the state administration
and smuggling of anything from cigarettes and coffee to illegal
immigrants to Italy is a daily routine.
	   And there is no dialogue between the two feuding political
camps, hampering parliamentary work and adding to a general sense
of drift.
	   In the absence of deputies from the Democratic Party, the
Socialist-dominated parliament adopted a constitution and is
preparing to hold a referendum on it Nov. 22. The opposition has
boycotted parliament all along and is likely to boycott the
referendum as well.

Batistuta, Edmundo feed hopes of Florentine Renaissance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Two Latin American star-forwards, who
reluctantly extended their contracts with Fiorentina, are feeding
dreams of a Florentine Renaissance in soccer.
	   Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta and Brazilian virtuoso
Edmundo combined for 11 goals in six rounds, lifted Fiorentina atop
the Serie A standings and sparked hopes that the team with the
violet jerseys could clinch its first league title in 30 years.
	   A stellar forward line, also including Brazilian-born Belgian
Oliveira and Portuguese Rui Costa, and a tight defense in the
tradition of newly signed veteran coach Giovanni Trapattoni have
produced one of the most consistent teams this season. It is
challenging such traditional powerhouses as Juventus of Turin,
Inter Milan and AC Milan.
	   With a league best of 13 goals scored and only four allowed, the
Florentine team is leading defending league champion Juventus 15
points to 13.
	   Fiorentina's record could have been an astonishing six wins in a
row had it not lost to a shorthanded AS Roma two weeks ago,
allowing two injury-time goals for a 2-1 defeat.
	   ``I would trade the Oscar for the ``Scudetto'' (league
titles),'' Fiorentina's owner Vittorio Cecchi Gori, a movie
producer, said this week.
	   Cecchi Gori produced the Roberto Benigni film ``La Vita e'
Bella'' (``Life is Beautiful''), which may be Italy's candidate for
an Academy Award for best foreign film.
	   Batistuta and Edmundo had angered Cecchi Gori in the off season
when both tried to transfer to other clubs, forcing the club
president to re-negotiate their contracts.
	   Batistuta, 29, who has been playing with Fiorentina since 1991,
has scored eight goals in league matches including three in one
game against AC Milan.
	   Edmundo, 27, in his second season in Italy, has added three
goals, but more than that has shown to be a perfect supporting
partner for his Argentine teammate.
	   Not by chance Batistuta's game winner, in Wednesday's Italian
Cup match against Lecce, came on an assist by Edmundo.
	   In weekend action Fiorentina's forwards are called to a tough
test against Parma, which fields the strongest Serie A defense -
only two goals allowed and both in last Sunday's 1-2 upset by
Perugia.
	   The Parma team, which trails the league leader by six points
after starting the season as a top title contender, has been
suffering from a sterile attack, although starting such strikers as
Colombian Faustino Asprilla, Enrico Chiesa and young Argentine
Hernan Crespo.
	   Parma scored only four goals in six rounds. Its new coach
Alberto Malesani lamented that his players were suffering for being
bitterly criticized by the media and club president Stefano Tanzi
for their disappointing start - two wins, three draws and one loss.
	   Parma-Fiorentina, which kicks off at 1330gmt, is one of the
three games scheduled Saturday because of UEFA Cup commitments of
some Italian teams next week.
	   Venezia-Bologna is also scheduled in the afternoon with AS Roma
against Udinese at night.
	   Roma, tied with crosstown rival Lazio and Inter Milan in fourth
place at 10 points, seeks revenge for last Sunday's undeserved 2-3
loss against AC Milan.
	   The game at Rome's Olympic stadium features a duel between
Brazilian internationals - Amoroso, Udinese's leading scorer with
six goals, versus Aldair, Cafu and Paulo Sergio.
	   In Sunday's action Inter takes on Bari at San Siro, third-place
AC Milan travels to Piacenza, Juventus hosts Sampdoria, Lazio plays
Salernitana on the road, Perugia is at Empoli and Vicenza plays
Cagliari.
	   Brazilian star Ronaldo, a key to Inter's UEFA Cup triumph and
second place in the league standings last season, is an uncertain
starter against Bari because of his questionable form as a result
of tendinitis in both knees.
	   Following consecutive losses to Lazio and Juventus, Inter badly
needs a convincing victory Sunday to stop growing protests by its
supporters.
	   Groups of angry fans hurled eggs at the bus taking Inter players
to the stadium for an Italian Cup match against Castel Di Sangro
Wednesday night. Fans also booed the team at the end of the game,
despite a 1-0 victory on a goal by young Italian striker Nicola
Ventola.
	   For the match against La Samp, led by Argentine star Ariel
Ortega, Juventus will be without key midfielders Zinedine Zidane
and Edgar Davids, both suspended.
	   The offense will be at full force with Alessandro Del Piero
teaming with Pippo Inzaghi.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Europe's largest shipbuilder, Kvaerner,
on Thursday delivered the last of eight ships to Carnival Cruise
Lines, the non-smoking Paradise.
	   The 70,400-ton ship, designed to carry 2,600 passengers and 900
crew members, was built at Kvaerner's Masa Yards in Helsinki.
	   The ship is worth some dlrs 300 million and brought to dlrs 2.5
billion the total value of liner orders from Carnival Cruise to
Kvaerner, said Jukka Jaatinen, project manager at the Masa ards.
	   The vessel, with a large red non-smoking sign on its stern, is
the world's first non-smoking cruise liner in the world, Jaatinen
said.
	   ``The ship is certainly completely smoke-free, as the Helsinki
yard workers did not smoke on board during her construction
period,'' Jaatinen said. ``And no one else has been allowed to
smoke on board either.''

	   A district court in the troubled Kosovo province sentenced Tahir
Salihi, 62, to seven years in prison for smuggling arms from across
the border with neighboring Albania.
	   Hekuran Cari, 18, was sentenced to eight years imprisonment on
similar charges.
	   Both were arrested in July while illegally crossing the border
on separate occasions. They had allegedly opened fire at Yugoslav
army border patrols they encountered.

U.N. envoy meets for second time with Myanmar opposition leader

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A day after a U.N. report sharply
criticized Myanmar's ruling junta, a U.N. envoy on Thursday met for
the second time with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in an
effort to promote a dialogue between government and opposition.
	   The meeting between Alvaro de Soto, a special representative of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and Suu Kyi, head of the
National League for Democracy, followed the envoy's meeting
Wednesday with a top junta official.
	   De Soto had a previous meeting with Suu Kyi on Tuesday, the day
he arrived.
	   United Nations, government and opposition sources have been
generally closemouthed about the details of de Soto's mission.
	   The new U.N. report, whose release in New York was unrelated to
de Soto's visit, expressed deep concern about the continued
harassment of political leaders and the detention of political
prisoners in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   It said serious human rights violations by Myanmar's armed
forces were continuing in the ethnic minority areas, including
arbitrary executions _ not sparing women and children _ rape,
torture, inhuman treatment, forced labor and denial of freedom of
movement.
	   ``These violations have been so numerous and consistent over the
past years as to suggest that they are not simply isolated or the
acts of individual misbehavior by middle- and lower-rank officers
but are rather the result of policy at the highest level, entailing
political and legal responsibility,'' it said.
	   The report was one of a series of country-by-country human
rights reports by special rapporteurs presented to the General
Assembly this year.
	   A faxed request to the Myanmar government for a response to the
charges went unanswered.
	   The government said Thursday that Khin Nyunt, a senior member of
the ruling junta, ``clarified the current political social and
economic situation of Myanmar'' in his meeting Wednesday with de
Soto. It said de Soto had conveyed Annan's position, and ``the
meeting was reported to be constructive and fruitful.''
	   De Soto is on his fifth visit as a U.N. envoy since 1995. Since
he last visited Myanmar in January, relations between the
government and the opposition have deteriorated sharply, with the
military increasing its repression of the pro-democracy movement
and Suu Kyi's party increasing its challenges to the government's
legitimacy.
	   In the past few months, almost 1,000 members of Suu Kyi's party
have been detained in an effort to block its activities. More than
100 have reportedly been released in the past few weeks, including
15 Thursday, the government said.
	   In a statement released late Thursday, the National League for
Democracy urged the government to prove its goodwill by freeing all
the detainees ``immediately without any preconditions.''
	   It criticized the junta's contention that party members had not
been arrested, but merely invited to government guest houses for an
exchange of views, as ``dishonorable.''
	   The assertion ``was a deliberate attempt by the government to
deceive the visiting U.N. special envoy to Myanmar,'' it said.

Hamas claims responsibility for car bomb explosion in Gaza

	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant
rammed an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep that was
escorting a bus full of elementary school students Thursday. The
powerful blast killed the attacker and a soldier.
	   An Israeli commander said the jeep had swerved to keep the car
away from the children.
	   The anti-Israeli group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
suicide attack that also injured three Israelis and four
Palestinians.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and told him he must wage all-out war on
terrorism if he wants Israel to pull back troops in the West Bank
over the next 12 weeks, as promised.
	   Arafat vowed to track down the masterminds of the bombing, and
in a first step dozens of Hamas activists, including its spritual
leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, were arrested in Gaza.
	   Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Israeli hard-liners to
call off the deal and the terror attack, the second this week,
makes it increasingly difficult for him to defend sell the
land-for-security agreement at home.
	   The blast went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) at the Gush
Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time, the Israeli
school bus convoy guarded by two jeeps was passing by.
	   Nine-year-old Eran Ayoube, who was on the bus, said he had just
finished his daily traveler's prayer and said ``amen'' when he
heard a loud boom and the windows around him were shattered.
	   His 10-year-old sister Adar said children began to cry and were
ordered by the driver to drop to the floor of the bus for cover.
	   ``There was terrible smoke everywhere. I thought I was going to
be burned,'' Adar said, sitting on her bicycle parked on a sidewalk
outside her home in the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom.
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb was so powerful that the jeep flipped over on its side.
The jeep and the bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in the
nearby town of Khan Yunis, were scorched and mangled.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler, said the jeep was still
burning an hour after the blast. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered
all over. There is oil, gas, blood,'' Kirshenzach told Israel
radio.
	   Pieces of black debris were scattered over a 50-yard (50-meter)
radius. A black, scorched shoe lay in the middle of the road.
	   The Israeli army said that immediately after the blast, Israeli
soldiers chased what they thought were suspects fleeing the scene.
Troops opened fire, wounding one Palestinian man. Palestinian
police, in turn, fired on Israeli troops, but no one was injured in
the exchange that lasted several minutes, the army said.
	   The roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed from the force of the
explosion and three Palestinian girls were injured, their relatives
said. Two girls were hospitalized and a third remained at home with
cuts to the back and hand.
	   After the attack, the Israeli children were taken to their
school in Gush Katif settlement before returning home to Kfar
Darom. In school, the children talked about their experience. The
children spoke of the big boom and flames and many asked about
their friends on a second bus, said Principal Yitzhak Amitai.
	   In a call to Israel radio, a man who said he spoke for Hamas
read a claim of responsibility. ``It's a revolution until
victory,'' the caller said, suggesting the attacks would continue.
	   A Hamas official in the West Bank said the group felt it was
being targeted by the new peace agreement and that it had nothing
to lose by launching attacks in hopes of derailing the accord.
	   Yassin, said the group wanted to avoid Palestinian civil war and
would not react violently to a possible crackdown by the
Palestinian Authority.
	   Palestinian policemen were posted outside Yassin's home Thursday
evening and searched those entering and leaving. Reporters were
barred from the area.
	   Netanyahu said he expected an all-out crackdown on the militants
as a condition for implementation of the peace agreement. ``I told
him (Arafat) that the test will be ... the absolute enlistment of
the Palestinian Authority against terrorists,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``He told me he had just emerged from a meeting a meeting with
his security chiefs and had given them instructions in that
spirit,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Arafat condemned the bombing. He said he would arrest the
masterminds and ``try them for deliberately harming the
Palestinians' national interests.''
	   In a first crackdown, dozens of Hamas activists were rounded up
and several leaders were summoned for questioning, including
spokesman Mahmoud Zahar.
	   Palestinian police also questioned the owner of the car used in
the bombing, identified as Mohammed Abdallah who said he had sold
the vehicle a day earlier.

Syrian parliamentary election campaign begins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Campaigning began Thursday for Syria's
parliamentary elections next month, with candidates putting up
posters and banners in the streets of this capital city.
	   Interior Minister Mohammed Haraba said 7,364 candidates were
running for the 250-seat parliament. By the socialist-oriented
constitution, 127 seats must go to persons from the working class.
	   Businessmen and industrialists are expected to have more say in
the parliament to be elected on Nov. 30. The influence of these
groups has increased with the government's efforts to encourage
investment.
	   The polls are expected to be won by the National Progressive
Front, a coalition of seven parties led by the Baath Party which
has ruled Syria since 1963.
	   Parliamentary elections are held every four years.
	   The assembly has some legislative power, but effective control
is held by President Hafez Assad, who came to power in a bloodless
coup in 1970.

GAZA CITY: the militants.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Nearly a dozen Palestinian policemen sealed off the area outside
Yassin's Gaza City home and searched and questioned passers-by.
Journalists were barred from the area.
	   The Palestinian security services said in a statement: ``Sheik
Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security reasons.''
	   This marked the first time that Arafat is openly confronting the
quadriplegic Hamas leader, his strongest political rival.
	   In the past, the Palestinian leader would detain lower-level
Hamas officials from time to time. However, he never touched
Yassin, apparently because he wanted to avoid an open and possibly
blood showdown with the militants.
	   A relative of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that
the Hamas leader had not been notified that he was barred from
leaving his home. The man said Yassin's first appointment outside
his home was Friday morning and that he had not plans to leave his
home in the meantime.
	   As part of the crackdown on Hamas, Arafat also ordered the
arrests of dozens of Hamas activists. Two senior members, Mahmoud
Zahar, and Ibrahim Hanieh, were among those detained.

Hamas leader placed under house arrest

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, the
Palestinian Authority on Thursday placed the leader of the Islamic
militant group Hamas under house arrest.
	   The decision came several hours after Hamas claimed
responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed an Israeli soldier
and threatened to undermine the new Mideast peace agreement.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised Israeli Prime Minster
Benjamin Netanyahu in response to the attack that he would crack
down on the militants.
	   Nearly a dozen Palestinian policemen sealed off the area outside
Yassin's Gaza City home and searched and questioned passers-by.
Journalists were barred from the area.
	   The Palestinian security services said in a statement: ``Sheik
Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security reasons.''
	   This marked the first time that Arafat is openly confronting the
quadriplegic Hamas leader, his strongest political rival.
	   In the past, the Palestinian leader would detain lower-level
Hamas officials from time to time. However, he never touched
Yassin, apparently because he wanted to avoid an open and possibly
blood showdown with the militants.
	   A relative of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that
the Hamas leader had not been notified that he was barred from
leaving his home. The man said Yassin's first appointment outside
his home was Friday morning and that he had not plans to leave his
home in the meantime.
	   As part of the crackdown on Hamas, Arafat also ordered the
arrests of dozens of Hamas activists. Two senior members, Mahmoud
Zahar, and Ibrahim Hanieh, were among those detained.

Britain's poet laureate Ted Hughes dies after battle with cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to UPDATE with publishing house now saying he
died in London hospital, not his home in Devon; SUBS 19th graf to
CORRECT that Frieda Hughes interview was before publication of
``Birthday Letters'' &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British poet laureate Ted Hughes, whose stormy
marriage to the anguished American poet Sylvia Plath dogged his
reputation after her suicide, has died, his publisher said
Thursday. He was 68.
	   Hughes died Wednesday in a London hospital after a 18-month
battle with cancer, which he had kept secret, said Matthew Evans,
chairman of the publisher Faber and Faber.
	   ``Not only was he one of the greatest poets of the 20th century,
but he was the most extraordinary man,'' Evans said. ``The loss to
his family is inestimable.''
	   A collection of searingly intense poems published by Hughes this
year called ``Birthday Letters'' shed new light on his difficult
six-year marriage to the tortured Plath, brought him sympathy and
won him rave reviews.
	   Some Plath fans called Hughes a murderer and his name has been
repeatedly hacked off of her gravestone in Yorkshire, northern
England.
	   But the reclusive Hughes chose not to defend himself after
Plath's suicide on Feb. 11, 1963, months after he had left her for
another woman. She gassed herself in the kitchen, leaving milk and
cookies for the couple's two children in the next room.
	   Evans noted that there was ``a great deal of understanding''
after Hughes put forth his story for the first time _ and revealed
the obvious depth of his love for Plath _ in the 88 poems that make
up ``Birthday Letters,'' chronicling the couple's meeting, marriage
and separation.
	   ``He wanted `Birthday Letters' to be published because he knew
he was seriously ill. He wanted to publish the work before he
died,'' the publisher said. ``He regarded it as being of personal
importance. It was the nearest thing to an autobiography.''
	   The poems surprised many with their startling intimacy. Of the
first time the couple made love, Hughes wrote: ``You were slim and
lithe and smooth as a fish./ You were a new world. My new world./So
this is America, I marveled./ Beautiful, beautiful America.''
	   Hughes, who has been poet laureate since 1984, refused to be
interviewed about the poems, which span 25 years from the late
1960s.
	   But in a letter read by his editor, Christopher Reid, who
accepted the Forward Poetry prize for ``Birthday Letters'' on
Hughes' behalf this year, he called the book ``a gathering of the
occasions _ written with no plan over about 25 years _ in which I
tried to open a direct, private, inner contact with my first wife,
not thinking to make a poem, thinking mainly to evoke her presence
to myself and to feel her there listening.
	   ``Except for a handful, I never thought of publishing these
pieces until last year, when quite suddenly I realized I had to
publish them, no matter what the consequences.''
	   Hughes and Plath married in 1956 after meeting at Cambridge,
where she was studying on a Fulbright Scholarship. They went to the
United States in 1957, where she taught at Smith College and he
taught at the University of Massachusetts. They returned to England
in 1959, continued to write and publish poetry.
	   Plath had a history of mental problems and had first attempted
suicide three years before meeting Hughes.
	   Poet Andrew Motion, writing in The Times of London, said reading
``Birthday Letters'' was ``like being hit by a thunderbolt.''
	   ``Anyone who thought Hughes's reticence was proof of his hard
heart will immediately see how stony they have been themselves,''
Motion wrote.
	   ``Hughes is one of the most important poets of the century, and
this is his greatest book. It closes in a heart of darkness, a
black hole of grief and regret. We stare into it feeling changed
and enriched.''
	   The book was dedicated to the couple's children, Nicholas and
Frieda.
	   Before its publication, Frieda, a 34-year-old artist, said in a
newspaper interview that she had lived under the burden of her
mother's suicide.

Heavy rains swell rivers, cause floods in western Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, UPDATES with more details &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BADEN-BADEN, Germany (AP) _ Heavy rains flooded low-lying areas
Thursday across western Europe, including this historic spa town
where elegant tree-lined boulevards once strolled by kings and
queens were under water.
	   Flood alarms sounded in Baden-Baden just after midnight. By
Thursday morning, German soldiers were sandbagging the swollen Oos
River that runs through the center of the luxurious resort, located
in the Black Forest near the southwest border with France. The
train station also was flooded.
	   ARD television reported that 20 Roman Catholic nuns from a
convent near Baden-Baden also joined in to help sandbag.
	   Harsh storms that started late Tuesday killed at least three
people _ one in Germany, one in the Czech Republic, and one in
Switzerland. All were involved in vehicle accidents with trees
uprooted by wind.
	   Power cuts, traffic snarls, and highway closings were reported
Thursday in Austria and the Netherlands as well as in Germany.
	   A train derailed on the Memmingen-Munich route in Bavaria after
hitting a herd of cows that had wandered onto the tracks. Eight
cows were killed and the train engineer and a passenger were
injured.
	   The cows made their way onto the tracks after storms apparently
knocked down an electric fence, a railway spokesman said.
	   About 500 soldiers and engineers were deployed to the Dutch
province of Groningnen and Drenthe to shore up dikes sodden by
rain-swollen canals and rivers, Dutch army spokesman Hans Hardenbol
said Thursday.
	   The Linz area of upper Austria and some Vienna suburbs were
flooded, and some Austrian towns were without electricity after
gusts blew down power lines.
	   In Switzerland, a 28-year-old man was killed in the northern
Thurgau region when the car he was driving hit a tree that had
fallen across the road. Boats on Lake Biel in the northwest were
ripped from their moorings, and police were called out to recover
them.
	   In northern Germany, residents in the flooded town center of Bad
Gandersheim fled their homes in rubber dinghies. About 1,000 police
and firefighters from the nearby city of Braunschweig arrived
during the night to pump out basements after the Leine River
swiftly rose about a meter (three feet). Fifteen people were
treated for hypothermia or shock.
	   The Mosel River, which meets the Rhine in southwest Germany, was
also rising, and smaller rivers _ the Glan, the Nahe and the Sieg _
had flooded into several small towns. Barge traffic on some
stretches of the Mosel was shut down.
	   Police also closed a section of the autobahn outside the town of
Pforzheim, south of Baden-Baden. Mudslides in the town of Rastatt,
in the same area, destroyed three houses, according to the interior
ministry in nearby Stuttgart.

Agriculture minister: Russia consults with U.S. on food aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES thruout with agriculture minister saying
Russia should accept humanitarian aid, other details, quotes.
Trims. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While insisting that Russia is under no threat of
food shortages, the agriculture minister conceded Thursday that the
country is holding ``consultations'' with the United States about
humanitarian aid.
	   Since the economic crisis hit in mid-August, a fall in food
imports that came on top of an unusually low harvest has led to
serious concerns that Russia may not have enough food for the
winter.
	   Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor Semyonov said the problem
was not in any actual lack of food, but in getting it to all the
regions and selling it at prices that poor people can afford.
	   He refused to confirm reports that Russia has asked for
humanitarian aid from the West, but said the possibility has been
considered, and donated food would be helpful.
	   ``There is no reason to refuse humanitarian aid in food,''
Semyonov told a news conference, adding that it would only be
needed ``in individual regions, for individual strata of the
population.''
	   Russian agricultural officials were meeting Wednesday with a
U.S. government delegation, led by the general sales manager for
the USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service, Christopher Goldphwait.
	   Semyonov indicated that the talks might deal with the
possibility of humanitarian aid, but few details have been
released.
	   At the same time, Semyonov insisted that the government sees
``no threat of food shortages, no grounds for the threat of food
shortages today.''
	   ``Russia is stocked up rather fully on basic foods such as
potatoes, sugar, oil, vegetables and other foods,'' he told a news
conference.
	   The Agriculture and Food Ministry wants to support domestic
producers and is unwilling to emphasize any food problems in Russia
for fear of inviting food imports and aid _ thus increasing the
competition to Russian farmers.
	   Even so, Semyonov conceded that 22 of Russia's 89 regions suffer
``acute shortages of grain,'' and the banking crisis and the poor
organization of trade hinder deliveries from Russia's
grain-producing areas.
	   Russia's grain harvest this year is estimated at 47.3 metric
tons _ or only about half of last year's yield of 88.5 metric tons,
he said.
	   Semyonov called for greater state control over the agricultural
market, saying only that would ensure deliveries of inexpensive
food to troubled regions.
	   ``Unfortunately, since entering the market (economy), we have
lost many of the levers we had before for regulating crisis
situations,'' he said.
	   Russia's new Cabinet generally appears to favor a shift toward
greater state interference in the economy to pull it out of its
worst crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Thursday that the
government has ``resolutely opted'' to take more control.
	   Primakov was commenting on the government's long-awaited plan
for coping with the crisis, which was presented to the
International Monetary Fund on Wednesday.
	   The government hoped the plan would persuade the IMF to release
another installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan frozen after the
Russian economy fell apart in mid-August.
	   Meanwhile, the World Bank is also considering a dlrs 500 million
loan to Russia for structural reform of the agricultural sector,
said bank official Vera Matusevich, according to the Interfax news
agency. The loan would depend on the government's economic program,
she said.
	   The plan presented to the IMF calls for tighter currency
controls, price controls on medicines and some basic foods, a food
reserve to help the country through the winter and indexing wages
and pensions to compensate Russians for rising inflation.
	   It tackles the tax system, lowering some income, property and
profit tax rates but tightening the rules in hopes of making more
people pay. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has
left it consistently short on cash and helped contribute to the
current crisis.

	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant
rammed an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep that was
escorting a bus full of elementary school students Thursday. The
powerful blast killed the attacker and a soldier.
	   An Israeli commander said the jeep had swerved to keep the car
away from the children.
	   The anti-Israeli group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
suicide attack that also injured three Israelis and four
Palestinians.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and told him he must wage all-out war on
terrorism if he wants Israel to go pull back troops in the West
Bank over the next 12 weeks, as promised.
	   Arafat vowed to track down the masterminds of the bombing, and
in an unprecedented move placed Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin under
house arrest and had dozens of the group's activists detained.
	   Netanyahu is under intense pressure from Israeli hard-liners to
call off the deal and the terror attack, the second this week,
makes it increasingly difficult for him to defend sell the
land-for-security agreement at home.
	   The blast went off at about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) at the Gush
Katif Junction in the southern Gaza Strip. At the time, the Israeli
school bus convoy guarded by two jeeps was passing by.
	   Nine-year-old Eran Ayoube, who was on the bus, said he had just
finished his daily traveler's prayer and said ``amen'' when he
heard a loud boom and the windows around him were shattered.
	   His 10-year-old sister Adar said children began to cry and were
ordered by the driver to drop to the floor of the bus for cover.
	   ``There was terrible smoke everywhere. I thought I was going to
be burned,'' Adar said, sitting on her bicycle parked on a sidewalk
outside her home in the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom.
	   The Israeli army commander in the Gaza Strip, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov
Samia, said the officers in the lead jeep had noticed the
Palestinian car trying to get close to the bus and blocked the
vehicle, thus taking the brunt of the blast themselves.
	   The bomb was so powerful that the jeep flipped over on its side.
The jeep and the bomber's car, registered to a Palestinian in the
nearby town of Khan Yunis, were scorched and mangled.
	   Yigal Kirshenzach, a Gaza settler, said the jeep was still
burning an hour after the blast. ``Parts (of bodies) are scattered
all over. There is oil, gas, blood,'' Kirshenzach told Israel
radio.
	   Pieces of black debris were scattered over a 50-yard (50-meter)
radius. A black, scorched shoe lay in the middle of the road.
	   The Israeli army said that immediately after the blast, Israeli
soldiers chased what they thought were suspects fleeing the scene.
Troops opened fire, wounding one Palestinian man. Palestinian
police, in turn, fired on Israeli troops, but no one was injured in
the exchange that lasted several minutes, the army said.
	   The roof of a nearby farm shack collapsed from the force of the
explosion and three Palestinian girls were injured, their relatives
said. Two girls were hospitalized and a third remained at home with
cuts to the back and hand.
	   After the attack, the Israeli children were taken to their
school in Gush Katif settlement bloc before returning home to Kfar
Darom. In school, the children talked about their experience. The
children spoke of the big boom and flames and many asked about
their friends on a second bus, said Principal Yitzhak Amitai.
	   In a call to Israel radio, a man who said he spoke for Hamas
read a claim of responsibility. ``It's a revolution until
victory,'' the caller said, suggesting the attacks would continue.
	   A Hamas official in the West Bank said the group felt it was
being targeted by the new peace agreement and that it had nothing
to lose by launching attacks in hopes of derailing the accord.
	   Several hours after the attack, Palestinian police placed Yassin
under house arrest. Officers sealed off the area around his Gaza
City home and questioned passers-by. Earlier in the day, Yassin has
said that despite an expected crackdown, Hamas did not want to
engage in a bloody confrontation with the Palestinian Authority.
	   Netanyahu said he expected an all-out crackdown on the militants
as a condition for implementation of the peace agreement. ``I told
him (Arafat) that the test will be ... the absolute enlistment of
the Palestinian Authority against terrorists,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``He told me he had just emerged from a meeting a meeting with
his security chiefs and had given them instructions in that
spirit,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Arafat condemned the bombing. He said he would arrest the
masterminds and ``try them for deliberately harming the
Palestinians' national interests.''

Agassi stopped by Krajicek

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Becker losing, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Richard Krajicek stopped Andre
Agassi's astonishing comeback when he upset the American 6-3, 6-4
in the third round of the dlrs 2.45 Eurocard Open on Thursday.
	   In a showdown between two former Wimbledon champions, Krajicek
used his serve-and-volley game to overpower Agassi and reach the
quarterfinals.
	   Tenth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov also advanced by beating Todd
Martin 6-4, 7-5, and Jan-Michael Gambill upset ninth-seeded Tim
Henman 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Goran Ivanisevic, seeded 14th, ended the run of Boris Becker,
the crowd's sentimental favorite, with a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5)
victory. Becker is in semi-retirement and this could have been his
last tournament at home.
	   Ivanisevic fired 17 aces, Becker 16. ``I was a bit unlucky
today,'' Becker said.
	   Krajicek, who is ranked No. 11 in the world, is trying to clinch
one of the last two places available for the eight-man World
Championship next month in Hanover, Germany.
	   Agassi already has qualified for Hanover and surged to No. 1 in
the world after winning last week's tournament in Ostrava, Czech
Republic. A former No. 1, Agassi was ranked No. 141 at this time
last year and playing challenger events. Now, he is in the Top 5
for the first time since July 15, 1996.
	   Winner of five titles this year, Agassi could not tame
Krajicek's monster serve. Agassi won only nine points on Krajicek's
serve.
	   ``When he serves that well, it's very difficult,'' Agassi said.
``He is a tough guy to develop any rhythm against. He likes the
court here. All he had to do was break my serve twice.''
	   Krajicek won the title here in 1995 and reached the final last
year.
	   ``I am very satisfied with the way I played today,'' he said.
	   ``I served very well from the start and I put a lot of pressure
on him. Eventually, he was going to miss a few passing shots,''
said Krajicek, who will have surgery on his left knee after the
indoor season.
	   ``It's a long road to Hanover, it doesn't seem that far away in
time but an eternity in points,'' said Krajicek, who hit nine aces.
	   The Dutchman trails three players _ Karol Kucera, Petr Korda and
Henman in points for Hanover. All three have lost here and Krajicek
could gain some ground if he does well in this tournament.
	   Gambill, a 21-year-old American, survived 25 aces by Henman to
beat the Briton for the second time this year. As No. 9 in the
world, Henman is the highest-ranked player Gambill has ever beaten
and his first Top 10 victim.
	   ``Nobody has aced me that much,'' Gambill said. ``He actually
played a better match. He served a lot better than I did. I just
scraped and did my best from the baseline.''
	   At the time of the Australian Open, Gambill was No. 227 in the
world. Now, he is No. 50. ``My goal for the year was to get into
the Top 100,'' he said.

Report: U.S. Major League Baseball to ban androstenedione
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ American Major League Baseball plans to ban the
use of androstenedione, the muscle-building dietary supplement used
by home run champion Mark McGwire, the Toronto Globe and Mail
reported Thursday.
	   The newspaper cited unidentified sources, who said they expect
commissioner Bud Selig to formally announce a ban before spring
training next season.
	   ``I would hate to be in McGwire's shoes right now,'' said Dr.
William Bryan, team physician for the Houston Astros and the past
president of the American Association of Professional Team
Physicians. ``We have just been shaking our heads all this time
that androstenedione was on the shelves.''
	   McGwire, who could not be reached for comment, hit 70 homers
this year, breaking the record of 61 set by Roger Maris in 1961.
	   ``All the players will know where we stand on andro once a
decision is made,'' said MLB players' union chief Donald Fehr, who
along with Selig agreed last summer to appoint a committee of
doctors to study the danger of andro. ``Right now, the doctors are
simply investigating.''
	   Androstenedione is illegal in Canada but legal in the United
States. It is banned by the International Olympic Committee, U.S.
pro gridiron National Football League and America's main governing
body for college sports (the NCAA), but allowed by MLB.
	   Selig could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   In Johnson City, Tennessee, researchers at East Tennessee State
University are studying the supplement. Dr. Craig Broeder, exercise
physiologist at the school's Human Performance Lab, said they will
study androstenedione's physical and psychological effect on men
between the ages of 35 and 65.
	   ``The main reason for the study is about health issues and
anti-aging,'' he said.
	   The study's 70 participants will undergo medical tests as they
engage in weight training for 12 weeks.
	   The dlrs 28,000 study is being funded by ChemSource, a company
that researches supplements and other products, and Metabolic
Response Modifiers, which produces supplements.
	   Broeder said he hopes to find that andro can boost men's
testosterone at an age when it begins to drop. Such a drop creates
a greater risk of heart and circulatory problems.

	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ An overcrowded river boat tipped over
Thursday in eastern India, spilling its 70 passengers into
rain-swollen waters. Officials said that two passengers were
missing.
	   The accident occured at dusk in Assam state, where heavy rains
over the last months have swelled the Puthimari river.
	   Earlier, officials said at least 35 people were feared drowned
after panicked passengers jumped into the water.
	   But D.N. Saikia, the district administrator of Kamrup, where the
accident took place, said all but two passenger made it safely to
shore.
	   The Press Trust of India also clarified that the boat did not
capsize but merely tilted because it was overcrowded.

tons projected a month ago.
	   The agency also cut its forecast for coarse grains _ principally
maize (corn) _ to 897 million tons from 903 million tons.
	   In 1997-98, production of wheat hit a record high of 610 million

In unusual move, Arab minister visits Holocaust memorial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Arab foreign minister paid a rare visit
Thursday to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial, and expressed
hopes that ``humanity can learn a lesson'' from its horrors.
	   Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammad Khouna of the African Arab country
of Mauritania was in Israel to discuss upgrading relations and to
express support for the peace process.
	   Khouna nodded attentively and asked frequent questions as he and
his entourage were led past the museum's displays. He examined
pictures of mass graves, walked on bricks from the Warsaw ghetto
and read grisly testimonies of German officers.
	   His head covered by a skullcap to show respect, Khouna later
laid a large wreath of red and white roses in the Hall of
Remembrance, a large dark chamber with an eternal flame in its
center.
	   With Arab-Jewish relations dominated by conflict, neither group
has traditionally had much interest the other side's past
sufferings.
	   Some in the Arab world simply don't acknowledge that the
Holocaust occurred. Others recognize it, but claim it is exploited
by Jews to justify Israel's existence.
	   ``It's always positive when an Arab leader is willing to learn,
understand, acknowledge and I think empathize with Jewish history
regarding the Holocaust,'' said John Lemberger, director of the
group AMCHA, which assists Holocaust survivors.
	   Khouna did not comment to reporters on his visit, but wrote in
the guestbook: ``We have made a visit today that reminded us of a
black page in history.
	   ``How odd is the ideology which led to this human catastrophe.
We hope humanity can learn a lesson from this shameful past so it
can live in brotherhood, cooperation and justice.''
	   Mordechai Paldiel, director of the memorial's Righteous Among
the Nations division, which honors non-Jews who risked their lives
to save Jews, led Khouna's tour.
	   ``I think it was an eye-opener for him,'' Paldiel said. ``He
expressed his shock and amazement at the scope and intensity of the
Holocaust.''
	   Speaking in French, Paldiel pointed out that rescuers of Jews
who were honored by Yad Vashem included Muslim Albanians and
Bosnians. He said Khouna was pleased that Muslim rescuers were
recognized.
	   Mauritania established low-level interest offices with Israel in
November 1995, angering other Arab League nations.

Hamas leader placed under house arrest

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, the
Palestinian Authority on Thursday placed the leader of the Islamic
militant group Hamas under house arrest.
	   The decision came several hours after Hamas claimed
responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed an Israeli soldier
and threatened to undermine the new Mideast peace agreement.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised Israeli Prime Minster
Benjamin Netanyahu in response to the attack that he would crack
down on the militants.
	   Palestinian policemen set up roadblocks around Yassin's home.
Motorists were stopped and questioned. Policemen opened trunks and
aimed flashlights at passengers.
	   Journalists were told they could stick around for a few minutes
to take in the scene, but would then have to leave.
	   The Palestinian security services said in a statement: ``Sheik
Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security reasons.''
	   This marked the first time that Arafat is openly confronting the
quadriplegic Hamas leader, his strongest political rival.
	   In the past, the Palestinian leader would detain lower-level
Hamas officials from time to time. However, he never touched
Yassin, apparently because he wanted to avoid an open and possibly
blood showdown with the militants.
	   A relative of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that
the Hamas leader had not been notified that he was barred from
leaving his home. The man said Yassin's first appointment outside
his home was Friday morning and that he had not plans to leave his
home in the meantime.
	   As part of the crackdown on Hamas, Arafat also ordered the
arrests of dozens of Hamas activists. Two senior members, Mahmoud
Zahar, and Ibrahim Hanieh, were among those detained.

Murdoch's bid to be referred to Monopolies Commission

	   LONDON (AP) _ BSkyB's 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid to
buy Manchester United received a setback Thursday when the
government referred the proposed deal for a full investigation by
its Monpolies and Mergers Commission.
	   Trade and Industry Secretary Peter Mandelson issued a statement
saying the MMC would decide whether the deal would break the rules
of fair trading.
	   ``The decision to a make a reference does not in any way
prejudge the question of whether or not the merger would be against
the public interest,'' the statement said. ``It is for the MMC to
report on this after its investigation.''
	   The MMC is due to issue its findings by March 12.
	   BSkyB, owned by Australian-born media magnate Rupert Murdoch,
had hoped that Mandelson would not hold up the deal by sending it
to the MMC.
	   Many Manchester United fans and lawmakers argue that BSkyB's
takeover of Europe's richest club would increase Rupert Murdoch's
already huge stake in TV coverage of soccer in Britain and create a
monopoly.
	   One of the leading campaigners against the bid, Manchester
United Independent Supporters' Association spokesman Andy Walsh,
said the referral gave opponents time to gather more opposition.
	   ``I am absolutely delighted,'' he said. ``This is what we've
been working for over the last two months and it's exactly what we
wanted.
	   ``The referral to the MMC will give football fans from
Manchester United and other clubs the opportunity to discuss for
the first time how football should be structured in this country.
	   ``We expect the MMC to look at all aspects of the game, not just
the BSkyB-Man United takeover,'' Walsh said. ``Hopefully they will
ensure the situation caused by the Sky attempt to take over our
club is a thing of the past.''
	   Mark Booth, the American chief executive of BSkyB, and Martin
Edwards, chief executive of Manchester United, issued a joint
statement on the MMC referral.
	   ``We will put our case strongly to the MMC that the proposed
transaction will not operate against the public interest and should
be allowed to proceed,'' the statement said.
	   ``The boards of both companies firmly believe that the
acquisition of Manchester United by BSkyB would be good for the
club, the players and the fans and will bring together two
companies whose skills complement each other and have demonstrated
their commitment to football.''
	   Graham Kelly, chief executive of the English Football
Association, said the FA opposed the deal on the basis that it
would make one club far too powerful compared with the others.
	   ``The FA welcomes Peter Mandelson's decision. Our concerns are
widely known,'' Kelly said.
	   ``There are clearly issues of fairness and, in the public
interest, it is to be debated. The referral to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission is the best way for that to happen.''
	   Thursday's announcement comes two days after BSkyB, which
exclusively shows live Premier League games in England, said it had
not yet won control of the majority of shares.
	   The satellite broadcasting company said it had received valid
acceptances from shareholders representing 33.5 percent of the
club's shares.
	   Combined with shares that BSkyB has been buying directly, the
broadcaster has a total ownership just under 45 percent and needs
to have more than 50 percent to gain a controlling stake in the
club.

Hamas leader placed under house arrest

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, the
Palestinian Authority on Thursday placed the leader of the Islamic
militant group Hamas under house arrest.
	   The decision to put Sheik Ahmed Yassin under house arrest came
several hours after Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide
bombing that killed an Israeli soldier and threatened to undermine
the new Mideast peace agreement.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised Israeli Prime Minster
Benjamin Netanyahu in response to the attack that he would crack
down on the militants.
	   Nearly a dozen Palestinian policemen sealed off the area outside
Yassin's Gaza City home and searched and questioned passers-by.
Journalists were barred from the area.
	   ``Sheik Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security
reasons,'' the Palestinian security services announced.
	   It marked Arafat's first open confrontation with the
quadriplegic Hamas leader, his strongest political rival.
	   In the past, the Palestinian leader has detained lower-level
Hamas officials from time to time. However, he never touched
Yassin, apparently because he wanted to avoid an open and possibly
bloody showdown with the militants.
	   A relative of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that
the Hamas leader had not been notified that he was barred from
leaving his home. The man said Yassin's first appointment outside
his home was Friday morning and that he had not planned to go out
before then.
	   Arafat also ordered the arrests Thursday of dozens of Hamas
activists. Two senior members, Mahmoud Zahar, and Ibrahim Hanieh,
were among those detained.

Latvia to make Latvian mandatory language at schools
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ The Parliament on Thursday passed a law
calling for Latvian to become the sole language of instruction in
public schools, despite criticism from the country's large ethnic
Russian population.
	   The law, passed by a 64-4 vote in the 100-seat Saeima, calls for
the measures to be phased in over the next decade, with some class
levels to be switched to Latvian-only instruction as early as 2004,
the Baltic News Service reported.
	   Russian will be allowed as a language of instruction in private
schools and some special-education institutions, BNS said.
	   After Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, hundreds
of thousands of Russians moved in. Many lived in communities where
Russian was the only language used in schools and workplaces, and
they did not learn to speak Latvian.
	   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia has
frequently denounced its diminutive neighbor for its treatment of
ethnic Russians, who make up some 40 percent of the Latvian
population.
	   The major point of contention were regulations that placed high
obstacles to many ethnic Russians seeking Latvian citizenship.
Voters this month approved amendments liberalizing the
naturalization law, but Latvian-Russian tensions run deep and could
be aggravated by the school-language law.
	   Earlier this month, the parliament amended the constitution to
declare Latvian the country's only state language.
	   A bill is also pending that would require the use of Latvian in
public and even many private activities. Under the proposal, even
companies staffed entirely by ethnic Russians would have to hold
certain meetings in Latvian.

Regional states, U.S., send out message to Caspian oil companies

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Sending out a strong statement to oil
companies on which route to choose for the transfer of oil from the
Caspian's rich fields to Europe, five regional countries signed a
declaration in favor of the U.S.-backed Turkish route.
	   The as-yet-unbuilt pipeline linking the Azeri capital of Baku to
the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan is a costly option for the oil
companies working in the Caspian, which are said to prefer a
cheaper and shorter route. Estimates how much the Baku-Ceyhan
pipeline would cost range from dlrs 2.5 billion to dlrs 4 billion.
	   But the presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan
and Georgia nonetheless pointed at the Baku-Ceyhan route as their
preference and pledged to ``take all the necessary measures to
create favorable conditions for the investors.''
	   ``Now the issue is not whether Baku-Ceyhan is going to happen,
because it is going to happen. The issue is how,'' said U.S. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, who witnessed the signing ceremony in a
show of Washington's commitment to the project.
	   Turkey, supported by the United States, has said that if oil
companies were to choose another line, other ways would be sought
to build the pipeline which could eventually be used to transport
Kazak and Russian oil to Europe.
	   But Russians are proposing another route, through their
territory, and Thursday's high-level gathering seemed unable to
overcome regional disputes.
	   Turkmenistan, expected to sign the agreement, refused to join
the Ankara declaration.
	   Analysts believe that its territorial dispute with Azerbaijan
over an oil-rich field in the Caspian seabed is at the origin of
this refusal.
	   Turkey has offered to build its own part of the pipeline and
Richardson said the five countries had agreed to propose serious
tax and tariff reductions to the investors.
	   But some remained skeptical the declaration would be enough to
convince companies.
	   ``It's a framework, now it's up to the Turks to really start
negotiating with the companies,'' said Zeyno Baran, an energy
analyst.
	   Turkey also signed an agreement with Turkmenistan to build a
pipeline for the export of Turkmen natural gas across the Caspian
sea to Turkey.
	   Under the agreement Turkey will buy and transport some 16
billion cubic meters (560 billion cubic feet) of Turkmen gas each
year.
	   The United States has repeatedly pledged its backing for the
proposed 1,730-kilometer (1,075-mile) Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.
Washington has announced a package of financial support, including
a dlrs 823,000 grant for the pipeline, and political risk insurance
for companies investing in the project.
	   Washington prefers to see the oil from the world's second
richest oil reserves after the Middle East passing through an
allied country like Turkey, rather than hostile Iran, which has
also proposed a route.
	   The companies are expected to announce their decision Nov. 12.
	   The main alternative to Baku-Ceyhan is an existing pipeline from
Baku to the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa, from where the oil
would be transferred in tankers through the Bosporus.
	   The Baku-Supsa line, currently being renovated, is scheduled to
carry early oil from the Caspian in April.
	   The five countries and the United States are opposed to this
route as the already heavy oil tanker traffic through the narrow
Bosporus strait has led to hundreds of accidents.

Sharon plans Washington trip to discuss U.S. aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon will fly
to Washington soon to seek U.S. aid for redeploying Israeli troops
in the West Bank, officials said Thursday.
	   Israel is reportedly seeking between dlrs 500 million and dlrs
one billion in financial help to build new army bases and construct
roads to replace those being vacated as a result of the Wye summit
accord.
	   Sharon was invited by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and is expected to travel after he recovers for a bout of flu,
either early next week or the week after at the latest, Israeli
officials said.
	   An Israeli official said on condition of anonymity that in
addition to U.S. aid, various other issues related to the Wye River
accord were expected to be discussed. These include a further
Israeli withdrawal after the planned 13 percent pullback and the
final status talks that are scheduled to begin next week.
	   U.S. officials are discussing a formula for giving some aid to
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority in order to facilitate the
implementation of the Wye accord. No figures were given.

Parliament convenes for first time, Meciar steps down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Newly elected lawmakers convened for
the first time Thursday, opening an era of change in this former
communist country, with promises to put Slovaks back on track
toward NATO and European Union membership.
	   In a move underscoring the change, outgoing Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar announced he was relinquishing his parliamentary
seat.
	   Meciar, who had ruled the country with authoritarian power since
1993, earlier promised Slovaks he would not stay in parliament
``with the limited power of a deputy.''
	   Slovaks voted Meciar and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
out of power on Sept. 25-26, electing a broad-based, four-party
coalition bent on setting the country back on the road to
integration with Western Europe.
	   Under Meciar's rule, Slovakia was criticized by its neighbors
and the West for shunning free-market and democratic reforms. While
the Czech Republic and Hungary, moved toward NATO and EU ascension,
Meciar concentrated on consolidating his party's power.
	   Already Thursday, the party leaders in the new governing
coalition demonstrated their eagerness to return to the Western
fold.
	   In an open letter sent to NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
and President of the European Commission Jacques Santer, they
promised to ``introduce significant political and economic changes
in Slovakia.''
	   ``We are committed to forming a strong, stable and effective
government for the next four years, firmly devoted to the
democratic principles with full respect for the rule of law,'' they
said.
	   Mikulas Dzurinda, who will be officially appointed prime
minister on Friday, is expected to pay his first foreign visit to
Brussels already next week.
	   Although the new governing coalition covers nearly every aspect
of the political spectrum _ including reformed Communists,
Christian Democrats, Liberals, Greens _ they found a common ground
in the fight against Meciar.
	   ``We want to be included in the first wave of countries for the
EU membership. It is our highest goal,'' said Jan Sigel, a
representative of the Slovak Democratic Coalition.
	   The Slovak parliament elected Jozef Migas, 44, its new chairman.
He is also chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left, the
second-largest party in the coalition. Migas' deputies were to be
elected later. The coalition holds 93 of the 150 seats in
parliament. Meciar's party hold 43 seats.
	   After being appointed prime minister, Dzurinda will present his
government in parliament on Friday, officials in Bratislava said.
	   Ludovit Cernak, who is most likely to be the economics minister,
said the government has to bring ``social peace.''
	   ``We have to get the economy started and become one of the
countries running for EU membership (once) again,'' he said.
	   ``Among the first things that have to be done is ... to become a
law-based state and that has to apply to everyone without
exception,'' said Sigel of the Slovak Democratic Coalition.
	   Under Meciar, certain members of the government and members of
his party seemed to be immune from several laws. This intention was
reflected in the party's decision to give Meciar's vacated seat to
Ivan Lexa, former director of Slovakia's secret service (SIS).
	   Lexa was dismissed from his position on Tuesday. He is suspected
to have been involved in the kidnapping of Michal Kovac Jr., son of
Slovakia's former President. But under existing law parliamentary
deputies cannot be tried in a court of law.

Three-time winner Becker gets wildcard for Paris Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Boris Becker will be able to seek his fourth Paris
Open title, after receiving a wildcard on Thursday.
	   Becker, 30, won the Paris Open in 1986, 1989 and 1992 but is now

Golmard, Arnaud di Pasquale and Sebastien Grosjean.
	   Magnus Larsson of Sweden and Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi have
withdrawn from the event due to injury.
	   The world's top 15 players, including last year's champion Pete
Sampras, are expected to compete in the dlrs 2.5 million
tournament, which starts Nov. 2.

After League Cup triumph, Vialli's Chelsea meets Villa again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Laudrup situation &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three days after his three goals knocked Aston
Villa out of the League Cup, Chelsea player-manager Gianluca Vialli
sends his team out against the same opponent in the Premier League
Saturday, with Villa top of the standings and four points clear.
	   With Chelsea also the defending Cup Winners Cup titlist and well
placed in the league, Vialli should be a happy man.
	   But the smiles turned to frowns even at the end of Wednesday's
4-1 crushing of Villa. The Chelsea manager saw his team captain,
Dennis Wise, sent off for a needless, two-footed tackle on Villa's
Darren Byfield and then received a yellow card himself for arguing
with the referee.
	   On top of that, Vialli has to deal with reports that Danish
striker Brian Laudrup could be leaving the club after only three
months. Though denying that he is unhappy with the manager's
rotation system of leaving players out even if they're playing
well, Laudrup says he wants to return to play in Denmark at some
stage.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, the
Palestinian Authority on Thursday placed the leader of the Islamic
militant group Hamas under house arrest.
	   The decision came several hours after Hamas claimed
responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed an Israeli soldier
and threatened to undermine the new Mideast peace agreement.
	   In response to the attack, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
promised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would
crack down on the militants.
	   Palestinian policemen set up roadblocks around Sheik Ahmed
Yassin's home. Motorists were stopped and questioned. Policemen
opened trunks and aimed flashlights at passengers.
	   Journalists were told they could stick around for a few minutes
to take in the scene, but would then have to leave.
	   ``Sheik Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security
reasons,'' the Palestinian security services announced.

Socialist premier reshuffles Cabinet for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Premier Costas Simitis, whose Socialist
government was wounded in recent local elections, announced
Thursday he was reshuffling his Cabinet.
	   ``The premier will make changes in the composition of the
government,'' said a one-line announcement issued by government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas.
	   A statement was expected later Thursday with the changes Simitis
was make among the 19 ministers and 23 undersecretaries. It was
Simitis' first government shakeup since he came to power in Oct.
1996.
	   Simitis' government emerged weakened from local elections two
weeks ago, losing ground to the conservative opposition in a vote
that was widely interpreted as a referendum on government policies.
	   The results were seen as reflecting disenchantment with the
government's economic austerity measures, designed to earn the
European Union's poorest country a spot in the bloc's single
currency group.
	   Many ranking Cabinet members, including Industry, Commerce and
Development Minister Vasso Papandreou, have in recent days been
calling on Simitis to revamp his government in order to improve its
image.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU which failed to
qualify for the first round of EMU. Britain, Denmark and Sweden
opted out of joining.
	   His administration's image has also suffered from accusations
that it has lost control of efforts to fight crime and corruption,
especially in the police department.

	   JEREZ, Spain (AP) _ Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland shot a
5-under 67 Thursday to share the first-round lead in the
season-ending Volvo Masters as he tries to claim the European money
title over Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood.
	   Montgomerie and Westwood each shot 70 over the par-72
Montecastillo layout in southern Spain.
	   Tied with five others for the lead, Clarke notched his 67 with a
birdie on the 18th when he hit a 6 iron out of a fairway bunker to
6 feet (2 meters) and dropped the putt.
	   Also in at 67 were Alexander Cejka of Germany, Australians Peter
O'Malley and Greg Chalmers, Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin and England's
Gordon Brand Jr.
	   ``I hit a proper shot and picked it off the top,'' Clarke said
of his bunker shot.
	   ``A big three out of the trap certainly is a boost,'' he added.
``You can lose the tournament on the first day, but you can't win
it. Now I'm in a position, hopefully, to be in it.''
	   Montgomerie got his 70 with a 20-foot (7 meter) birdie putt on
the 18th and an eagle on the 12th.
	   ``Seventy is a fair result the way I played,'' Montgomerie said.
``I didn't putt very well and I'm still just three off the lead.''
	   I've done this before,'' he added. ``It's not as if this is
anything new. It's been going on since 1993.''
	   Westwood, who opened with birdies on four of the first five
holes but then missed an 18-inch (half meter) putt for birdie on
the 12th, took a double-bogey on the 13th and then had to hold on.
	   ``I just about managed to turn a 65 into a 70,'' Westwood said.
``But I'm delighted to have left that many shots on the course and
still be only three behind.
	   Going into the Europe's final event, Montgomerie leads the PGA
European Tour money list with winnings of 760,077 (dlrs 1,276,929).
Westwood is No. 2 at 714,812 (dlrs 1,200,884) followed by Clarke at
616,867 (dlrs 1,036,337).
	   This season-ending tournament is two events in one.
	   The winner of the tournament get 166,000 pounds (dlrs 278,880).
In addition, there is a bonus payout for the top 15 finishers on
the European money list _ beginning with 170,000 pounds (dlrs
285,600) for No. 1, 120,000 (dlrs 201,600) for No. 2 and so on.
	   If Montgomerie or Westwood win this final event, they would also
claim the overall money title. Westwood can also take the money
title by finishing second, provided Montgomerie is third or lower.
If Westwood finishes third, Montgomerie must finish 12th or lower.
	   For Clarke to top the money list, he must win the tournament and
hope that Westwood finishes no better than third and Montgomerie no
higher than ninth.
	   Montgomerie, Westwood or Clarke could all break the European
Tour season money record of 875,146 pounds (dlrs 1,470,245) set by
Montgomerie in 1996.

Striker wins initial 50,000 pounds in damages for dangerous tackle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Bradford City striker Gordon Watson was
awarded an initial 50,000 (dlrs 83,500) in damages Thursday after
successfully suing an opponent who broke his leg with a lunging
tackle.
	   Justice Anthony Hooper, who ruled in favor of Watson's
negligence suit in the Leeds High Court on Monday, ordered that the
interim payment be made within 14 days by Huddersfield Town
defender Kevin Gray and his club.
	   A settlement for full damages will be announced next year.
	   Watson was out of action for 18 months after suffering a double
fracture of his right leg when Gray lunged at him with both feet
during a division one game on Feb. 1, 1997.
	   In his ruling, the judge said Gray knew his high tackle on
Watson carried ``a significant risk of serious injury.''
	   The judge agreed with various descriptions of the challenge as
``dangerous, appalling, diabolical and quite unacceptable.''
	   He said the tackle, which resulted in Gray receiving a yellow
card, deserved a red card.
	   Watson's lawyer, Craig Moore, had sought interim damages of
100,000 pounds (dlrs 167,000).
	   Moore said the 27-year-old Watson had lost potential
goal-scoring bonuses of over 30,000 pounds (dlrs 50,000). He said
Watson was faced with renegotiating a contract with his value as a
player reduced and could be out of work by next summer.

Top U.S. official blames Angola's former rebels for ailing peace
</HEADLINE>
process &QL; 
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The U.S. State Department's top Africa
official on Thursday condemned Angola's former rebel group UNITA
for fracturing a four-year-old peace deal and returning to war.
	   ``We have no doubt that UNITA is the most responsible for the
peace process' standstill and the return to war,'' Susan Rice said,
in a reference to the collapsing 1994 peace deal that ended a
two-decade civil war between UNITA and the government.
	   The U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa also called on
the former rebels to fulfill peace demands and ``end these
inconceivable attacks on innocent civilians.''
	   The U.N.-brokered deal, signed in the Zambian capital, Lusaka,
required UNITA to demobilize its 70,000 strong army and relinquish
control of almost half the country.
	   It also committed the government to guarantee the former rebels
the right to full political participation as civilians.
	   If UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi honors his promises, ``there will
be no more trouble, and peace will be possible,'' Rice said at a
seminar, during a three-day visit to the vast, southwest African
country.
	   The former rebels and the government have clashed in recent
months, especially in diamond-rich areas in northern Angola.
	   Rice arrived Wednesday in Luanda _ accompanied by President Bill
Clinton's special assistant Gayle Smith and his special envoy to
the Great Lakes region, Howard Wolpe _ to discuss the peace process
and the country's role in neighboring Congo's war.
	   They were to meet President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Friday,
before leaving for a tour of African countries.
	   The U.S. delegation has met with Angola's Prime Minister Franca
Van Dumen and other top Angolan officials. They also talked to a
group of dissidents who split with Savimbi, but were not expected
to meet with representatives from UNITA.
	   The Angolan government in September severed all contact with
Savimbi, who lives in the country's central highlands, and has
waged an international diplomatic campaign to isolate him.
	   The United States, Portugal and Russia are monitoring the
implementation of the ailing 1994 peace deal.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ broke contact with the three
observer countries in August, accusing them of bias in the
southwest African nation's peace process.
	   The U.S. officials were also to visit the key oil town of Soyo,
in northern Angola. The country is sub-Saharan Africa's
second-biggest oil exporter after Nigeria.

Banners line streets as Syrian parliamentary campaign begins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Campaigning formally began Thursday for
Syria's Nov. 30 elections, with parliamentary candidates putting up
posters and banners on the streets of this capital city.
	   The assembly that is elected every four years has some
legislative power, but effective control is held by President Hafez
Assad, who came to power in a bloodless coup in 1970.
	   Interior Minister Mohammed Haraba said 7,364 candidates were
running for the 250-seat parliament. By the socialist-oriented
constitution, 127 seats or just over half must go to people from
the working class.
	   The polls are expected to be won by the National Progressive
Front, a coalition of seven parties led by the Baath Party that has
ruled Syria since 1963.

National Court hears arguments on legal basis for Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
extradition bid

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The National Court Thursday began hearing a
case that could end a Spanish judge's drive to extradite former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from Britain.
	   A verdict is expected Friday.
	   The court is to rule on prosecutors' arguments that Judge
Baltasar Garzon, whose warrant got Pinochet arrested in London on
Oct. 16 as he recovered from back surgery, lacks jurisdiction to
investigate human rights crimes committed in Chile and Argentina.
	   Garzon and another National Court judge have been gathering
evidence for two years to support charges of murder, torture and
the disappearance of thousands during the military juntas that
ruled Chile and Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   The order for Pinochet's arrest stemmed from these probes and
cited charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. Garzon says he
can go after perpetrators of genocide even if it is committed
outside Spain.
	   If the National Court agrees with the prosecutors that Garzon
lacked jurisdiction to investigate in the first place, Garzon
almost certainly would have no choice but to abandon his drive to
extradite Pinochet and his probes in Latin America, lawyers close
to the case have said. He can appeal to a higher Spanish court but
this is considered unlikely.
	   In opening arguments Thursday, National Court prosecutor Pedro
Rubira insisted that jurisdiction for human rights crimes committed
in Argentina and Chile lies within those countries, not Spain.
	   ``No country is above another,'' Rubira told an 11-member panel
of National Court judges. ``No country has more jurisdiction than
another.''
	   He added that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
the political opponents that died under his regime were not
persecuted because of their race or religion.
	   However Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer for families of junta victims in
Argentina, said ``the motive does not matter. Pinochet is guilty of
genocide because he tried to eliminate an entire group of people.''
	   The Spanish judges' probes of Chile and Argentina intersect
because Pinochet is accused of taking part in so-called Operation
Condor, in which several military juntas in South America teamed up
in the 1970s and 1980s to help each other crush what they perceived
as a communist threat.
	   Spanish news reports say Garzon will continue to seek Pinochet's
extradition if he gets the backing of the National Court, despite
Britain's High Court ruling that the former Chilean leader was
entitled to immunity from prosecution.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if he gets the backing of the
National Court, he will maintain his petition to interrogate
Pinochet and file an extradition demand as long as he is detained
in London, the daily newspaper El Pais reported.

EU interior ministers calling for new refugee laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Europe needs a new, joint policy on
refugees, interior and justice ministers from the European Union
agreed Thursday at an informal meeting in the Austrian capital.
	   Thursday's meeting centered on how to cope with the influx of
asylum-seekers coming to EU member countries, including a common
refugee law and redefining who qualifies as a refugee, the Austria
Press Agency reported.
	   Both Germany and Austria support a common law on asylum that
would include a policy of evenly distributing the refugees among
the 15-member nations, based on each country's population.
	   Germany's new foreign minister, Otto Schily, supported the
proposals, saying Germany's new government recognized that Germany
``has become a land of immigrants,'' APA said.
	   Anita Gradin, the EU Commissioner for Home and Justice Affairs,
called for improving refugees' status by amending the definition of
who is a refugees, as stated in the Geneva Convention.
	   The 1951 convention was adopted in the wake of massive
dislocation during World War II and the Cold War division of Europe
into rival camps. However, most recent refugees have been seeking
better economic opportunities in wealthier countries.
	   Gradin, a Swede, called the convention a ``Cold War document''
and proposed expanding it to broaden the definition.
	   Last month, the Austrian Interior Ministry released a paper
suggesting that the universal right of asylum for those fleeing
oppression could be amended to become a ``political offer'' which
individual countries could make if they choose. After meeting with
criticism, the Austrians later withdrew the paper.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency.

Criminal charges brought against independent radio director
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with media officials to have their passports
impounded, international media group protesting crackdown, Cekic's
reaction. Adds byline.
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The director of an independent
Belgrade radio station said Thursday he has been charged with
violating a government ban by broadcasting without a license.
	   The charges against Nenad Cekic, director of the small but
influential Radio Index, are the latest move in a crackdown on
independent media by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
government.
	   If found guilty, Cekic could be sentenced to up to eight years
in jail. His radio, often critical of Milosevic's hard-line
policies, was banned on Oct. 8 for not having a broadcast license.
	   Radio Index and other independent broadcasters have been denied
licenses for years, opening the way for the government to shut them
down when their broadcasts become critical of authorities.
	   Defying the ban, Radio Index continued its one-hour daily
broadcast over the airwaves of another popular independent Belgrade
radio station, B 92.
	   Cekic said Thursday that the Serb authorities ``Have gone a step
further ... threatening journalists with jail terms.''
	   Last week, the parliament in Serbia, Yugoslavia's most powerful
republic, passed a new media law severely restricting press freedom
and instituting heavy fines for media publishing or broadcasting
stories they deemed ``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government''.
	   The law was passed amid widespread anti-Western sentiment fueled
by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end the crisis in Kosovo.
Ethnic Albanian secessionists have been battling Yugoslav troops in
the southern Serbian province.
	   Four major independent Belgrade newspapers have stopped
publishing out of fear of huge fines.
	   Over the weekend, a Belgrade court fined Evropljanin weekly dlrs
246,000 for publishing articles that accused Milosevic of leading
Serbia into political and economic chaos. The court ordered three
top employees of the weekly to pay a third of their salaries to the
state each month, until the fine was settled.
	   Slavko Curuvija, the owner of Evropljanin, said Thursday that
the authorities have threatened to impound his passport, as well as
those from the weekly's editor-in-chief and the technical director.
	   In a protest letter sent Thursday to Milosevic, the World
Association of Newspapers said the new media law ``makes free
expression a crime and contravenes international human rights
conventions.''
	   The Paris-based group said that among the aspects of the law
that are of particular concern are a presumption of guilt, a ban on
listening to foreign radio stations, removal of freedom to
contradict state propaganda.
	   The letter called on Milosevic to ensure the law is repealed and
all convictions under it overturned.
	   The World Association of Newspapers defends press freedom.

Excerpts from the Truth Commission final report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more excerpts &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-South Africa-Truth Commission

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Excerpts from the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission's final report on abuses committed by all
sides during the fight against white rule.
	   _ From Retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu's foreward: ``However
painful the experience has been we remain convinced that there can
be no healing without truth. My appeal to South Africans as they
read this report is not to use it to attack others, but to add to
it, correct it and ultimately to share in the process that will
lead to national unity through truth and reconciliation.''
	   _ Primary finding: ``The predominant portion of gross violations
of human rights was committed by the former state through its
security and law enforcement agencies. Moreover the South African
state ... from the late 1970s to early 1990s became involved in
activities of a criminal nature when ... it knowingly planned,
undertook, condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful acts,
including the extra-judicial killing of political opponents inside
and outside South Africa.''
	   _ On P.W. Botha: ``Mr. Botha was responsible for ordering former
Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok and former police
Commissioner Johan van der Merwe unlawfully to destroy Khotso House
(which housed anti-apartheid groups).''
	   _ On the African National Congress: It ``perpetrated gross
violations of human rights in that the distinction between civilian
and military targets was blurred ... resulting in ... civilian
injury and loss of life.''
	   _ On the media: English language media ``often adopted a policy
of appeasement toward the state, ensuring a large measure of
self-censorship.'' The Afrikaans-language media ``with rare
exceptions chose to provide direct support for apartheid and the
activities of the security forces, many of which led directly to
gross violations of human rights.''
	   _ On the judiciary: ``The judiciary and the magistracy as well
as the ... legal profession were locked into an overwhelmingly
passive mindset which characterized the judgements of the bench in
the face of the injustices of apartheid.''
	   _ On business: ``The business sector failed ... to take
responsibility for its involvement in state security initiatives
... specifically designed to sustain apartheid rule.''
	   _ On religion: South African Christianity ``promoted the
ideology of apartheid in a range of different ways that included
Biblical and theological teaching.'' Ethical failures by religious
communities ``contributed to a climate within which apartheid was
able to survive.''
	   _ On accountability: ``Prosecution should be considered where
evidence exists that an individual has committed a gross human
rights violation'' unless they have asked for amnesty.
	   _ On reconciliation: ``Reconciliation is a process which is
never-ending, is costly and often painful. For this process to
develop it is imperative that democracy and a human rights culture
be consolidated. Reconciliation is centered on the call for a more
decent, more caring and more just society.''
	   _ On white attitudes: ``Despite amnesty provisions extending to
criminal and civil charges, the white community often seemed either
indifferent or plainly hostile to the work of the commission, and
certain media appear to have actively sought to sustain this
indifference and hostility.''
	   _ On the submission of the Inkatha Freedom Party: ``The Inkatha
Freedom Party made no pretense of co-operating with the commission.
Its submission to the commission consisted largely of a lengthy
exposition of how the president of the IFP had been vilified by his
political enemies ... its submission was singularly unforthcoming,
evasive and defensive.''
	   _ On destruction of state documents: ``The former state
deliberately and systematically destroyed state documentation in an
attempt to ensure that a new democratic government would be denied
access to incriminating evidence.''
	   _ On abuse of women: ``Women were abused by the security forces
in ways which specifically exploited their vulnerabilities as
women, for example rape or threats of rape and other forms of
sexual abuse.'' On the ANC treatment of women in its military
camps: ``Women in exile, particularly those in camps, were
subjected to various forms of sexual abuse and harassment,
including rape.''
	   _ On the state chemical, biological warfare program: The
program's scientists ``had as their purpose the murder of
individuals and the undermining of the health, if not the
elimination, of entire communities.''
	   _ On conscription: ``The state's policy of conscription was
immoral and denied conscripts the right to freedom of conscience
and the right to refuse to serve in the South African Defense
Force. Through the policy of conscription the state and the SADF
used young men to assist, implement and defend the policy of
apartheid, to maintain the illegal occupation of Namibia and to
wage war against neighboring countries.''

Swiss break up Kosovo weapons-smuggling ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss police have broken up a
weapons-smuggling ring which was organizing arms shipments to
Serbia's Kosovo province, the federal prosecutor's office said
Thursday.
	   Six people _ four from the former Yugoslavia, a Swiss woman and
a national of an Arab country _ were arrested in central and
eastern Switzerland an operation starting Monday, according to a
statement. The arrests were accompanied by house searches in
several states.
	   Half a ton of ammunition, several weapons and 230,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 172,000) in cash were seized.
	   ``Immediately before the arrest of the main suspects, they were
negotiating a planned arms deal to the value of several million
U.S. dollars for the resistance movement (against Yugoslav
government forces) in Kosovo,'' the federal prosecutor's office
said.
	   Some weapons are thought to have already arrived at their
destination, it added. The arrests and seizures followed the
opening of an investigation into a number of Yugoslav citizens
earlier this summer.
	   A Swiss police official will travel to Albania, where customs
officials seized two containers from Switzerland, in connection
with the investigation. The shipments contained ``modern weapons''
among other things.
	   The federal prosecutor's office declined to give further details
of the case.
	   Switzerland is home to a large Kosovo Albanian community.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with West Indian win, ADDS details of Pakistani
innings. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ West Indies entered the semifinal of
the $400,000 Wills International Cup with a convincing 30 run
victory against local favorites Pakistan at the Bangabandhu
national stadium Thursday.
	   Pakistan, chasing the West Indies total of 289 for nine wickets,
were 259 for nine when their quota of 50 overs ran out.
	   Pakistan's batting was sketchy and there wasn't a single
partnership that could have swayed the match in their favor. Opener
Salim Elahi and Ijaz Ahmad did boost their personal run bank, but
their knocks of 46 and 51 respectively, finally made no difference.
	   Pakistan never looked in control as they kept losing wickets at
regular intervals to West Indies bowlers led by Arthurton who took
four wickets for just 31 runs.
	   Pakistan also paid for some loose strokes by their batsmen and
even senior players like Salim Malik, skipper Aamir Sohail and
Wasim Akram fell to strokes that should have avoided.
	   West Indies bowling was not threatening, but with the Pakistani
batsmen repeatedly making mistakes, all that the Caribbean's had to
do was to slot the ball into the right spot.
	   Pakistan's skipper Sohail admitted that his team had failed in
all departments of the game. One positive outcome of the match was
Elahi, drafted into the squad after Inzamamul Haq pulled out, who
made 46 runs, the second highest score in the team.
	   Earlier in the West Indies innings, though the West Indies lost
the early wicket of opener Stuart Williams for 14 runs to Azhar
Mahmood's ball, they kept a brisk scoring rate with Philo Wallace
scoring the fastest fifty in the tournament.
	   Wallace was eventually run out for 79. Skipper Brian Lara was
dismissed for 16 runs caught by Saqlain Mushtaq to the bowling of
Arshad Khan.
	   Shivnaraine Chanderpaul, who scored a solid 49, and Carl Hooper
with 33 runs were the other notable contributors for the West
Indies.
	   World Champions Sri Lanka will take on South Africa in the first
semifinal Friday while West Indies will meet India in the second
semifinal on Saturday.

Russian premier hails `breakthrough' in talks with Chechen leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with Primakov saying meeting led
to breakthrough &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov flew
Thursday to the Caucasus Mountains for an unexpected meeting with
the leader of breakaway Chechnya, and said the former enemies
achieved a ``breakthrough.''
	   ``We did everything to bring the positions of Russia and
Chechnya closer, so that we finally overturn a tragic page in our
relations,'' Primakov said after a two-hour meeting with Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov in the southern city of Vladikavkaz.
	   The trip hadn't been announced in advance, apparently for
security reasons.
	   Primakov said that the Russian government would provide funds to
restore the war-shattered Chechen economy and help Chechen
officials combat a wave of kidnappings and other crime that has
swept the region.
	   He stressed that joint anti-crime efforts would not involve the
deployment of Russian forces in Chechnya. ``That will never
happen,'' Primakov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Arriving back in Moscow, Primakov told the ITAR-Tass news agency
that he had telephoned President Boris Yeltsin, ``who heartily
approved the results. I emphasized that the matter in question is
serious, as it seems to me a breakthrough in our relations.''
	   Despite repeated pledges, Maskhadov has achieved little in
fighting crime, having encountered strong resistance from numerous
warlords who abhor any government control. Some of them have
recently joined forces in a bid to overthrow Maskhadov.
	   Some 2,000 heavily armed men gathered at a rally in the Chechen
capital of Grozny on Thursday, demanding that Maskhadov face trial
for alleged violations of the constitution.
	   Participants at the rally, which was led by former rebel leader
Shamil Basayev, also criticized Maskhadov for meeting with
Primakov.
	   Speaking to reporters in Vladikavkaz, Maskhadov said he still
has broad popular support. ``The Chechen people support their
president, and the fact that several people demand my resignation
is a normal situation for any country,'' he said.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
1994-96 war with Russia, but no country has recognized its
independence claim. Moscow insists the territory remains part of
Russia.
	   Maskhadov, who was the top rebel commander during the war, is a
staunch proponent of independence, but the Kremlin supports him,
hoping he can stabilize the region.
	   ``Stability in Chechnya is vital not only for its residents, but
all Russians,'' Primakov said.
	   ``Chechnya must not be viewed as a part of Russia, but as a
territory suffering from serious problems following a war,''
Maskhadov said. ``We must strengthen mutual understanding between
Russia and Chechnya and fulfill earlier agreements.''
	   Chechen law enforcement officials, meanwhile, are in the midst
of a crackdown on hostage-takers. At least 100 people, including
five foreigners, are believed to be held.
	   Police raided two criminal groups Thursday morning, releasing
five hostages and arresting 14 people, said Chechen Security
Minister Aslanbek Arsayev, according to Interfax.
	   During their meeting on Thursday, Primakov and Maskhadov also
decided to set up a panel to search for those missing after the
war.
	   According to the ITAR-Tass, Primakov on Thursday also met the
presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia and discussed a
permanent settlement to 1992 fighting between ethnic Ingush and
Ossetians.

National Court hears arguments on legal basis for Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
extradition bid
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING with eds. note
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with court hearing underway, adds quotes from
prosecutor and lawyer for victims' families &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The National Court Thursday began hearing a
case that could end a Spanish judge's drive to extradite former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from Britain.
	   A verdict is expected Friday.
	   The court is to rule on prosecutors' arguments that Judge
Baltasar Garzon, whose warrant got Pinochet arrested in London on
Oct. 16 as he recovered from back surgery, lacks jurisdiction to
investigate human rights crimes committed in Chile and Argentina.
	   Garzon and another National Court judge have been gathering
evidence for two years to support charges of murder, torture and
the disappearance of thousands during the military juntas that
ruled Chile and Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   The order for Pinochet's arrest stemmed from these probes and
cited charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. Garzon says he
can go after perpetrators of genocide even if it is committed
outside Spain.
	   If the National Court agrees with the prosecutors that Garzon
lacked jurisdiction to investigate in the first place, Garzon
almost certainly would have no choice but to abandon his drive to
extradite Pinochet and his probes in Latin America, lawyers close
to the case have said. He can appeal to a higher Spanish court but
this is considered unlikely.
	   In opening arguments Thursday, National Court prosecutor Pedro
Rubira insisted that jurisdiction for human rights crimes committed
in Argentina and Chile lies within those countries, not Spain.
	   ``No country is above another,'' Rubira told an 11-member panel
of National Court judges. ``No country has more jurisdiction than
another.''
	   He added that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
the political opponents that died under his regime were not
persecuted because of their race or religion.
	   However Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer for families of junta victims in
Argentina, said ``the motive does not matter. Pinochet is guilty of
genocide because he tried to eliminate an entire group of people.''
	   The Spanish judges' probes of Chile and Argentina intersect
because Pinochet is accused of taking part in so-called Operation
Condor, in which several military juntas in South America teamed up
in the 1970s and 1980s to help each other crush what they perceived
as a communist threat.
	   Spanish news reports say Garzon will continue to seek Pinochet's
extradition if he gets the backing of the National Court, despite
Britain's High Court ruling that the former Chilean leader was
entitled to immunity from prosecution.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if he gets the backing of the
National Court, he will maintain his petition to interrogate
Pinochet and file an extradition demand as long as he is detained
in London, the daily newspaper El Pais reported.

Explosion rips through fuel company in St. Petersburg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A powerful blast tore through the headquarters of
a state-run fuel and energy company in St. Petersburg on Thursday,
causing serious damage and two slight injuries, a news agency said.
	   The explosion tore up concrete flooring and blew out doors and
windows on the first floor of the Toplivno-Energetichesky Komplex
company, ITAR-Tass reported, citing a company official.
	   It also shattered windows in nearby buildings.
	   Authorities were investigating the blast, and there were no
reports of anyone claiming responsibility. State authorities have
recently invited bidders for a tender to restructure the company.
	   Valery Kislov, a spokesman for the company, said flying glass
from the blast slightly injured one worker in his shin, and another
employee complained of temporary deafness.

Yemeni tribesmen release two Belgians

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesmen released two Belgian
tourists Thursday, two days after they were kidnapped, a security
official said.
	   The Belgians were handed over to the authorities and were being
taken to the southern city of Aden, the official said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The official said the authorities had negotiated with the
tribesmen, but did not say what had procured the release.
	   The Belgians were seized Tuesday in Abyan province, about 280
kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital, San`a, by five armed
members of the al-Bakazim tribe.
	   The tribesmen demanded that the government rescind a court
sentence which had condemned three of their clan to death for armed
robbery and murder, the official said.
	   The hostages were initially reported to be Austrian, but
diplomats said they were Belgian. ``The two men are not Austrians.
They are Belgians,'' said Abdul Jaleel Radman, the Austrian
honorary consul in the capital San`a.
	   A Belgian foreign ministry spokesman in Brussels confirmed their
nationality early Thursday.
	   ``The two were just tourists. We know this happens there. This
is not an isolated case,'' said spokesman Hubert Cooreman.
	   Yemeni security officials initially said they were kidnapped on
Wednesday, but later changed this to Tuesday.
	   The tourists' names have not been revealed. They are expected to
arrive in San`a on Friday.
	   In August, Yemen's president approved a law that imposes a
possible death penalty for people carrying out kidnappings.
	   Tribesmen have kidnapped more than 250 foreigners since 1991 in
attempts to obtain better government services or money.
	   Large swaths of Yemen are ruled by tribesmen armed with
everything from rifles to artillery. The hostages _ often oil
workers, diplomats or tourists _ are usually treated as guests and
are released unhurt.

Yeltsin may go on Black Sea vacation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin may check out of a
sanitarium where he is receiving treatment for exhaustion and go on
vacation to Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi on Friday, news
reports said.
	   Yeltsin entered a rest home in the woods outside Moscow on
Tuesday, to walks, receive treatment and rest to recover from
fatigue.
	   A medical team was meeting Thursday in the secluded Barvikha
sanitarium to discuss their patient, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax
news agencies reported, citing presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   The president's condition has not grown worse during his
sanitarium stay, Yakushkin said, according to Interfax. He did not
elaborate.
	   On Friday morning, Yeltsin will meet with Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov to discuss a European Union meeting in Austria, which
Primakov attended earlier this week in the ailing president's
stead.
	   Later in the day, Yeltsin may travel to Sochi _ about a two-hour
flight from Moscow _ for two weeks, Yakushkin said, according to
Interfax.
	   The spokesman added that the Moscow meetings with foreign
leaders that Yeltsin had planned for November were still on
schedule.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been seldom seen since the country was rocked
by an economic crisis in August, and it has become increasingly
clear that Primakov is handling day-to-day decisions.
	   A poll released Thursday indicated that three out of every four
Russians are in favor of impeaching Yeltsin.
	   Communist-led opposition in parliament had launched an
impeachment campaign long before the economic crisis, and long
before Yeltsin's latest illness.
	   Impeachment supporters in parliament accuse Yeltsin of
instigating the Soviet collapse, starting the unsuccessful war in
separatist Chechnya, and sending troops and tanks against his
hard-line foes in Russia's previous parliament in 1993.
	   But the campaign appears unlikely to fail, as several previous
ones have.
	   A poll by the independent Public Opinion Foundation indicated
that 75 percent of Russians supported impeaching Yeltsin, while 16
percent opposed it.
	   The greatest numbers of impeachment supporters were reported in
impoverished rural areas, according to Interfax. The largest number
of opponents were in Moscow _ Russia's only boomtown, where many
people are relatively content with Yeltsin's government.
	   The poll, conducted on Oct. 17 among 1,500 people throughout the
country, gave no margin of error.
	   In another recent poll, Primakov received the highest favorable
rating of any Russian politician, at 50 percent, up from 47 percent
last month.

Top U.S. official warns of Congo war threats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United States' top Africa official on
Thursday urged the eight countries involved in Congo's civil war to
prevent a genocide in that central African country.
	   ``They have the moral obligation of preventing this ethnic
violence and the international community must condemn its
perpetrators,'' Susan Rice said in the Angolan capital Luanda
during a tour of African countries to discuss Congo's conflict.
	   Rwandan Hutu extremists reportedly have become actively involved
in the country's three-month-old war. The United States has
condemned what it said were the Congolese government's efforts to
recruit perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
	   Rice, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa, also said
Congo's war could become ``one of the worst conflicts in the world
today.''
	   Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Chad and, reportedly, Sudan have sent
troops to support Congo President Laurent Kabila against insurgents
backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members
of Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ took up arms Aug. 2
and have since made steady gains in the country's east.
	   Rice _ accompanied by President Bill Clinton's special
assistant, Gayle Smith, and his special envoy to the Great Lakes
region, Howard Wolpe _ expressed the United States' interest in
renewing its relations with African countries.
	   ``We want a partnership that's based on mutual respect and
mutual interests,'' she said.
	   The U.S. officials were to leave Angola on Friday after meeting
with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Their next stop is not
clear, although their itinerary is known to include South Africa,
Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Uganda.

South Africa to play world champions Sri Lanka

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ World Champions Sri Lanka will face
South Africa in the first semifinals of the $400,000 Wills
International Cup at the Bangabandhu national stadium on Friday.
	   South Africa will start as the underdogs against a strong Sri
Lankan side, bolstered by the return of Chaminda Vaas who is likely
to spearhead the Lankan bowling attack.
	   South Africa will, however, be a little more confident after
their six-wicket victory over England. It was a victory fashioned
by the senior players in the team, with Daryll Cullinan playing the
anchor with a classy 69 in his first match.
	   Almost all the top South African batsmen are good with the bat,
but the bowling has to do better. England scored 281 for seven
against a rather weak attack and that must be a worrying factor to
skipper Hansie Cronje.
	   Sri Lanka looked good in all departments of the game in their
five wicket victory against New Zealand. But skipper Arjun
Ranatunga will have to call for more application from his frontline
batsmen who failed against the Kiwis.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Holding army parades and fighter jet
flyovers, Turkey showed off its military might Thursday while
throngs celebrated the 75th anniversary of the republic and pledged
to keep it secular.
	   ``Turkey is secular and will remain so,'' thousands chanted
along a long route leading to the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk, who founded the Westward-looking republic on the ruins of
the Ottoman Empire on Oct. 29, 1923.
	   Dignitaries from around the world watched a parade that included
a procession of tanks and artillery. Overhead, Turkish-made F-16s
and F-4s buzzed a hippodrome and an aerobatics team twisted and
turned through stunts.
	   Ataturk sought to curtail religion in a society where 99 percent
of the population is Muslim, banning Islamic attire and making
secularism the state ideology.
	   Seventy-five years later, Turkey is divided between those
wanting to preserve Ataturk's secular vision and those calling for
a greater place for religion in society.
	   Last year, Turkey's strongly secular military pressured an
Islamic-led government out of power, angered at policies aimed at
increasing Islam's hold on society.
	   In the festivities organized by the pro-secular establishment,
no dissenting voices were heard _ and no criticism tolerated.
	   The pro-Islamic mayor of a northeastern city had his powers
suspended Thursday after he was caught on tape insulting Ataturk as
a drunkard. Ataturk was known for his love of Turkey's
aniseed-flavored drink, raki.
	   Guests at the festivities included Prince Andrew, the Duke of
York; Israeli President Ezer Weizman; President Rafiq Tarrar of
Pakistan; and six presidents of former Soviet republics.
	   Turks gathered at Ankara's central Kizilay square for a night of
concerts, dancing and fireworks, starting the evening by singing
songs from the early days of the republic. Street parties, banquets
and fireworks were planned across the country.
	   ``We are so happy and so proud today,'' said Tugce Aziz, a
teen-ager wearing a sweatshirt bearing Ataturk's silhouette.
	   Others carried portraits of the late leader _ a
soldier-turned-statesman who fought off Western powers' attempts to
commandeer what was left of the old Ottoman empire after World War
I.
	   At Ataturk's mausoleum, two elderly men bearing medals awarded
to their fathers in Turkey's fight for independence saluted
journalists and passers-by. A blimp floated over the capital, its
sign declaring: ``Ataturk, we are following in your footsteps.''

Drop of blood, thank-you note from Freud sold on final day
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A drop of Pablo Picasso's blood on a scrap of
paper, lovingly preserved by his companion for decades, and a
thank-you note from Sigmund Freud were among the mementos sold at
auction Thursday.
	   The bloodstain was sold along with four other small souvenirs
for 20,000 francs (dlrs 3,590).
	   It was found among the possessions of Picasso's muse for eight
years, Dora Maar, upon her death last year at age 89. Below the
stain, she had scribbled: ``Blood of Picasso.''
	   Also sold on Thursday, the final day of a three-day sale of
Maar's possessions, was a printed note from Freud, thanking Picasso
for having taken part in celebrations for his 80th birthday.
	   It sold for 102,000 francs (dlrs 18,312) _ 20 times the
estimated price.
	   Picasso had passed the note on to Maar, with his own scribbled
message to her, beginning, ``Dora Mia.''
	   The highest sale of the day, though, had nothing to do with
Picasso _ it was an object created for Maar by the Surrealist
writer Andre Breton.
	   The item, called a ``song-object,'' was a handwritten poem
mounted in a box, to which the writer affixed various objects such
as a tiny blue flask. It sold for 1.35 million francs (dlrs
242,370.)
	   Picasso's bloodstain was in a package of five small items
including a photo of the artist in 1920.
	   When the bidding was completed, the government made a
``pre-emption,'' meaning it has the right to buy the item at the
same price within 15 days.
	   Picasso and Maar seemed to have somewhat of a fascination with
blood. His later companion, Francoise Gilot, once described what
happened when Picasso first met Maar at Les Deux Magots cafe in the
Left Bank.
	   ``Dora Maar wore black gloves with little roses. She took off
her gloves and took a long, pointed knife that she stabbed into the
table between her spread fingers,'' said Gilot, quoted by the daily
Le Figaro.
	   ``From time to time, she missed the mark by a fraction of a
millimeter, and her hand was covered in blood. Picasso was
fascinated.''
	   Maar and Picasso spent eight tumultuous years together before he
left her for a younger woman.
	   Maar fell into a depression when they parted, and by the time
she died she was living in isolation and poverty. All her life, she
refused to sell or even lend out the amazing Picasso collection she
had amassed.
	   Though Maar appeared to have no heirs, genealogists tracked down
two distant relatives, who had never heard of her. After the
government takes 60 percent of the proceeds, those relatives will
share the remaining 40 percent with the auction house and the
genealogists.
	   The auction's highest price, 37 million francs (dlrs 6.6
million), went for the 1937 ``The Crying Woman (Study for
Guernica)'' _ in which Dora's eyes are turned into tears pierced
with long pins.

New German leader denies split over economic policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Just two days in office, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder on Thursday rejected the notion that his new government
is split between reformers and old-style leftists over how to fight
unemployment _ his declared No. 1 goal.
	   ``The point is to find a balance between an economic policy that
pays attention to the cost of doing business and one that looks at
workers' incomes,'' he said in a television interview.
	   ``My goal is to pin down common approaches.''
	   Schroeder sought to assert authority over finance minister Oskar
Lafontaine, a traditional leftist who has competed for power with
Schroeder since the left's Sept. 27 election win.
	   Responding to harsh criticism from German industry and small
business lobbies, Schroeder said he was open to changes in the new
government's tax redistribution plans, which bear Lafontaine's
stamp.
	   The tax reform would leave more money in average earners'
pockets, partly by curbing loopholes and breaks for business.
	   Schroeder also slapped down Lafontaine for repeatedly urging
Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, to lower interest rates to
spur the economy.
	   ``One must talk with the Bundesbank, but not publicly,'' he
said.
	   Yet he insisted the election campaign unity between him and
Lafontaine, who also is the boss of Schroeder's Social Democratic
Party, would survive.
	   ``We are adults, and we have agreed to work together,'' he said
on ZDF television.
	   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, used his pro-business reputation
to win over conservative voters; Lafontaine is a traditional
leftist in favoring a stronger government role in the German
economy and world markets.
	   Among those calling for a more business-friendly approach and
bolder modernization of the economy is Schroeder's chief of staff,
Bodo Hombach.
	   Cuts in corporate taxes are planned only in several years, but
Schroeder said Thursday they may be moved up. He also backed
shorter working hours as a way to spread work around, but only if
wages are cut correspondingly.

Agriculture minister: Russia consults with U.S. on food aid

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While insisting that Russia is under no threat of
food shortages, the agriculture minister conceded Thursday that the
country is holding ``consultations'' with the United States about
humanitarian aid.
	   Since the economic crisis hit in mid-August, a fall in food
imports that came on top of an unusually low harvest has led to
serious concerns that Russia may not have enough food for the
winter.
	   Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor Semyonov said the problem
was not in any actual lack of food, but in getting it to all the
regions and selling it at prices that poor people can afford.
	   He refused to confirm reports that Russia has asked for
humanitarian aid from the West, but said the possibility has been
considered, and donated food would be helpful.
	   ``There is no reason to refuse humanitarian aid in food,''
Semyonov told a news conference, adding that it would only be
needed ``in individual regions, for individual strata of the
population.''
	   Russian agricultural officials were meeting Wednesday with a
U.S. government delegation, led by the general sales manager for
the USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service, Christopher Goldthwait.
	   Semyonov indicated that the talks might deal with the
possibility of humanitarian aid, but few details have been
released.
	   At the same time, Semyonov insisted that the government sees
``no threat of food shortages, no grounds for the threat of food
shortages today.''
	   ``Russia is stocked up rather fully on basic foods such as
potatoes, sugar, oil, vegetables and other foods,'' he told a news
conference.
	   The Agriculture and Food Ministry wants to support domestic
producers and is unwilling to emphasize any food problems in Russia
for fear of inviting food imports and aid _ thus increasing the
competition to Russian farmers.
	   Even so, Semyonov conceded that 22 of Russia's 89 regions suffer
``acute shortages of grain,'' and the banking crisis and the poor
organization of trade hinder deliveries from Russia's
grain-producing areas.
	   Russia's grain harvest this year is estimated at 47.3 metric
tons _ or only about half of last year's yield of 88.5 metric tons,
he said.
	   Semyonov called for greater state control over the agricultural
market, saying only that would ensure deliveries of inexpensive
food to troubled regions.
	   ``Unfortunately, since entering the market (economy), we have
lost many of the levers we had before for regulating crisis
situations,'' he said.
	   Russia's new Cabinet generally appears to favor a shift toward
greater state interference in the economy to pull it out of its
worst crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Thursday that the
government has ``resolutely opted'' to take more control.
	   Primakov was commenting on the government's long-awaited plan
for coping with the crisis, which was presented to the
International Monetary Fund on Wednesday.
	   The government hoped the plan would persuade the IMF to release
another installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan frozen after the
Russian economy fell apart in mid-August.
	   Meanwhile, the World Bank is also considering a dlrs 500 million
loan to Russia for structural reform of the agricultural sector,
said bank official Vera Matusevich, according to the Interfax news
agency. The loan would depend on the government's economic program,
she said.
	   The plan presented to the IMF calls for tighter currency
controls, price controls on medicines and some basic foods, a food
reserve to help the country through the winter and indexing wages
and pensions to compensate Russians for rising inflation.
	   It tackles the tax system, lowering some income, property and
profit tax rates but tightening the rules in hopes of making more
people pay. The government's chronic inability to collect taxes has
left it consistently short on cash and helped contribute to the
current crisis.

Tamoxifen approved as breast cancer protector
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. government decided Thursday that
healthy women who have a very high risk of getting breast cancer
later in life can take the powerful drug tamoxifen to cut their
odds of a tumor.
	   The action by the Food and Drug Administration makes tamoxifen
the first medicine ever approved to reduce women's risk of breast
cancer. But it can cause life-threatening side effects. And there's
no proof that it truly prevents breast cancer _ it may just delay
an inevitable tumor.
	   ``As valuable as tamoxifen is to some patients, FDA strongly
advises women and their doctors to carefully weigh the benefits and
risks of tamoxifen before patients use the drug,'' said FDA acting
Commissioner Michael Friedman, a cancer specialist.
	   A study funded by the National Cancer Institute and announced
last spring showed tamoxifen could cut the chances of developing
breast cancer by 44 percent in women at high risk of the disease.
	   But tamoxifen can cause serious side effects: It doubled women's
risk of uterine cancer, tripled the risk of potentially fatal blood
clots and increased the chances of developing cataracts that hurt
eyesight.
	   In studies so far, however, tamoxifen appeared mostly to reduce
the smallest, easiest-to-treat cancers. And some smaller British
studies have cast doubt on how effective the drug is.
	   Tamoxifen has been sold for 25 years to treat cancer, and after
the NCI study made headlines last spring many healthy women
frightened of getting cancer demanded it from their doctors. But
many physicians were reluctant to prescribe it as a possible cancer
preventive until the FDA's approval, primarily because they were
unsure just which women have enough cancer risk to benefit.

National Court hears arguments on legal basis for Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
extradition bid
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with court hearing underway, adds quotes

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's national court was deciding
Thursday whether to end a Spanish judge's drive to extradite former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from Britain.
	   Prosecutors asked the court Thursday to invalidate a judge's
arrest warrant for Pinochet, who was arrested Oct. 16 in a London
clinic while recovered from back surgery. They claim Judge Baltasar
Garzon lacks jurisdiction to investigate human rights crimes
committed in Chile and Argentina.
	   A verdict is expected Friday.
	   Garzon and another National Court judge have been gathering
evidence for two years to support charges of murder, torture and
genocide in the disappearance of thousands during military regimes
that ruled Chile and Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s. Garzon says
he can go after perpetrators of genocide even if it is committed
outside Spain.
	   If the National Court decides that Garzon lacks jurisdiction,
the judge almost certainly would have to abandon his drive to
extradite Pinochet and discontinue his probes in Latin America.
Garzon can appeal to a higher Spanish court but this is considered
unlikely.
	   In opening arguments Thursday, National Court prosecutor Pedro
Rubira insisted that jurisdiction for human rights crimes committed
in Argentina and Chile lies within those countries, not Spain.
	   ``No country is above another,'' Rubira told an 11-member panel
of National Court judges. ``No country has more jurisdiction than
another.''
	   He added that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
political opponents were not persecuted because of their race or
religion.
	   However Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer for families of victims of
Argentina's junta, said ``the motive does not matter. Pinochet is
guilty of genocide because he tried to eliminate an entire group of
people.''
	   The Spanish judges' probes of Chile and Argentina intersect
because Pinochet is accused of taking part in so-called Operation
Condor, in which several military juntas in South America teamed up
in the 1970s and 1980s to help each other crush what they perceived
as a communist threat.
	   Spanish news reports say Garzon will continue to seek Pinochet's
extradition if he gets the backing of the National Court, despite
Britain's High Court ruling that the former Chilean leader was
entitled to immunity from prosecution.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if he gets the backing of the
National Court, he will maintain his petition to interrogate
Pinochet and file an extradition demand as long as he is detained

Bickering, complaints mar first national committee meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Athens, Greece (AP) _ Bickering, complaints and accusations on
Thursday marred the first meeting of the Greek national committee
that is to help organize the Athens 2004 summer Olympics.
	   ``This place is more like Parliament than a national
committee,'' griped Deputy Public Works Minister Christos Verelis.
	   It was the first meeting of the committee, which numbers more
than 50, since Athens was awarded the Games in September 1997.
	   Intended to coordinate preparation efforts, the committee is
made up of political, social, cultural and athletic figures.
	   Some of the questions raised during the four-hour meeting
included whether all the projects will be completed on time, their
cost, and if Athens will turn a profit or will be paying off debts
years after the Olympics are over.
	   Members of the main opposition conservative party also peppered
government ministers with more than 35 questions on deadlines,
money, and proposed changes in some of the Olympic venues.
	   ``Everyone understands that the organization of the Olympic
Games isn't a simple, technical issue but an opportunity to apply a
national strategy for the country's projection,'' said Culture
Minister Evangelos Venizelos, the committee president.
	   He added that ``we are within the time frame agreed upon in the
agreement we made when the Olympic Games were assigned to Athens.''
	   Although there have been some accusations that bureaucratic
red-tape has delayed the organization so far, an International
Olympic Committee commission which visited last month said it was
happy with preparations so far.
	   Athens has completed more than two-thirds of the facilities
necessary to stage the Games. Key projects _ including the subway,
a new airport and a ring road _ are due for completion by 2001,
organizers claim.
	   Organizing committee president Stratis Stratigis also shrugged
off criticism that Athens was foot dragging in its preparations for
the Games.
	   ``After all,'' he said, ``the turtle finished before the hare.''

Report: U.S. Major League Baseball to ban androstenedione
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 7th graf to update with denial by Selig spokesman. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ American Major League Baseball plans to ban the
use of androstenedione, the muscle-building dietary supplement used
by home run champion Mark McGwire, the Toronto Globe and Mail
reported Thursday.
	   The newspaper cited unidentified sources, who said they expect
commissioner Bud Selig to formally announce a ban before spring
training next season.
	   ``I would hate to be in McGwire's shoes right now,'' said Dr.
William Bryan, team physician for the Houston Astros and the past
president of the American Association of Professional Team
Physicians. ``We have just been shaking our heads all this time
that androstenedione was on the shelves.''
	   McGwire, who could not be reached for comment, hit 70 homers
this year, breaking the record of 61 set by Roger Maris in 1961.
	   ``All the players will know where we stand on andro once a
decision is made,'' said MLB players' union chief Donald Fehr, who
along with Selig agreed last summer to appoint a committee of
doctors to study the danger of andro. ``Right now, the doctors are
simply investigating.''
	   Androstenedione is illegal in Canada but legal in the United
States. It is banned by the International Olympic Committee, U.S.
pro gridiron National Football League and America's main governing
body for college sports (the NCAA), but allowed by MLB.
	   ``We haven't even seen the reports from the doctors,'' Selig
spokesman Rich Levin said, adding no decision has been made. ``It's
all speculation.''
	   In Johnson City, Tennessee, researchers at East Tennessee State
University are studying the supplement. Dr. Craig Broeder, exercise
physiologist at the school's Human Performance Lab, said they will
study androstenedione's physical and psychological effect on men
between the ages of 35 and 65.
	   ``The main reason for the study is about health issues and
anti-aging,'' he said.
	   The study's 70 participants will undergo medical tests as they
engage in weight training for 12 weeks.
	   The dlrs 28,000 study is being funded by ChemSource, a company
that researches supplements and other products, and Metabolic
Response Modifiers, which produces supplements.
	   Broeder said he hopes to find that andro can boost men's
testosterone at an age when it begins to drop. Such a drop creates
a greater risk of heart and circulatory problems.

Greece to bid for Archimedes manuscript in New York auction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece will bid for a one-of-a-kind copy
of a text by ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes in a New York
auction after a court refused to halt the bidding, the culture
minister said Thursday.
	   ``The Greek government and the institutional sponsors supporting
us will participate'' in the sale at Christie's auction house,
Evangelos Venizelos said.
	   Greece appealed earlier this month to Greek private and public
institutions for help in mounting a bid for the 1,000-year-old
manuscript, which includes copies of some of the only known
writings and calculations on geometry and physics by the scientist
and inventor, who lived in the 3rd century B.C.
	   The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem, which claimed the
text was stolen after World War I from its library in present-day
Istanbul, applied for an injunction against Christie's auction
house to stop the sale.
	   But the Federal Court of New York refused to halt the Thursday
auction. The manuscript, owned by a French family, was expected to
fetch between dlrs 800,000 and dlrs 1.2 million.
	   But Venizelos said the Patriarchate will continue with legal
action even after the auction.
	   ``Our aim is for the manuscript to be saved, to be revealed to
the scientific community, to stop being hidden,'' he said.
	   ``The Jerusalem Patriarchate has very important evidence which
perhaps could not have been judged,'' Venizelos added.
	   The 174-leaf manuscript is a palimpsest _ a text which has been
written on twice. When writing materials were in short supply, the
original text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful and
a new one written over it.
	   The manuscript was studied in 1907 by a Danish scientist, who
used only natural light and a magnifying light. Experts believe
modern methods such as ultraviolet light and digital scanning could
reveal as yet unknown works of Archimedes underneath.

Britain's poet laureate Ted Hughes dies

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Poet laureate Ted Hughes, who won some of his
greatest acclaim at the end of his life with a searing poetic
account of his troubled marriage to American poet Sylvia Plath, has
died. He was 68.
	   Hughes, who died Wednesday after an 18-month battle with cancer,
had long ignored the attacks on his character by feminists and
others who blamed him for Plath's 1963 suicide.
	   He kept silent on the subject for nearly 35 years, rearing their
two children and steadily gaining admiration for his powerful,
unsentimental poetry about nature and its savagery.
	   The publication in January of ``Birthday Letters'' about his
love for the tortured Plath not only silenced much of the personal
criticism, it brought him understanding and a torrent of praise.
	   It became a publishing sensation _ and a best-seller.
	   ``Reading it is like being hit by a thunderbolt,'' poet Andrew
Motion wrote. ``Anyone who thought Hughes' reticence was proof of
his hard heart will immediately see how stony they have been
themselves.''
	   Announcing Hughes' death at a London hospital, publisher Matthew
Evans of Faber and Faber on Thursday called the poet ``the most
extraordinary man. The loss to his family is inestimable.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair called Hughes ``a towering figure in
20th-century literature who even in his last years was producing
great works.''
	   The 88 poems in ``Birthday Letters'' shed new light on Hughes'
difficult six-year marriage to Plath, who committed suicide months
after he had left her for another woman.
	   She gassed herself in the kitchen, leaving milk and cookies for
their children, Frieda and Nicholas, in the next room.
	   Some Plath fans called Hughes a murderer and his name has been
repeatedly hacked off her gravestone in Yorkshire, northern
England.
	   ``He wanted `Birthday Letters' to be published because he knew
he was seriously ill. He wanted to publish the work before he
died,'' Evans said. ``He regarded it as being of personal
importance. It was the nearest thing to an autobiography.''
	   The book arrived without warning or fanfare.
	   ``He just appeared at our offices one day last summer bearing a
vast bundle containing pages of poems that we had no idea
existed,'' editor Christopher Reid said in January.
	   The poems surprised many with their intimacy.
	   Of the first time the couple made love, Hughes wrote: ``You were
slim and lithe and smooth as a fish./ You were a new world. My new
world./So this is America, I marveled./ Beautiful, beautiful
America.''
	   When the collection won the Forward Poetry Prize this month,
judges' chairman Geordie Greig called it a work of ``timeless
genius.''
	   Hughes would not be interviewed about it, but when his editor
accepted the prize on his behalf, he read a letter in which the
poet said the collection was ``a gathering of the occasions _
written with no plan over about 25 years _ in which I tried to open
a direct, private, inner contact with my first wife, not thinking
to make a poem, thinking mainly to evoke her presence to myself and
to feel her there listening.
	   ``Except for a handful, I never thought of publishing these
pieces until last year, when quite suddenly I realized I had to
publish them, no matter what the consequences.''
	   To read ``Birthday Letters,'' said Nobel Prize-winning poet
Seamus Heaney, was ``to experience the psychic equivalent of the
bends. It takes you down to levels of pressure where the
undertruths of sadness and endurance leave you gasping.''
	   Ted Hughes was the son of a carpenter, born Aug. 17, 1930, in
the mill town of Mytholmroyd in Yorkshire, northern England, and
started writing poems in grammar school.
	   He went on to Cambridge University, where he met Plath, who was
studying on a Fulbright Scholarship. They married in 1956.
	   Plath had a history of mental problems and had first attempted
suicide three years before meeting Hughes.
	   After a day in London in 1956, Hughes wrote: ``We clutched each
other giddily/ For safety and went in a barrel together/ Over some
Niagara. Falling/ In the roar of soul your scar told me _/ Like its
secret name, or its password _/ How you had tried to kill yourself.
And I heard/ Without ceasing for a moment to kiss you/ As if a
sober star had whispered it/ Above the revolving, rumbling city:
stay clear.''
	   The couple went to the United States in 1957, where she taught
at Smith College and he taught at the University of Massachusetts.
They returned to England in 1959, and continued to write and
publish poetry.
	   Hughes' first volume of poems, ``Hawk in the Rain,'' was
published in 1957 and immediately established him as one of the
most interesting of Britain's young poets.
	   Hughes, who remarried in 1970, published more than 35 poems and
collections of verse, three works of prose, as well as opera
libretti and stage plays.
	   He was a also successful children's writer, publishing five
poetic works for young people and seven stories including the
popular ``The Iron Man'' _ published in 1968 in the United States
as ``The Iron Giant.''
	   As poet laureate, a designation he received in 1984, Hughes
wrote about significant national occasions, including Princess
Diana's funeral last year.
	   His last appearance in public was 13 days ago when he accepted
the Order of Merit, a rare honor, from Queen Elizabeth II at
Buckingham Palace.
	   Hughes is survived by his wife, Carol, and his children. No
funeral plans were announced.

Germany's new environment minister to attend conference in

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Juergen Trittin, Germany's new Greens party
environment minister, is to head the nation's delegation taking
part in international conference in Buenos Aires next month, his
office said Thursday.
	   The focus of the third annual environment conference scheduled
for Nov. 11-13 is to make a clearer working plan for the goals
agreed upon at last year's conference in Kyoto, Japan, the ministry
said.
	   Those goals include cooperation between industrial nations to
reduce and eliminate polluting gases. Tritten said he does not have
high hopes for any revolutionary proposals at the conference as it
will deal mainly with old issues.
	   Many countries have not yet ratified the protocol that was
agreed upon at the Kyoto conference in December.
	   The long term vision of the protocol is to decrease the release
of the six most poisonous gases polluting the atmosphere by five
percent between 2008 and 2012.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch cut through the
Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds
whirling for a third day through resort islands and mainland
communities. At least 32 people have been killed and widespread
flooding prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground.
	   Mitch, once among the century's most powerful hurricanes,
weakened Thursday as it blasted this Central American nation,
bringing downpours that flooded at least 50 rivers. It also kicked
up huge waves that pounded seaside communities.
	   The storm's power was easing fast and by 1800 GMT, it had
sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), down from 100 mph (160 kph)
around 0600 GMT and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of early
Tuesday.
	   ``Mitch could weaken to tropical storm strength later today, but
restrengthening is possible if the center moves away from land,''
the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in a statement Thursday.
	   The center said that after remaining virtually stationary for
more than a day, the center of the 350-mile-wide
(560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly to the southeast,
just inland near the town of Limon. Hurricane-force winds whirled
up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with rain-laden
tropical storm winds extending well beyond that.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Sending a strong statement to oil
companies on what route to pick for oil from the petroleum-rich
Caspian Sea, Turkey and four former Soviet republics signed a
declaration Thursday supporting the U.S.-backed Turkish route.
	   The as-yet-unbuilt pipeline linking the Azeri capital of Baku to
the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan is a costly option for Western oil
companies, which are said to prefer a cheaper and shorter route.
Estimates on how much the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline would cost range
from dlrs 2.5 billion to dlrs 4 billion.
	   Nonetheless, the presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakstan,
Uzbekistan and Georgia pointed at the Baku-Ceyhan route as their
preference and pledged to ``take all the necessary measures to
create favorable conditions for the investors.''
	   ``Now the issue is not whether Baku-Ceyhan is going to happen,
because it is going to happen. The issue is how,'' said U.S. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, who witnessed the signing ceremony in a
show of Washington's commitment to the project.
	   Turkey, supported by the United States, has said that even if
oil companies were to choose another route, it would find other
funding to build the pipeline, which could eventually be used to
transport Kazak and Russian oil to Europe.
	   But Russians are proposing another route, through their
territory, and Thursday's high-level gathering seemed unable to
overcome regional disputes.
	   Turkmenistan, expected to sign the agreement, refused to join
the Ankara declaration. A territorial dispute with Azerbaijan over
an oil-rich field in the Caspian appeared to be the cause.
	   Turkey has offered to build its own part of the pipeline and
Richardson said the five countries had agreed to propose major tax
and tariff reductions to the investors.
	   ``It's a framework. Now, it's up to the Turks to really start
negotiating with the companies,'' said Zeyno Baran, an energy
analyst.
	   The United States has repeatedly pledged its backing for the
proposed 1,730-kilometer (1,075-mile) Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.
Washington has announced a package of financial support, including
a dlrs 823,000 grant for the pipeline, and political risk insurance
for companies investing in the project.
	   Washington prefers to see the oil from the Caspian _ the world's
second-richest oil reserves after the Middle East _ passing through
an allied country like Turkey, rather than hostile Iran, which has
also proposed a route.
	   The companies, including British Petroleum and U.S.-based Amoco,
Exxon, Pennzoil and Unocal, are expected to announce their decision
Nov. 12.
	   The main alternative to Baku-Ceyhan is an existing pipeline from
Baku to the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa, from where the oil
would be transferred in tankers through the Bosporus.
	   The Baku-Supsa line, currently being renovated, is scheduled to
carry early oil from the Caspian in April.
	   The five countries and the United States are opposed to this
route. They cite the already heavy oil tanker traffic through the
narrow Bosporus strait, which has led to hundreds of accidents.

Bickering, complaints mar first national committee meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Athens, Greece (AP) _ Bickering, complaints and accusations on
Thursday marred the first meeting of the Greek national committee
that is to help organize the Athens 2004 summer Olympics.
	   ``This place is more like Parliament than a national
committee,'' Deputy Public Works Minister Christos Verelis said.
	   It was the first meeting of the committee, which numbers more
than 50, since Athens was awarded the Games in September 1997.
	   Intended to coordinate preparation efforts, the committee is
made up of political, social, cultural and sports figures.
	   Some of the questions raised during the four-hour meeting
included whether all the projects will be completed on time, their
cost, and if Athens will turn a profit or will be paying off debts
years after the Olympics are over.
	   Members of the main opposition conservative party also peppered
government ministers with more than 35 questions on deadlines,
money, and proposed changes in some of the Olympic venues.
	   ``Everyone understands that the organization of the Olympic
Games isn't a simple, technical issue but an opportunity to apply a
national strategy for the country's projection,'' Culture Minister
and committee president Evangelos Venizelos said.
	   ``We are within the time frame agreed upon in the agreement we
made when the Olympic Games were assigned to Athens.''
	   Although there have been some accusations that bureaucratic
red-tape has delayed the organization so far, an International
Olympic Committee commission which visited last month said it was
happy with preparations so far.
	   Athens has completed more than two-thirds of the facilities
necessary to stage the Games. Key projects _ including the subway,
a new airport and a ring road _ are due for completion by 2001,
organizers said.
	   Organizing committee president Stratis Stratigis also shrugged
off criticism that Athens was delaying in its preparations for the
Games.
	   ``After all,'' he said, ``the turtle finished before the hare.''

Kiss-and-tell book stirs media storm, shatters taboo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Photos of her lounging on a sailboat or entwined on
the beach with then-Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, and her account
of a multimillion-dollar kickback scandal involving him, stirred a
media storm Thursday.
	   Even if Christine Deviers-Joncour overturns no new stones in the
scandal, her new book ``The Whore of the Republic'' _ which comes
out on Tuesday _ is breaking France's longtime taboo of publicizing
the private lives of its politicians.
	   Many French have snickered and sneered at the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, calling it a puritan witchhunt against President Bill
Clinton that would never happen in France.
	   It wasn't until months before President Francois Mitterrand died
in 1996 that his illegitimate daughter, Mazarine, was brought into
the media limelight.
	   Now Dumas, the 76-year-old head of the Constitutional Council _
one of France's highest legal bodies _ is in hot spot.
	   Dumas was known for numerous dalliances, never publicized. But
that protection began to erode last year, when Deviers-Joncour was
arrested in connection with a kickback scandal.
	   Investigators say Deviers-Joncour, about 20 years Dumas' junior,
was hired to lobby him to secure the state-owned Thomson company's
1991 contract to build frigates for Taiwan.
	   In her book, Deviers-Joncour acknowledges the lobbying job,
though she makes no reference to the 66-million-franc (dlrs 12
million) commission _ from another state-owned company _ she
allegedly shared with Dumas.
	   In April, Dumas was placed under formal investigation, one step
short of being charged, for ``complicity and receiving embezzled
public funds.''
	   ``If that work was not, for me, a question of survival, I would
probably have left it all,'' Deviers-Joncour wrote in the book, in
excerpts published Thursday in the daily Le Monde.
	   ``But is love so ethereal?'' she added cynically in the book,
published by Calmann-Levy. ``Does it not often fill a need? Does it
not often correspond to an opportunity?''
	   The tabloid weekly Paris Match on Thursday featured snapshots of
Dumas and Deviers-Joncour on the beach in 1991, on a friend's
sailboat and walking in the woods.
	   Another weekly, l'Evenement du Jeudi, ran the cover story ``The
Mistresses of the Republic,'' reporting not only on Dumas but also
other leaders. Mitterrand was ``the great skirt-chaser,'' it said,
and former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing ``confused
free-market liberalism with libertinism.''
	   President Jacques Chirac ``benefits from total media silence,
even if editing rooms hum from time to time with rumors about
liaisons he could have had with a journalist, an actress or the
former wife of a former minister,'' it said.
	   Le Monde acknowledged the book established ``no formal link''
between Dumas and the kickback money, but wrote that the love
affair ``further weakens the defense of the president of the
Constitutional Council.''
	   A Le Monde editorial said Dumas ``is guardian of constitutional
law, in other words republican virtue. Can he continue to be, now
that the truth has been said?''
	   Dumas' lawyers shot back that the book ``brings no new
evidence'' against their client.
	   While Dumas was taking no action against the book, an ex-husband
of Deviers-Joncour sought a court order to strike passages about
him. A court was to rule on Monday, Le Monde said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece will bid for a one-of-a-kind copy
of a text by ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes in a New York
auction after a court refused to halt the bidding, the culture
minister said Thursday.
	   ``The Greek government and the institutional sponsors supporting
us will participate'' in the Christie's auction, Evangelos
Venizelos said.
	   Greece appealed earlier this month to Greek private and public
institutions for help in mounting a bid for the 1,000-year-old
manuscript, which includes copies of some of the only known
writings and calculations on geometry and physics by the 3rd
century BC scientist and inventor.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, the
Palestinian Authority on Thursday placed the leader of the Islamic
militant group Hamas under house arrest.
	   The decision came several hours after Hamas claimed
responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed an Israeli soldier
and threatened to undermine the new Mideast peace agreement.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised Israeli Prime Minster
Benjamin Netanyahu in response to the attack that he would crack
down on the militants.
	   Palestinian policemen set up roadblocks around Sheik Ahmed
Yassin's home. Motorists were stopped and questioned. Policemen
opened trunks and aimed flashlights at passengers.
	   Journalists were told they could stick around for a few minutes
to take in the scene, but would then have to leave.
	   The Palestinian security services said in a statement: ``Sheik
Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security reasons.''
	   This marked the first time that Arafat is openly confronting the
quadriplegic Hamas leader, his strongest political rival.
	   In the past, the Palestinian leader would detain lower-level
Hamas officials from time to time. However, he never touched
Yassin, apparently because he wanted to avoid an open and possibly
blood showdown with the militants.
	   A relative of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that
the Hamas leader had not been notified that he was barred from
leaving his home. The man said Yassin's first appointment outside
his home was Friday morning and that he had no plans to leave his
home in the meantime.
	   As part of the crackdown on Hamas, Arafat also ordered the
arrests of dozens of Hamas activists. Two senior members, Mahmoud
Zahar, and Ismail Hanieh, were among those detained.

Sampras wins, Agassi stopped, Ivanisevic ousts Becker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sampras quotes, CORRECTS in 13th graf that Agassi
is No. 5 &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras made sure of extending
his No. 1 reign for at least another week by beating Bohdan
Ulihrach 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the
dlrs 2.45 Eurocard Open.
	   Had he lost, Sampras could have lost the top spot to either No.
2 Marcelo Rios or No. 3 Patrick Rafter.
	   But Sampras needed just under an hour to beat Ulihrach, who had
won two of their three previous matches. The victory assured
Sampras of remaining No. 1 when the new rankings come out Monday.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1
for six years in a row.
	   ``It's a record that might not ever be broken. It is that hard
to do,'' Sampras said. ``I feel like I am on a good road.''
	   Richard Krajicek stopped Andre Agassi's recent roll when he
upset the American 6-3, 6-4.
	   In a showdown between two former Wimbledon champions, Krajicek
used his serve-and-volley game to overpower Agassi and reach the
quarterfinals.
	   Tenth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov also advanced by beating Todd
Martin 6-4, 7-5, and Jan-Michael Gambill upset ninth-seeded Tim
Henman 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Goran Ivanisevic, seeded 14th, ended the run of Boris Becker,
the crowd's sentimental favorite, with a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5)
victory. Becker is in semi-retirement and this could have been his
last tournament at home.
	   Ivanisevic fired 17 aces, Becker 16. ``I was a bit unlucky
today,'' Becker said.
	   In an all-Swedish battle, Jonas Bjorkman rallied to beat Thomas
Johansson 2-6, 6-4, 6-2.
	   Krajicek, who is ranked No. 11 in the world, is trying to clinch
one of the last two places available for the eight-man World
Championship next month in Hanover, Germany.
	   Agassi already has qualified for Hanover and surged to No. 5 in
the world after winning last week's tournament in Ostrava, Czech
Republic. A former No. 1, Agassi was ranked No. 141 at this time
last year and playing challenger events. Now, he is in the Top 5
for the first time since July 15, 1996.
	   Winner of five titles this year, Agassi could not tame
Krajicek's monster serve. Agassi won only nine points on Krajicek's
serve.
	   ``When he serves that well, it's very difficult,'' Agassi said.
``He is a tough guy to develop any rhythm against. He likes the
court here. All he had to do was break my serve twice.''
	   Krajicek won the title here in 1995 and reached the final last
year.
	   ``I am very satisfied with the way I played today,'' he said.
	   ``I served very well from the start and I put a lot of pressure
on him. Eventually, he was going to miss a few passing shots,''
said Krajicek, who will have surgery on his left knee after the
indoor season.
	   ``It's a long road to Hanover, it doesn't seem that far away in
time but an eternity in points,'' said Krajicek, who hit nine aces.
	   The Dutchman trails three players _ Karol Kucera, Petr Korda and
Henman in points for Hanover. All three have lost here and Krajicek
could gain some ground if he does well in this tournament.
	   Gambill, a 21-year-old American, survived 25 aces by Henman to
beat the Briton for the second time this year. As No. 9 in the
world, Henman is the highest-ranked player Gambill has ever beaten
and his first Top 10 victim.
	   ``Nobody has aced me that much,'' Gambill said. ``He actually
played a better match. He served a lot better than I did. I just
scraped and did my best from the baseline.''
	   At the time of the Australian Open, Gambill was No. 227 in the
world. Now, he is No. 50. ``My goal for the year was to get into
the Top 100,'' he said.
	   In the quarterfinals, Gambill plays Sampras, while Ivanisevic
meets Krajicek.

More Israeli-Palestinian talks on Geneva Convention hoped soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland expects to organize a second meeting
in the near future between Israeli and Palestinian delegates to
discuss the Geneva Conventions on the conduct of war, officials
said Thursday.
	   In Geneva last June, the two sides secretively held a first
meeting that could start a process for dealing with Jewish
settlements under international law.
	   The second meeting is expected to take part in the southern
Swiss town of Locarno, but no date has been confirmed.
	   The talks marked the first time Israel has attended negotiations
that implied any formal recognition that the conventions have any
application to territories it captured in 1967.
	   They fell far short of Arab and European demands that all 188
countries of the convention be convened to discuss enforcement
against settlement building. Israel fears such an assembly could
build pressure on Israel over the settlements.
	   The Arab-European position has won overwhelming backing in the
U.N. General Assembly, with only the United States, Israel and
Micronesia voting against.
	   Israel, a signatory to the Geneva Convention, refuses to accept
its application to the territory it captured in the 1967 Mideast
war, which it maintains is Jewish land.
	   The Convention bans the usurpation of land by an occupying power
_ a provision the Palestinians and the European Union say would ban
settlement building.
	   Switzerland, depository of the Geneva Conventions, proposed the
Israeli-Palestinian talks. The International Committee of the Red
Cross, charged with upholding the convention, also was represented.
	   The bilateral contacts are the first part of a package proposed
by the Swiss.
	   The second, a three-day experts' meeting of signatories to the
Fourth Geneva Convention, the 1949 update of the world's ground
rules for the conduct of war, wrapped up Thursday.
	   Experts from 118 countries were present to identify general
problems in applying the conventions and possible means of
overcoming them.
	   Walter Gyger, the chairman and Switzerland's ambassador to
international organizations in Geneva, stressed that it wasn't the
conference of signatories called for at the General Assembly or a
preparation for such a conference.
	   The meeting avoided identifying specific countries or
territories.
	   ``The ground rules were with some interpretation respected,''
Gyger told reporters. ``Nobody was interrupted.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An assailant splashed acid into the face of a
Russian soccer star Thursday, but the player was not seriously
injured, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   An unidentified man threw the acid on Oleg Veretennikov, a
leading player with Rotor Volgograd in southern Russia, while
Veretennikov was taking a walk with his daughter, the news agency
said, citing police.
	   The report said the player sustained light burns. The report did

Argentine and Britain ``open up'' new era in relations

	   LONDON (AP) _ Argentine President Carlos Menem and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on Thursday signed a string of agreements to
``open up'' a new era in relations between the two nations.
	   Over two hours of talks at Blair's Downing Street residence, the
prime minister hinted at lifting the arms embargo imposed by
Britain after Argentina invaded the British-governed Falklands
Islands in 1982.
	   During the 74-day confict, 970 soldiers _ mostly Argentinean _
died.
	   The three agreements covered trade, sport and political
relations between Britain and Argentina.
	   ``Argentine and British companies are recreating, through trade
and investment, the commercial relationship that was once one of
the most important in the world,'' a joint communique said after
the meeting.
	   While the subject of the Falklands was raised, Blair's office
said each leader restated his position and moved on to other
topics. The issue of sovereignty was not discussed, said a Blair
spokesman, speaking on terms of customary anonymity.
	   But the conflict over the Falklands _ which Argentina calls the
Malvinas _ did cast a shadow over some negotiations.
	   Blair told Menem that Britain was concerned about planned
Argentinean legislation giving Argentina the right to license oil
and fishing operations around the Falklands.
	   And Blair also said the reappraisal of the arms embargo would be
made ``mindful of our security considerations.''
	   Britain is the third-largest foreign investor in Argentina,
behind the United States and Spain, and Blair's office said the two
leaders talked at length about global financial instability.
	   Trade between the two countries reached dlrs 1.2 billion last
year. Statistics show it increased by 275 percent between 1991 and
1996, driven by banking, tobacco, automobile and service
industries.
	   Menem said Argentina will back England's bid to stage the 2006
soccer World Cup, and invited Blair to visit Argentina.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) - Ending a cathartic exercise in
truth-telling Thursday, the panel probing apartheid's horror called
the system a crime against humanity. It also condemned the main
enemy of white rule, the African National Congress, for torture and
killings.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued a sprawling
report that spared few parties in South Africa's history from 1960
to 1994, when all-race elections ended white minority rule.
	   Publication of the five hard-cover volumes numbering 2,750 pages
was a major event in South Africa's efforts to deal with its
violent past. It culminated more than two years of hearings of
apartheid's perpetrators and victims, who produced some 21,000
statements.
	   The idea was to set the record straight after decades of
censorship and lies by white governments. But the hearings also
were like collective psychoanalysis, an emotional exploration of a
nation's pain.
	   ``Let the waters of healing flow from Pretoria today ... to
cleanse our land, its people and to bring unity and
reconciliation,'' Desmond Tutu, the retired Anglican archbishop who
headed the commission, told President Nelson Mandela in handing
over the report here.
	   ``We will have looked the beast in the eye. We will have come to
terms with our horrendous past and it will no longer keep us
hostage,'' he said.
	   The commission laid the heaviest burden of guilt, not
surprisingly, on white governments. The commissioners accused those
at the highest level of power -- top officials who served on the
secretive State Security Council -- of sanctioning killings,
torture and beatings of political opponents.
	   They also condemned lawyers, judges, church officials and
journalists who through collaboration or silence perpetuated the
apartheid system.
	   ``The recognition of apartheid as a crime against humanity
remains a fundamental starting point for reconciliation in South
Africa,'' the commissioners wrote.
	   It indirectly suggested prosecution for key figures, including
P.W. Botha, the last hardline apartheid president; Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, Mandela's ex-wife and an ANC official; and
Mangosuthu Buthulezi, leader of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha
Freedom Party and a member of government.
	   They were implicated in ``gross human rights violations.'' The
document said ``prosecution should be considered where evidence
exists that an individual has committed a gross human rights
violation.''
	   The commission can grant amnesty, but only to those who ask for
it and who confess fully to politically motivated crimes. Botha,
Madikizela-Mandela and Buthelezi did not seek amnesty.

Lebanese court sentences Israeli collaborators to jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A military court sentenced 16 Lebanese on
Thursday to up to 10 years in prison for spying for Israel, the
official National News Agency reported.
	   The court convicted them of ``contacting the Israeli enemy and
its agents and passing on information to its advantage'' and
entering Israel without permission from the Lebanese government,
the agency reported.
	   The 16 were arrested earlier this year and charged on July 8.
	   A statement issued by the court said that one defendant was
sentenced to three months in jail and another to 10 years. The
other 14 received sentences of one to eight years.
	   The statement did not give any breakdown of the charges nor any
personal details of the accused apart from their names.
	   The court sentenced another 59 accused in absentia to prison
terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with hard labor on similar
charges, the agency said.
	   A further three accused were found innocent.
	   Those convicted were found to have provided information on
Lebanese and Syrian troop movements and the activities of Lebanese
guerrillas fighting Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, the agency
reported.
	   Israeli troops and a pro-Israeli militia occupy a strip of
territory in southern Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks
on northern Israel. Syria stations about 30,000 troops in Lebanon.
	   Lebanon, which is technically at war with Israel, bans any
dealings with the Jewish state.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss police have broken up a
weapons-smuggling ring which was organizing arms shipments to
Serbia's Kosovo province, the federal prosecutor's office said
Thursday.
	   Six people _ four from the former Yugoslavia, a Swiss woman and
a citizen of an Arab country _ were arrested in central and eastern
Switzerland an operation starting Monday, according to a
prosecutor's statement. The arrests were accompanied by house
searches in several states.
	   Half a ton of ammunition, several weapons and 230,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 172,000) in cash were seized.
	   ``Immediately before the arrest of the main suspects, they were
negotiating a planned arms deal to the value of several million
U.S. dollars for the resistance movement (against Yugoslav
government forces) in Kosovo,'' the federal prosecutor's office
said.
	   Some weapons are thought to have already arrived at their
destination, it added. The arrests and seizures followed a summer
investigation into a number of Yugoslav citizens.
	   A Swiss police official will travel to Albania, where customs
officials seized two containers from Switzerland, in connection
with the investigation. The shipments contained ``modern weapons''
among other things.
	   The federal prosecutor's office declined to give further details
of the case.
	   Switzerland is home to a large community of ethnic Albanians
from Kosovo.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, the
Palestinian Authority on Thursday placed the leader of the Islamic
militant group Hamas under house arrest.
	   The decision came several hours after Hamas claimed
responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed an Israeli soldier
and threatened to undermine the new Mideast peace agreement.
	   In response to the attack, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
promised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would
crack down on the militants.
	   Palestinian policemen set up roadblocks around Sheik Ahmed
Yassin's home. Motorists were stopped and questioned. Policemen
opened trunks and aimed flashlights at passengers.
	   Journalists were told they could stick around for a few minutes
to take in the scene, but would then have to leave.
	   ``Sheik Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security
reasons,'' the Palestinian security services announced.
	   It marked Arafat's first open confrontation with the
quadriplegic Hamas leader, his strongest political rival.
	   In the past, the Palestinian leader has detained lower-level
Hamas officials from time to time. However, he never touched
Yassin, apparently because he wanted to avoid an open and possibly
bloody showdown with the militants.
	   A relative of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that
the Hamas leader had not been notified that he was barred from
leaving his home. The man said Yassin's first appointment outside
his home was Friday morning and that he had not planned to go out
before then.
	   Arafat also ordered the arrests of dozens of Hamas activists.
Two senior members, Mahmoud Zahar, and Ismail Hanieh, were among
those detained.

New German foreign minister to meet Polish leaders

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer on
Thursday assured Polish leaders that Germany's new government will
continue support for Poland's integration into the European Union
but did not name a date for it.
	   Fischer, on a half-day visit to Warsaw that ends his first
foreign trip since he was sworn-in on Tuesday, said it was in
Germany's ``highest interest to end the division of Europe.''
	   He visited Paris on Wednesday and held talks in London early
Thursday.
	   In Warsaw, Fischer said that the process of integration cannot
end on the former Iron Curtain line that used to divide western
Europe from the Warsaw Pact countries.
	   But he repeated an idea alarming to the Poles that ``realism is
needed in the vision of enlargement so that we don't get lost in
the individual interests,'' of member countries that are often
conflicting.
	   Such differences should be overcome, he said.
	   Fischer said it would be in Europe's interest if Poland joined
the EU during his four-year term. However, he jokingly added that
from his point of view it would be better if that happened during
his second term, suggesting he's already thinking of reelection.
	   Poland's Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said he was
reassured by the ``very good responses'' he heard from Fischer
about Poland's concerns and by his confirmation of Germany's
continuing support for Poland's future EU membership.
	   ``Germany is not a threat to Poland, to the contrary, Germany is
a chance for Poland,'' Geremek said.
	   Fisher's trip was aimed at reassuring European partners the new
German government will stress continuity.
	   Shortly after arriving Thursday afternoon, Fischer met Geremek
then Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and President Aleksander
Kwasniewski.
	   ``We are very happy that minister Fisher is coming to Warsaw at
the very start,'' of the new government, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Pawel Dobrowolski said.
	   He said Geremek, who has expressed reservations about the future
of Polish-German relations under the new Social Democratic-led
government, was looking forward to establishing a direct contact
with Fischer, a member of the junior partner Greens party in the
German coalition.
	   Apart from political meetings, German officials had requested
two additional points on the busy agenda. Fisher laid wreathes at
two World War II memorials in Warsaw commemorating the 1943 Jewish
Ghetto struggle and the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis.
	   He later said it was to show that Germany was taking the
responsibility for suffering during the war, though he said it did
not directly concern his generation.
	   The gesture was also seen as underlying Germany's continuing
commitment to forging a special bond with Poland. Having turned
France from foe to friend in the decades since World War II,
Germany has sought to repeat the process eastward with Poland since
the end of the Cold War.

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Mideast peace talks:
	   The fourth anniversary of the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan
and Israel today offers a chance to appraise the value of the
accord and measure the impact it has had on the peoples of the two
states.
	   After four years, many Jordanians still feel that the regional
peace process in general and Jordan's treaty with Israel in
specific have not yielded many of the benefits promised by these
undertakings, such as withdrawals from occupied Arab lands and the
economic peace dividends.
	   The popular Jordanian turn away from normalization with the
Jewish state since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
election in 1996 should come as no surprise to anyone.
	   The choice still remains: a cold peace or a functional and
active partnership with the Kingdom. Israel must make the decision
of whether to remain in its fortress or begin a new chapter in
relations with its neighbors.
	   This cannot happen without a fair and just settlement of the
Palestinian question as well as a resolution on the Lebanese and
Syrian peace tracks.
	   Unfortunately after four years, it seems that Israel has already
made its decision.

	   Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, Tupleo, Mississippi, on
murder of physician who performed abortions:
	   Zealotry can be a dangerous thing. It can even lead to murder,
as it did over the weekend in the case of Dr. Barnett Slepian, an
Amherst, New York, physician who performed abortions. ...
	   The anti-abortion zealot responsible for this heinous act could
certainly not be described as pro-life. Authorities believe the
murder is connected to three earlier shootings _ none fatal _
involving other doctors in New York state and across the border in
Canada who performed abortions.
	   If abortion is related to the dehumanizing violence of modern
culture, as pro-life forces believe, violence toward those who
perform abortions and those who undergo them _ even if the violence
in the latter case is mostly verbal _ only accelerates and
perpetuates the cycle. The murderers and clinic bombers, so sure
they are doing God's work, are in fact in the clutches of evil. ...
	   It will make none of the zealots in either camp happy, but the
best thing that could happen in the U.S. abortion debate is for
people of good will on both sides to forge a policy consensus.
Impossible? Only if the debate is left on the fringes.

	   The Hickory Daily Record, Hickory, North Carolina, on President
Clinton and military:
	   For employees, no dilemma is thornier than having a contemptible
boss. When that employee wears the uniform of the United States
Armed Forces, and his boss is the president, the dilemma becomes
even pricklier. In the military, disrespectful remarks about the
commander-in-chief not only can cost you your job, they can earn
you a year in the slammer.
	   That's the way it should be. Yet despite this clear rule,
revulsion over President Clinton among U.S. military personnel is
reaching a boiling point. Some of them have been unable to contain
their steam. While we share their disgust with Bill Clinton, we
admonish these servicemen to hold their fire. Clinton has set a bad
enough precedent; we don't need the military setting one of its
own. ...

	   Austin American-Statesman, Austin, Texas, on Texas nuclear waste
dump:
	   Will the decision not to locate a nuclear waste dump near the
West Texas border with Mexico prompt the Mexican government to
respond to entreaties to clean up border pollution?
	   It should. Although Mexico's semiofficial protest of the Sierra
Blanca nuclear waste dump wasn't the recorded reason for the permit
denial, it was no doubt a factor in a complicated decision. And it
should give Texas leverage in convincing Mexico to help further in
mitigating border pollution. ...
	   In denying the permit for a nuclear waste dump 20 miles (32
kilometers) from the Mexican border, the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission opened the door to better cooperation on
border pollution issues. Now is the time to urge Mexico to walk
through it and help clean up the mess on the border.

	   The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, on U.S. Embassy warnings in
Kenya:
	   The State Department's refusal to move the U.S. Embassy in Kenya
to a safer location was disquieting enough when it came to light
following the Aug. 7 terrorist bombings of the embassy there and in
Tanzania. ...
	   But as bad as the State Department decision already looked in
hindsight, a revelation this week makes it incomprehensible: U.S.
officials received a detailed, specific warning that a group was
planning to set off a truck bomb in the building's underground
parking garage. ...
	   The warning wasn't totally ignored. The Central Intelligence
Agency sent two reports to the State Department, which stepped up
security measures at the embassy for several weeks. ...
	   But when no bomb went off, even that limited response was ended.
Immediately after the bombing, the State Department described the
embassies as relatively low security risks and denied that any
specific threats were received. ...
	   CIA officials said they had to consider the possibility that the
warning was really a trick, a way to see how an embassy would
defend itself against an attack. ...
	   And more than 200 Kenyans and 12 Americans perished because of
it.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Orlando Sentinel, Orlando, Florida, on John Glenn:
	   If the United States had no need for heroes, for inspiring deeds
or for tapping more knowledge from the heavens, Sen. John Glenn
wouldn't be returning to space. But Mr. Glenn properly will embark
on his final trip to the last frontier next week because those
needs loom large.
	   There can never be enough heroic acts, enough events that send
spirits soaring or enough creative approaches to sharing the
benefits of space exploration.
	   As a younger astronaut, Mr. Glenn presented a role model of
stellar proportions for the youth of this nation. Today, as
America's oldest astronaut, he still wears that hero's mantle. The
youngsters of the early 1960s, of course, have reached middle age.
They, of course, will watch his space flight intently and likely
will bring their own children into the experience.
	   Older Americans, too, can draw inspiration from Mr. Glenn's
feat. Living longer and remaining active, they can hold up Mr.
Glenn as a senior who still has the right stuff. ... This time,
though, he won't rocket off alone, with limited knowledge, as he
did so long ago. He'll ride in the company of a space-shuttle crew,
astride a legacy of U.S. achievements in space that his mission
promises to enhance.

Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao reports stunning first-year attendance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ A year after opening, the ultra-modern
Guggenheim Museum that is Bilbao's pride and joy has given itself a
glowing report card.
	   Attendance for the first 12 months stood at 1.36 million people,
three times the originally forecast figure, the museum in this
gritty industrial city in Spain's Basque region said in a report.
	   So many people flocked to the futuristic structure on the banks
of the Nervion River that the first-year attendance goal was met in
just four months.
	   The museum, which opened Oct. 19 of last year, is now Spain's
most popular after El Prado in Madrid, the report said.
	   Designed by American architect Frank O. Gehry, the Guggenheim
houses work by artists such as Marc Chagall, Vasily Kandinsky and
Jean-Michel Basquiat.
	   The report said 84 percent of those who visited the museum came
to Bilbao just for that reason.
	   Visitors spent a total of 171 million dollars, either in the
museum itself or in Bilbao's restaurants, hotels and public
transportation.

	   BUBLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Their tractors and horse carts piled
high with belongings, a dozen ethnic Albanian families gathered in
a grassy field Thursday and prepared to journey home together after
weeks as refugees.
	   Then ethnic Albanian guerrillas showed up and warned them not to
go because Serb police were in the area, sparking an argument
during which a rebel drew his weapon.
	   Eventually, only one tractor set off down the dirt road, then
turned back a few kilometers (miles) later at the sight of army
vehicles.
	   This week's withdrawal of Serb police and Yugoslav soldiers from
Kosovo was supposed to allow the safe return of an estimated
300,000 refugees, particularly the 150,000 still in the restive
province.
	   But two days after news of the withdrawal spread, only small
numbers have gone back home. Few if any were seen going home
Thursday.
	   Those interviewed here and elsewhere cited the same reasons:
police or soldiers were still in the area, or their houses were
unlivable because of war damage.
	   ``The return is not as easy as was expected,'' said Jacques
Franquin of the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to pressure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
agree on Oct. 12 to reduce his forces in Kosovo to levels before he
launched a February crackdown on Albanian separatists.
	   The threat of airstrikes remains, though NATO this week lifted
its deadline for Milosevic to fully comply with the wide-ranging
agreement reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   International observers report large numbers of Serb police and
Yugoslav soldiers have returned to barracks or left Kosovo, and a
convoy of 15 tanks rumbled into the Pristina barracks on Thursday
from positions 15 kilometers (nine miles) west of the capital.
	   But police and soldiers still maintain a visible presence in
some areas. Police were checking vehicles Thursday on the main road
between Pristina and the western city of Pec. Three tanks and two
mortar launchers positioned outside Junik, near the mountain border
with Albania.
	   Refugees said the continued police presence shows the failure of
the Oct. 12 agreement.
	   ``I don't have anything to eat and my family is sleeping on the
floor but I can't go back because there are police just 200 meters
(yards) from my house,'' complained Cen Gashi, 58, a farmer and
father of 11 children living in the room of an acquaintance about
four kilometers (2.5 miles) from his village.
	   In a field at Bublje, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Pristina,
families with their mattresses, baby carriages, blankets, flour
sacks and other possessions loaded on carts waited to head home to
Perceva, just three kilometers (about two miles) away.
	   The arrival of four Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas, one in
his camouflage fatigues, sparked an uproar _ the guerrillas said
`don't go' and the men resisted turning back.
	   As the din increased, the KLA leader reached in his car to pull
out a wide-barreled, shoulder-held weapon that shut everyone up.
After a more subdued discussion, one of the farmers _ Hasan Gashi _
drove his green tractor hauling a full laden cart with his family
of 10 toward Perceva.
	   Halfway there, people on the road pointed out an army posting
near the town that included two armored vehicles and a small truck.
Gashi turned back.
	   ``We cannot spend our lives in other people's homes,'' Gashi
said as his wife and mother cried. ``But now I am going back.''
	   In Kodralji village, outside Decani in western Kosovo, a few
people who returned a week or two ago said no one else would come
back now because police continued to patrol. A few minutes later, a
blue armored police vehicle ambled down the dirt road toward the
village.
	   Since the withdrawal, land mines and booby traps set by Serb
forces have been tripped and reports of sporadic violence continue.
The Serb Media Center reported Thursday that two pro-Serb Albanians
had been killed by the guerrillas in separate incidents. There was
no way to independently verify the report.

Belarusian Holocaust survivors receive aid from Swiss fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Swiss humanitarian fund on Thursday
distributed the first batch of aid to needy Holocaust survivors in
this former Soviet republic.
	   The payments of dlrs 400 for each person _ a considerable amount
in Belarus _ were distributed by Swiss Fund for Needy Victims of
the Holocaust, which Switzerland established last year as a
goodwill gesture toward survivors around the world.
	   Rolf Bloch, the fund's president, said that the payments were
not meant as restitution.
	   ``We wanted to show that no one has been forgotten. And we want
to not only pay this aid, but talk with these people, find out how
they live,'' Bloch said, as the first payments were made at a bank
in the capital, Minsk.
	   ``Your sufferings are remembered in Switzerland, you must know
that,'' he said.
	   Several survivors cried and kissed Bloch, who also wiped away a
few tears. He also presented the Belarusian survivors with bars of
Swiss chocolate.
	   ``This event has made me remember the most bitter days of my
life, but it has also moved me by showing that somebody needs me,''
said 78-year-old Lydia Tokanko, a retiree whose monthly pension is
about 2 million Belarusian rubles (about dlrs 12 at the Belarusian
black-market rate).
	   Over the next few days, 841 Belarusian survivors will receive
the payments.
	   About 800,000 Jews died in Nazi camps in Belarus, about 200,000
of them Belarusian Jews. About 100,000 Jews live in Belarus now.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Facing a symbolically important
deadline, Northern Ireland's rival politicians argued behind closed
doors Thursday about why they had not yet formed a new
cross-community government.
	   But after seven hours of talks a fundamental gap remained
between Protestants and Catholics over how big a new cabinet-style
Executive administration for Northern Ireland should be _ and
whether the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party was entitled to a share of
power.
	   Thursday's inconclusive outcome at Stormont Parliament Building
in east Belfast ensured that one of the few deadlines contained in
April's peace accord would be missed.
	   It specified that the new Executive should hold an inaugural
summit with the Irish government by Oct. 31, but the Protestant
side refuses to appoint the full Executive, while the Catholic side
refuses to hold a summit without one.
	   David Trimble, chief representative of the north's British
Protestant majority and the designated figurehead of the new
government, says Protestants will not accept Sinn Fein in any new
government unless the Irish Republican Army starts disarming.
Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party also wants to restrict the
Executive to six additional posts.
	   Seamus Mallon, the moderate Catholic elected to lead the
government alongside Trimble, has refused to go along with
Trimble's argument that the two of them alone could represent the
otherwise unformed government at the first summit. Like Sinn Fein,
Mallon's Social Democratic and Labor Party wants the Executive to
have 10 more positions.
	   Trimble, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize this month with Mallon's
party leader John Hume, said Thursday's negotiations produced ``a
comparatively coherent list of issues ... that need to be
resolved.''
	   Mallon called the discussions ``a good day's work,'' but
rejected outright Trimble's view that the Executive should be
limited to eight positions including themselves.
	   Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin appeared downbeat
afterward, emphasizing that his party had pushed unsuccessfully for
another round of talks Friday. Instead, Trimble and Mallon plan to
shuttle Monday among parties _ including two hard-line Protestant
parties that refused to attend Thursday's session because Sinn Fein
was there.
	   On a visit to Scotland, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
downplayed fears that the peace process was facing a crisis.
	   ``The fact of the matter is that all aspects of the agreement
are positively moving forward,'' Ahern said. ``Maybe not at the
pace that we'd like every week, but they are positively moving
forward.''

Russian premier hails `breakthrough' in talks with Chechen leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `Arriving in ...,' to CORRECT that Primakov
spoke on departure, sted arrival. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov flew
Thursday to the Caucasus Mountains for an unexpected meeting with
the leader of breakaway Chechnya, and said the former enemies
achieved a ``breakthrough.''
	   ``We did everything to bring the positions of Russia and
Chechnya closer, so that we finally overturn a tragic page in our
relations,'' Primakov said after a two-hour meeting with Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov in the southern city of Vladikavkaz.
	   The trip hadn't been announced in advance, apparently for
security reasons.
	   Primakov said that the Russian government would provide funds to
restore the war-shattered Chechen economy and help Chechen
officials combat a wave of kidnappings and other crime that has
swept the region.
	   He stressed that joint anti-crime efforts would not involve the
deployment of Russian forces in Chechnya. ``That will never
happen,'' Primakov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Departing for Moscow, Primakov told the ITAR-Tass news agency
that he had telephoned President Boris Yeltsin, ``who heartily
approved the results. I emphasized that the matter in question is
serious, as it seems to me a breakthrough in our relations.''
	   Despite repeated pledges, Maskhadov has achieved little in
fighting crime, having encountered strong resistance from numerous
warlords who abhor any government control. Some of them have
recently joined forces in a bid to overthrow Maskhadov.
	   Some 2,000 heavily armed men gathered at a rally in the Chechen
capital of Grozny on Thursday, demanding that Maskhadov face trial
for alleged violations of the constitution.
	   Participants at the rally, which was led by former rebel leader
Shamil Basayev, also criticized Maskhadov for meeting with
Primakov.
	   Speaking to reporters in Vladikavkaz, Maskhadov said he still
has broad popular support. ``The Chechen people support their
president, and the fact that several people demand my resignation
is a normal situation for any country,'' he said.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
1994-96 war with Russia, but no country has recognized its
independence claim. Moscow insists the territory remains part of
Russia.
	   Maskhadov, who was the top rebel commander during the war, is a
staunch proponent of independence, but the Kremlin supports him,
hoping he can stabilize the region.
	   ``Stability in Chechnya is vital not only for its residents, but
all Russians,'' Primakov said.
	   ``Chechnya must not be viewed as a part of Russia, but as a
territory suffering from serious problems following a war,''
Maskhadov said. ``We must strengthen mutual understanding between
Russia and Chechnya and fulfill earlier agreements.''
	   Chechen law enforcement officials, meanwhile, are in the midst
of a crackdown on hostage-takers. At least 100 people, including
five foreigners, are believed to be held.
	   Police raided two criminal groups Thursday morning, releasing
five hostages and arresting 14 people, said Chechen Security
Minister Aslanbek Arsayev, according to Interfax.
	   During their meeting on Thursday, Primakov and Maskhadov also
decided to set up a panel to search for those missing after the
war.
	   According to the ITAR-Tass, Primakov on Thursday also met the
presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia and discussed a
permanent settlement to 1992 fighting between ethnic Ingush and
Ossetians.

Study finds shark cartilage worthless against cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2300 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Shark cartilage, often touted as a cancer cure,
has proved worthless in the first careful scientific study in
people with advanced tumors.
	   Doctors estimate that 50,000 U.S. cancer victims have tried
shark cartilage, either alone or with standard drugs.
	   This and dozens of other herbs and potions sold as dietary
supplements have proliferated since 1994, when Congress exempted
them from regulation by the Food and Drug Administration.
	   Recently, however, doctors have attempted to subject some of
these alternative therapies to the same rigorous testing that the
FDA demands of prescription drugs to make sure they are safe and
valuable.
	   The latest study, conducted and largely financed by the
independent Cancer Treatment Research Foundation in Arlington
Heights, Illinois, tested shark cartilage powder on terminally ill
cancer patients and found it did nothing to slow their disease or
improve their quality of life.
	   ``It doesn't work,'' said Dr. Denis R. Miller, who directed the
study.
	   The results were published in the November issue of the Journal
of Clinical Oncology.
	   The three-month study was conducted on 60 patients with cancer
of the brain, breast, lung, colon, prostate, bladder or lymph
system. In no case did patients' tumors go away or even shrink.
	   In 10 of the patients, tumors temporarily stopped growing for
periods ranging from three to 10 months. However, Miller said this
would be expected in any group of advanced cancer patients, even if
they got no treatment.
	   ``Shark cartilage by itself won't result in any measurable
clinical response,'' Miller said. ``It won't improve quality of
life. As a single agent, it has no role in treating cancer.''
	   Shark cartilage's wide use for cancer resulted in part from
William Lane's book ``Sharks Don't Get Cancer.'' Lane Labs, headed
by Lane's son Andrew, makes the BeneFin brand of shark cartilage.
	   ``We definitely have seen it work in some people with cancer.
There's no doubt about it,'' said Andrew Lane.
	   He criticized the study for taking people off treatment too soon
and for using what he considered to be an inferior brand of shark
cartilage. He said his company is sponsoring three new studies of
shark cartilage on 60 victims of brain and breast cancer.
	   Barrie Cassileth, a psychologist who wrote ``The Alternative
Medicine Handbook,'' said shark cartilage's popularity as a cancer
treatment has already peaked. But it remains widely used for joint
problems, against which it also has no proven benefits.
	   She said that while few doctors ever believed that it cured
cancer, ``the benefit of this article is that it documents for the
general public the uselessness of this over-the-counter food
supplement.''
	   Dr. Patricia Ganz of the University of California at Los Angeles
said she is glad to have clear data she can give to desperate
cancer patients who ask her about shark cartilage.
	   ``In advance disease, when the medical community says we don't
have much to offer you, people are looking for anything that will
give them hope,'' she said.

British government defends Pinochet arrest

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite the High Court's decision to throw out
arrest warrants against former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet and make Britain pay thousands for his legal costs,
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Thursday that Britain was not
embarrassed.
	   ``The Foreign Office has consistently taken the position that we
want to see due process of law carried out,'' Cook said, denying
Britain made a mistake by arresting Pinochet on Oct. 16 on Spanish
charges of murder, torture and kidnapping of political opponents
during his 17-year regime.
	   Lawyers for Pinochet pushed for immediate bail, with a hearing
expected to take place within the next few days.
	   Until then, the 82-year-old, who is recovering from back
surgery, will remain under police guard. British criminal lawyers
said it is rare for someone facing an extradition warrant to be
granted bail because they are considered a flight risk.
	   ``But Pinochet's case is unusual. He is a public figure, and
could not easily disappear,'' said criminal lawyer Richard Almond,
who specializes in extradition cases. ``I honestly can't guess what
will happen.''
	   If the magistrate does grant bail, a number of conditions could
be imposed, such as the payment of a large sum of cash and
guarantees that Pinochet remain in Britain, lawyer Mark Haslam
said.
	   But it is also possible Pinochet would be allowed to go home to
Chile if he promised to return to England as required, Almond said.
	   A Chilean military aircraft with medical personnel and equipment
remains on standby at a Royal Air Force base northwest of London to
take the general home if he is allowed to leave.
	   On Wednesday, the High Court overturned the Spanish arrest
warrants, which British police acted upon in detaining Pinochet. A
Spanish magistrate is seeking Pinochet's extradition.
	   The court ruled Pinochet could not be prosecuted for crimes
committed while in office, and that British courts don't have
jurisdiction to arrest a non-British citizen for crimes committed
in another country. The court also ordered the British government
to pay his legal costs of 350,000 pounds (dlrs 560,000).
	   But the judges ordered Pinochet to be held in custody until
prosecutors appeal the ruling. The appeal is expected to be filed
Monday to a five-judge panel in the House of Lords.
	   Meanwhile, Pinochet was moved Thursday from the London Clinic to
a private psychiatric hospital Thursday, which reports said could
provide better security for the general.
	   The name of the facility was not disclosed, but British TV
stations reported it to be the Grovelands Priory Hospital in north
London. Grovelands officials would not comment.
	   Also on Thursday, the Spanish National Court began considering
whether Spanish courts have jurisdiction over Pinochet's alleged
crimes. A decision is expected Friday.

Brazilian president battles to win support for austerity plan

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Belt-tightening, higher taxes,
recession _ the government's plan for fixing the economy was every
bit as harsh as Brazilians expected.
	   Now comes the hard part: Selling it.
	   With the strong mix of taxes and spending cuts unveiled
Wednesday, the government hopes to save nearly dlrs 24 billion in
1999 and reduce the huge budget deficit that has scared off
investors.
	   On Thursday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic team
set off to woo Congress. Finance Minister Pedro Malan and Central
Bank President Gustavo Franco presented the plan and took questions
from senators.
	   The support of Congress and state governors is essential to
implement many of the measures. But resistance promises to be
stiff, even among the government's allies.
	   That was clear from the reaction to a proposed increase in a tax
on all financial transactions _ from writing checks to buying
stocks _ to 0.38 percent from the current 0.2 percent.
	   ``I think it's too high,'' said Rep. Inocencio de Oliveira,
normally a staunch government supporter. ``If it were, say, 0.3
percent, that would be more palatable.''
	   Although the government has a majority in the 513-seat Chamber
of Deputies and the 81-seat Senate, it faces an uphill fight.
Changing the tax requires a three-fifths majority in two votes in
the Chamber and two more in the Senate. Debate starts Nov. 11, and
there's no telling when it will finish.
	   Another battle is shaping up over a proposal to raise the social
security tax on civil servants and for the first time collect it
from retired government workers.
	   Sen. Jader Barbalho warned that his Brazilian Democratic
Movement Party, which often sides with the government, will be
``alert for eventual negative social impacts'' and said the plan
will ``be carefully scrutinized.'' Observers read that as a sign of
possible trouble ahead.
	   Brazilian governors have tremendous influence over how their
congressmen vote _ and that's another problem. The government wants
to double the amount it now deducts from federal funds it legally
should give to the states and use it instead to cover shortfalls in
the budget. Governors were less than thrilled.
	   The task of convincing them got harder after last Sunday's
gubernatorial elections, when the opposition took important states
such as Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul.
	   On Thursday, six opposition governors met in Brasilia, the
capital, to discuss the plan. Anthony Garotinho, the populist
governor-elect of Rio, said he would oppose an idea of reducing the
payroll to save money.
	   ``The plan is totally unviable for Rio,'' he said. ``Rio doesn't
have too many civil servants _ it has too few.''
	   Former President Itamar Franco, governor-elect of powerful Minas
Gerais state, also lined up with the opposition camp. Although he
is Cardoso's former boss, Franco has been critical of his handling
of the economy, especially the idea that the economy will shrink 1
percent next year.
	   ``We can't accept this recessive discourse,'' said Franco. ``The
country won't resist the social crisis that will come with the
retraction of private industry.''

Guinea-Bissau leaders fly to Gambia for peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's president and a rebel
leader flew Thursday to nearby Gambia for their first face-to-face
talks on ending five months of fighting in their west African
country, news reports said.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Brig. Ansumane Mane flew some
200 kilometers (125 miles) to the Gambian capital Banjul for talks
scheduled to begin late Thursday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
said.
	   The conflict began June 7 when the rebels _ mostly army veterans
angered by poor pay and conditions _ seized the capital's army
garrison and airport.
	   This breakaway military faction has since accused Vieira of
corruption and abuse of power.
	   It was not clear what each side would be aiming for in the talks
in Gambia. But Lusa said the key issue would be withdrawal of
troops sent from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea to
back Vieira.
	   Vieira's spokesman Cipriano Cassama said he had no knowledge of
the meeting's agenda.
	   ``The President travels to Gambia as a head-of-state open to
national reconciliation,'' he said on Portuguese state radio Antena
1.
	   Rebel spokesman Zamora Induta told the same station that the
insurgents were not demanding Vieira's resignation.
	   ``What we want is for the President to be held responsible for
the crimes he's committed,'' Induta said, but he gave no details.
	   The army dissidents refused Wednesday to fly to Gambia, a thin
sliver of land surrounded on three sides by Senegal. They said it
was not safe to cross Senegal's air space. Guinea-Bissau is just
south of Senegal.
	   About half the impoverished country's population of 1 million
has been displaced by the fighting.
	   A cease-fire was declared July 26 but fighting broke out again
10 days ago.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A stain of Pablo Picasso's blood on a scrap of
paper, lovingly preserved by his companion for decades, and a
thank-you note to the artist from Sigmund Freud were among mementos
sold at auction Thursday.
	   The bloodstain was found among the possessions of Picasso's muse
for eight years, Dora Maar, upon her death last year at age 89.
Below the stain, she had scribbled: ``Blood of Picasso.''
	   It was sold along with four other small souvenirs for 20,000
francs (dlrs 3,590), on the final day of a three-day auction that
brought in 192 million francs altogether (dlrs 34.6 million.)
	   The printed note from Freud thanked Picasso for having taken
part in celebrations for his 80th birthday.
	   Picasso had passed the note on to Maar, with his own scribbled
message to her, beginning: ``Dora Mia.''
	   It sold for 102,000 francs (dlrs 18,312) _ 20 times the
estimated price. The highest sale of the day, though, had nothing
to do with Picasso _ it was an object created for Maar by the
Surrealist writer Andre Breton.

Brazilian austerity plan could have effect on Argentine economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Brazil's plans for solving its
financial woes will likely have a ripple effect of slower growth in
the Argentine economy over the coming year, economists here
predict.
	   The Brazilian program, unveiled Wednesday, is designed to save
that government nearly dlrs 24 billion next year and help it win a
rescue package of some dlrs 30 billion from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   But the more controversial proposals, including an unprecedented
tax on government pensions paid to retired civil servants, face an
uphill battle with Brazilian lawmakers.
	   About a third of Argentine exports are destined for Brazil,
meaning this country will feel the pinch as that country's economy
slows under austerity measures, the experts forecast.
	   Some said Argentine growth could be flat or the economy could
even shrink slightly in the coming year.
	   Manuel Solanet, head of local investment bank INFUPA SA, said
Argentine auto and commodity exports already are showing signs of
weakness, and aren't expected to improve anytime soon.
	   But he said Brazil's austerity measures could ultimately raise
investor confidence throughout the region if successful. ``The
confidence factor eventually will have a positive impact,'' he
predicted.

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Top seeds Nathalie Tauziat and Mary Pierce
remained on course for an all-French final at the dlrs 164,250 Seat
Luxembourg Open after both won their quarterfinals in straight sets
Thursday.
	   Top-seeded Tauziat, who reached the Wimbledon final this year,
had little trouble is disposing of Germany's Anke Hueber, the No. 6
seed, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Mary Pierce, coming off a tournament win in Moscow, swept past
fifth-seeded Ai Sugiyama 6-3, 6-2. Pierce, ranked 11th in the
world, will face Elena Likhovtseva in Friday's semifinal.
	   In an all Russian quarterfinal, Likhovtseva, 27 in the WTA
rankings, showed no mercy for Evgenia Koulikovskaya, 6-2, 6-0.
	   The No. 3 seed Irina Spirlea of Romania became the biggest
victim so far in the tournament. She went down to Silvia Farina in
a marathon match. The Italian, No. 24 in the world, won 6-4, 4-6,
6-3 to force a semifinal against Tauziat, ranked 17 places ahead of
her.

Crash probe finding prompts Swissair to switch off entertainment

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with background on entertainment system,
comment from U.S. aviation agency; New for some lines &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Crash investigators said Thursday that wiring
from an advanced entertainment system aboard Swissair Flight 111
showed signs of significant heat damage, prompting the airline to
switch off the system on other planes.
	   Swissair acted voluntarily after investigators from Canada's
Transportation Safety Board detected signs of heat damage on wiring
and other debris from the ceiling around the cockpit of the MD-11
plane, which crashed Sept. 2 off the coast of Nova Scotia.
	   The safety board said its investigators were not yet able to
tell if any of the material they had found was the source of the
heat.
	   The ``Interactive Flight Entertainment Network'' in first and
business class will be disconnected from a power supply network
that is routed through the cockpit, Philippe Bruggisser, chief
executive of Swissair parent SAirGroup, told a news conference in
Zurich.
	   The measure, which Bruggisser stressed was purely precautionary,
was taken in agreement with manufacturer Boeing and U.S. and Swiss
aviation authorities.
	   The entertainment system, which includes a choice of movies and
games, is available on individual video screens that pop out of the
armrests of all first and business class seats. The precautionary
measure is being applied to three Swissair Boeing 747s as well as
to its 15 remaining MD-11s.
	   Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said the systems will be
switched off immediately. However, they will only be mechanically
disconnected when each of the planes are next serviced at Zurich.
	   ``The system, which is certified by the Federal Aviation
Administration, has not been identified as a cause of the
accident,'' a Swissair statement said.
	   Standard video and audio entertainment system are unaffected, it
added.
	   The crash killed all 229 people aboard the New York-to-Geneva
flight. Sixteen minutes before the crash, the pilots detected smoke
in the cockpit.
	   Canadian officials said earlier this week that about 60 percent
of the plane has now been retrieved from the Atlantic Ocean floor.
But they said it could take up to two more years to complete their
investigation.
	   The entertainment systems being switched off by Swissair were
not the original systems installed in the aircraft by McDonnell
Douglas and Boeing. Officials said the factory-installed system
aboard Flight 111 and the other 18 Swissair planes were replaced
with the advanced system designed by Interactive Flight
Technologies Inc. of Phoenix, Arizona.
	   IFT spokeswoman Marchea Malone said Swissair is the only
customer for those systems.
	   In Washington, FAA spokesman Les Dorr said the agency endorsed
Swissair's decision to disconnect the system.
	   ``It is a positive step that we think will eliminate any
potential safety concerns about that system while the investigation
continues.'' he said.
	   Dorr said the FAA and Swissair have been examining other planes
in the wake of the crash but thus far have found no safety
problems.

Zhirinovsky to take aid to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, freshly
returned from a trip to Taiwan that rattled Russia's relations with
China, announced plans Thursday to go to Iraq with a shipment of
humanitarian aid.
	   It would be Zhirinovsky's second such trip to Baghdad this year.
On an earlier trip, in February, he offered to stay as a ``human
shield'' against potential U.S. attacks, an offer that was
apparently spurned.
	   Last week, Zhirinovsky infuriated Chinese officials when he
visited Taiwan and invited President Lee Teng-hui to visit Moscow.
China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to
international recognition.
	   Top Russian officials quickly reassured Chinese leaders that
Zhirinovsky was acting as a private citizen and did not reflect the
views of the Russian government.
	   Zhirinovsky intends to leave for Iraq on Saturday along with a
fellow member of the Russian parliament, Mikhail Gutseriyev,
Interfax reported. They say they will bring medicine and school
stationery for Iraq, which remains under U.N. sanctions.
	   Once considered a strong contender for Russian leadership,
Zhirinovsky is now known as much for his attention-getting antics
as for his politics.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Ignatz Bubis, the chairman of Germany's
Central Council of Jews, told Muslim representatives at a
conference in Bonn Thursday they must better inform the public on
their religion to break down prejudices in Germany.
	   Bubis, speaking to the Islamic Council for the Federal Republic
of Germany, said that Germans know more about the Jewish beliefs of
some 75,000 people in Germany than they do about 2.5 million
Muslims living in the country.
	   Informing the public about Islamic beliefs would create more
understanding and help eliminate prejudice between Muslims,
Christians and Jews, Bubis said.
	   But he admitted the goal of working for more understanding was a
difficult one, citing the decades it took before Roman Catholics
and Lutherans, the dominant religions in Germany, conducted joint
religious services. A common practice today.
	   Such a move would be difficult even for the Jews, Bubis said.
Adding that he as a liberal Jew has no reservations about contact
with other beliefs, but that of the 18 rabbis in Germany, he
estimated only three would be willing to hold joint services with
another religion.
	   The Islamic Council in Germany was founded in 1986 to coordinate
the interests of Muslims in the country and promote multicultural
understanding.
	   About 7 million foreigners live in Germany, which has a
population of about 83 million.

Soldier killed by suicide bomber was teen-age immigrant to Israel

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The day before he died, nineteen-year-old Sgt.
Alexei Neykov phoned home to tell his mother he'd be home for a
visit soon.
	   Neykov was killed Thursday when the military jeep he was riding
in swerved into the path of a car whose Palestinian driver was
trying to ram a school bus full of elementary-school pupils from a
Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip.
	   His mther, Clara Neykov wept she told Israel radio that her son
had told her in their last telephone talk that he liked army life
and was happy serving in the field engineer corps.
	   Neykov, from the Ukraine, had immigrated to Israel only two
years ago under a special program to bring young people to the
country. His parents and younger brother followed about a year
later.
	   They settled in the port city of Haifa, where Neykov graduated
from high school and intended to go to college _ at the Technion,
Israel's MIT, where he wanted to study aeronautics.
	   Instead, Haifa is where the funeral will be held Friday.
	   His cousin, Oleg, described Neykov as fearless and stubborn. His
18-year-old brother is to enlist in the army soon.
	   Neykov was to be buried with full military honors. His commander
said the soldiers in the jeep acted without hesitation when the
school bus was in danger.
	   Neykov, seated in the open back, was killed instantly when the
jeep cut off the car before it could ram the bus, and its driver
detonated a payload of explosives.
	   ``It is clear that the jeep took the main force of the
explosion,'' said Maj. Gen. Yom Tov Samia, the head of the army's
southern command. Without the action of the soldiers in the jeep,
he said, ``the bus would have been very badly hit.''

Utility worker seventh to die while restoring power in Puerto Rico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A 53-year-old linesman became the
seventh state utility worker to die of injuries sustained while
restoring power lines downed by Hurricane Georges, Puerto Rico's
electricity company said Thursday.
	   Adail Dominguez Sierra fell 15 feet (5 meters) Saturday while
cutting branches off a tree that had downed lines in the
east-central town of Aguas Buenas, said company spokesman Freddie
Marrero. A 27-year employee, Dominguez Sierra died at a San Juan
hospital late Tuesday.
	   Seven utility workers have been electrocuted or suffered fatal
injuries while repairing power lines downed by Hurricane Georges,
which knocked out all power on the island of nearly 4 million
people Sept. 21.
	   Service this week has been restored to about 90 percent of the
utility's customers island-wide. Union leaders have denounced
alleged pressure from the government to restore power as quickly as
possible, saying it poses unnecessary dangers to utility crews.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A hijacker commandeered a Turkish Airlines
flight Thursday with 34 passengers on board, Turkey's Anatolia news
agency reported.
	   The hijacker ordered the plane diverted to the Bulgarian capital

	   There was no immediate information on whether the hijacker was
armed.
	   The flight took off from the southern city of Adana and was on
its way to Ankara, Turkey's capital.
	   At late evening it was circling the Ankara airport, Anatolia
said. Security was been tightened at the airport.
	   Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this year,
each time with no real weapons and with no injuries. The latest was
in September, when a man with a toy gun commandeered a domestic
flight to protest government restrictions on Islam.

	   MT. ZVIJEZDA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The frontline, the
people and the hatreds are the same as during the Bosnian war. Only
now, the weapons are axes and clubs instead of rifles. And the
clash, which has drawn the attention of international peacekeepers,
is over a rare export product _ timber.
	   Before the Bosnian war began in 1992, Croat and Muslim timbermen
all worked for the same company, harvesting timber on this central
Bosnian mountain near the town of Vares.
	   Like almost everything else in this country, the company split
during the war along ethnic lines. About 40 Croat woodcutters now
work for a Croat company, 170 Muslims for a Muslim-run firm.
	   Since the war ended in 1995, the two companies recognized the
old wartime frontline. Each harvested timber on its own side of the
line.
	   Last week, however, Muslim woodcutters say the Croats encroached
on their portion of the forest. The Muslims, suspecting the Croats
have depleted their own timber supply, mobilized right away,
chasing away the intruders with clubs and axes.
	   The Croats returned a second time, only to be driven off again.
Now, a yellow truck blocks the only road to the nearby village
preventing the Croats to transport timber from the contested area.
	   The dispute prompted American troops of the NATO-led
peacekeeping force to begin regular patrols in the area on Monday.
That has prevented any new flareups, but resentment remains.
	   ``I also have to work. It is the only way for my family to
survive,'' said Anto Knezevic, 56, a Croat who has been a
woodcutter for 32 years. His monthly 600 German marks (dlrs 353) is
the only income for his seven member-family.
	   One of Knezevic's fellow Croats, unwilling to give his name,
said he was willing to take up arms to defend what he considers the
Croats' right to cut timber where they want.
	   The dispute on this mountain is a small part of the pattern of
ethnic hatred that remains in this country three years after the
Dayton peace agreement ended fighting.
	   Despite international efforts to encourage reconciliation, each
of the three communities _ Croat, Serb and Muslim _ flies its own
flag. The weak central government barely functions and is incapable
of regulating timber cutting or resolving the dispute here.
	   Like most poor countries, Bosnia relies on natural resources
such as timber for most of its exports. The unemployment rate here
is 70 percent. Some officials have expressed concern about the
rapid disappearance of Bosnia's forests.
	   For others, however, timber means life. Even after working
hours, both Muslim and Croat woodcutters usually stay on in the
forest to cut wood for cooking, heating and for sale at 110 German
Marks (dlrs 64) per cubic meter.
	   ``This is the only job I know how to do,'' said Esmir Bajric, a
27-year-old Muslim cutter. ``Where would I go? I don't have a
single German mark to pay a ticket for a local bus.''

Guinea-Bissau leaders fly to Gambia for peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's president and a rebel
leader flew Thursday to nearby Gambia for their first face-to-face
talks on ending five months of fighting in their west African
country, news reports said.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Brig. Ansumane Mane flew some
200 kilometers (125 miles) to the Gambian capital Banjul for talks
scheduled to begin late Thursday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
said.
	   The conflict began June 7 when the rebels _ mostly army veterans
angered by poor pay and conditions _ seized the capital's army
garrison and airport.
	   This breakaway military faction has since accused Vieira of
corruption and abuse of power.
	   It was not clear what each side would be aiming for in the talks
in Gambia. But Lusa said the key issue would be withdrawal of
troops sent from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea to
back Vieira.
	   Vieira's spokesman Cipriano Cassama said he had no knowledge of
the meeting's agenda.
	   ``The President travels to Gambia as a head-of-state open to
national reconciliation,'' he said on Portuguese state radio Antena
1.
	   Rebel spokesman Zamora Induta told the same station that the
insurgents were not demanding Vieira's resignation.
	   ``What we want is for the President to be held responsible for
the crimes he's committed,'' Induta said, but he gave no details.
	   The army dissidents refused Wednesday to fly to Gambia, a thin
sliver of land surrounded on three sides by Senegal. They said it
was not safe to cross Senegal's air space. Guinea-Bissau is just
south of Senegal.
	   About half the impoverished country's population of 1 million
has been displaced by the fighting.
	   A cease-fire was declared July 26 but fighting broke out again
10 days ago.

Italian volleyball stars indicted for alleged tax evasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Former volleyball stars Andrea Lucchetta and
Andrea Zorzi have been indicted on tax evasion counts in an ongoing
investigation into teams sponsored by Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest
media group, Italy's ANSA news agency reported Thursday.
	   Giancarlo Foscale, former managing director of Fininvest, also
was indicted in the case involving 10 players of the now-dissolved
Mediolanum Gonzaga volleyball team, the news agency said.
	   Tax police allege that Lucchetta and Zorzi, two of the most
popular Italian volleyball players, now retired, failed to pay
about two billion lire (dlrs 1.2 million) in taxes between 1992 and
1993 on contract money paid by their club on Swiss-based accounts.
	   Mediolanum Gonzaga was one of several sports groups sponsored by
Fininvest, including soccer, rugby, basketball and ice hockey
teams.
	   Fininvest and Berlusconi, a former premier who now leads Italy's
right-wing opposition, have been the subject of repeated
investigations by Milan judges in tax-related cases.

Criminal charges brought against independent radio director
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with media officials to have their passports
impounded, international media group protesting crackdown, Cekic's
reaction. Adds byline.
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The director of an independent
Belgrade radio station said Thursday he has been charged with
violating a government ban by broadcasting without a license.
	   The charges against Nenad Cekic, director of the small but
influential Radio Index, are the latest move in a crackdown on
independent media by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
government.
	   If found guilty, Cekic could be sentenced to up to eight years
in jail. His radio, often critical of Milosevic's hard-line
policies, was banned on Oct. 8 for not having a broadcast license.
	   Radio Index and other independent broadcasters have been denied
licenses for years, opening the way for the government to shut them
down when their broadcasts become critical of authorities.
	   Defying the ban, Radio Index continued its one-hour daily
broadcast over the airwaves of another popular independent Belgrade
radio station, B 92.
	   Cekic said Thursday that the Serb authorities ``Have gone a step
further ... threatening journalists with jail terms.''
	   Last week, the parliament in Serbia, Yugoslavia's most powerful
republic, passed a new media law severely restricting press freedom
and instituting heavy fines for media publishing or broadcasting
stories they deemed ``anti-patriotic'' and ``anti-government''.
	   The law was passed amid widespread anti-Western sentiment fueled
by NATO threats to launch airstrikes to end the crisis in Kosovo.
Ethnic Albanian secessionists have been battling Yugoslav troops in
the southern Serbian province.
	   Four major independent Belgrade newspapers have stopped
publishing out of fear of huge fines.
	   Over the weekend, a Belgrade court fined the Evropljanin weekly
dlrs 246,000 for publishing articles that criticized Milosevic. The
court ordered three top employees of the weekly to pay a third of
their salaries to the state each month, until the fine was settled.
	   Slavko Curuvija, the owner of Evropljanin, said Thursday that
the authorities have threatened to impound his passport, as well as
those from the weekly's editor-in-chief and the technical director.
	   In a protest letter sent Thursday to Milosevic, the World
Association of Newspapers said the new media law ``makes free
expression a crime and contravenes international human rights
conventions.''
	   The letter called on Milosevic to ensure the law is repealed and
all convictions under it overturned.
	   The Paris-based group defends press freedom.

Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao reports stunning first-year attendance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ A year after opening, the ultra-modern
Guggenheim Museum that is Bilbao's pride and joy has given itself a
glowing report card.
	   Attendance for the first 12 months stood at 1.36 million people,
three times the forecast figure, said a report from the museum in
the gritty industrial city of Bilbao, in Spain's Basque region.
	   So many people flocked to the futuristic structure on the bank
of the Nervion River that the first-year attendance goal was met in
just four months.
	   The museum, which opened Oct. 19, 1997, is now Spain's most
popular after The Prado in Madrid, the report said.
	   The museum, designed by American architect Frank O. Gehry,
houses work by artists including Marc Chagall, Vasily Kandinsky and
Jean-Michel Basquiat.
	   The report said 84 percent of those who visited the museum came
to Bilbao just for that reason.
	   Visitors spent a total of 171 million dollars, either in the
museum itself or on Bilbao's restaurants, hotels and public
transportation.

One dead, one injured in latest attack in Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Eight unidentified gunmen shot and killed one
Abkhazian policeman and seriously wounded another Thursday in the
latest outburst of violence in the breakaway Georgian region, a
news agency said.
	   The attack occurred in the Abkhazian village of Nabakevi, near
the Georgian border, ITAR-Tass said. It took place as Georgian and
Abkhazian officials were meeting under U.N. auspices for settlement
talks.
	   The Abkhazian Interior Ministry blamed the attack on ``Georgia's
authorities and `power structures' who violate earlier cease-fire
agreements in the security zone of the Ghali District,'' ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Georgia lost Abkhazia, a region on the Black Sea, to
secessionist forces in 1993 after 13 months of fighting. About
250,000 Georgians were forced to flee their homes.
	   Russian peacekeepers have kept the two sides apart since June
1994, enforcing the Ghali security zone between Abkhazia and the
rest of Georgia. But peacekeepers have been unable to stem the
frequent outbursts of violence that continue to plague the region.

Adult brains can grow new cells, raising hopes for repair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have shown for the first time that
adults grow new brain cells, even in their 60s and 70s.
	   Up to now, it was generally believed that once you lost brain
cells as an adult, they were gone forever. The finding raises a
distant hope for treating brain diseases or damage by getting the
brain to fix its broken circuitry.
	   The new neurons, or nerve cells that form circuits, were found
in just one small part of the brain _ the hippocampus, a deep-brain
structure that's important for learning and memory. And it's not
yet clear whether the new brain cells actually function, or what
they do.
	   Still, the discovery contradicts the traditional wisdom that
adult human brains do not make new neurons, even though that
ability had been identified in rat brains some 30 years ago.
	   ``It's not providing an answer or a cure at this point in time
for any particular disorder, but it's a very exciting discovery,''
said Dr. Ira Black, head of neuroscience and cell biology at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, New Jersey.
	   The big question is whether scientists can find ways to make new
brain cells appear in the right places to overcome damage from
strokes, brain injuries and such diseases as Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's. Right now, for example, the new neurons are in the
wrong place to replace brain cells lost to heavy drinking.
	   Lots of people think they also lose brain cells just by getting
older, but it's not clear whether that's true.
	   The new finding is reported in the November issue of the journal
Nature Medicine by Fred Gage of the Salk Institute for Biological
Studies in La Jolla, California, and Peter Eriksson and colleagues
at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden.
	   For the study, they examined autopsy specimens from people who
had been given a drug called BrdU because of cancer in their mouths
or throats. BrdU is taken up by dividing cells; doctors had
administered it to see how rapidly the patients' tumors were
growing.
	   But the drug also spreads through the body, including the brain.
The researchers reasoned that if cells in the brain were dividing
to spawn new cells, they would take up BrdU, and the substance
would be present in the new cells.
	   In hippocampus samples from all five patients, the researchers
did, in fact, find neurons containing BrdU.
	   Two of the patients were in their 50s, two were in their 60s,
and one was 72 when the cells were produced.
	   The brain makes neurons during its early development, of course,
and ``what we're saying is the same programs that are present
during development are persisting throughout life,'' Gage said.
``Things we thought were ending are not ending, they're just
continuing at a slower rate.''

Serbian deputy premier vows to fight ``terrorism''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's deputy premier vowed
Thursday to continue the government's fight against ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo despite the withdrawal of Serbian security forces.
	   Vojislav Seselj said the substantial police pullout from Kosovo,
as demanded by NATO, did not mean Serbia would give up its struggle
against ``terrorism.''
	   ``All armed terrorists will be disarmed and brought to
justice,'' said Seselj, according to the Fonet news agency. ``The
withdrawal of police from Kosovo does not mean the end of (our)
fight against terrorism.''
	   Serbian officials refer to ethnic Albanian rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army as ``terrorists.''
	   Also Thursday, Ivica Dacic, a spokesman for President Slobodan
Milosevic's ruling Socialists, said Serbia and Yugoslavia would
``defend themselves as they have done so far.''
	   He said ``terrorism has been defeated,'' and only additional
police brought into the province to fight the rebels were
withdrawing. Dacic ruled out the possibility that the KLA be
included in any negotiations on the future of Kosovo.

Impressionist gallery reopens to public on Friday

	   LONDON (AP) _ Suzon is back and ready with her champagne
bottles, liqueurs and oranges.
	   The woman in a black velvet bodice, whom artist Edouard Manet
immortalized in his 1882 masterpiece, ``A Bar at the
Folies-Bergere,'' has been away for a year while her home was
overhauled.
	   But on Friday, visitors may again gaze at Suzon and one of the
world's best collections of art by impressionists and their
successors when the Courtauld Gallery reopens to the public.
	   The gallery at Somerset House in London's Strand has undergone a
3 million pounds (dlrs 5 million) restoration. The walls were
freshly painted, new lighting put up and air conditioning
installed.
	   ``For the first time you can feel the flow of fresh air. It's
clean and better for the art and the visitors and we should catch
every bit of grit trying to come in from the Strand,'' said
director John Murdoch.
	   The gallery was founded on the bequest of textile magnate Samuel
Courtauld who began buying modern art before World War I. In 1931,
he founded the Courtauld Institute of Art, the first establishment
in Britain to teach art history.
	   The entire collection, which spans 800 years of European art,
might be valued at 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.6 billion) but
Elizabeth Foy, head of public affairs, remarked, ``Things that
aren't going to be sold have no value.''
	   Among the famous pictures in the gallery are Vincent Van Gogh's
self-portrait with bandaged ear, Pierre-Auguste Renoir's box at the
theater, Edgar Degas's dancers and a nude bather. There are also
works by Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, Georges
Seurat, Paul Signac, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Edouard Vuillard
and Amedeo Modigliani.
	   About half of the 530 paintings and a handful of the 7,000
drawings and 27,000 prints are on display at a time.
	   As part of the relaunch, there's an exquisite small show of
drawings by such giants as Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Watteau,
Constable and Picassso to demonstrate how artists used ink,
charcoal, graphite, chalks, pastels, watercolor and pens made from
reeds, quills and steel.
	   Admission is 4 pounds (dlrs 6.48) to visit but Mondays are free
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. (1000 to 1400 GMT).

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A hijacker allegedly armed with a bomb
commandeered a Turkish Airlines flight Thursday with 34 passengers
on board, Turkey's Anatolia news agency said.
	   The hijacker ordered the plane diverted to Lausanne,
Switzerland. According to Anatolia, the pilot misled the hijacker
into thinking the plane was landing at the Bulgarian capital of
Sofia, apparently for refueling, but landed at Ankara's airport
instead.
	   Security was immediately tightened there.
	   The flight had taken off from the southern city of Adana bound
for Ankara, Turkey's capital.
	   The passengers were predominantly Turkish; there were no
foreign-sounding names on the passenger list released by the
airline.
	   Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this year,
each time with no real weapons and with no injuries. The latest was
in September, when a man with a toy gun commandeered a domestic
flight to protest government restrictions on Islam.

Lebanon accuses Israel of stealing Lebanese soil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ After accusing Israel of taking its water
and using south Lebanon to test missiles, Lebanon is now accusing
the Jewish state of stealing its soil.
	   Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri sent letters to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Arab League Secretary-General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Thursday urging them to intervene to stop
Israel from allegedly stealing top soil from southern Lebanon.
	   The Beirut newspaper The Daily Star reported Monday that Israeli
trucks were carrying soil from the al-Marj area in the
Israeli-occupied zone to northern Israel. Israeli troops and an
allied militia occupy a strip of south Lebanon as a buffer against
guerrilla attacks.
	   ``It was confirmed to us recently that Israel is systematically
scooping hundreds of tons of soil from al-Marj ... and transporting
it to the northern Galilee for its farming needs,'' Berri wrote in
his letter, which was published by the official National News
Agency on Thursday.
	   Berri said the soil operation, which began two weeks ago, was
``a violation of all international laws and regulations.''
	   The Daily Star published a photograph of what it said were two
Israeli trucks being loaded with top soil in al-Marj. The Lebanese
soil is said to be richer than northern Israel's as the farmland of
south Lebanon is little cultivated owing to the conflict between
Israeli and guerrilla forces.
	   There was no immediate response to the allegation from the
Israeli military.
	   Lebanon has for years accused Israel of diverting water from the
Wazzani river which flows close to the Israeli-Lebanese border.
Government officials have alleged Israel is pumping water from the
Wazzani through underground pipes. Israel has denied the charge.
	   In August, Lebanon accused Israel of testing a guided anti-tank
missile in South Lebanon. The missile was believed to be the NT-D
Dandy, which is manufactured by Israel's state armaments company.

U.N. Security Council decides to maintain sanctions against Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council decided Thursday
to maintain sanctions on Libya, reiterating that they will be
suspended only after Libya turns over two suspects in the fatal
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
	   The council called on the Libyan government to hand over the two
intelligence agents for trial in the Netherlands ``as soon as
possible,'' noting that the 10th anniversary of the crash of the
Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland falls on Dec. 21.
	   The Security Council decision, made after a periodic review, was
a setback for Libya, which has been pushing to have the
six-year-old sanctions lifted immediately.
	   The council voted on Aug. 27 to suspend sanctions when the two
intelligence agents are handed over for trial. It also threatened
additional measures against Libya if the suspects fail to appear
for trial before a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish
law.
	   The two suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb aboard the flight, which
exploded on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   The council has not set any target date for Libya to hand over
the suspects before it considers further sanctions.
	   But Britain and the United States, which agreed to hold a trial
in the Netherlands in hopes of finally resolving the case, are
pressing for a speedy response.
	   U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh and British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock said they want to see the two suspects delivered for
trial well before the Dec. 21 anniversary.
	   Col. Moammar Gadhafi has said his government has ``no
objection'' to holding a trial in the Netherlands, but Libya has
been seeking clarification of the U.S.-British offer to hold the
trial in a third country.
	   Greenstock, speaking as the current council president, said
council members welcomed the fact that Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's legal team was providing clarifications of trial procedures
to the Libyans.
	   ``Council members were encouraged by the relatively positive
trend of those developments,'' he said.
	   Speaking in his role as Britain's ambassador, Greenstock said
London and Washington had been providing ``very full and detailed
clarifications to all the Libyan requests for information''
	   He said the two suspects ``should have no fears about their
rights in the trial process, about their rights if they are
convicted of serving a sentence in the Scottish system.''
	   ``We've provided, for instance, reassurance to the Libyan
authorities that all religious, dietary and health requests would
be met. There would be visits by clerics or family members,''
Greenstock said.
	   Responding to Libyan concerns about the base chosen by the Dutch
to hold the trial, he said it was a purely Dutch facility _ not an
air base _ and had the best physical arrangements available for a
trial including a hospital. The U.S. Air Force used the base from
1954 to 1993.
	   Before the vote, the Libyan Foreign Ministry accused the United
States and Britain of threatening tighter sanctions while Libya was
still seeking clarifications.
	   Libya is still awaiting ``all required answers'' and ``does not
accept any claim that it is procrastinating to mark time, as
alleged by the other parties,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement released by Libya's U.N. Mission.
	   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the United States wants an official reaction from Libya to the Aug.
27 resolution in the near future.
	   ``The deep question here is whether these questions that the
Libyans are raising now are real _ in the sense that they are of
important substance _ or whether they are delaying,'' the official
said.
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 to push Libya to surrender
the suspects. The measures ban air travel to and from the country,
prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of
oil equipment.

we're stealing the air.''

 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Premier Costas Simitis on Thursday carried
out an essentially cosmetic reshuffle of his Socialist government,
but for the first time sought to reinforce his party leadership by
asking for a parliamentary vote of confidence.
	   ``It is self-evident what a vote of confidence means,'' said
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas after announcing the
reshuffle.
	   Debate will start Sunday and the confidence vote is expected
midnight Tuesday. He needs a simple majority, with at least 120
deputies present in the 300-member unicameral parliament.
	   By asking for the vote, his first since coming to power in 1996,
Simitis sent a clear message that he is ready to fight and win a
full-fledged battle against dissenters.
	   Many socialist deputies have spoken out against economic
austerity measures designed to earn the European Union's poorest
country a spot in the bloc's single currency group.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU which failed to
qualify for the first round of European Monetary Union. Britain,
Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining.
	   The vote will also reinforce Simitis before he submits another
austerity budget next month. But at the same time, his call
included a veiled threat of early elections should any of the 160
socialist deputies vote against the government.
	   ``The government enjoys the confidence of parliament only if in
that vote it wins the absolute majority of the total number of
deputies. This is the position of the prime minister and of the
government,'' Reppas said.
	   New Democracy, the main opposition conservative party, said the
vote was ``a sign of panic.''
	   With his first reshuffle and the vote, Simitis was admitting
that his government emerged weakened from local elections two weeks
ago. New Democracy gained ground in a vote that was widely
interpreted as a referendum on government policies.
	   The results were seen as reflecting disenchantment with
government austerity and anger that Simitis appears to have done
little on such high profile issues as crime fighting and police
corruption.
	   Simitis sought to improve his administration's image by ousting
controversial Public Order Minister Giorgos Romaios, a respected
journalist who failed to cope with a series of police foul-ups.
	   In recent weeks police have been charged with everything from
taking part in bank robberies to supplying prostitution rackets
with women from eastern Europe.
	   Last month, the police chief resigned and two top officers were
replaced after a botched raid to arrest an escaped convict holding
a family hostage. A young female hostage died, while the fugitive
died in prison custody under mysterious circumstances.
	   Simitis also issued marching orders to Agriculture Minister
Stefanos Tzoumakas, criticized for failing to organize efforts to
extinguish more than 3,000 wildfires that wreaked havoc around the
country this past summer.
	   In another move, Simitis also set up a new cabinet position,
appointing Health Minister Costas Geitonas to the post of minister
to the premier's office. Undersecretary of the Interior Lambros
Papadimas took over the health post.

Sampras wins, Agassi stopped, Ivanisevic ousts Becker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rafter losing &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras made sure of extending
his No. 1 reign for at least another week by beating Bohdan
Ulihrach 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the
dlrs 2.45 Eurocard Open.
	   Had he lost, Sampras could have lost the top spot to either No.
2 Marcelo Rios or No. 3 Patrick Rafter.
	   But Sampras needed just under an hour to beat Ulihrach, who had
won two of their three previous matches. The victory assured
Sampras of remaining No. 1 when the new rankings come out Monday.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1
for six years in a row.
	   ``It's a record that might not ever be broken. It is that hard
to do,'' Sampras said. ``I feel like I am on a good road.''
	   Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open champion, lost some ground when
he was beaten by Greg Rusedski. Rusedski won 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (5-7),
6-4.
	   The battle for No. 1 is unlikely to be settled before the
season-ending World Championship in Hanover, Germany, next month.
	   Richard Krajicek stopped Andre Agassi's recent roll when he
upset the American 6-3, 6-4.
	   In a showdown between two former Wimbledon champions, Krajicek
used his serve-and-volley game to overpower Agassi and reach the
quarterfinals.
	   Tenth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov also advanced by beating Todd
Martin 6-4, 7-5, and Jan-Michael Gambill upset ninth-seeded Tim
Henman 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Goran Ivanisevic, seeded 14th, ended the run of Boris Becker,
the crowd's sentimental favorite, with a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5)
victory. Becker is in semi-retirement and this could have been his
last tournament at home.
	   Ivanisevic fired 17 aces, Becker 16. ``I was a bit unlucky
today,'' Becker said.
	   In an all-Swedish battle, Jonas Bjorkman rallied to beat Thomas
Johansson 2-6, 6-4, 6-2.
	   Krajicek, who is ranked No. 11 in the world, is trying to clinch
one of the last two places available for the eight-man Hanover
championship.
	   Agassi already has qualified for Hanover and surged to No. 5 in
the world after winning last week's tournament in Ostrava, Czech
Republic. A former No. 1, Agassi was ranked No. 141 at this time
last year and playing challenger events. Now, he is in the Top 5
for the first time since July 15, 1996.
	   Winner of five titles this year, Agassi could not tame
Krajicek's monster serve. Agassi won only nine points on Krajicek's
serve.
	   ``When he serves that well, it's very difficult,'' Agassi said.
``He is a tough guy to develop any rhythm against. He likes the
court here. All he had to do was break my serve twice.''
	   Krajicek won the title here in 1995 and reached the final last
year.
	   ``I am very satisfied with the way I played today,'' he said.
	   ``I served very well from the start and I put a lot of pressure
on him. Eventually, he was going to miss a few passing shots,''
said Krajicek, who will have surgery on his left knee after the
indoor season.
	   ``It's a long road to Hanover, it doesn't seem that far away in
time but an eternity in points,'' said Krajicek, who hit nine aces.
	   The Dutchman trails three players _ Karol Kucera, Petr Korda and
Henman in points for Hanover. All three have lost here and Krajicek
could gain some ground if he does well in this tournament.
	   Gambill, a 21-year-old American, survived 25 aces by Henman to
beat the Briton for the second time this year. As No. 9 in the
world, Henman is the highest-ranked player Gambill has ever beaten
and his first Top 10 victim.
	   ``Nobody has aced me that much,'' Gambill said. ``He actually
played a better match. He served a lot better than I did. I just
scraped and did my best from the baseline.''
	   At the time of the Australian Open, Gambill was No. 227 in the
world. Now, he is No. 50. ``My goal for the year was to get into
the Top 100,'' he said.
	   In the quarterfinals, Gambill plays Sampras, while Ivanisevic
meets Krajicek.

Mexico announces efforts to overhaul tax system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Treasury Secretary Angel Gurria said Thursday
that Mexico is planning to overhaul its Mexico's aging tax system
ahead of the 1999 budget.
	   Speaking at a conference of retailers, Gurria said the
government hopes to focus public resources on subsidies to the poor
while reducing fiscal costs of generalized subsidies and tax
exemptions.
	   He said current generalized subsidies on tortillas and tax
exemptions on food and medicines are ``unfair'' because they also
benefit people who don't need them.
	   The government must present its 1999 budget proposal to Congress
by Nov. 15. The House of Deputies then has until Dec. 15 to debate
and modify the bill.
	   Gurria said the government is discussing with business groups
the possibility of revising taxes on food and medicines in the 1999
budget. News reports have said that a sales tax of 6 percent could
be placed on food and medicine.
	   Mexico's sales tax for all consumer goods except food and
medicine currently stands at 15 percent.
	   Gurria said 1999 would be ``a complex year on the international
economic stage.'' He said that in light of the lack of credit in
international capital markets, the government ``will take extreme
precautions'' and plan its 1999 expenditures ``very cautiously.''
	   He said government spending next year will be lower as a
percentage of the gross domestic product than in 1998 and that the
government would have ``very modest'' funding from international
sources.
	   The government will seek financing from internal savings without
pressuring local interest rates, Gurria said.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A hijacker reportedly armed with a hand
grenade commandeered a Turkish Airlines flight Thursday with 33
passengers and six crew members on board.
	   The hijacker ordered the plane diverted to Lausanne,
Switzerland, Turkey's Anatolia news agency said.
	   Instead, the pilot landed the Boeing 737 at the Turkish capital
of Ankara, apparently misleading the hijacker into thinking he was
landing at the Bulgarian capital of Sofia for refueling, the news
agency said.
	   A passenger who telephoned security officials on his cell phone
said the hijacker was a Kurdish militant, according to Turkey's
private Star television. The passenger reportedly said the hijacker
was also carrying a gun.
	   Authorities immediately sealed off the airport and otherwise
tightened security.
	   The flight had taken off from the southern city of Adana bound
for Ankara. The passengers were predominantly Turkish. There were
no foreign-sounding names on the passenger list released by the
airline.
	   Last week, the same plane was prevented from taking off from the
Strasbourg airport by protesters trying to prevent French officials
from deporting a Kurd to Turkey.
	   Autonomy-seeking Kurds in Turkey's southeast have been fighting
Turkey's military since 1984. The conflict has killed 37,000.
	   Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this year,
each time with no real weapons and with no injuries. The latest was
in September, when a man with a toy gun commandeered a domestic
flight to protest government restrictions on Islam.
	   In February, a man claiming to have a teddy bear packed with
explosives took over a flight. Authorities said later he was
mentally ill.

Report: U.S. Major League Baseball to ban androstenedione
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Selig denial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ American Major league baseball plans to ban the
use of androstenedione, the muscle-building dietary supplement used
by home run champion Mark McGwire, the Toronto Globe and Mail
reported today.
	   The newspaper cited unidentified sources, who said they expect
commissioner Bud Selig to formally announce a ban before spring
training next season.
	   Selig denied the report, saying he hadn't begun to consider the
issue.
	   ``Together with the union, we've got the leading experts in this
country studying this,'' Selig said Thursday. ``It's not only very
premature, but very unfair. None of this should ever diminish from
Mark McGwire's extraordinary season.''
	   Selig and union head Donald Fehr agreed Aug. 27 to appoint a
committee of doctors to study andro. The doctors aren't expected to
report back for 6-to-10 weeks.
	   ``All the players will know where we stand on andro once a
decision is made,'' Fehr was quoted as saying by the paper. ``Right
now, the doctors are simply investigating.''
	   McGwire, who could not be reached for comment, hit 70 homers
this year, breaking the record of 61 set by Roger Maris in 1961.
	   ``I would hate to be in McGwire's shoes right now,'' said Dr.
William Bryan, team physician for the Houston Astros and the past
president of the Association of Professional Team Physicians. ``We
have just been shaking our heads all this time that androstenedione
was on the shelves.''
	   Androstenedione is illegal in Canada but legal in the United
States. It is banned by the NFL, NCAA and the Olympics but allowed
by baseball.
	   In Johnson City, Tennessee, researchers at East Tennessee State
are studying the supplement. Dr. Craig Broeder, exercise
physiologist at the school's Human Performance Lab, said they will
study androstenedione's physical and psychological effect on men
between the ages of 35 and 65.
	   ``The main reason for the study is about health issues and
anti-aging,'' he said.
	   The study's 70 participants will undergo medical tests as they
engage in weight training for 12 weeks.
	   The dlrs 28,000 study is being funded by ChemSource, a company
that researches supplements and other products, and Metabolic
Response Modifiers, which produces supplements.
	   Broeder said he hopes to find that andro can boost men's
testosterone at an age when it begins to drop. Such a drop creates
a greater risk of heart and circulatory problems.

Heavy rains swell rivers, cause floods in western Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with water rising on Main river, more roads cut off,
other details. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BADEN-BADEN, Germany (AP) _ Heavy rains flooded low-lying areas
Thursday across western Europe, including this historic spa town
where elegant tree-lined boulevards once strolled by kings and
queens were under water.
	   Water was rising on the Main river, that empties into the Rhine
near Mainz, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Frankfurt. Barge
traffic east of Frankfurt towards Aschaffenburg was stopped late
Thursday with more flooding expected downstream.
	   Low-lying streets in the Bavarian towns of Miltenberg and Cham
were flooded and closed to traffic, police said.
	   Police in Stuttgart said late Thursday that witnesses reported a
boy fell in a swollen stream in Moeckmuehl near Heilbronn and when
another jumped in to save him both were swept away.
	   Neither of the boys was found and the search was called off
after dark when no one reported children missing, a police
spokesman said. ``We hope the witnesses were mistaken.''
	   In Baden-Baden flood alarms sounded just after midnight. By
Thursday morning, German soldiers were sandbagging the swollen Oos
River that runs through the center of the luxurious resort, located
in the Black Forest near the southwest border with France. The
train station also was flooded.
	   ARD television, reported that 20 Roman Catholic nuns from a
convent near Baden-Baden also joined in to help sandbag.
	   Harsh storms that started late Tuesday killed at least three
people _ one in Germany, one in the Czech Republic, and one in
Switzerland. All were involved in vehicle accidents with trees
uprooted by wind.
	   Power cuts, traffic snarls, and highway closings were reported
Thursday in Austria and the Netherlands as well as in Germany.
	   A train derailed on the Memmingen-Munich route in Bavaria after
hitting a herd of cows that had wandered onto the tracks. Eight
cows were killed and the train engineer and a passenger were
injured.
	   The cows made their way onto the tracks after storms apparently
knocked down an electric fence, a railway spokesman said.
	   About 500 soldiers and engineers were deployed to the Dutch
province of Groningnen and Drenthe to shore up dikes sodden by
rain-swollen canals and rivers, Dutch army spokesman Hans Hardenbol
said Thursday.
	   The Linz area of upper Austria and some Vienna suburbs were
flooded, and some Austrian towns were without electricity after
gusts blew down power lines.
	   In Switzerland, a 28-year-old man was killed in the northern
Thurgau region when the car he was driving hit a tree that had
fallen across the road. Boats on Lake Biel in the northwest were
ripped from their moorings, and police were called out to recover
them.
	   In northern Germany, residents in the flooded town center of Bad
Gandersheim fled their homes in rubber dinghies. About 1,000 police
and firefighters from the nearby city of Braunschweig arrived
during the night to pump out basements after the Leine River
swiftly rose about a meter (three feet). Fifteen people were
treated for hypothermia or shock.
	   The Mosel River, which meets the Rhine in southwest Germany, was
also rising, and smaller rivers _ the Glan, the Nahe and the Sieg _
had flooded into several small towns. Barge traffic on some
stretches of the Mosel was shut down.
	   Police also closed a section of the autobahn outside the town of
Pforzheim, east of Baden-Baden. Mudslides in the town of Rastatt,
destroyed three houses, according to the interior ministry in
nearby Stuttgart.

Rochat-Moser: lawyer, restaurateur, marathon champ
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In 1997, Franziska Rochat-Moser ran the New York
City Marathon because it was her goal. This year, as the defending
women's champion, she feels it's her obligation.
	   ``Last year, I wanted to run the New York City Marathon because
I had that dream as a child,'' the 32-year-old from Switzerland
said Thursday. ``This season was very difficult for me, but the
dream to defend made me train hard and come back.''
	   Rochat-Moser's season has been interrupted twice by stress
fractures, one to her left thigh in March, one to her left leg in
July. The injuries forced her to miss the European Championships at
Budapest, Hungary, in August, and delayed her entry for New York,
because she wasn't sure she would be ready.
	   But after resuming training in August, she decided to go for a
second straight victory Sunday, against a tough field that includes
1994-95 winner and world record-holder Tegla Loroupe of Kenya, 1996
champion Anuta Catuna of Romania and European silver medalist
Madina Biktagirova of Russia.
	   Not only has Rochat-Moser been plagued by injuries, she also has
been overwhelmed by well-wishers in Switzerland since her victory a
year ago.
	   ``Winning the New York City marathon changed my life. ...
Everybody wanted something from me,'' she said. ``The whole year
has been hard for me. Everyone wanted to know how I am. But I still
went on to train.''
	   While Rochat-Moser is not Switzerland's most well-known women's
athlete _ that designation belongs to tennis star Martina Hingis _
she is nonetheless popular at home. Rochat-Moser is always in
Switzerland while Hingis doesn't spend much time there.
	   Rochat-Moser's popularity is enhanced by the three-star
restaurant she owns with her husband _ one of only two three-star
establishments in Switzerland.
	   The restaurant, Girardet, in her hometown of Crissier, on the
outskirts of Lausanne, seats 70 people, specializes in French
cuisine, has an average price range of about dlrs 200 a meal and
requires reservations three months in advance for Friday and
Saturday nights.
	   One recent customer was Cindy Crawford.
	   ``She ate in the kitchen,'' Rochat-Moser said, adding that the
model had not made a reservation and had gone to Switzerland at the
last minute to help promote a golf tournament.
	   ``We get people from all over the world _ the United States,
Japan, everywhere.''
	   Rochat-Moser also is a lawyer but will not actively pursue that
job until she finishes her running career.
	   ``It is not possible to work three professions,'' she said.
	   Rochat-Moser's best marathon time is 2 hours, 27 minutes, 44
seconds, in winning the 1994 Frankfurt Marathon. She won New York
last year at 2:28:43, and doesn't figure to improve much on that
time Sunday.
	   ``In New York, you don't run against the clock,'' she said.
``It's important to have a good placing. If you want to make a good
time, you don't run New York.
	   ``If I could win the New York City Marathon twice, I would be a
star (like Hingis) as well,'' she said.

	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch wore itself out
pounding the Honduran coast and became a tropical storm on
Thursday. But floodwaters continued to rise after up to 25 inches
(63 cms) of rain, and the danger of disease set in on communities
cut off from food, water and medicine.
	   Already, at least 32 people have died, and a yacht with 31
people aboard was missing off the Nicaraguan-Honduran border. A
U.S. Coast Guard airplane was searching for the boat Thursday.
	   Mitch, which on Tuesday ranked among the century's most powerful
storms, weakened to a tropical storm on Thursday as it moved
slightly inland. At 2100 GMT, sustained winds were only 60 mph (95
kph), down from 180 mph (290 kph) early Tuesday. A hurricane has
sustained winds of at least 75 mph (120 kph).
	   The storm had hardly moved since its peak, and on Thursday was
tearing into the same coastline and tourist islands it had been
lashing for three days.
	   On the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 kms) off Honduras' coast
and popular with divers and beachcombers, at least 14 people died
and many houses were destroyed. There were few details because the
islands were cut off except for occasional phone service.
	   Along the coast, incessant rain had flooded at least 50 rivers,
knocking out bridges and highways and putting many towns under
water. More than 150,000 were forced to seek higher ground.
	   ``My God, this thing is getting ugly,'' said 13-year-old Juan
Padilla as he watched the swollen Chamelecon River sweep cars,
trees, cattle and pieces of houses down toward the Caribbean Sea in
La Lima.
	   In addition to the dead on the Bay Islands, Honduras reported
nine other deaths and Nicaragua eight. Mexico said an American was
thrown from his boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on Monday and
presumed dead.
	   And the Antigua-registered Fantome, a 240-foot (73-meter)
sailing yacht with 31 people aboard, had been missing since
Tuesday, said the U.S. Coast Guard, which sent a C-130 plane to
search for it.
	   The Fantome, owned by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, was on a
six-day cruise through Belize and Honduras' Bay Islands when the
storm hit, said company spokesman James Canty.
	   He said the boat radioed Tuesday that it was heading east to
avoid the hurricane, and hadn't been heard from since. He said the
passengers were of various nationalities, but he didn't know which.
	   Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had
been isolated by the storm, left without power, telephones or clean
drinking water. More than 72,000 people were staying in shelters,
and countless others were managing on their own.
	   In La Lima, 110 miles (175 kms) northwest of the capital,
Tegucigalpa, entire neighborhoods were in waist-deep water and
hundreds of families had set up tents _ made of scraps of tarp and
wood _ on the highway that runs through town.
	   ``Last night the water just kept rising, so we decided to come
onto the highway,'' said Jose Antonio Galindo, 36, who makes his
living collecting firewood.
	   La Lima is part of the Sula Valley, Honduras' richest
agricultural zone, filled with banana plantations and home to more
than 200 export factories.
	   Officials said 40 percent of the 250,000-acre (100,000 hectare)
valley was flooded.
	   Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said grain, citrus and
banana crops had been damaged ``and the economic future of Honduras
is uncertain.''
	   In the short term, food, water and medicine already were running
out in communities isolated by the storm.
	   ``Today I just ate manioc with salt, and tomorrow I don't know
what I'll do,'' Maria Gonzalez, 28, said in the northern coastal
town of Tela. She held her 6-month-old son Jose in her arms.
	   In La Ceiba, which is cut off from the rest of the country by
two downed bridges, 10,600 of the city's 40,000 residents were
staying in 18 shelters. Many had run out of food. Treated water
also had run out, prompting warnings that epidemics could break
out.
	   ``You don't know what it is to have your children crying because
they're hungry, and to not be able to do anything,'' said Jorge
Tulio Romero, 31, who fled to a shelter with his children ages 5, 3
and 10 months. ``It's tremendously painful.''
	   With the weakening storm seemingly anchored off Honduras,
officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency measures on the
Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. More than 20,000 tourists
had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort areas, leaving hotels at
about 20 percent of capacity.
	   Houston accountant Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend
Nina Devries had tried to leave Cancun but found all the flights
full.
	   ``It's been horrible,'' said Montgomery, as she and her friend
drank cocktails at an outdoor restaurant. ``We couldn't go out on a
boat, we couldn't go snorkeling.
	   ``Even Carlos' N Charlie's and Senor Frog's are closed,'' she
said dejectedly, referring to two restaurants. ''Some vacation.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Top seeds Nathalie Tauziat and Mary Pierce
remained on course for an all-French final at the dlrs 164,250 Seat
Luxembourg Open after both won their quarterfinals in straight sets
Thursday.
	   Top-seeded Tauziat, who reached the Wimbledon final this year,
had little trouble is disposing of Germany's Anke Hueber, the No. 6
seed, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Mary Pierce, coming off a tournament win in Moscow, swept past
fifth-seeded Ai Sugiyama 6-3, 6-2. Pierce, ranked 11th in the
world, will face Elena Likhovtseva in Friday's semifinal.
	   In an all Russian quarterfinal, Likhovtseva, 27 in the WTA
rankings, showed no mercy for Evgenia Koulikovskaya, 6-2, 6-0.
	   The No. 3 seed Irina Spirlea of Romania became the biggest
victim so far in the tournament. She went down to Silvia Farina in
a marathon match. The Italian, No. 24 in the world, won 6-4, 4-6,
6-3 to force a semifinal against Tauziat, ranked 17 places ahead of
her.

Explosion rips through fuel company in St. Petersburg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with director speculating about cause &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A powerful blast tore through the headquarters of
a state-run fuel and energy company in St. Petersburg on Thursday,
causing serious damage and two slight injuries, a news agency said.
	   The explosion tore up concrete flooring and blew out doors and
windows on the first floor of the Toplivno-Energetichesky Komplex
company, ITAR-Tass reported, citing a company official.
	   It also shattered windows in nearby buildings.
	   Authorities were investigating the blast, and there were no
reports of anyone claiming responsibility. The director of the
company, Konstantin Dubov, said he thought the blast might be
related to recent efforts to cut internal spending and tighten
customers' debt repayment.
	   ``Probably the order which is being introduced does not suit
everybody, and I think this is the main cause of the incident,'' he
said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Valery Kislov, a company spokesman, said flying glass from the
blast slightly injured one worker in his shin, and another employee
complained of temporary deafness.

Five killed by armed men in southwest Mexico mountains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Gunmen in southwestern Mexico opened
fire on a family in a remote mountain village, killing five people
and wounding two children in what authorities on Thursday called a
drug-related attack.
	   The target appears to have been Taurino Leal Sierra, 38, who was
released from a local prison in February after serving time for
robbery and homicide, government prosecutor Felipe Quintero Campos
said.
	   The massacre is suspected to have been a settling of scores
between drug traffickers, Quintero said. He did not elaborate, and
there were no immediate arrests.
	   The attack took place late Wednesday night in the indigenous
community of Tlapa de Comonfort, high in the mountains of Guerrero
state 130 miles (210 kms) south of Mexico City _ and just half a
mile (700 meters) from a state police station.
	   The assailants used assault rifles to kill Leal, his wife Ines
Linares and their 14-year-old twins. Also killed was Fidel
Arellano, 57, whose relationship to the Leal family was not clear.
	   Two other children, ages 4 and 6, were being treated for gunshot
wounds.
	   Last month, 19 members of an extended family were lined up
outside their house in the northern Indian community of El Sauzal
and shot to death in what prosecutors call a drug-related attack.
Fourteen people have been arrested, but not the gunmen.

Brazilian president battles to win support for austerity plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Shorter version. &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ After proposing a package of
spending cuts and higher taxes, the government on Thursday turned
to selling the painful measures aimed at healing the economy.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic team headed to
Congress to try to get needed backing for the plan, which would
save nearly dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and pare the huge budget
deficit.
	   But resistance to the measures was expected, even among
Cardoso's allies.
	   Rep. Inocencio de Oliveira, normally a strong government
supporter, complained about a proposed increase in a tax on all
financial transactions _ from writing checks to buying stocks _ to
0.38 percent from the current 0.2 percent.
	   ``I think it's too high,'' he said. ``If it were, say, 0.3
percent, that would be more palatable.''
	   Another battle is shaping up over a proposal to raise the social
security tax on civil servants and collect it, for the first time,
from retired government workers.
	   The measures were proposed to help Brazil win a dlrs 30 billion
rescue package from the International Monetary Fund. Brazil has
been whipsawed by the global financial crisis that began more than
a year ago in Southeast Asia.
	   Although the government has a majority in the 513-seat Chamber
of Deputies and the 81-seat Senate, it faces an uphill fight.
	   Cardoso also must gain support from the states' governors who
wield enormous influence over their lawmakers.
	   The economic plan has angered some governors by calling for
sharp cutbacks in the amount of federal money given to the states.
The money would go to cover shortfalls in the federal budget.
	   Six opposition governors met in Brasilia, the capital, to
discuss the plan. Anthony Garotinho, the populist governor-elect of
the state of Rio de Janeiro, said he would oppose any move to
reduce the state payroll to save money.
	   ``Rio doesn't have too many civil servants _ it has too few,''
he said.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Princess Diana's former butler will run in the
New York City Marathon Sunday to raise money for charities in her
memory.
	   Paul Burrell will be raising funds for the London-based Diana,
Princess of Wales Memorial Fund.
	   Burrell has traveled widely as fund-raising manager for the
fund, which provides money for charities sponsored by the late
princess, including the international campaign against land mines.
He collects money from donors who sponsor his runs.
	   Princess Diana died Aug. 31, 1997.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MOTA GETS AWARD
	   Portugal's Rosa Mota, the women's 1988 Olympic marathon gold
medalist and the sixth-fastest marathoner in history, will receive
the Abebe Bikila Award Saturday.
	   The award is presented by the New York Road Runners Club,
organizers of Sunday's New York City Marathon, for outstanding
contributions to the sport of distance running.
	   Mota ran her fastest marathon at Chicago in 1985, with a time of
2 hours, 23 minutes, 29 seconds, finishing behind Joan Benoit
Samuelson (2:21:21, still the American record) and Norway's Ingrid
Kristiansen (2:23:05).
	   Overall, she had 12 sub-2:30 performances and won a total of 14
marathons. Her other victories included Boston three times
(1987-88-90), the European Championships three times (1982-86-90),
Chicago twice (1983-84) and once each at Rotterdam, Tokyo, Osaka
(Japan), the 1987 World Championships and the 1991 World Cup.
	   Mota was ranked No. 1 in the world from 1987-1991.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MARATHON MAN
	   Jerry Dunn, a massage therapist from Spearfish, South Dakota,
will run his 29th marathon in 29 days Sunday when he competes in
the 29th New York City Marathon.
	   To commemorate the race's anniversary, Dunn began running the
marathon distance through Central Park, the original race course,
daily on Oct. 4. After completing that route again Saturday, Dunn
will run the present course through the city's five boroughs
Sunday.
	   Dunn, 52, holds the record for most marathons run in one year
with 104. He also ran 26 consecutive marathons to commemorate the
100th running of the Boston Marathon and 13 consecutive marathons
to mark the 13th anniversary of the Los Angeles Marathon.
	   Dunn's motto is: ``Don't limit your challenges, challenge your
limits.''

	    &UR; VIETNAM DUO
	   Dan Jensen and Tran Son, disabled athletes competing in Sunday's
New York City Marathon, have a common bond.
	   Both were seriously injured during the Vietnam War, when they
fought on opposite sides.
	   Jensen, 49, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, lost his right foot
after stepping on a land mine in 1971. Tran, 51, of Hanoi, Vietnam,
lost his right leg in a battle in 1972.
	   The two became friends nine months ago during the Vietnam
Challenge, a 16-day, 1,200-mile (1,900-kilometer) bike ride from
Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City to unify American and Vietnamese
veterans, organized by World T.E.A.M. Sports of Charlotte, North
Carolina. They were standing in a Vietnamese cemetery when they
began talking about Tran's running and his prosthetic foot.
	   Tran had run the New York City Marathon twice, but his current
foot was limiting his athletic performances. Jensen, who had
completed nine marathons, promised to bring Tran to the United
States so he could get a new leg and they could run together
Sunday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DISABLED ATHLETES
	   The Achilles Track Club, the worldwide organization that
encourages people with various disabilities to participate in
running with the general public, will have 350 competitors from 37
countries in Sunday's New York City Marathon.
	   Two of the largest contingents will come from New Zealand and
Japan. Rod Dixon, the 1983 race winner, and Allison Roe, the 1983
women's champion, will lead New Zealand's group of 43. Japan will
be represented by about 30 Achilles team members from clubs in
Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo.
	   From Slovakia, a married couple of wheelchair marathoners will
compete in their fifth straight New York City Marathon in sports
wheelchairs donated by race volunteers.
	   After the race, 10 sports wheelchairs will be donated to
wheelchair marathon athletes completing event.

Hijacker commanders Turkish Airlines flight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prime minister, airline official saying

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A hijacker reportedly armed with a hand
grenade commandeered a Turkish Airlines flight Thursday with 33
passengers and six crew members aboard. The pilot landed in
Turkey's capital, where authorities pressed for release of women
and children.
	   The hijacker took over the flight demanding that it be diverted
to Lausanne, Switzerland, Turkey's Anatolia news agency said.
	   Instead, the pilot brought the Boeing 737 down at Ankara's
airport, apparently after initially misleading the hijacker into
thinking the crew was stopping in neighboring Bulgaria for
refueling, the news agency said.
	   At Ankara, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said, authorities
promised to let the plane refuel and take off again if the hijacker
freed the women and children on board.
	   Even as officials talked with the hijacker in hopes of a
peaceful resolution, authorities moved out security forces, sealing
off the airport. NTV television said the government deployed about
40 assault team officers.
	   ``Negotiations with the hijacker are going on,'' said Turkish
Airline's Deputy Head Cetin Ozbey. ``We hope the issue will come to
an end without any operations.''
	   NTV and Star television, both independent operations, reported
conversations with a passenger who had a cell phone.
	   Star quoted the passenger, a businessman, as saying the hijacker
was a Kurdish militant who also had a gun. NTV quoted the passenger
as saying the man was a retired schoolteacher who was a ``leftist
revolutionary.''
	   The flight had taken off from the southern city of Adana bound
for Ankara.
	   The passengers were mostly Turkish doctors on their way to a
medical convention, the Anatolia news agency said. There were no
obviously foreign names on the passenger list released by the
airline.
	   Last week, the same plane was prevented from taking off from the
Strasbourg airport by protesters trying to prevent French officials
from deporting a Kurd to Turkey.
	   Autonomy-seeking Kurds in Turkey's southeast have been fighting
Turkey's military since 1984. The conflict has killed 37,000.
	   Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this year,
each time with no real weapons and with no injuries. The latest was
in September, when a man with a toy gun commandeered a domestic
flight to protest government restrictions on Islam.
	   In February, a man claiming to have a teddy bear packed with
explosives took over a flight. Authorities said later he was
mentally ill.

Marseille leapfrogs Bordeaux to go top; Monaco moves to third
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fabrizio Ravanelli scored two goals as Marseille
stormed back from a goal behind to beat Lorient 3-1 on Thursday,
and regain the leadership of the French first division.
	   The win puts Marseille on 27 points, two points ahead of
Bordeaux, which plays Friday.
	   On a misty Britanny night, Marseille's unbeaten record looked
under threat in the 25th minute when Ali Bouafia latched on to a
leftwing cross to slide the ball in from close range.
	   Pascal Bedrossian had a good chance to double the lead before
halftime, but his 15 meter (yard) shot was well saved by Stephane
Porato.
	   Ravanelli levelled in the 55th minute and eleven minutes later
smacked in a stunning 25 meter (yard) free kick to put the away
side in front.
	   Marseille had midfielder Daniel Bravo sent off with 20 minutes
remaining but Robert Pires made the game safe with a breakaway goal
in the 82nd minute.
	   Monaco, the 1997 champion, moved into third place with a
deserved 3-1 against Nantes.
	   Monaco opened the scoring when Croat striker Robert Spehar
brilliantly beat three defenders before checking back and crossing
to Frank Gava who planted a firm header past goalkeeper Michael
Landreau.
	   Gava was unlucky to have a 28th minute goal disallowed when the
linesman ruled offside against Thierry Henry - who was lying on his
back after attempting to bundle the ball over the line.
	   Earlier, Robert Spehar created a golden chance for Henry, but
the winger sidefooted wide only seven meters (yards) from goal.
	   A minute before time, Nantes levelled against the run of play
when Argentine defender Nestor Fabbri was left unmarked to head in
right wing corner.
	   A spectacular 25 meter (yard) strike from Philippe Leonard in
the 60th minute put the home side back ahead, before Victor Ikpeba
latched on to a long through ball before lobbing the ball over
Landreau.
	   Lowly Le Havre withstood persistent pressure to grab a goalless
draw at Lyon.
	   Vikash Dhorasoo was desparately unlucky not to score against his
former club in the 13th minute.
	   The diminutive Lyon playmaker, who has been in outstanding form
since moving to the Stade Gerland in pre-season, skipped past three
challenges before firing a 10 meter (yard) shot against the inside
of the post.
	   Frederic Kanoute headed wide when well-placed, minutes before Le
Havre goalkeeper Stephane Cassart brilliantly tipped a 20 meter
(yard) shot from Marco Grassi round the post.
	   In Friday's matches, Bordeaux travels to struggling Strasbourg,
while Rennes visits another underachiever, Toulouse.
	   Paris Saint-Germain coach Artur Jorge returns for his first
match at the Parc des Princes since returning to the club.
	   PSG plays in-form Auxerre.

Sampras wins to protect No. 1 ranking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rios advancing &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras made sure of extending
his No. 1 reign for at least another week by beating Bohdan
Ulihrach 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the
dlrs 2.45 Eurocard Open.
	   Had he lost, Sampras could have surrendered the top spot to
either No. 2 Marcelo Rios or No. 3 Patrick Rafter.
	   Rios also advanced when his opponent Jan Siemerink retired
because of illness after losing the first set 6-2. But the Chilean
will not be able to seize the No. 1 this week even if he wins the
tournament.
	   Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open champion, lost some ground when
he was beaten by Greg Rusedski, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (5-7), 6-4 after
wasting two set points in the first set.
	   Rusedski, who lost the 1997 U.S. Open final to Rafter, now has
beaten the Australian twice in two weeks.
	   ``It has been a long year and it's just mental tiredness at the
moment,'' Rafter said. ``The problem with indoor tournaments you
don't really get out in the sunshine and you play night matches all
the time I struggle with that more than anything.''
	   Sampras fired 13 aces and needed just an hour to beat Ulihrach,
who had won two of their three previous matches. The victory
assured Sampras of remaining No. 1 when the new rankings come out
Monday.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1
for six years in a row.
	   ``It's a record that might not ever be broken. It is that hard
to do,'' Sampras said. ``I feel like I am on a good road.''
	   The battle for No. 1 is unlikely to be settled before the
season-ending World Championship in Hanover, Germany, next month.
	   Richard Krajicek stopped Andre Agassi's recent roll when he
upset the American 6-3, 6-4 in a showdown between two former
Wimbledon champions.
	   Tenth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov also advanced by beating Todd
Martin 6-4, 7-5, and Jan-Michael Gambill upset ninth-seeded Tim
Henman 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Goran Ivanisevic, seeded 14th, ended the run of Boris Becker,
the crowd's sentimental favorite, with a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5)
victory. Becker is in semi-retirement and this could have been his
last tournament at home.
	   In an all-Swedish battle, Jonas Bjorkman rallied to beat Thomas
Johansson 2-6, 6-4, 6-2.
	   Krajicek, who is ranked No. 11 in the world, is trying to clinch
one of the last two places available for the eight-man Hanover
championship.
	   Agassi already has qualified for Hanover and surged to No. 5
after winning last week's tournament in Ostrava, Czech Republic. A
former No. 1, Agassi was ranked No. 141 at this time last year and
playing challenger events. Now, he is in the Top 5 for the first
time since July 15, 1996.
	   Winner of five titles this year, Agassi could not tame
Krajicek's monster serve. Agassi won only nine points on Krajicek's
serve.
	   ``When he serves that well, it's very difficult,'' Agassi said.
``He is a tough guy to develop any rhythm against. He likes the
court here. All he had to do was break my serve twice.''
	   Krajicek won the title here in 1995 and reached the final last
year.
	   ``I served very well from the start and I put a lot of pressure
on him. Eventually, he was going to miss a few passing shots,''
said Krajicek, who will have surgery on his left knee after the
indoor season.
	   ``It's a long road to Hanover, it doesn't seem that far away in
time but an eternity in points,'' said Krajicek, who hit nine aces.
	   The Dutchman trails three players _ Karol Kucera, Petr Korda and
Henman in points for Hanover. All three have lost here and Krajicek
could gain some ground if he does well in this tournament.
	   Gambill, a 21-year-old American, survived 25 aces by Henman to
beat the Briton for the second time this year. As No. 9 in the
world, Henman is the highest-ranked player Gambill has ever beaten
and his first Top 10 victim.
	   ``Nobody has aced me that much,'' Gambill said. ``He actually
played a better match. He served a lot better than I did. I just
scraped and did my best from the baseline.''
	   At the time of the Australian Open, Gambill was No. 227 in the
world. Now, he is No. 50. ``My goal for the year was to get into
the Top 100,'' he said.
	   In the quarterfinals, Gambill plays Sampras, Ivanisevic meets
Krajicek, Rusedski plays Borkman and Rios meets Kafelnikov.

UN policy announced to keep military observers over age 25
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations announced new age
requirements for U.N. peacekeepers Thursday, hoping to set an
example for countries to refrain from using children under 18 in
their own forces.
	   The United Nations is now asking that governments not send
civilian police and military observers younger than 25 to serve in
U.N. peackeeping operations. Troops in national contingents should
preferably be 21 but no younger than 18, the under-secretary
general for peacekeeping, Bernard Miyet, told the General Assembly.
	   ``This decision has been taken as an additional measure in the
organization's effort to promote the rights of the child,'' U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   ``While we have no indication that member governments have
provided the U.N. with soldiers under the age of 18, this policy
has been adopted as a proactive measure,'' he said.
	   Human Rights Watch applauded the move, saying it was a step in
the right direction. The use of child combatants has become one of
the most devastating aspects of contemporary warfare, with more
than 300,000 children under 18 currently fighting around the world,
said Jo Becker, the organization's children's rights advocacy
director.
	   ``National governments should be doing everything possible to
stop this horrible practice. Raising their enlistment age to 18 is
one important move,'' Becker said.
	   The U.N. envoy for children and armed conflict, Olara Otunnu,
also welcomed the decision, saying ``it will strengthen current
efforts to promote better protection for the most vulnerable
sections of the population in peacekeeping situations.''

Tyson plans to fight in January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mike Tyson is headed for a fight early next year
at the site of his boxing ban.
	   ``He's going to fight in January,'' Shelly Finkel, calling
himself Tyson's boxing adviser, said Thursday. ``We're looking at
Las Vegas.''
	   It was at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that Tyson bit Evander
Holyfield's ears June 28, 1997, leading to his license revocation
and a dlrs 3 million fine.
	   The Nevada State Athletic Commission voted 4-1 on Oct. 19 to
restore Tyson's license.
	   The former champion, however, still faces a Dec. 1 trial on
misdemeanor assault charges stemming from a traffic accident Aug.
31 at Gaithersburg, Maryland.
	   Finkel did not mention a specific site or date, but the MGM
Grand reportedly is interested in bringing Tyson back, with Jan. 16
a possibility.
	   As for an opponent, Finkel said, ``We're looking at the Axel
Schulzes, the Francois Bothas, the Vaughn Beans, somebody like
that.''
	   Schulz, Botha and Bean are capable fighters, but are not
knockout punchers, which is in their favor when considered as
possible opponents for Tyson. They have good records and have
title-fight experience. In other words, they are much more
acceptable, and saleable at this point of Tyson's career than a
Peter McNeeley would be.
	   In Tyson's first fight after his release from prison in 1995, he
beat McNeeley in 89 seconds.
	   Schulz lost a 12-round decision to George Foreman in a bid for
the IBF title in 1995. The German also lost a 12-round decision to
Michael Moorer for the vacant IBF championship in 1996.
	   Botha of South Africa was stopped in the 12th round by Moorer in
an IBF title fight Nov. 9, 1996.
	   Bean failed to win the WBA-IBF titles when he was outpointed by
Evander Holyfield on Sept. 19.

Mantle's estate and former mistress dispute ownership of three
</HEADLINE>
paintings &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMUEL MAULL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The family of American baseball great Mickey
Mantle is again battling the late slugger's mistress, this time
over ownership and sale of three paintings that she claims she and
Mantle owned jointly.
	   Two of the paintings are portraits, one of Mantle and teammate
Roger Maris, and a second of Mantle and teammate Billy Martin. The
third, titled ``Life of a Legend,'' is a huge collage depicting
Mantle's life and is signed by him in several places. The three are
valued at dlr 150,000.
	   Greer Johnson, Mantle's agent and lover who lived with him
during his last years, has been trying to arrange a sale next month
of the paintings at Christie's East auction house.
	   Mantle was separated from his wife, Merlyn, for 15 years until
his death on Aug. 13, 1995, but they never divorced. Mrs. Mantle is
a co-executor of his estate.
	   Last year, the Mantle family went to federal court to stop
Johnson's auction of many of the Yankee great's personal items. The
family called the sale of some items, such as a lock of Mantle's
hair, ``ghoulish.''
	   Mantle's son, David, said his family wants the paintings to stay
in Mickey Mantle's Restaurant in Manhattan. ``This is where you get
your goosebumps,'' he said.
	   In papers filed Wednesday in State Supreme Court, Johnson, of
Duluth, Georgia, says she has a right to sell the paintings because
she owns 50 percent of them. She says Mantle's estate owns the
other half.
	   Johnson says when she forwarded a contract from Christie's East
to Wayne Miller, the estate's lawyer, he wrote back and said the
Mantle family was claiming full ownership and would not cooperate
with the sale.
	   She wants the court to declare her a 50-percent owner of the
artwork and to give her custody of the paintings until there is
agreement on their disposal. She is also seeking damages and legal
fees.
	   Her lawyer, Richard Blumenthal, obtained a court order
preventing the paintings from being moved pending a hearing on Nov.
13.
	   Blumenthal said resistance to Johnson's claim and to the sale of
the paintings was coming largely from Bill Liederman, owner of the
restaurant.
	   Liederman said, ``I don't own the paintings. I'm just hanging
them. The family instructed me to keep the paintings here. As soon
as they tell me anything else they want to do with the paintings,
that's what I'll do.''
	   David Mantle, reached at his home in Texas, says he doesn't know
what Johnson is talking about.
	   ``Dad never mentioned that he wanted the paintings sold after
his death,'' he said, ``and I don't remember Dad or Bill
(Liederman) telling me she gets half.''

Williams targets Davenport next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Venus Williams put Lindsay Davenport on notice
Thursday. She wants what Davenport has _ the No. 1 ranking in
women's tennis.
	   ``In 1999, I would be going for the number one position,'' said
Williams, who will be in the field with Davenport in next month's
season-ending dlrs 2 million Chase Championships at Madison Square
Garden.
	   ``Number one is something that I can achieve,'' said Williams,
currently No. 5. ``That is my goal. It's everybody's goal, but not
everybody can see it. I'm not far away from it and it is definitely
attainable.''
	   Williams, 18, feels she is improving and that she ought to move
up in the rankings. ``I don't see anything too complicated about
it,'' she said. ``My serve is large, my groundstrokes are nice and
I would like to get more powerful at the net.
	   ``There is always a place to get better in your game, you can't
just get to a plateau, you have to keep rising.''
	   Williams has played consistently well this year to climb into
the top five, winning two tournaments including last month's
inaugural Grand Slam Cup for the women.
	   But she has not enjoyed the spectacular results that marked last
year's breakthrough rookie season on the WTA Tour, when she climbed
nearly 200 spots on the rankings to break into the top 25 and
reached the U.S. Open final in her debut.
	   At this year's U.S. Open, she lost to Davenport in the
semifinals but said that wasn't a big setback since she felt
fortunate to be even playing after being sidelined a few weeks
earlier with a knee injury.
	   ``The Open wasn't a disappointment,'' she said. ``I was injured
and Lindsay played well and she deserved it.''
	   Davenport went on to win her first Grand Slam, defeating Martina
Hingis in the final.
	   Williams' troublesome left knee flared up again in last week's
semifinal loss to Mary Pierce in Moscow. ``I'm not worried at
all,'' she said. ``I'm a little bit taller than most people at a
younger age and my body has to catch up my height.''
	   Williams intends to rest the knee except for playing doubles in
Philadelphia in two weeks before coming to Madison Square Garden
for the Chase Championships.
	   Also qualified for the 16-player Chase Championships singles
field are Davenport, Hingis, Monica Seles, Jana Novotna, Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario, Anna Kournikova, Conchita Martinez and Patty
Schnyder.

DiMaggio well enough to receive visitors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF SHAIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ American baseball legend Joe DiMaggio was well
enough to receive a few visitors Thursday as he continued to
rebound from what a friend said was a near-fatal bout with
pneumonia and a lung infection.
	   Morris Engelberg, who is also DiMaggio's lawyer and surrogate,
said the Yankees great looked better than at any time since he was
admitted to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, on
Oct. 12.
	   DiMaggio had his lungs drained at least twice to relieve severe
breathing problems, Engelberg said. The Hall of Fame center fielder
was still in intensive care, but was in a larger room.
	   ``He's up out of bed. That's a major, major plus,'' said
Engelberg, who acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that
DiMaggio's life had been in danger.
	   Engelberg has become much more optimistic.
	   ``He's a tough guy.'' the 58-year-old lawyer said. That's why
he's going to make it through.''
	   DiMaggio was expected to remain in intensive care for another
week to 10 days. He's not likely to be discharged until about a
week before his 84th birthday, Nov. 25.
	   His condition was improved enough for doctors to allow DiMaggio
to sit at a table in his room, and clear him to receive visitors,
though DiMaggio's longstanding desire for privacy would keep the
numbers severely limited.
	   DiMaggio, however, was eagerly awaiting a visit from his
grandchildren, Engelberg said. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
was expected to drop by within a few days.
	   Steinbrenner has introduced DiMaggio as ``The Greatest Living
Yankee'' at Yankee Stadium appearances and had insisted that the
Hall of Famer throw out the ceremonial first pitch to open the
World Series.
	   But DiMaggio was in the hospital by then.

Lazio defeats AC Milan 3-1 in first-leg game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Two second-half goals by Italian veteran striker
Roberto Mancini lifted defending champion Lazio to a 3-1 victory
against AC Milan in a third-round first leg game of the Italian Cup
Thursday.
	   It was a repeat of last season's Cup final when the Roman team
captured the trophy beating the Milan powerhouse 3-1.
	   Mancini gave the Roman team a 2-1 lead in the 71st minute,
kicking in from a few meters a perfect pass by Portuguese
midfielder Sergio Conceicao.
	   Mancini made it three in injury time (95th), heading in a corner
kick by Sinisa Mihajlovic.
	   The Yugoslav midfielder had tallied Lazio's equalizer in the
28th minute, with a powerful long-distance free kick, to make up
for an early goal by AC Milan's German striker Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Bierhoff, who limped off the field at the end of the first half
with a light ankle injury, scored Milan's only goal after 7 minutes
with a precise curling left-footed shot.
	   Lazio's Chilean star Marcelo Salas, returning to action
following an ankle injury suffered in a league match, wasted two
clear scoring chances showing a questionable form. He was
substituted in the 75th minute.
	   AC Milan defender Alessandro Costacurta, who was expelled in
injury time, Bierhoff and French midfielder Ibrahim Ba, who
received their second caution in the competition, will be suspended
for the second-leg game scheduled at San Siro on Nov. 11, making
Milan's qualifying chances additionally difficult.
	   About 20,000 fans watched the game at Rome's Olympic stadium. It
was AC Milan's fourth defeat this season - two in the Cup and two
in Serie A games.
	   ``We missed some good chances and were punished. We can hope to
recover in the second leg. But we will have to play definitely
better,'' said Milan's coach Alberto Zaccheroni.

Report warns against rice farming in Trinidad's largest wetland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago (AP) _ A government report is
warning against allowing large-scale rice farmers to plant again in
Trinidad and Tobago's largest wetland, the Nariva Swamp.
	   The 200-page study by the Institute of Marine Affairs said
pesticides used in farming harm the swamp's plants and animals. It
also said irrigation canals divert water from the natural homes of
manatees, an endangered species.
	   The report was presented to Cabinet members on Thursday.
	   Farmers planted illegally in the swamp from 1986 until they were
ousted by the government in 1996. In July they tried to block
government crews working to fill in irrigation canals the farmers
had carved through the swamp. Police were called in to protect the
workers.
	   The report said if the government chooses to allow small farms,
it should ban the use of fertilizers and pesticides in the area.
	   ``The chemicals used in agricultural activities have proven to
be toxic to flora and fauna,'' it said.

Hijacker commandeers Turkish Airlines flight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with plane reportedly refueling,
all flights diverted from Ankara, medical staff called to airport &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A hijacker reportedly armed with a hand
grenade commandeered a Turkish Airlines flight Thursday with 33
passengers and six crew members aboard. The pilot landed in
Turkey's capital, where authorities pressed for release of women
and children.
	   The hijacker demanded that the plane be flown to Lausanne,
Switzerland, Turkey's Anatolia news agency said.
	   Instead, the pilot brought the Boeing 737 down at Ankara's
airport, apparently after initially misleading the hijacker into
thinking the crew was stopping in neighboring Bulgaria for
refueling, the news agency said.
	   At Ankara, authorities promised to let the plane refuel and take
off again if the hijacker freed the women and children on board,
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said on Turkish TV.
	   Refueling started after about 2 1/2 hours on the ground,
Anatolia said, but there was no immediate word on anyone being
released.
	   Even as officials talked with the hijacker in hopes of a
peaceful resolution, authorities moved out security forces, sealing
off the airport. NTV television said the government deployed about
40 assault team officers.
	   Ambulances and doctors were also called to the airport. All
flights from Ankara were canceled and inbound flights diverted to
Istanbul.
	   ``Negotiations with the hijacker are going on,'' said Turkish
Airline's Deputy Head Cetin Ozbey. ``We hope the issue will come to
an end without any operations.''
	   NTV and Star television, both independent operations, reported
conversations with a passenger who had a cell phone.
	   Star quoted the passenger, a businessman, as saying the hijacker
was a Kurdish militant who also had a gun. NTV quoted the passenger
as saying the man was a retired schoolteacher who was a ``leftist
revolutionary.''
	   The flight had taken off from the southern city of Adana bound
for Ankara.
	   The passengers were mostly Turkish doctors on their way to a
medical convention, Anatolia said. There were no obviously foreign
names on the passenger list released by the airline.
	   Last week, the same plane was prevented from taking off from the
Strasbourg airport by protesters trying to prevent French officials
from deporting a Kurd to Turkey.
	   Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this year,
each time with no real weapons and with no injuries. The latest was
in September, when a man with a toy gun commandeered a domestic
flight to protest government restrictions on Islam.
	   In February, a man claiming to have a teddy bear packed with
explosives took over a flight. Authorities said later he was
mentally ill.

Brazilian share prices fall sharply amid doubts over fiscal plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Brazil-Selling the Plan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO (AP) _ Brazilian share prices fell sharply Thursday,
amid doubts over the viability of implementing the government's
newly unveiled fiscal plan.
	   A day after the plan was announced, the Sao Paulo Stock
Exchange, the country's biggest, closed 4.2 percent down.
	   ``People still need time to study the (government's) measures to
determine what the real impact will be on the economy,'' said one
Sao Paulo trader.
	   Brazil's fiscal plan is a combination of budget cuts and tax
increases designed to generate savings of dlrs 24 billion (28
billion reals). The implementation of most measures depends on
Congressional approval.

Palmer returns to tour after radiation therapy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Arnold Palmer, looking fit and saying he
feels strong, returns to the Senior PGA Tour on Friday following
radiation treatments for prostate cancer.
	   ``It will be about four or five weeks until I'm fully back,
although I feel fine,'' he said Thursday. ``It's great to be back
and it's great to be feeling good. I'm looking forward to the
tournament.''
	   The 69-year-old golf great, who has not played a tournament
since early August, recently completed seven weeks of radiation
therapy as a follow-up to his cancer surgery in January 1997.
	   It was learned last week that Palmer's wife, Winnie, has ovarian
cancer. She had her first treatment Monday at Orlando, Florida.
	   ``She's fine,'' Palmer said. ``She's doing very well and we
expect a full recovery from her.''
	   Palmer is the second-oldest player among the 78 golfers for the
dlrs 1.1 million Pacific Bell Senior Classic at Wilshire Country
Club. Charlie Sifford is 76.
	   ``I enjoy what I do,'' Palmer said. ``I suppose that's the major
thing that keeps me going.''
	   Palmer won 60 tournaments on the PGA Tour, seven of them major
championships, and has 10 Senior PGA Tour victories.
	   Also entered in this tournament are defending champion Gil
Morgan, Larry Nelson, Hugh Baiocchi, Dana Quigley, Jim Colbert,
Bruce Summerhays, Isao Aoki and Dave Stockton.
	   The winner of the 54-hole tournament earns dlrs 165,000.

Italian auto giant hurt by weakness of Brazilian market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Italy's auto maker and industrial giant Fiat
SpA said Thursday its results in the third quarter of 1998 were
hurt by the weakness of the Brazilian auto market.
	   Brazil, where Fiat has about a 30 percent market share, is a
pillar of Fiat's globalization strategy.
	   The Italian group said sales slipped to 19.3 trillion lire (dlrs
11.6 billion) in the third quarter, from 20.3 trillion lire (dlrs
12.3 billion) a year before.
	   In the first nine months of the year Fiat's pretax profit fell
to 2.37 trillion lire (dlrs 1.4 billion), from 3.1 trillion lire
(dlrs 1.8 billion).
	   Fiat said sales in Italy and Poland had been weaker than in
other countries in the third quarter of 1998, while a further
decrease in demand in Brazil was expected in the short term as a
result of the recent austerity measures.
	   Fiat said it sold some 754,000 vehicles in Italy in the first
nine months, down 11 percent from a year before. Its domestic
market share settled at around 40 percent.
	   Overall, it sold some 1.86 million vehicles, down from 1.98
million a year before.
	   Fiat's sales and results last year had been boosted by Italian
government-sponsored incentives to purchase new cars.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin may check out of a
sanitarium where he is receiving treatment for exhaustion and go on
vacation to Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi on Friday, news
reports said.
	   Yeltsin entered a rest home in the woods outside Moscow on
Tuesday, to walks, receive treatment and rest to recover from
fatigue.
	   A medical team was meeting Thursday in the secluded Barvikha
sanitarium to discuss their patient, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax
news agencies reported, citing presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   The president's condition has not grown worse during his
sanitarium stay, Yakushkin said, according to Interfax. He did not
elaborate.
	   On Friday morning, Yeltsin will meet with Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov to discuss a European Union meeting in Austria, which
Primakov attended earlier this week in the ailing president's
stead.
	   Later in the day, Yeltsin may travel to Sochi _ about a two-hour
flight from Moscow _ for two weeks, Yakushkin said, according to
Interfax.
	   The spokesman added that the Moscow meetings with foreign
leaders that Yeltsin had planned for November were still on
schedule.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been seldom seen since the country was rocked
by an economic crisis in August, and it has become increasingly
clear that Primakov is handling day-to-day decisions.
	   A poll released Thursday indicated that three out of every four
Russians are in favor of impeaching Yeltsin.
	   Communist-led opposition in parliament had launched an
impeachment campaign long before the economic crisis, and long
before Yeltsin's latest illness.
	   Impeachment supporters in parliament accuse Yeltsin of
instigating the Soviet collapse, starting the unsuccessful war in
separatist Chechnya, and sending troops and tanks against his
hard-line foes in Russia's previous parliament in 1993.
	   But the campaign appears likely to fail, as several previous
ones have.

Venzuelan court authorizes change of residence for detained

ex-president &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A Venezuelan court granted former
President Carlos Andres Perez permission Thursday to spend the
final days of his senate campaign under house arrest in the state
where he is seeking election.
	   Until now, he has been restricted to Caracas, hundreds of miles
(kilometers) away from his home state of Tachira, where polls show
he is favored to win a senate seat in Nov. 8 elections.
	   He has been doing TV and radio ads and interviews from his home
in Caracas for broadcast in Tachira, and he has campaign workers
rallying support on the spot.
	   A federal court granted Perez's request to shift his residence
temporarily, ruling, however, that Perez cannot leave home without
its permission.
	   Perez, 76, has been under house arrest since April pending
resolution of charges of illegal enrichment. He was allowed to
avoid prison time because of his age.
	   If the two-time president wins a senate seat, he will
automatically receive parliamentary immunity and be freed.
	   Ron Sandoval, Perez's campaign manager in Tachira, told The
Associated Press that the former president plans to hold a rally in
Tachira on Friday or Saturday. It was not immediately clear if
authorities would allow that.
	   Perez was impeached in 1993 on corruption charges in a separate
case and was under arrest for two years and four months.

Cuban government says it has enough evidence to try bombing

suspects &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ There is enough evidence for Cuban courts to
try a Salvadoran man who confessed to a hotel bombing spree last
year along with four others charged with similar acts, the
communist government said Thursday.
	   The Communist Party daily Granma alleged in a lengthy article
that Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon, arrested Sept. 4, 1997, in last
summer's bombings, and the others belonged to a Central
America-based network directed and funded by the exile-led Cuban
American National Foundation, which is based in Miami.
	   An Italian man was killed in one of the bombings. Another seven
people were wounded.
	   Foundation spokeswoman Ninoska Perez denied Granma's allegation,
calling it ``more of the same badly staged circus'' by the Cuban
government. The foundation has always denied using violence in its
campaigns against the government of President Fidel Castro, in
power for nearly 40 years.
	   The Granma article was summarized by the Cuban government's
Prensa Latina news service, monitored in Mexico City.
	   The two-page Granma article said there was enough evidence to
try the five for terrorism immediately. No trial date was set.
	   ``They are mercenaries who would charge between dlrs 1,000 and
dlrs 4,500 for each bomb they exploded in Cuba,'' the article said.
	   The other suspects were identified as Otto Rene Rodriguez
Llerena of El Salvador and Guatemalans Nader Kamal Musalam Bakarat,
Maria Elena Gonzalez Meza and her husband Jazid Ivan Fernandez
Mendoza.
	   Granma said that the suspects told Cuban officials that their
activities were financed by the foundation and organized by Luis
Posadas Carriles, a Cuban exile accused by Cuban authorities of
responsibility for the 1976 bombing of a Cubana airliner that
killed 73 people.
	   Posada Carriles was twice acquitted of that action, but spent
nine years in a Venezuelan prison before escaping in 1985.

NHL suspends Manson for three games

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Defenseman Dave Manson of the Montreal Canadiens
was suspended for three games and fined dlrs 1,000 by North
America's National Hockey League on Thursday for elbowing P.J.
Axelsson of the Boston Bruins.
	   Manson was assessed a major penalty for elbowing and a game
misconduct after hitting Axelsson in the second period of the game
on Wednesday night.
	   ``Manson delivered a flagrant elbow to Axelsson's face,'' said
Colin Campbell, the NHL's senior vice president and director of
hockey operations. ``Whether by elbow, stick or otherwise, the
league will continue to punish players for deliberate blows to the
head of an opponent.''
	   Manson will miss three games _ Thursday night at Boston,
Saturday at Ottawa and Wednesday at the New York Rangers.\

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
criticized the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for refusing to
include in its report the ANC's response to allegations it
committed abuses while fighting apartheid.
	   Mbeki, who is also president of the African National Congress
and is President Nelson Mandela's likely successor after elections
next year, said the ANC was awaiting Judge Wilfred Thring's reasons
for dismissing on Thursday the party's petition for a publication
ban on the Truth Commission's report.
	   The report condemned the ANC for killing civilians and suspected
traitors during its fight to overthrow white rule.
	   The ANC, notified ahead of time of the finding, responded that
it was ``proud'' of its fight for ``the destruction of a vile
system'' and asserted that ANC fighters ``did not resort to vile
methods of struggle on the basis that (any means) justified the
end.''
	   It was ``incorrect'' for the report to be released without the
ANC's written response, Mbeki told reporters Thursday in Cape Town.
	   ``This does not help the process for which the TRC was
established,'' Mbeki said.
	   The Truth Commission was established to examine the horrors of
apartheid in hopes of moving the country toward reconciliation.

Wide gulf still separates sides; no talks scheduled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout, UPDATES with Thursday developments. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After a busy burst of bargaining, the opposing
sides in the American National Basketball Association lockout took
a breather Thursday to assess their progress and determine their
next moves.
	   Owners and players spent four days and a total of about 24 hours
since Saturday talking about the salary dispute that has postponed
the start of the NBA season.
	   Team owners decline to let their players on the court until the
dispute is settled, resulting in the first-ever cancellation of
regular-season NBA games. The season was scheduled to start Nov. 3,
but November's games already have been canceled.
	   Negotiators over the past few days have developed a loose
framework for what the next labor deal is going to look like.
	   So far, they know it will retain the ``Larry Bird'' exception,
change the rookie salary system, include some kind of ``tax'' on
the highest-paid players and increase minimum salaries for
long-term veterans.
	   The Larry Bird exemption allows clubs to disregard the league's
cap on total money paid out in salaries in order to re-sign their
own free agents.
	   The biggest hang-up remains what percentage of revenues will be
devoted to salaries by the time the new system has been in place
for a few years.
	   The owners have moved off their insistence upon getting the
percentage down from 57 percent to 48 percent, and the players have
moved off asking for 63 percent, sources involved in the talks told
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   ``There's still a pretty wide gap that separates the sides. But
at least we identified the sizes of the gaps between us,'' league
commissioner David Stern said early Thursday morning after an
eight-hour bargaining session ended.
	   Those gaps remain very large, and it will clearly take much more
movement and compromise to get to a point where a deal can be done.
	   The sides spoke by telephone Thursday and agreed to speak again
Friday. There are no bargaining sessions planned, and the owners
who sit on the league's negotiating committee have returned to
their home cities.
	   Over the next day or two, the other owners and the rank and file
players will be briefed on what has been accomplished.
	   The sides are talking about a hybrid system incorporating
aspects of each side's latest proposal. In the first two or three
years, there will be a tax on any owner who signs a player to a
high-end contract. The sides remain far apart on the threshold and
rates for such a tax.
	   After those first two or three years, if the percentage of
revenue devoted to player salaries fails to drop to an agreed-upon
level, an escrow tax of 10 percent will be withheld from some
players' paychecks. Both sides are widely separated on how many
players would contribute to the escrow fund.
	   In those ``escrow plan'' years, the sides would determine at the
end of each season how much revenue had been devoted to player
salaries. If the targeted number had been exceeded, a portion of
the escrow money would be returned to the owners and the rest would
go back to the players.
	   After trying each system for an equal number of years, there
would be one more year under either the tax system or the escrow
system.
	   ``Obviously, the parties are apart on variety of issues. We have
to see where they next place might be to make some progress,''
Stern said. ``There might be a framework, but there are so many
issues on the table _ and they are not trivial. We're going to
continue losing time.''
	   Asked if the lockout might be resolved in the next week, Stern
thought long and hard before answering.
	   ``I just don't know. I just don't know,'' he said.
	   ``If the parties are willing to split everything in the middle,
you can reach agreement in a quick period of time. But I don't
think either party is at that position,'' Stern said. ``That's just
the way it is. We're really far apart.''

Methuselah gene keeps fruit flies alive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Researchers at Cal Tech have discovered a gene
that lets fruit flies live longer and resist heat, starvation and
even poison.
	   Their work adds to the study of aging, though it is not the
first instance in which a gene has been found to be behind the
aging process. A different gene was previously associated with
aging in a type of worm.
	   The newly identified fruit fly gene, which they call
``methuselah'' after the long-lived man in the Bible, was found in
a search for life-extending mutations, according to a paper in
Friday's edition of the journal, Science. Genes are the basic units
of biological inheritance, coding for various traits in humans and
other living things.
	   Flies with this gene lived an average of 35 percent longer than
those without it, said researchers Yi-Juan Lin, Laurent Seroude and
Seymour Benzer. That amounted to extending a normal 60-day lifespan
to between 80 and 100 days for the flies, according to an
accompanying article in Science.
	   The California Institute of Technology researchers also tested
the flies' ability to resist high temperatures, starvation and the
pesticide paraquat. In all three cases those with the methuselah
gene lived longer than those without it.

 &UR; South African deputy president criticizes Truth Commission's action
 &UR; With BC-South Africa-Truth Commission

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
criticized the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for refusing to
include in its report the ANC's response to allegations it
committed abuses while fighting apartheid.
	   Mbeki, who is also president of the African National Congress
and is President Nelson Mandela's likely successor after elections
next year, said the ANC was awaiting Judge Wilfred Thring's reasons
for dismissing on Thursday the party's petition for a publication
ban on the Truth Commission's report.
	   The report condemned the ANC for killing civilians and suspected
traitors during its fight to overthrow white rule.
	   The ANC, notified ahead of time of the finding, responded that
it was ``proud'' of its fight for ``the destruction of a vile
system'' and asserted that ANC fighters ``did not resort to vile
methods of struggle on the basis that (any means) justified the
end.''
	   It was ``incorrect'' for the report to be released without the
ANC's written response, Mbeki told reporters Thursday in Cape Town.
	   ``This does not help the process for which the TRC was
established,'' Mbeki said.
	   The Truth Commission was established to examine the horrors of
apartheid in hopes of moving the country toward reconciliation.

Singhing praises for East Lake _ a 63 for Vijay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Vijay Singh had no complaints Thursday in the
Tour Championship.
	   One day after the PGA champion criticized the shaggy rough of
East Lake Golf Club as unfair, Singh shattered the course record
with a 7-under-par 63 for a three-stroke lead over Billy Mayfair in
the first round.
	   ``Unbelieveable,'' Singh said. ``That's probably the best I've
played in a long time.''
	   Singh had a chance for the lowest score ever in the Tour
Championship until a three-putt bogey from about 40 feet (12
meters) on the par-3 18th. His 63 tied the tournament record held
by three others and last set by Jim Gallagher Jr. in 1993.
	   It was easily enough to break the competitive scoring record on
East Lake since its redesign, a 66 by Larry Nelson in June 1997
during a U.S. Open qualifier. And it matched the best score ever by
Bobby Jones, who learned the game on East Lake.
	   ``I felt pretty good about my round,'' Payne Stewart said of his
1-under 69. ``Then I looked at the scoreboard and said, `OK, what
golf course is Vijay playing?'''
	   With narrow, sloping fairways and thick, punishing rough
reminiscent of a major championship, Singh made it look like he was
playing the Greater Milwaukee Open instead of a season-ending event
set up to test the best players of the year.
	   Oh, he still believes the rough is too difficult, but at least
he found an answer: Avoid it.
	   ``Tee to green, that's the best I've ever hit the ball,'' he
said.
	   Only eight players in the field of the top 30 money-winners
managed to break par on a sunny, breezy afternoon that made the
greens run faster as the day went on.
	   Tom Lehman, who hit all 18 greens in regulation, and Jim Furyk
were at 67. Another stroke back was Jeff Sluman and Justin Leonard,
who won the dlrs 4 million Players Championship in March and is
bidding to become just the third player to win the tour's two
richest events in the same season.
	   Stewart, Hal Sutton and Steve Stricker were at 69.
	   Singh's three-stroke lead is the largest after 18 holes since
Gallagher's 63 five years ago gave him a five-stroke advantage. He
went on to win by a stroke.
	   No one was ready to concede anything.
	   ``It's 72 holes of golf,'' said Stewart, who needs to win to
make the Presidents Cup team. ``It was a great round, but he's got
three more days of hitting the fairways, hitting the greens and
making the putts.''
	   That's not as simple as it sounds, as evidenced by some of the
other scores.
	   Defending champion David Duval, who has won seven tournaments in
his last 25 starts, was at 75. Tiger Woods took a double bogey-7 on
the ninth hole and failed to make a birdie in his round of 75 _ 12
strokes behind his playing partner, Singh.
	   Masters and British Open champion Mark O'Meara birdied three of
the last five holes to salvage a round of 71. U.S. Open champion
Lee Janzen wasn't so lucky _ he shot a 41 on the back nine for a
7-over 77, then stormed off to the clubhouse and said, ``Not
good.''
	   Mayfair, enjoying his best season since he won the Tour
Championship at Southern Hills in 1995, played bogey-free and got
his birdies in bunches _ all four of them in a five-hole stretch
starting on the par-5 ninth hole.

Hijackers commandeer Turkish Airlines flight
</HEADLINE>

site where Kurdish demands for independence was blocked. No

 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One or more hijackers claiming to be armed
with a hand grenade commandeered a Turkish Airlines domestic flight
Thursday. The pilot landed in Turkey's capital, where authorities
pressed for release of women and children among the 39 people
aboard.
	   The only reported demand in the hijacking was that the plane be
flown to Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   Instead, the six-member crew brought the Boeing 737 down at
Ankara's airport, apparently after initially misleading the
hijacker into thinking the flight was stopping in neighboring
Bulgaria for fuel, the news agency said.
	   At Ankara, authorities promised to let the plane refuel and take
off again if women and children aboard could go free, Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz said.
	   Refueling started after about 2 1/2 hours on the ground,
Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia news agency said, but there was no
immediate word on any of the hostages being let go.
	   Even as officials negotiated in hopes of a peaceful resolution,
authorities moved out security forces, sealed off the airport and
summoned ambulances and doctors.
	   Independent NTV television said the government deployed about 40
assault team members.
	   ``We hope the issue will come to an end without any
operations,'' said Cetin Ozbey, the airlines' deputy director.
	   NTV and Star television reported conversations with a passenger
who had a cell phone. The passenger variously described the
hijacker as a Kurdish militant and ``leftist revolutionary,''
according to the stations.
	   NTV said the hijacker also had a gun, and that he challenged the
crew to check for themselves that the weapons were real.
	   While first reports had only one hijacker, Turkish media later
put the number at two, citing security officials.
	   The flight had taken off from the southern city of Adana bound
for Ankara. Most of the 33 passengers were Turkish doctors on their
way to a medical convention, Anatolia said.
	   There were no obviously foreign names on the passenger list
released by the airline.
	   Many believed the hijacking timed to embarrass Turkey as it
marked Thursday's 75th anniversary of its founding as a secular
republic. Lausanne, the reported intended destination in the
hijacking, is significant to Kurds as the site where a 1919 treaty
ended a drive to create an independent Kurdish state.
	   ``This is clearly an attempt to cast a shadow on the 75th
anniversary celebrations,'' said Ozbey, the airlines' official.
	   Last week, the same plane was prevented from taking off from the
Strasbourg airport by protesters trying to prevent French officials
from deporting a Kurd to Turkey.
	   Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this year,
each time with no real weapons and with no injuries. The latest was
in September, when a man with a toy gun commandeered a domestic
flight to protest government restrictions on Islam.
	   In February, the hijacker was a man claiming to have a teddy
bear packed with explosives. Authorities said later he was mentally
ill.

	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ A yacht with 31 people aboard was
missing Thursday in the storm-roiled Caribbean, where Hurricane
Mitch killed 32 people before being downgraded to a tropical storm.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard airplane was searching for the boat, while
storm-driven floodwaters continued to rise on shore, cutting some
Central American communities off from food, water and medicine.
	   Mitch, which on Tuesday ranked among the century's most powerful
storms, weakened to a tropical storm on Thursday as it moved
slightly inland over Honduras.
	   At 2100 GMT, sustained winds were only 60 mph (95 kph), down
from 180 mph (290 kph) early Tuesday, though the storm was still
tearing into the same coastline and tourist islands it had been
lashing for three days.
	   Incessant rain along the coast has flooded at least 50 rivers,
knocking out bridges and highways and putting many towns under
water. More than 150,000 people were forced to seek higher ground
in the region, including Honduras, Nicaragua, Belize and Mexico.
	   Belizeans almost evacuated Belize City and other coastal towns.
Nicaragua was reporting that perhaps as many as 50,000 people had
been evacuated, and 20,000 tourists fled Mexican hotels.
	   Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had
been isolated, left without power, telephones or clean drinking
water. More than 72,000 people were staying in shelters, and
countless more were making do on their own.
	   ``My God, this thing is getting ugly,'' said 13-year-old Juan
Padilla of La Lima as he watched the swollen Chamelecon River sweep
cars, trees, cattle and pieces of houses down toward the Caribbean
Sea.
	   On the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 kms) off Honduras and
popular with divers and beachcombers, at least 14 people died and
many houses were destroyed. There were few details because the
islands were cut off except for occasional phone service.
	   In addition to the dead on the Bay Islands, Honduras reported
nine other deaths and Nicaragua eight. Mexico said an American was
thrown from his boat south of Cancun on Monday and was presumed
dead.
	   And the Antigua-registered Fantome, a 240-foot (73-meter)
sailing yacht with 31 people aboard, had been missing since
Tuesday, said the U.S. Coast Guard, which sent a C-130 plane to
search for it.
	   The Fantome, which is owned by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, was
on a six-day cruise near Belize and Honduras' Bay Islands when the
storm hit, Windjammer spokesman James Canty said.
	   He said the boat radioed Tuesday that it was heading east to
avoid the hurricane, and hadn't been heard from since. He said the
passengers were of various nationalities, but he didn't know which.
	   In La Lima, 110 miles (175 kms) northwest of the Honduran
capital, Tegucigalpa, entire neighborhoods were in waist-deep water
and hundreds of families had set up tents made of scraps of tarp
and wood on the highway that runs through town.
	   ``Last night the water just kept rising, so we decided to come
onto the highway,'' said Jose Antonio Galindo, 36, who makes his
living collecting firewood.
	   La Lima is in the Sula Valley, Honduras' richest agricultural
zone, filled with banana plantations and home to more than 200
factories. Officials said 40 percent of the 250,000-acre (100,000
hectare) valley was flooded _ and the waters were rising.
	   Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said grain, citrus and
banana crops had been damaged ``and the economic future of Honduras
is uncertain.''
	   In the short term, food, water and medicine already were running
out in communities isolated by the storm.
	   ``Today I just ate manioc with salt, and tomorrow I don't know
what I'll do,'' Maria Gonzalez, 28, said in the town of Tela on
Honduras' northern coast. She held her 6-month-old son Jose in her
arms.
	   In La Ceiba, which is cut off from the rest of the country by
two downed bridges, 15,600 of the city's 40,000 residents were
staying in 18 shelters, only some of which had any food at all.
Treated water also had run out, prompting warnings of epidemics.
	   ``You don't know what it is to have your children crying because
they're hungry, and to not be able to do anything,'' said Jorge
Tulio Romero, 31, who fled to a shelter with his children ages 5, 3
and 10 months. ``It's tremendously painful.''
	   The situation was even worse across the Saopin Bridge on La
Ceiba's east side. The bridge was gone, and a 65-yard (60-meter)
torrent passed below. Hundreds of people gathered on either side,
passing messages in a soda can.
	   ``We want food and water, please,'' one note read.
	   In the afternoon, firefighters rigged a rope across the water,
and people began shimmying across. It was an arduous trip, and they
had to pause repeatedly to catch their breath. At some points,
their backs skimmed the water.
	   The first one across was Victor Arteaga, 25, who was stranded on
the banana plantation where he works, cut off from his wife and two
daughters, ages 3 and 2.
	   ``I want to know how they are,'' he said, adding: ``Over there
there's nothing left _ no water, no food. I haven't eaten in three
days. I couldn't stand the hunger.''

Rubin wins Bell Challenge despite herself
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUEBEC (AP) _ For a while, it looked like Chanda Rubin was
struggling not to beat herself, never mind her opponent.
	   The American survived two match points and a series of sluggish
plays to defeat compatriot Mashona Washington 4-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4
in two hours 11 minutes at the Bell Challenge women's tennis
tournament Thursday.
	   Rubin, the fifth seed and the 38th-ranked player in the world,
advanced to the quarterfinals.
	   ``I'm happy to get through, but I certainly didn't play as well
as I could have,'' said Rubin. ``I'm not too pleased with some of
the things that happened in the match, especially giving away the
last game in the first set.''
	   That wasn't all.
	   In the second set, Rubin twice blew two-game leads and
squandered three break points that would have won the set and tied
the match. The set eventually went to a tiebreaker.
	   Washington led 6-4 in the tiebreaker on Rubin's unforced errors,
but she couldn't finish and Rubin escaped with a 9-7 win.
	   The third set mirrored the second.
	   Rubin won the first game, but blew three break points in the
next. She eventually broke in the sixth game to take a 4-2 lead,
but was broken in her next service game.
	   The Louisiana native won the final two games after failing to
capitalize on three more break chances in the eighth game.
	   In an earlier match, American Jane Chi, the last player to
receive a direct entry into the tournament, defeated Czech Denisa
Chladkova 6-2, 6-2 to reach her first tour quarterfinal.
	   Chi was content to put the ball in play and let Chladkova
self-destruct in another match that was filled with unforced
errors.
	   Chladkova has had a difficult season. Her ranking plummeted more
than 60 places after a first-round loss at Wimbledon and now stands
at 148. The 19-year-old made it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon
in 1997.
	   Toronto's Sonya Jeyaseelan, the only Canadian left in the
tournament, was to meet American Alexandra Stevenson in her second
round singles match in the evening and then play a late doubles
match.

Explosion damages Greek bank branch in Athens suburb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A propane gas canister bomb exploded early
Friday outside a suburban Athens branch of the state-owned Ionian
Bank, causing damage but no injuries, police said.
	   The explosive device, consisting of camping gas canisters soaked
in gasoline, exploded at 1:00 a.m. (2300 GMT Thursday), seriously
damaging the bank branch in the northern suburb of Maroussi.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but shadowy
anarchist groups little known to authorities have over the past
year claimed more than 100 attacks on cars and offices belonging to
policemen, officials, politicians, diplomats, journalists and
foreigners.
	   Last weekend, a time bomb exploded outside a government tax
office in the Athens port of Piraeus, causing damages but no
injuries. Five cars were also burnt and five others were seriously
damaged in a Saturday spate of attacks by anarchists. There was no
claim of responsibility in either of the attacks.
	   The last attack against a bank occured in the same suburb last
August, when a propane gas canister bomb damaged a branch office of
the Banque National de Paris.

Explosion damages Greek bank branch in Athens suburb

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A propane gas canister bomb exploded early
Friday outside a suburban Athens branch of the state-owned Ionian
Bank, causing damage but no injuries, police said.
	   The explosive device, consisting of 29 camping gas canisters
soaked in gasoline, exploded at 1:00 a.m. (2300 GMT Thursday),
seriously damaging the bank branch in the northern suburb of
Maroussi. It was the largest ever number of canisters ever used in
such an attack.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but shadowy
anarchist groups little known to authorities have over the past
year claimed more than 100 attacks on cars and offices belonging to
policemen, officials, politicians, diplomats, journalists and
foreigners.
	   Last weekend, a time bomb exploded outside a government tax
office in the Athens port of Piraeus, causing damages but no
injuries. Five cars were also burnt and five others were seriously
damaged in a Saturday spate of attacks by anarchists. There was no
claim of responsibility in either of the attacks.
	   The last attack against a bank occured in the same suburb last
August, when a propane gas canister bomb damaged a branch office of
the Banque National de Paris.

Former Cabinet Minister withdraws as candidate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former Cabinet minister who resigned his job
after being mugged by a stranger he picked up withdrew Thursday as
a candidate to lead Wales' new assembly.
	   ``Ron Davies has decided to withdraw as Labor's candidate as
leader of the national assembly of Wales,'' a spokesman for Davies,
speaking on terms of customary anonymity, said on Thursday. ``He
has reached the decision in the interests of the Labor Party, the
assembly and above all, his family.''
	   Scotland Yard said Thursday that two more people had been
arrested in connection with the crime. Three others had already
been arrested and released without charges.
	   Davies has said that while walking on Monday night on Clapham
Common, a south London park with a reputation as a meeting place
for homosexuals, he was approached by a male stranger, started
chatting and accepted an invitation to pick up two of the
strangers' friends and go to the man's apartment for a meal. He was
later robbed of his wallet, mobile phone and car, he said.
	   Newspaper reports have implied that the incident was linked to
sex or illegal drugs, but Davies has denied impropriety. He has
made no public appearance since his resignation Tuesday.
	   Davies almost certainly would have become the First Minister _
the equivalent of Welsh prime minister _ when the principality gets
its first separate assembly next May, and led last year's
referendum in favor of the assembly.
	   The Welsh body will have power to distribute most of the annual
grant from the central government for health, education, transport,
arts and culture, but no power to tax the 2.7 million Welsh nor to
make laws.

Report: Mitsui Trust Bank to withdraw from overseas operations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. takes an ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. will close down all
its overseas banking operations, while establishing a trust venture
in Japan with a U.S. bank, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Under a sweeping restructuring plan, Mitsui Trust is withdrawing
from less-profitable operations to focus on its domestic
asset-management and retail-trust businesses to stay competitive at
home, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported.
	   The reported move by Japan's third-largest trust bank would be
the latest retreat from foreign markets by Japanese financial
institutions amid the nation's worst recession since the end of
World War II. Daiwa Bank Ltd. announced its withdrawal from
overseas banking last week.
	   Mitsui Trust is currently negotiating with State Street Bank and
Trust Co. to have the planned joint venture assume part of Mitsui
Trust's asset-management business, the Nihon Keizai said.
	   Mitsui Trust will also transfer its foreign custody business to
State Street, and the two companies will jointly offer trustee
services for investment trusts, the daily said.
	   Mitsui Trust, which has down-sized its overseas operations the
last few years, will close its remaining foreign branches in New
York, London and Hong Kong by March 31, 1999, Japan's top business
daily said.
	   Its New York and London units will hand in their banking
licenses and become investment-advisory firms, while the trust bank
will also sell all its overseas loans, according to the paper.
	   After withdrawing from overseas operations, Mitsui Trust will
only be required to meet the domestic capital-ratio requirement of
4 percent, which will give it a capital surplus of about 600
billion yen (dlrs 5.1 billion), the report said.
	   The daily also said the bank plans to enhance its capital base
further by requesting an injection of public funds under recently
passed legislation aimed at cleaning up Japan's debt-saddled
banking system.

Peru to complete sell-off of state companies in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peru will sell off the remaining state
companies it plans to privatize by the end of 1999, bringing in
about dlrs 1 billion, the head of the government's privatization
commission said.
	   The privatization program was started by President Alberto
Fujimori in 1992 and has earned more than dlrs 7 billion to date,
led by the 1994 sale of the state telephone company for dlrs 2
billion.
	   But several sales slated for this year were delayed by the world
economic crisis, leading to fears that the government's commitment
to privatization might be wavering.
	   ``The Peruvian government has the will to continue the
privatization process,'' privatization chief Jorge Gonzalez
Izquierdo said Thursday.
	   Among the state companies to be sold is the Cerro de Pasco mine,
one of Peru's largest producers of zinc, lead and silver, which
will be privatized in March 1999, he said.
	   State-owned phosphate fields, forests, the train system, part of
the country's electricity distribution grid, and concessions to
operate ports, airports and roads will also be sold, he said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks ended a brief slump Thursday,
rallying as fund managers spruced up portfolios with popular names
before the close of their fiscal year. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 123.06 points _ or by nearly 1.5 percent _ to
8,495.03, the biggest gain in nearly two weeks. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Wages and salaries paid to American workers
rose by 3.7 percent over the past year, the biggest increase in
more than six years. The rise for the year ended in September shows
workers still are benefiting from two years of robust economic
growth, which slowed this spring as spillover from world financial
turmoil hurt American trade. But, before that happened,
unemployment sank to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent in April in May,
forcing employers to increase compensation faster than inflation in
order to attract and retain qualified workers. During the year
covered by Thursday's Labor Department report, consumer prices rose
less than 2 percent. (US-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While insisting that Russia is under no threat of
food shortages, the agriculture minister conceded Thursday that the
country is holding ``consultations'' with the United States about
humanitarian aid. Since the economic crisis hit in mid-August, a
fall in food imports that came on top of an unusually low harvest
has led to serious concerns that Russia may not have enough food
for the winter. Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor Semyonov said
the problem was not in any actual lack of food, but in getting it
to all the regions and selling it at prices that poor people can
afford. He refused to confirm reports that Russia has asked for
humanitarian aid from the West but said the possibility has been
considered, and donated food would be helpful. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The sale of the ailing bank Credit Lyonnais will go
ahead in the first half of next year, markets willing, French
Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn announced Thursday. But he
made clear that France's Socialist-led government has built in a
protection structure against hostile suitors. A careful shareholder
structure ``is the best way to guarantee the interests of the
state, the bank, employees and tax payers,'' Strauss-Kahn told a
news conference. The government plans to construct a core minority
share holding group in the bank, holding less than a one-third
stake and made up of Credit Lyonnais' current commercial partners,
or any new investors who want to set up commercial ties with the
bank, he said. (FRANCE-CREDIT LYONNAIS)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey and four former Soviet republics
signed a declaration Thursday in favor of the U.S.-backed route for
bringing oil from the Caspian Sea to Europe. The pledge by Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel and his counterparts in Azerbaijan,
Kazakstan, Uzbekistan and Georgia sends a strong message to oil
companies, who are said to prefer a cheaper and shorter route than
the pipeline Washington wants them to build through Turkey.
Washington prefers to see the oil from the Caspian Sea, the world's
second-richest oil reserves after the Middle East, passing through
an allied country like Turkey, rather than hostile Iran, which has
also proposed a route. (TURKEY-CASPIAN OIL)
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Europe's largest forest products
company, UPM-Kymmene, increased its nine-month pretax profit 62
percent this year to 7.57 billion markkaa (dlrs 1.51 billion),
mainly because of higher paper prices and capital gains. Last year,
the group's pretax profit for the same period was 4.68 billion
markkaa, the company said Thursday. Net sales from January to
September fell slightly to 37.47 billion markkaa (dlrs 7.49
billion), from 37.73 billion markkaa in 1997. The company warned
that uncertainty over ``future economic trends'' has started to
reduce demand for paper, and that demand for packaging material and
special products is expected to weaken as a result of economic
difficulties in Asia and Russia. (FINLAND-EARNS-UPM-KYMMENE)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The price of cocoa _ a major export earner for
west African states such as Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Cameroon and
Nigeria _ has dropped to an eight-month low, according to data
released Thursday by the International Cocoa Organization. The
London-based intergovernmental agency's latest daily cocoa market
indicator price has fallen to dlrs 1,609.28 per metric ton from
dlrs 1,629.16 in February. Traders said that the market's recent
decline was due to worries about consumption prospects caused by
Russia's economic problems and improving new-season crop prospects
in the key West African producing region. (BRITAIN-COCOA)

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman accepted a
``substantial'' settlement Thursday from a newspaper that reported
he was gay and their marriage was a sham to cover it up.
	   Cruise showed up in court to hear a public apology from Express
Newspapers for a ``highly offensive'' article in the Oct. 5, 1997,
Express on Sunday Magazine, which also said he was impotent and
sterile.
	   ``I don't take a whole lot of pleasure in being here today,'' he
said later. ``It is the last recourse against those that published
vicious lies about me and my family. I have to protect them. This
was certainly not about money. Every penny of this very substantial
sum will be donated to charities.''
	   The amount of the settlement was undisclosed, but Express
Newspapers is believed to have paid more than dlrs 167,000 to each
of the two actors and their legal costs of about dlrs 250,000.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Luciano Pavarotti is shaping up at an Italian
spa near Austria.
	   ``I feel very, very well. I was just out to walk in the
mountains; I just returned,'' he said Thursday from Merano, Italy.
``I used a cane. If you walk in the mountains, go up and down, you
must have the cane.''
	   Rumors of retirement swept the opera world last week when
Pavarotti canceled three Met appearances in November, citing more
recuperation time needed from hip replacement and knee replacement
surgery over the summer.
	   Pavarotti, 63, told The Associated Press he hopes to do without
the cane Nov. 22, when he'll perform at a gala marking the 30th
anniversary of his Metropolitan Opera debut.
	   The superstar tenor plans to spend 10 days at the spa, where he
arrived Wednesday, taking walks and exercising in a pool.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Princess Diana's former butler will run in the
New York City Marathon on Sunday to raise funds in her memory.
	   Paul Burrell is raising money for the Diana, Princess of Wales
Memorial Fund, said Paula Turner, a marathon spokeswoman.
	   Burrell, who went to work for Diana in 1980, has traveled widely
as fund-raising manager for the fund, which provides money for such
charities as the international campaign against land mines.
	   Princess Diana died last year in a car crash.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles jilted
photographers Thursday at the wedding of friends by showing up 20
minutes apart.
	   The paramours dashed media hopes that they would mark their
first appearance as a couple at the nuptials of Santa
Palmer-Tomkinson and Simon Sebag-Montefiore.
	   Charles brought along 14-year-old Harry. Mrs. Parker Bowles, who
is divorced, arrived before him with her two grown children.
	   The couple broke precedent on Sunday by issuing their first
joint statement to deny cooperating in a new book that contains
damaging allegations about Charles' former wife, the late Princess
Diana.
	   While Britons have warmed to Charles since Diana's death,
opinion polls show a majority of people still object to the
possibility of the heir to the throne marrying Mrs. Parker Bowles.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Call it the airborne version of Russian roulette.
	   Aeroflot, Russia's largest airline, announced a great deal
Thursday on roundtrip tickets to and from the United States _ only
dlrs 260. The catch: Buyers have to agree to randomly selected
dates of departure.
	   As explained by the ITAR-Tass news agency, Aeroflot has
developed and patented a new ticket-selling technology that it
plans to begin using on flights between Moscow and Washington,
Chicago and New York.
	   The technology, called ``Z-tariff,'' uses an automatic booking
system in which customers are allowed to choose only their
destination and length of stay within a three-month period. The
computer then selects the departure date.
	   The system has obvious advantages for the airline, which can
fill otherwise underbooked flights. Airline officials also noted,
rather obviously, that the system works best for customers who are
``insensitive'' to time pressures.

Top track and field athlete jailed over drug importing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Olympic decathlete Simon Poelman
was jailed for 5-1/2 years Friday after being found guilty of
importing New Zealand dlrs 200,000 (U.S. dlrs 100,000) worth of
party drug ecstasy into New Zealand.
	   Poelman, 35, had denied the charge and showed no emotion when
the sentence was announced in the High Court.
	   Outside the courthouse, defense counsel Peter Kaye said
Poelman's reaction to the jail term was a ``complete sense of
relief that it's over''.
	   Kaye said Poelman maintained his innocence and was considering
an appeal.
	   Poelman had been on remand in prison since a jury found him
guilty three weeks ago of importing a class B drug, an offense that
carries a maximum penalty of 14 years.
	   Customs officials said the seizure, comprising 1990 tablets, was
the second largest involving ecstasy in New Zealand history.
	   The case arose from a visit Poelman made to the Netherlands and
Belgium in September and October last year. During the three-day
trial, the Crown alleged that Poelman, while in the Belgian city of
Antwerp, sent a toy rabbit filled with the drugs to an unsuspecting
businessman friend in Auckland.
	   But the athlete denied buying the drugs or putting them in the
rabbit and said he handed the parcel containing the toy to a Dutch
friend to post.
	   Poelman was New Zealand's decathlon representative at the
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in September, but won
no medals.
	   He made his Commonwealth Games debut in Edinburgh in 1986, when
he won a bronze medal in the decathlon.
	   In the 1990 Auckland Games, he grabbed silver in the same event
and bronze in the pole vault.
	   Poelman also represented New Zealand at the 1988 and 1992
Olympics, and was once ranked as high as sixth in the world in the
decathlon.

Police disperse anti-Pinochet demonstrators in Santiago

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chilean police used water cannons to
disperse hundreds of mostly young demonstrators supporting the
arrest of former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet and demanding that
he be tried for human rights abuses.
	   The demonstrators first gathered in a plaza near downtown
Santiago on Thursday but helmeted riot police prevented them from
marching, as the government has banned street demonstrations.
	   The protesters dispersed, then regrouped repeatedly in small
groups to fight skirmishes with police throughout the downtown
area.
	   Police did not immediately report any arrests or injuries, but
reporters saw several demonstrators detained and taken to police
buses.
	   The protesters chanted slogans against Pinochet, who on
Wednesday won a legal victory when the High Court of London ruled
that he has state immunity against prosecution. He remains under
arrest because the Chamber of Lords must decide on an appeal.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London at the request of a
Spanish judge who wants to try him for genocide, terrorism and
torture during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   On Thursday, the 82-year-old former ruler was transferred to an
undisclosed London hospital from the private clinic where he had
been recovering from back surgery he underwent on Oct. 9.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG (AP) _ ``It's over. Whoopee!'' shouted a jubilant
Archbishop Desmond Tutu just before he handed President Nelson
Mandela a long-awaited report laying bare abuses committed on both
sides during apartheid.
	   Then the two danced a jig together, to the delight of onlookers
at a Pretoria convention center.
	   They were celebrating the release Thursday of one of the most
important documents ever produced in this nation's tortured
history. Compiled over 2 1/2 years by the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, it is based on some 21,000 statements from apartheid's
victims and perpetrators and represents a purging of South Africa's
dark past.
	   But as Truth Commission chairman Tutu and others point out,
although the sweeping report is now complete, the work of national
reconciliation is just beginning.
	   ``If reconciliation and unity are to become a reality in South
Africa, the energy and commitment of all its people will be
required,'' the 2,750-page report concludes.
	   The report laid the heaviest burden of guilt on white
governments that made non-whites second-class citizens and
ruthlessly crushed dissent. The commissioners accused top officials
who served on the secretive State Security Council of sanctioning
killings, torture and beatings of political opponents.
	   ``The recognition of apartheid as a crime against humanity
remains a fundamental starting point for reconciliation in South
Africa,'' the commissioners wrote.
	   In particular, the report said former President P.W. Botha, the
apartheid state's last hard-line leader, who ruled from 1978 to
1989, ``contributed to and facilitated a climate in which ... gross
violations of human rights could and did occur and as such is
accountable for such violations.''
	   The commission can grant amnesty to those who fully confess to
politically motivated crimes. Botha says he has nothing to confess
to. He can still be prosecuted in criminal court.
	   The report, contained in five hard-cover volumes, is sometimes
difficult to read. Thousands of prisoners were beaten, given
electric shocks and raped during apartheid.
	   ``The only thing that really made me break was when they
threatened to kidnap my 4-year-old nephew, Christopher, bring him
to the 13th floor and drop him out the window,'' anti-apartheid
activist Zahrah Narkedien is quoted as testifying at one of the
commission's hearings, which were held across the country.
	   Narkedien said she will never recover from her seven months in
solitary confinement.
	   ``I was damaged. A part of my soul was eaten away as if by
maggots .. and I will never get it back again,'' the report quotes
her as saying.
	   The report also blames the African National Congress, which
waged a guerrilla campaign to overthrow apartheid and has led the
country since 1994's first all-race elections.
	   While the ANC and other groups conducted ``legitimate
struggles,'' they ``committed gross violations of human rights ...
for which they are morally and politically accountable,'' the
report said.
	   The ANC ``routinely used torture'' on suspected spies and
dissidents, planted land mines that killed farm laborers and their
families and killed innocent civilians in bomb blasts.
	   The ANC filed suit to block the report's release, saying it
lacked the party's response. Early Thursday, a judge blocked the
lawsuit, allowing Tutu to present the report to Mandela.
	   The AN had responded that it was ``proud'' of its fight for
``the destruction of a vile system'' and asserted that ANC fighters
``did not resort to vile methods of struggle on the basis that (any
means) justified the end.''
	   On Thursday, Mandela conceded that the report would not produce
instant reconciliation.
	   ``Its release is bound to reawaken many of the difficult and
troubling emotions that the hearings themselves brought,'' said
Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison for fighting apartheid.
	   The ANC's legal maneuvering outraged Tutu, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1984 for his anti-apartheid efforts.
	   ``I have struggled against a tyranny. I didn't do that in order
to substitute it with another,'' he told journalists.
	   But his anger did not carry over to Mandela, a fellow Nobel
laureate and a symbol of the nation's capacity to forgive. Thus the
little dance performed by the two old warriors.
	   The commission said the president should call a national summit
in 1999 to ensure all sectors of society are involved in
considering its recommendations, and urged people to ``reach out to
fellow South Africans in a spirit of tolerance and understanding.
	   ``It is up to each individual to respond by committing ourselves
to concrete ways of easing the burden of the oppressed and
empowering the poor.''

category codes:
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ John Glenn has roared back into
space, retracing the trail he blazed for America's astronauts 36
years ago. ``Boy, enjoying the show,'' Glenn said as Discovery
soared 340 miles (550 kilometers) over Hawaii three hours into the
flight Thursday. ``This is beautiful. It's still a trite old
statement: Zero-G (gravity) and I feel fine,'' he added, repeating
the words of his first flight. Glenn, the first American in orbit
on Feb. 20, 1962, became at age 77 the world's oldest space
traveler when he and six crewmates lifted off aboard the shuttle
Discovery at 2:19 p.m. EST (1919 GMT). Discovery's U.S., Japanese
and Spanish crew will spend the next week conducting not only
medical and other laboratory experiments, but releasing a
sun-gazing satellite and a small Navy communication satellite.

	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ An Islamic militant
rammed an explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep that was
escorting a bus full of elementary school students. Thursday's
blast killed the attacker and a soldier. An Israeli commander said
the jeep swerved to keep the car away from the children. The
anti-Israeli group Hamas claimed responsibility for the suicide
attack that also injured three Israelis and four Palestinians.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and told him he must wage all-out war on terrorism if
he wants Israel to pull back troops in the West Bank over the next
12 weeks, as promised. Arafat vowed to track down the masterminds
of the bombing, and in a first step, dozens of Hamas activists,
including its spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin, were arrested in
Gaza. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One or more hijackers claiming to be armed
with a hand grenade commandeered a Turkish Airlines domestic flight
Thursday. The only reported demand was that the plane be flown to
Lausanne, Switzerland. But the pilot landed in Turkey's capital,
Ankara, where authorities pressed for release of women and children
among the 39 people aboard the Boeing 737. Even as officials began
refueling the plane and negotiated in hopes of a peaceful
resolution, authorities moved out security forces, sealed off the
airport and summoned ambulances and doctors. NTV and Star
television reported conversations with a passenger who had a cell
phone. The passenger variously described the hijacker as a Kurdish
militant and ``leftist revolutionary,'' according to the stations.
(TURKEY-HIJACKING)
	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ A yacht with 31 people aboard was
missing Thursday in the storm-roiled Caribbean, where Hurricane
Mitch killed 32 people before being downgraded to a tropical storm.
A U.S. Coast Guard airplane was searching for the boat, while
storm-driven floodwaters continued to rise on shore, cutting some
Central American communities off from food, water and medicine.
Mitch, which on Tuesday ranked among the century's most powerful
storms, weakened to a tropical storm on Thursday as it moved
slightly inland over Honduras. Incessant rain along the coast has
flooded at least 50 rivers in Honduras, knocking out bridges and
highways and putting many towns under water. More than 150,000
people were forced to seek higher ground in the region, including
Honduras, Nicaragua, Belize and Mexico. (HURRICANE MITCH)
	   JOHANNESBURG (AP) _ ``It's over. Whoopee!'' shouted a jubilant
Archbishop Desmond Tutu just before he handed President Nelson
Mandela a long-awaited report laying bare abuses committed on both
sides during apartheid. Then the two danced a jig together, to the
delight of onlookers at a Pretoria convention center. They were
celebrating the release Thursday of one of the most important
documents ever produced in this nation's tortured history. Compiled
over 2 1/2 years by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it is
based on some 21,000 statements from apartheid's victims and
perpetrators and represents a purging of South Africa's dark past.
But as Truth Commission chairman Tutu and others point out,
although the sweeping report is now complete, the work of national
reconciliation is just beginning. (SOUTH AFRICA-TRUTH COMMISSION)

National Court meets to rule on Pinochet extradition bid

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish judge trying to have former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet extradited from Britain faces a
key day in court.
	   The judge, Baltasar Garzon, and a colleague have been probing
human rights crimes in Argentina and Chile in the 1970s and 1980s.
As a spinoff off that two-year investigation, Garzon had Pinochet
arrested in London on Oct. 16.
	   An 11-judge panel of the National Court was to meet Friday to
rule on an appeal by prosecutors who say Garzon and colleague
Manuel Garcia Castellon lack jurisdiction to carry out such a
probe.
	   That motion pre-dates Pinochet's arrest, so the case is not
directly linked to Pinochet's detention on a Spanish warrant after
he arrived in London for medical treatment.
	   But if the judges were to rule against Garzon, he would be left
seeking the extradition of someone he has charged in a case his
superiors say he had no business bringing in the first place.
	   Such a ruling would be expected to force Garzon to drop his
drive to extradite Pinochet as well as the parallel probes that led
to his arrest. Garzon is considered unlikely to appeal if he loses.
	   Pinochet, who seized power in 1973 and ruled for 17 years, has
been widely accused of running a ruthless regime. During his rule,
4,299 political opponents died or disappeared, according to a
Chilean government report.
	   Garzon says that under Spanish law he can go after Pinochet on
grounds that the ex-despot, now 82, committed genocide by trying to
wipe out his political opponents. In his arrest warrant he also
accuses Pinochet of terrorism and torture.
	   Although Britain's High Court ruled Wednesday that Pinochet has
diplomatic immunity, Garzon was expected to keep trying to
extradite him if the National Court backs him, Spanish news reports
said.
	   In Madrid on Thursday, about 100 demonstrators chanted
``Pinochet, murderer'' outside the National Court as it heard
arguments in the case.
	   National Court prosecutor Pedro Rubira insisted that
jurisdiction for human rights crimes committed in Argentina and
Chile lies within those countries, not Spain.
	   ``No country is above another,'' Rubira told the panel. ``No
country has more jurisdiction than another.''
	   He added that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
political opponents that died under his regime were not persecuted
because of their race or religion.
	   But Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer for families of junta victims in
Argentina, said, ``The motive does not matter. Pinochet is guilty
of genocide because he tried to eliminate an entire group of
people.''
	   Another lawyer, Juan Garces, representing families of junta
victims in Chile, drew applause from about 100 spectators in the
court chamber when he said: ``Let justice be done. Let's help
humanity.''
	   The Spanish probes of Chile and Argentina intersect because
Pinochet is accused of taking part in so-called Operation Condor,
in which several military juntas in South America teamed up in the
1970s and 1980s to help each other crush what they perceived as a
communist threat.
	   Pinochet remains in custody in Britain pending appeals of the
High Court ruling that he cannot be arrested because he was head of
state at the time the crimes cited against him were allegedly
committed.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook insisted that
the government was not embarrassed by the verdict. ``The Foreign
Office has consistently taken the position that we want to see due
process of law carried out,'' he said.
	   Also Thursday, lawyers for Pinochet pressed for him to be
released on bail. A hearing was expected in the next few days.

Swift reverberations from suicide blast aimed at school bus

<TEXT>
	   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) _ It took only a second for
Israeli soldiers escorting the school bus to realize something was
terribly wrong. Within moments, two people were dead. Within hours,
Yasser Arafat launched an unprecedented crackdown on Islamic
militants.
	   Arafat put Sheik Ahmed Yassin under house arrest Thursday after
his militant Islamic group, Hamas, claimed responsibility for the
bombing that targeted the red-and-white bus full of elementary
school children.
	   The 40 students on board were saved _ not a single one was hurt
_ but the car bomb killed an Israeli soldier in the jeep, a
19-year-old immigrant from Ukraine now being praised as a fallen
hero.
	   Political reverberations from the first suicide attack on
Israelis in six months were swift. Coming only six days after the
signing of a land-for-security agreement in Washington, it was a
destabilizing new factor in what is already a highly delicate
prelude to implementing the accord. That process is to start next
week.
	   Blocking the pact is the avowed goal of Hamas, which bitterly
opposes any peace with Israel. Hamas has carried out attacks that
have killed scores of Israelis.
	   As the bus from Kfar Darom, an isolated Jewish settlement in the
heart of the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip, passed a busy
intersection Thursday, a car with Palestinian plates tried to cut
into the convoy and ram it.
	   The lead army jeep, one of two escorting the bus, rushed to
block the car's path _ and took the brunt of a blast so powerful it
flipped the jeep like a toy, leaving it lying charred and mangled
in the soft, early morning light.
	   It was a suicide blast; the car's driver died too. Six others _
three Israelis and three Palestinians _ were wounded. Israeli
troops quickly sealed off the Gaza Strip, preventing any
Palestinians from leaving.
	   In response, Arafat's Palestinian Authority took what has been
one of its strongest steps ever against Hamas: it placed Yassin,
the group's spiritual leader who has been nearly paralyzed and in a
wheelchair since an accident as a teen, under house arrest.
Officers sealed off the sandy slum streets near Yassin's house in
Gaza City and questioned passers by.
	   The house arrest was a stunning move by Arafat, who in the year
since Yassin's release from an Israeli jail has bent over backward
to avoid open conflict with him.
	   Yassin, who has a relatively small but extraordinarily devout
following, customarily disavows direct knowledge of actions by
Hamas' military arm and tries to play down any rivalry with Arafat.
Earlier in the day, he said the group did not want a bloody
confrontation with the Palestinian Authority.
	   The claim of responsibility came in a call to Israel radio, and
the caller hinted that more violence was in the offing. ``It's a
revolution until victory,'' he said.
	   That theme was echoed by a Hamas official in the West Bank, who
said the group saw itself targeted by the new peace agreement,
which explicitly calls on Arafat to crack down hard on Islamic
militants. In launching attacks, the official said, Hamas feels it
has nothing left to lose.
	   It's a tactic that has worked before for Hamas. After the
signing of the Oslo accords, a series of suicide-bombings paralyzed
negotiations and helped pave the way for the election of hard-line
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu, who is already under intense pressure from right-wing
settlers and their supporters to back out of the deal, telephoned
Arafat after the attack to say the Palestinians must wage all-out
war on terrorism if Israel is to pull back troops in the West Bank
over the next 12 weeks, as promised.
	   Arafat replied by denouncing the bombing and vowing to track
down its masterminds. Even before the move against Yassin, dozens
of Hamas activists were rounded up.
	   For the children who were aboard the bus, it was an
all-too-early lesson in just the kind of threat their settler
parents and teachers have been talking about endlessly since the
accord's signing.
	   Nine-year-old Eran Ayoube, who comes from a religious family,
was just finishing the traveler's prayer that Orthodox Jews recite
for journeys when the blast hit. ``Amen,'' he said, just before the
explosion blew out the bus windows.
	   Children shrieked and cried; smoke billowed. The driver shouted
at them to drop to the floor for cover.
	   ``I thought I was going to be burned,'' Eran's sister Adar, 10,
said afterward as she perched on her bicycle outside her house in
Kfar Darom.
	   Outside, the scene was terrible. ``Oil, gas, blood,'' Gaza
settler Yigal Kirshenzach said as he described the aftermath to
Israel radio. ``(Body) parts are scattered all over.''
	   Black debris were flung over a 50-yard (45 meter) radius. A
shoe, scorched black, lay in the middle of the road.
	   Afterward, the bus took the children to school in the Gush Katif
settlement bloc instead of home, on the theory that trying to stay
on their normal schedule was the best way for them to learn to
cope.
	   At school, the children were encouraged to talk to their
teachers and counselors. Their principal, Yitzhak Amitai, said they
described the boom, the flames and smoke.

	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Home is an isolated Jewish enclave
in the heart of the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip, where greenery and
swing sets contrast sharply with barbed wire and watch towers. But
to the settlers living here _ especially the children _ it's a safe
haven.
	   Out on the road _ beyond the fence _ a suicide-bomber tried to
take the lives of 40 elementary school pupils aboard a school bus
Thursday.
	   ``I feel less scared here,'' said 12-year-old Reut, sitting on
the grass and munching a cookie. Her father stood nearby, a
holstered pistol clipped to his belt, next to the ritual fringe of
his prayer shawl.
	   Just a few hours earlier and about a mile (kilometer) away, an
Islamic militant rammed his bomb-packed car into an army jeep
escorting Reut's bus on its way to school in another Jewish
settlement.
	   Screaming, she and her friends had fallen to the floor as dense
smoke poured in through the shattered windows.
	   In what parents called a ``miracle,'' the front and side of the
red-and-white school bus was blackened, but none of the children,
aged 6 and up, were injured. An Israeli soldier and the attacker
were killed.
	   Six hours after the bombing, the shady streets of Kfar Darom
seemed serene. Packs of children on bicycles wove their way along
sidewalks, and toys dotted lawns adorned with plastic garden
furniture.
	   Even so, when the children spoke, it was not about games and
toys, but of thunderous booms, bombs, smoke and death.
	   Eran Ayoube, a 9-year-old boy with large somber eyes and a
freckled face, said he had just finished his daily traveler's
prayer and said ``amen'' when a loud boom rocked the school bus.
	   Eran stared at the ground in silence as his 10-year-old sister
Adar spoke about their horrifying morning.
	   ``There was smoke all around, all the kids started to cry,''
Adar said, perched on her bicycle. ``I started to cry because I was
scared. I thought I was going to be burned. I thought they had
thrown a firebomb at us.''
	   Life in Kfar Darom, which 250 people call home, is a mix of
military barracks _ security checks, army convoys and soldiers
carrying assault rifles _ and suburban subdivision with manicured
lawns and spacious villas with red-tile roofs.
	   ``I'm used to it,'' Adar said. Before she could elaborate, she
was hushed by her teen-aged babysitter.
	   Eran and Adar Ayoube, whose father was killed three years ago in
a West Bank drive-by shooting, promptly got back on their bicycles
and peddled off.
	   David Shanbaum, 30, a student in a Jewish seminary and the
father of four who immigrated from Los Angeles, stood next to a
jungle gym set in the sand outside his house and said he felt safer
living in Kfar Darom than in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.
	   ``The kids can run around,'' Shanbaum said. ``It is one big
park.''

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the Hamas
spiritual leader placed under house arrest by Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority, is a charismatic figure and an unyielding
ideologue.
	   The Islamic preacher was left almost completely paralyzed and in
a wheelchair after a sports accident as a teen, but that did not
prevent him from founding Hamas 10 years ago and serving as the
driving force behind the radical group's bitter opposition to any
peace with Israel.
	   Since his release from Israeli jail 13 months ago, Yassin, 63,
has been a thorn in Arafat's side. Until his detention Thursday,
though, the Palestinian leader had refrained from moving openly
against him, mindful of Yassin's popularity in the slums of Gaza.
	   Like many of the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank, Yassin is a refugee. His family, from what is now the Israeli
city of Ashkelon, was uprooted in 1948 with Israel's founding, and
Yassin grew up in Palestinian refugee camps.
	   In the years leading up to the Palestinian uprising, or
intefadeh, he made a name for himself as an Islamic preacher and
spiritual leader. He would preach sermons, receive disciples and
settle community disputes.
	   With the outbreak of the intefadeh in December 1987, Yassin
founded Hamas _ which means ``zeal'' and is also the Arabic acronym
for Islamic Resistance Movement.
	   Sentenced to life in prison for organizing attacks on civilians
and ordering the killing of an Israeli soldier, Yassin suffered
from a variety of ailments in jail. He is nearly blind, with
chronic bronchitis and hearing problems.
	   Israeli officials privately worried he might die in prison and
set off riots. Last September, though, he was freed to ransom two
Israeli Mossad agents who botched an effort to assassinate another
Hamas leader in neighboring Jordan.
	   Yassin returned to a tumultuous welcome in Gaza.
	   In February, Yassin left the Palestinian lands, supposedly for
medical treatment, but instead spent several months touring Arab
countries, raising funds for Hamas and boosting its prestige.
	   During the tour, he urged a return to the armed struggle and
harshly criticized Arafat for choosing to try to make peace with
Israel.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Fighting in eastern Congo could have
disastrous consequences for wildlife, including endangered
rhinoceros and mountain gorillas, conservationists said Friday.
	   ``The increased presence of high-powered firearms and the
disruption of conservation activities in the parks are a dangerous
combination,'' said Deborah Snelson, World Wildlife Fund
representative in Nairobi. ``Two mountain gorillas were killed last
month and it could happen again any time, given the scale of the
conflict.''
	   Rebels trying to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila renewed
their efforts on Aug. 2. Fighting is concentrated in the eastern
third of the vast, mineral-rich country formerly known as Zaire.
	   The Washington-based group urged all factions to seek a peaceful
settlement.
	   Some of Central Africa's most endangered species, including the
northern white rhino and the mountain gorilla, could easily fall
prey to profiteering in and around protected areas, including
Garamba and Virunga national parks, WWF said in a statement.
	   Located where the borders of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda meet,
Virunga is Africa's oldest national park and has a unique tropical
mountain forest.
	   Half of the world's remaining 620 mountain gorillas live in
Virunga, Volcano National Park in Rwanda and Mgahinga National Park
in Uganda.
	   In 1994, the influx of nearly 1 million refugees fleeing Rwanda
caused widespread destruction in Virunga. The current crisis has
left park personnel cut off from their headquarters in Kinshasa,
Congo, WWF said.
	   Garamba, in northeastern Congo, has the last wild population of
northern white rhinos. A survey earlier this year confirmed at
least 23 surviving rhinos.
	   The northern white rhinoceros is a rare subspecies of white
rhino, of which there are about 7,600 in the world, nearly all of
them in South Africa.
	   ``We have lost all contact with the park staff in Garamba,''
Snelson said. ``There is no telling what has happened ... to the
rhinos.''
	   Garamba's savanna lands border Sudan, where political
instability caused an increase in poaching in the park in 1997.
Rebuilding of essential park operations had just begun when current
hostilities broke out, WWF said.
	   Other areas threatened by the conflict are Maiko and
Kahuzi-Biega national parks and the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, it
said.
	   ``The sad thing is that these national parks are not just
wildlife conservation areas,'' Snelson said. ``They are areas that
are key to the development of the region and should be protected as
such, so that the people and their children living around them can
benefit from their unique biological and economic value, now and in
the future.''

The legal road ahead for Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Spain-Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   A look at the next steps in the legal process facing former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   On Wednesday, England's High Court rejected two arrest warrants
from a Spanish magistrate seeking Pinochet's extradition to face
charges of murder, torture and kidnapping of political opponents
during his 17-year rule:
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Q: If the court threw out the warrants, why can't Pinochet leave
Britain now?
	   A: The High Court gave British prosecutors the right to appeal,
and ordered Pinochet held in custody pending that outcome.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Q: Pinochet's lawyers immediately asked for the general to be
released on bail. If a judge grants bail at the upcoming hearing,
what does that mean?
	   A: It could mean very little. If Pinochet still needs medical
care, he may not leave the hospital, but bail would allow him to
leave if he chose to. However, the magistrate can put any
conditions on bail, and it is unusual for people in extradition
cases to be granted bail because of the high risk they will flee.
The magistrate could allow Pinochet to return to Chile, however, if
the general agrees to come back to Britain if required.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Q: Who are the prosecutors appealing the High Court's ruling to?
	   A: The House of Lords has a five-judge law tribunal that is the
highest legal body in Britain, made up of senior judges. The
tribunal's decision cannot be appealed.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Q: When can a decision from the House of Lords be expected?
	   A: Prosecutors are required to file their appeal by Monday, but
the date for a hearing has not yet been specified. The House of
Lords is expected to move quickly because the case is of such high
political interest.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Q: What effect will the House of Lords ruling have on
extradition warrants being considered by other countries, such as
Sweden and Switzerland?
	   A: If the House of Lords agrees with the High Court, the other
extradition warrants probably would not hold up in British courts.
The High Court ruled that Britain does not have jurisdiction to
bring a non-British citizen to trial for killing British citizens
in another country.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Q: Prosecutors in Spain have filed a petition with the National
Court to stop two Spanish magistrates from investigating crimes in
Chile and Argentina. The National Court is holding a hearing
Thursday, and expects a decision by Friday. What will its decision
mean?
	   A: The case predates the Pinochet arrest, so the hearing is not
directly related to the British situation. If the court stops the
investigation by Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon _ whose arrest
warrant British authorities acted upon _ Garzon's warrant would be
in limbo because he would be seeking extradition for a case his
court has ruled is outside its jurisdiction. If the court allows
investigations to continue, Garzon reportedly plans to continue
attempts to extradite Pinochet.

UN policy announced to keep military observers over age 25
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, ADDS that U.S. allowance of 17-year-olds to serve
in armed forces targeted by new decree &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations has announced new age
requirements for U.N. peacekeepers, hoping to set an example for
countries to refrain from using children under 18 in their own
forces.
	   The United Nations announced Thursday that civilian police and
military observers sent by governments to serve in U.N.
peacekeeping operations should be at least 25. Troops in national
contingents should preferably be 21 but no younger than 18, the
under-secretary general for peacekeeping, Bernard Miyet, told the
General Assembly.
	   ``This decision has been taken as an additional measure in the
organization's effort to promote the rights of the child,'' U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   ``While we have no indication that member governments have
provided the U.N. with soldiers under the age of 18, this policy
has been adopted as a proactive measure,'' he said.
	   U.N. officials said the United States was an indirect target of
the new decree since Washington allows 17-year-olds in the U.S.
armed forces.
	   Human Rights Watch applauded the move, saying it was a step in
the right direction. The use of child combatants has become one of
the most devastating aspects of contemporary warfare, with more
than 300,000 children under 18 currently fighting around the world,
said Jo Becker, the organization's children's rights advocacy
director.
	   ``National governments should be doing everything possible to
stop this horrible practice. Raising their enlistment age to 18 is
one important move,'' Becker said.
	   The U.N. envoy for children and armed conflict, Olara Otunnu,
also welcomed the decision, saying ``it will strengthen current
efforts to promote better protection for the most vulnerable
sections of the population in peacekeeping situations.''

	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ A yacht with 31 people aboard was
missing in the storm-roiled Caribbean, where Hurricane Mitch killed
at least 36 people but weakened to a tropical storm.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard airplane was searching for the boat Thursday,
while storm-driven floodwaters continued to rise on shore.
	   Officials had no word at all from hundreds of small communities
cut off in Honduras and neighboring Nicaragua. More than 150,000
people have fled homes or hotels in the region, including Mexico
and Belize.
	   ``God save Honduras!'' said President Carlos Flores Facusse
after flying over parts of the vast disaster zone left by more than
two days of rain-charged hurricane-force winds.
	   Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had
been isolated, without power, telephones or clean drinking water.
More than 72,000 people were staying in shelters, and countless
more were making do on their own. Even the road between the two
largest cities, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, was blocked by a
mudslide Thursday.
	   Honduras reported 23 deaths. Nicaraguan emergency officials said
Thursday that its death toll had risen to 12. Mexico said an
American was thrown from his boat south of Cancun on Monday and was
presumed dead.
	   ``My God, this thing is getting ugly,'' said 13-year-old Juan
Padilla of La Lima as he watched the swollen Chamelecon River sweep
cars, trees, cattle and pieces of houses down toward the Caribbean
Sea.
	   Mitch, which on Tuesday ranked among the century's most powerful
storms, weakened as it moved slightly inland over Honduras.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that at 0000 GMT, the
storm was centered just inland, about 30 miles (50 kms)
south-southeast of the coastal city of Trujillo, Honduras.
	   Maximum sustained winds were near 60 mph (95 kph), down from 180
mph (290 kph) early Tuesday. The center said Mitch would probably
weaken if it remained over land, but could regain force if it
returned to sea.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, a 240-foot (73-meter) sailing
yacht with 31 people aboard, had been missing since Tuesday, said
the U.S. Coast Guard, which sent a C-130 plane to search for it.
	   The Fantome, which is owned by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, was
on a six-day cruise near Belize and Honduras' Bay Islands when the
storm hit, Windjammer spokesman James Canty said.
	   He said the boat radioed Tuesday that it was heading east to
avoid the hurricane, and hadn't been heard from since. He said the
passengers were of various nationalities, but he didn't know which.
	   In La Lima, 110 miles (175 kms) northwest of the Honduran
capital, Tegucigalpa, entire neighborhoods were in waist-deep water
and hundreds of families had set up tents made of scraps of tarp
and wood on the highway that runs through town.
	   ``Last night the water just kept rising, so we decided to come
onto the highway,'' said Jose Antonio Galindo, 36, who makes his
living collecting firewood.
	   La Lima is in the Sula Valley, Honduras' richest agricultural
zone, filled with banana plantations and home to more than 200
factories. Officials said 40 percent of the 250,000-acre (100,000
hectare) valley was flooded _ and the waters were rising.
	   Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said grain, citrus and
banana crops had been damaged ``and the economic future of Honduras
is uncertain.''
	   In the short term, food, water and medicine already were running
out in communities isolated by the storm.
	   ``Today I just ate manioc with salt, and tomorrow I don't know
what I'll do,'' Maria Gonzalez, 28, said in the town of Tela on
Honduras' northern coast. She held her 6-month-old son Jose in her
arms.
	   In La Ceiba, which is cut off from the rest of the country by
two downed bridges, 15,600 of the city's 40,000 residents were
staying in 18 shelters, only some of which had any food at all.
Treated water also had run out, prompting warnings of epidemics.
	   A 65-yard (60-meter) torrent raced where the Saopin Bridge used
to be. Hundreds of people gathered on either side, passing messages
in a soda can.
	   ``We want food and water, please,'' one note read.
	   In the afternoon, firefighters rigged a rope across the water,
and people began shimmying across. It was an arduous trip, and they
paused repeatedly to catch their breath, their backs sometimes
skimming the water.
	   The first one across was Victor Arteaga, 25, who was stranded on
the banana plantation where he works, cut off from his wife and two
daughters, ages 3 and 2.
	   ``I want to know how they are,'' he said, adding: ``Over there
there's nothing left _ no water, no food. I haven't eaten in three
days. I couldn't stand the hunger.''

Reports: Indonesian troops remain in force in East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Indonesian troops stationed in the
disputed territory of East Timor are far in excess of the numbers
claimed by the government, reports in Australia said Friday, citing
leaked Indonesian military records.
	   Printouts of military computer records say that in August there
were more than 21,000 Indonesian troops and auxiliaries in East
Timor, including almost 8,000 ``penugasan,'' or assigned troops,
The Sydney Morning Herald reported.
	   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported that the 8,000 were
combat troops, part of an overall military force of about 17,000 in
East Timor.
	   The Australian newspaper said the more than 100 pages of leaked
documents confirm the continued presence of units of the army's
elite special forces, Kopassus.
	   The figures contrast with Indonesian claims that troop numbers
in East Timor are now less than 12,000 and that virtually all
combat troops have been withdrawn.
	   The figures come amid U.N.-sponsored talks between Indonesia and
Portugal, East Timor's former colonial power, to resolve the
question of sovereignty.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after invading the previous
year during a civil war. The United Nations does not recognize
Indonesia's sovereignty over the half-island territory.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan this month called for an end
to military activity and urged Indonesia to withdraw many of its
troops from the contested territory.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer warned Friday that
the revelations of troops numbers in East Timor could derail the
reconciliation process.
	   ``We've argued for two and a half years that an important
component of confidence building in East Timor is to reduce numbers
of troops,'' Downer told ABC radio.
	   ``We very strongly urge the Indonesian government to reduce the
numbers.
	   ``Remember, though, that the peace process, the reconciliation
process, is at a very delicate stage in East Timor and our concern
would be that if these reports are accurate it won't help that
reconciliation process.''
	   Australia's opposition Labor party spokesman Laurie Brereton
said independent international observers should be allowed into
East Timor to monitor troop movements.

Security Council decides to maintain sanctions against Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs; UPDATES with letter from Libyan ambassador. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council has decided to
maintain sanctions on Libya, reiterating that they will be
suspended only after Libya turns over two suspects in the fatal
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
	   The council on Thursday called on the Libyan government to hand
over the two intelligence agents for trial in the Netherlands ``as
soon as possible,'' noting that the 10th anniversary of the crash
of the Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland falls on Dec. 21.
	   The Security Council decision Thursday, made after a periodic
review, was a setback for Libya, which has been pushing to have the
6-year-old sanctions suspended immediately.
	   The council voted on Aug. 27 to suspend sanctions when the two
intelligence agents are handed over for trial. It also threatened
additional measures against Libya if the suspects fail to appear
for trial before a panel of three Scottish judges under Scottish
law.
	   The two suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah _ are accused of planting a bomb on the jumbo jet, which
exploded on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   The council has not set any target date for Libya to hand over
the suspects before it considers further sanctions.
	   But Britain and the United States, which agreed to hold a trial
in the Netherlands in hopes of finally resolving the case, are
pressing for a speedy response.
	   U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh and British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock said they want to see the two suspects delivered for
trial well before the Dec. 21 anniversary.
	   In a letter to the council, which was discussed Thursday by the
15 members, Libya's Ambassador Abuzed Omar Dorda reaffirmed his
country's acceptance of a trial in the Netherlands for the two men.
	   ``It is a totally serious position, from which there is no going
back,'' he said.
	   Libya has sought clarification of the U.S.-British offer and
Dorda vehemently denied U.S. and British allegations that his
country was trying to delay the handover.
	   Dorda said Libya is still waiting for ``a positive response'' on
three issues:
	   _Since the trial is being held in a third country, Libya wants
the two suspects if convicted to be able to serve their sentence in
a third country.
	   _Libya wants sanctions lifted _ not just suspended _ when the
men are handed over.
	   _Libya insists that the trial must not be held in a military
facility or base.
	   Greenstock, the council president, said council members welcomed
the fact that Secretary-General Kofi Annan's legal team was
providing clarifications of trial procedures to the Libyans.
	   The Libyans said another meeting with Annan's legal team was
scheduled for Nov. 9.
	   Speaking as Britain's ambassador, Greenstock said London and
Washington had been providing ``very full and detailed
clarifications to all the Libyan requests for information.'' Dorda
said Libya's legal team waited for more than three weeks for
responses, which weren't complete.
	   Britain and the United States are still insisting that the
suspects serve their sentence in Scotland if convicted.
	   Greenstock said the two suspects ``should have no fears about
their rights in the trial process, about their rights if they are
convicted of serving a sentence in the Scottish system.''
	   ``We've provided, for instance, reassurance to the Libyan
authorities that all religious, dietary and health requests would
be met. There would be visits by clerics or family members,''
Greenstock said.
	   The ambassador also defended the Dutch government's decision to
hold the trial at Camp Zeist, a former U.S. Air Force base 20 miles
(32 kilometers) southeast of Amsterdam. He said it had the best
physical arrangements available for a trial including a hospital.
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 to push Libya to surrender
the suspects. The measures ban air travel to and from the country,
prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of
oil equipment.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Fire raced through a building housing a
discotheque early Friday, killing at least 20 people and possibly
more than 50, reports said.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in the
building of the local Macedonian Association, national radio and
the news agency TT reported.
	   ``The fire is raging out of control. We do not know how it

	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch, worn by pounding the
Honduran coast, weakened to a tropical storm and plunged inland
after killing at least 36 people in three countries and leaving 31
people missing aboard a tourist yacht.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard airplane was searching for the boat Thursday,
while on shore, officials had no word at all from hundreds of small
communities cut off in Honduras and neighboring Nicaragua. More
than 150,000 people have fled homes or hotels in the region,
including Mexico and Belize.
	   ``God save Honduras!'' said President Carlos Flores Facusse
after flying over parts of the vast disaster zone left by more than
two days of rain-charged hurricane-force winds.
	   Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had
been isolated, without power, telephones or clean drinking water.
More than 72,000 people were staying in shelters, and countless
more were making do on their own. Even the road between the two
largest cities, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, was blocked by a
mudslide Thursday.
	   Honduras reported 23 deaths. Nicaraguan emergency officials said
Thursday that its death toll had risen to 12, with 21 missing.
Mexico said an American was thrown from his boat south of Cancun on
Monday and was presumed dead.

Newspapers struggle to survive Russia's latest financial crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ It isn't easy to get hold of the truth in Russia
these days.
	   Just this spring, three newspapers were claiming to be the
successor of the old Communist Party mouthpiece Pravda, which means
``truth'' in Russian.
	   But the economic crisis has driven one of them out of business.
The second _ generally regarded as the real successor to the
original _ has been barred from printing because it lost a court
case to the third, Krasnaya Pravda, an ultra-left wing paper with a
tiny circulation.
	   Pravda isn't the only publication battling to go to press in the
midst of Russia's worst financial crisis in years. It was among
dozens of newspapers and magazines, many of them struggling, that
set up booths at a media exposition in Moscow that runs this week
and next.
	   Sergei Filatov, general director of the Pravda that's under
court order not to print, was staffing his paper's booth even
though it's not on the newsstands.
	   Such helplessness set the tone for the entire event, which was
more a chance for the media to commiserate about hard times than to
make new deals.
	   ``Take a student. He's got a few rubles, and he's got a choice
between a newspaper and a loaf of bread. Which do you think he's
going to buy?'' said Filatov.
	   Several Russian business titans have purchased media outlets in
recent years, but their pockets may not be deep enough to keep
funding the press through the crisis.
	   Moscow has more than a dozen daily newspapers and many were
believed to be losing money even before the bottom fell out of the
economy.
	   Advertisers are on the run, printing costs are up and papers and
magazines have been reducing their size, limiting circulation and
cutting staff.
	   ``Before (the crisis) we would have signed at least 10 to 20
contracts at an expo like this,'' said Alexander Dubrovsky,
marketing director for Mart Media, which distributes magazines
across Russia. ``Now we'd be lucky to get five.''
	   Some papers are taking desperate measures to stay alive.
	   The weekly newspaper Argumenty i Fakty once had a circulation in
the millions. Heavily hit by the crisis, it has launched a public
relations agency that offers to print paid-for stories in the
newspaper, blurring the line between news stories and advertising.
The newspaper says it will identify which stories were bought.
	   Moskovsky Komsomolets, one of the city's most popular papers
with a daily circulation of just under 1 million, cut its number of
pages from 12 to 10 because printing costs became too expensive,
said Andrei Korotkov, head of marketing for the paper.
	   But the crisis has pushed up the paper's subscriptions up 35
percent, Korotkov added.
	   ``People want to know what's happening with the (dollar-ruble
exchange rate), and what's happening with Boris Yeltsin, if he's
healthy. So they keep buying the paper,'' he said.

Dollar, Japanese stocks higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks rose moderately in early trading
Friday in a positive reaction to a report a major Japanese trust
bank was to withdraw from overseas banking. The U.S. dollar was
slightly higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 62.53 points,
or 0.46 percent, to 13,731.25 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Thursday, the index gained 152.65 points, or 1.13 percent.
	   The dollar bought 116.84 yen at 9 a.m. (0000 GMT), up 0.48 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
116.93 yen overnight.
	   ``Even though things aren't moving quickly with public funds
infusion, people are happy banks are closing overseas operations
and focusing on domestic business,'' said Jon Yang, a salesman in
the futures and options group at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. will close down all its overseas
banking operations and set up a trust venture in Japan with State
Street Bank and Trust Co. of the United States, according to the
Nihon Keizai newspaper. Daiwa Bank Ltd. announced its withdrawal
from overseas banking last week.
	   The retrenchments come as Japan's Parliament passed laws earlier
this month allowing the government to take control of troubled
banks to fix them or shut them down by pumping up to 60 trillion
yen (dlrs 515 billion) in taxpayer funds into the ailing banking
system.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 6.69 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,043.79. The
TOPIX rose 8.49 points, or 0.83 percent, the previous day.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar was moving in a
narrow range amid an absence of fresh market-moving news, traders
said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 0.860 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.870
percent, driving its price up to 108.35 yen from 108.25 yen.

English club to offer Lomu contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ English rugby club Leeds will offer
star New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu the chance to play both union
and league in Britain after next year's World Cup.
	   Leeds Rugby Club chief executive Gary Hetherington told a New
Zealand reporter in London that he would be chasing Lomu, whose
contract with the New Zealand Rugby Union expires following the
World Cup next November.
	   Rather than offering Lomu a straight switch to rugby league,
Hetherington said Leeds will give the All Black winger the chance
to carry on in union, meaning both codes would cover the costs of
buying one of the world's most expensive players.
	   He said Leeds have been trying to sign Lomu for more than three
years, saying he came ``very, very close'' to joining the club
after the last World Cup, held in South Africa in 1995.
	   Lomu burst onto the world rugby scene at the 1995 World Cup with
a string of dominant performances in the All Blacks' run to the
final, where they eventually lost to the host country.
	   Hetherington conceded there had not been any formal discussions
with the player, but said Lomu had told club officials last
December that one of his ambitions was to play league in Britain.
	   He said while there was a salary cap for players in the British
Super League competition, Leeds owned both the league and union
clubs so the cost could be shared.
	   In Britain, union is played in winter, but league has moved to a
summer competition.
	   Meanwhile, Australian rugby league player Wendell Sailor could
still make his English rugby union debut on Sunday despite problems
gaining a work permit.
	   English rugby union regulations require non-European Union
nationals to have had international experience in the 15-man code
over the last 12 months.
	   Leeds have argued that Sailor, a try-scorer in Australia's third
Test victory over New Zealand two weeks ago, should be made a
special case because he was likely to enhance the reputation of the
sport. This argument was rejected but Leeds have not given up and
are now trying to register Sailor as an amateur.
	   Sailor is believed to be willing to give up an estimated U.S.
dlrs 170,000 salary to try his hand at the 15-man code.

Death toll in Korean fire rises to 27
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Rescuers found two more charred bodies
early Friday, raising to 27 the total number killed in a fire that
swept through a cold storage plant under construction in the
southern city of Pusan, police said.
	   Fifteen other people, including five firefighters, were injured
in the Thursday blaze that engulfed the three upper floors of the
eight-story structure, police said.
	   The two bodies were found in a stairway leading to the rooftop,
police said. Most of the dead suffocated in toxic gas that filled
parts of the building.
	   Some of the injured suffered broken legs and back injuries after
jumping from the building, police said.
	   Welding sparks were believed to have ignited the blaze, police
said.

	   Hundreds of people were believed to have been inside when the
fire broke out.
	   When fire crews arrived on the scene, young people were crowding
the area, but it was not known how many of them had been inside, TT
said.
	   The injured were taken to three hospitals, but Lennart Olin, a
leader of the local rescue service, told TT it was not immediately
known how many had been injured or what their conditions were.
	   Goteborg is Sweden's second-largest city, on the west coast
about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

Norman supports Olympics, the only way he can
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Greg Norman will put some of his
millions towards helping his homeland host the 2000 Olympics _ but
there's one games experience his money can't buy.
	   Norman, whose success in golf has put virtually anything he
wants within his reach, admitted Friday that golf's absence from
the Olympic sports program was a continuing source of frustration.
	   ``I've always been very confused by the fact it's not in
there,'' said Norman. ``When I see the NBA delivers its Dream Team
to the Olympics, I think golf's a little bit more popular on a
global basis than basketball is.''
	   Golf is recognized by the Olympic movement and there were failed
bids to have it included as a demonstration sport at the Atlanta
Olympics.
	   International Olympic Committee officials have expressed support
for golf to follow other top pro sports such as tennis and
basketball, as they've opened up the games to the world's richest
athletes.
	   ``Hopefully one day if we all just chip away, the water torture
trick, the message might get in,'' Norman said. He said Spanish
player Seve Ballesteros had spoken to IOC chief Juan Antonio
Samaranch about the issue ``on an almost continual basis for years
and years.''
	   For now, Norman's Olympic experience will be restricted to his
not inconsiderable abilities to raise money for the struggling
Sydney organizing committee (SOCOG).
	   Norman's Great White Shark Enterprises has entered a deal with
SOCOG to supply his trademark hats to about 50,000 Olympic
volunteers.
	   SOCOG marketing boss John Moore has admitted the organization is
about Aust dlrs 200 million short of its Aust dlrs 874 million
marketing target with less than two years to go. Norman's decision
to throw his hats into the ring won't help SOCOG raise the
shortfall but he has pledged to help further.
	   He will pass the hat around in the corporate circles he
frequents, urging companies to support the games, and will stage
some special pro-am events with the proceeds flowing to Australia's
Olympic team.
	   ``The question I'll answer before you ask it is what is the
value of this relationship? I'd like to tell you that it's
priceless,'' said Moore.
	   Norman said his contacts should produce results.
	   ``Because I live in the United States and the involvement I have
in a lot of the high profile companies and the branching out of my
business I have the opportunity to knock on a few doors that I
wouldn't have four or five years ago,'' said Norman. ``It's just a
logical extension of business. It's priceless because I'm going to
put a lot into it.''
	   SOCOG has yet to decide who will light the flame at the Sydney
2000 opening ceremony but Moore said he kept hearing that Norman
should get to chip a flaming golf ball into the cup.
	   Norman was coy about any official role.
	   ``I don't know what capacity I'll be in there, but I'll be
there,'' Norman said.
	   But would you light the flame? ``I don't smoke...''

At least 20 killed in fire in Sweden

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Fire raced through a building housing a
discotheque in the city of Goteborg early Friday, killing at least
20 people and injuring about 100.
	   About three hours after the fire was reported, rescue crews had
brought about 20 bodies out of the building and there were fears
that the death toll could be as high as 50, national radio and the
news agency TT reported.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in the
building of the local Macedonian Association, the reports said. The
cause was not immediately known.
	   The fire struck a discotheque on the second story of the brick
building.
	   Hundreds of people were believed to have been inside when the
fire broke out. When fire crews arrived on the scene, young people
were crowding the area, but it was not known how many of them had
been inside, TT said.
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities and
the Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service
to help transport the injured.
	   ''I would think the total of injured taken from here is about
100; our vehicles have been put into shuttle service,'' Stefan
Pettersson, an ambulance coordinator at the scene, was quoted as
saying by TT.
	   Goteborg is Sweden's second-largest city, on the country's west
coast about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

Top banks in Japan's Mitsui group plan sweeping restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. takes an ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two of Japan's largest banks, both members of the
powerful Mitsui group, announced drastic restructuring plans Friday
calling for massive job cuts at Sakura Bank Ltd. and Mitsui Trust
and Banking Co.'s withdrawal from overseas operations.
	   Sakura, the core bank of the Mitsui industrial group, will slash
3,000 jobs, or 20 percent of its total work force, within three
years, said a bank spokesman who declined to be named.
	   The cost-cutting move comes as Sakura and many other Japanese
banks scramble to secure funds to write off huge loads of bad loans
amid the country's worst recession since World War II.
	   Less than two months ago, Sakura asked Toyota Motor Corp. and
other Mitsui group members to shore up its eroded capital base with
an emergency infusion of more than 300 billion yen (dlrs 2.1
billion).
	   Also Friday, a Mitsui Trust spokesman said the company will
close down all overseas banking operations to focus on its domestic
asset-management and retail-trust businesses.
	   Bank officials scheduled a press conference at 10:30 a.m. (0130
GMT) to explain the withdrawal, which reportedly accompanied a
decision to establish a trust venture in Japan with a U.S. bank.
	   Mitsui is just the latest Japanese financial institution to
stage a retreat from foreign markets. Last week, Daiwa Bank Ltd.
announced a similar pullout. Others include a number of regional
banks and the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., which
the government recently decided to nationalize.
	   Mitsui Trust has begun talks with State Street Bank and Trust
Co. to have a planned joint venture assume part of its
asset-management business, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported.
	   Mitsui Trust will also transfer its foreign custody business to
the U.S. bank, and the two companies will jointly offer trustee
services for investment trusts, Japan's top business daily said.
	   Many of the soured loans haunting Japanese lenders were extended
before a speculative asset price bubble burst earlier this decade.
That was accompanied by an overall economic slump which has crimped
earnings growth at banks and other businesses.
	   In addition to the burden imposed by bad loans, Japan's banks
also face increased competition as the government carries out
promised deregulation of the financial industry.
	   After withdrawing from overseas, Mitsui Trust will only be
required to meet the domestic capital-ratio requirement of 4
percent, which will give it a capital surplus of about 600 billion
yen (dlrs 5.1 billion), the Nihon Keizai said.
	   The daily also reported the bank plans to enhance its capital
base further by requesting an injection of public funds under
recently passed legislation aimed at cleaning up the debt-ridden
banking system.

Kiss-and-tell book stirs media storm in France, shatters taboo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The new book ``The Whore of the Republic'' is
dealing a major blow to France's longtime taboo of publicizing
politicians' private lives, and a media storm has erupted from its
photos of the head of one of the country's highest legal bodies
entwined with his mistress.
	   Christine Deviers-Joncour's book, which comes out Tuesday, gives
her account of a multimillion-dollar kickback scandal involving
then-Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
	   Many French have snickered and sneered at the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, calling it a puritan witchhunt against U.S. President Bill
Clinton that would never happen in France.
	   It wasn't until months before President Francois Mitterrand died
in 1996 that his illegitimate daughter, Mazarine, was brought into
the media limelight.
	   Now Dumas, the 76-year-old head of the Constitutional Council _
one of France's highest legal bodies _ is in hot spot.
	   Dumas was known for numerous dalliances, never publicized. But
that protection began to erode last year, when Deviers-Joncour was
arrested in connection with a kickback scandal.
	   Investigators say Deviers-Joncour, about 20 years Dumas' junior,
was hired to lobby him to secure the state-owned Thomson company's
1991 contract to build frigates for Taiwan.
	   In her book, Deviers-Joncour acknowledges the lobbying job,
though she makes no reference to the 66-million-franc (dlrs 12
million) commission _ from another state-owned company _ she
allegedly shared with Dumas.
	   In April, Dumas was placed under formal investigation, one step
short of being charged, for ``complicity and receiving embezzled
public funds.''
	   ``If that work was not, for me, a question of survival, I would
probably have left it all,'' Deviers-Joncour wrote in the book, in
excerpts published Thursday in the daily Le Monde.
	   ``But is love so ethereal?'' she added cynically in the book,
published by Calmann-Levy. ``Does it not often fill a need? Does it
not often correspond to an opportunity?''
	   The tabloid weekly Paris Match on Thursday featured snapshots of
Dumas and Deviers-Joncour on the beach in 1991, on a friend's
sailboat and walking in the woods.
	   Another weekly, l'Evenement du Jeudi, ran the cover story ``The
Mistresses of the Republic,'' reporting not only on Dumas but also
other leaders. Mitterrand was ``the great skirt-chaser,'' it said,
and former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing ``confused
free-market liberalism with libertinism.''
	   President Jacques Chirac ``benefits from total media silence,
even if editing rooms hum from time to time with rumors about
liaisons he could have had with a journalist, an actress or the
former wife of a former minister,'' it said.
	   Le Monde acknowledged the book established ``no formal link''
between Dumas and the kickback money, but wrote that the love
affair ``further weakens the defense of the president of the
Constitutional Council.''
	   A Le Monde editorial said Dumas ``is guardian of constitutional
law, in other words republican virtue. Can he continue to be, now
that the truth has been said?''
	   Dumas' lawyers shot back that the book ``brings no new
evidence'' against their client.
	   While Dumas was taking no action against the book, an ex-husband
of Deviers-Joncour sought a court order to strike passages about
him. A court was to rule Monday, Le Monde said.

Hyundai chief's trip home from North Korea to be delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The scheduled return home Friday of
the head of South Korea's largest conglomerate from a visit to
North Korea will be delayed ``one or two days,'' Seoul's
Unification Ministry said.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 84, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai
group, began a four-day visit to North Korea on Tuesday to discuss
tourism and other joint venture projects in the communist country.
	   Chung originally had been scheduled to return home Friday across
the heavily armed border but North Korea abruptly asked him to
extend his stay, ministry spokesman Hwang Ha-su told reporters.
	   Hyundai confirmed Chung's extended stay in the North, saying
that it has received a fax from its Beijing office saying that
Chung has ``some pending issues that require consolation.''
	   North Korea gave no reason for requesting the change in Chung's
schedule.
	   There was speculation that the North Korean request may be
related to possible plans to allow Chung to meet new leader Kim
Jong Il.
	   Before leaving for North Korea, Chung said he anticipated a
meeting with the new leader during the visit, his second in four
months. During his June visit, Chung was given assurances that he
would be allowed to meet the leader this time.
	   South Korean government and Hyundai officials stress the
importance of a meeting with the new North Korean leader, who rules
his Stalinist country under a personality cult similar to the one
built around his late father, Kim Il Sung. The elder Kim died in
1994.
	   Hyundai already has obtained North Korean approval to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships for a four-day
tour of Diamond Mountain, a scenic attraction on the North's east
coast.
	   But South Korean officials are concerned the deal still lacks
agreements on safety, communications and other emergency measures.
	   Hyundai's other joint venture projects being pushed in the North

Spoils of dictatorship: Abacha family mulls its fortune

<TEXT>
	   KANO, Nigeria (AP) _ Halfway down Gidado Road, behind the white,
Spanish-style wall topped with metal spikes and overgrown with
flowering shrubs, the Abacha family is waiting for its freedom _
and its fortune.
	   Once the home of Nigeria's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, the
estate is now one of his family's last enclaves.
	   There is little left for the Abachas in Nigeria. They have lost
their power, most of their friends, their passports. The soldiers
who once protected them now keep watch on them, checking cars that
come into the compound and following family members when they go
out.
	   What the Abachas have left, though, is a fortune estimated at
dlrs 3 billion to dlrs 6 billion.
	   Little of it was legally earned, say analysts who tracked the
flow of the nation's wealth when Abacha was in power. Abacha's five
years in office were marked by kickbacks, bribery and outright
theft that reached into every sector of society and flourished
among his inner circle.
	   ``We found ourselves in a situation where the government was
filled with thieves,'' said Yemi Osinbajo, executive director of
the anti-corruption group Integrity.
	   The organization estimates that Abacha alone took billions of
dollars through shady dealings and theft. The dictator's associates
took billions more, Osinbajo charges.
	   But four months after Abacha's sudden death and well into the
tenure of a reformist general, few people have been prosecuted for
any wrongdoing.
	   Instead, the junta is quietly trying to recover what it can from
Abacha's family and his close allies. Some believe the junta fears
a widespread investigation could implicate an entire generation of
officers and conceivably bring reform to a halt.
	   One Westerner familiar with the investigation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the junta has a good idea of who
siphoned off money and is quietly pressuring them to return it.
	   The Abacha family has already turned over dlrs 750 million to
the state, Nigerian newspapers say. One of Abacha's closest allies,
National Security Adviser Ismaila Gwarzo, surrendered more than
dlrs 250 million, the Lagos-based newspaper ThisDay reported _ cash
that was returned to authorities in 80 trunks.
	   What remains to be seen is how much money must be returned
before the government is satisfied, and whether anyone will
actually face criminal charges. Reports indicate fewer than a dozen
people are being seriously investigated.
	   During his tenure, Abacha inserted himself into nearly every
major Nigerian business deal, taking a healthy commission for
himself, Osinbajo and others say. The family businesses ran from
aluminum smelting to banking to construction to petroleum. His son,
Mohammed, and daughter, Zainab, were also heavily involved in
Abacha's deals, according to numerous press reports.
	   ``He had his finger in most things,'' said Pat Utomi, a former
managing director of Volkswagen's Nigerian manufacturing subsidiary
and a professor at the Lagos Business School.
	   Other money was simply taken from the treasury. An October 1997
letter from Gwarzo to Abacha is filled with flowery praise of the
dictator _ and then a blithe request for dlrs 150 million to help
campaign for a permanent Nigerian seat on the U.N. Security
Council.
	   ThisDay, which reprinted the letter, said the cash simply
disappeared into Gwarzo's and Abacha's bank accounts.
	   The core of the corruption was the oil industry. To Nigeria,
with 2 million barrels a day in oil production, the petroleum
industry should be the lubricant of a healthy economy. Instead, it
became the treasure chest of the ruling elite.
	   Money was taken at every level of the drilling and refining
process. From kickbacks on prospecting licenses to contracts on
refinery repairs, Abacha and his inner circle were there to make
sure they were in on the profits.
	   Now the world's sixth-largest oil producer can't even fulfill
its own needs. Refineries don't refine, gas lines can last for days
and gasoline is sold by the whiskey bottle on roadsides. Black
market prices can run 10 times official prices.
	   In the oil-rich Niger River delta region, communities cut off
from the profits that surround them don't even have telephone
service or electricity. The recent deadly explosion in the delta
town of Jesse, which occurred while as many as 1,000 people were
scavenging fuel spilling from a pipeline, reflected the desperation
of years of poverty.
	   What many Nigerians wonder is why the government has not opened
criminal cases against those suspected of corruption.
	   Gwarzo was arrested a few months ago, but was later freed,
begging public forgiveness for his ``misdeeds.''
	   The junta argues this is no time for a sweeping investigation.
	   Junta officials say Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took control
after Abacha's death, is in a delicate situation as he moves
Nigeria toward civilian rule next May.
	   He has freed political prisoners, met with foreign envoys and
thrown out many dictatorial decrees. Trying to curtail corruption,
he has purged the oil ministry and ordered open bidding for
government contracts.
	   But an open-ended investigation could slow these reforms, the
officials say.
	   ``When you have a short time and you spend this time chasing
people ... you lose focus,'' said Richard Ikiebe, an adviser to
Rear Adm. Mike Akhigbe, the No. 2 person in the junta.
	   The real reason for the half-hearted prosecutions may run
deeper.
	   What the junta appears to fear is an investigation of
themselves. Corruption has long been a part of Nigeria's political
and military culture and many officials have benefited from easy
access to loans, commissions on contracts and even gifts of homes.
	   Many analysts believe that going after the Nigerian officer
corps, or even prosecuting Abacha's inner circle too aggressively,
could spark another coup.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Fire raced through an upstairs
discotheque jammed with hundreds of young people in the city of
Goteborg early Friday, killing at least 20 and injuring about 100.
	   About three hours after the fire was reported, rescue crews had
brought about 20 bodies out of the building and there were fears
that the death toll could be as high as 50, national radio and the
news agency TT reported.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in the
building of the local Macedonian Association, the reports said. The
cause was not immediately known.
	   The fire struck a discotheque on the second story of the brick
building.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started.
	   ''It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ''It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people
trampled on each other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked
out the windows and jumped out,'' said Fawz, who estimated there
were about 400 people inside.
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities and
the Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service
to help transport the injured.
	   ``I would think the total of injured taken from here is about
100; our vehicles have been put into shuttle service,'' Stefan
Pettersson, an ambulance coordinator at the scene, was quoted as
saying by TT.
	   Goteborg is Sweden's second-largest city, on the country's west
coast about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The pilot of a hijacked Turkish Airlines
flight managed to land the jet at Turkey's capital, where security
forces tried Friday to negotiate the release of the 39 hostages
aboard.
	   The hijackers _ their number was unclear _ claimed to have a
grenade and gun.
	   Authorities suspected Kurdish rebels, out to make a statement on
Thursday's 75th anniversary of Turkey's founding as a secular
republic. TV stations, saying they were talking to a captive
passenger who had a cell phone, said one hijacker declared he was
acting to protest Turkey's crackdown on Kurdish rebels.
	   The hijacking late Thursday marred the nationwide anniversary
celebrations, which drew hundreds of foreign dignitaries. They
faced stranding in Ankara when security forces sealed off the
airport; authorities reportedly planned to fly the foreign leaders
out through a military airbase.
	   TV stations reported conversations with passenger they
identified as Fuat Tosyali, a name that was on the passenger list
released by Turkish Airlines.
	   ``He said he chose to act today because of the republic day,''
the passenger reportedly told private Star television early Friday.
	   There were conflicting accounts on whether there were one or two
hijackers. The hijacking started Thursday evening, when one or more
men took over an Ankara-bound flight from the southern city of
Adana and demanded it be diverted to Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   Lausanne is significant to Kurds as the site where a 1919 treaty
ended a drive to create an independent Kurdish state.
	   Instead of heading to Switzerland, the six-member crew brought
the plane down at Ankara's airport, apparently after initially
misleading the hijacker into thinking the flight was stopping in
neighboring Bulgaria for fuel.
	   Turkish authorities promised to let the plane refuel and take
off again if women and children aboard could go free, said Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who was called away from a ballet marking
the republic's anniversary for the emergency.
	   Security forces reportedly deployed a 40-member assault team;
ambulances and doctors were called to the airport.
	   ``We hope the issue will come to an end without any
operations,'' said Cetin Ozbey, the airlines' deputy director.
	   The hijackers reportedly challenged the crew to check for
themselves that the weapons were real.
	   The 33 passengers included a baby. Most of the other travelers
aboard were doctors headed to a medical convention, Turkey's
Anatolia news agency said. There were no obviously foreign names on
the passenger list released by the airline.
	   Last week, the same plane was prevented from taking off from the
Strasbourg airport by protesters trying to prevent French officials
from deporting a Kurd to Turkey.
	   Kurdish rebels have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984. The conflict has killed close to 37,000
people.
	   Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this year,
each time with no real weapons and with no injuries. The latest was
in September, when a man with a toy gun commandeered a domestic
flight to protest government restrictions on Islam.
	   In February, the hijacker was a man claiming to have a teddy
bear packed with explosives. Authorities said later he was mentally
ill.

Australia wary of English: Healy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy says
the home side will treat its English opposition with caution this
summer despite dominating Ashes contests since 1989.
	   The 34-year-old Healy, who broke the world record for dismissals
during Australia's 1-0 series win over Pakistan earlier this month,
admitted the current England side had a host of talented
individuals capable of pushing the Australians this summer.
	   However, he said while England had often fielded quality players
in recent years, they had not always performed up to expectations.
	   ``But at some stage they're going to sneak up and bite us,''
Healy said Friday. ``Individually their players are very, very
good.''
	   England arrived in Australia this week confident of regaining
the coveted Ashes, and got away to a successful start with a
one-run victory over an ACB Chairman's XI in Perth on Thursday.
	   But fitness worries have already surfaced, with captain Alec
Stewart and all-rounder Ben Hollioake unable to field in the match
after complaining of soreness while batting.
	   Stewart has long had a problem with his back, while Hollioake
had a groin problem. Add to that opener Mike Atherton's long-term
back complaint and a knee injury to fast bowler Dean Headley and
England are already looking slightly frail less than one week into
the tour.
	   In Thursday's match, Stewart was forced to hand over the
captaincy to predecessor Atherton as England kept their nerve to
restrict the ACB to 296 all out in reply to the visitors' 297 for
five.
	   Stewart's back injury is a recurrence of a problem which flared
prior to the second test against South Africa at Lord's earlier
this year. It poses further questions about his ability to captain,
keep wicket and bat high in the order on a regular basis.
	   But Stewart insisted he would be ready to face Western Australia
in the four-day game starting Saturday in Perth.
	   ``It was just a little bit of stiffness,'' Stewart said. ``If it
had been a test match or a first-class game we were playing today,
then I would have played but I stayed off as a precaution.''

Palmeiras beat Boca Juniors 3-1 in Mercosur Cup quarterfinal first
</HEADLINE>
leg &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ With a last minute header, Magrao gave
Palmeiras a valuable 3-1 win over Boca Juniors in the first leg of
this Mercosur Cup quarterfinal here.
	   The Brazilians deservedly preserved their faultless competition
record Thursday at the expense of Argentina's league leaders, who
rested most key players for domestic games.
	   Palmeiras controlled the first half at their Parque Antartica
stadium and took the lead on 27 minutes when striker Almir
sidefooted Junior's curling cross into the net.
	   But it was a tired-looking game. At least until Palmeiras
substitute Arilson decided to inject some energy at the start of
the second half.
	   Moments after taking the field, he blasted his side into a 2-0
lead with a fierce shot from 15 meters (yards).
	   Boca Juniors, who had not seemed to want to come out for the
second period after 20 minutes in their dressing room, responded
with a penalty two minutes later.
	   Striker Rey was clearly brought down in the penalty area by
Junior and Schelotto converted the spot-kick.
	   It became end-to-end play and Boca Juniors' goalie Abbondancieri
pulled off a stunning reflex save to keep out Cleber's powerful
downward header, on 52 minutes.
	   It was all too much for Alex, who had commanded the midfield for
Palmeiras in the first half. He got tired and was substituted,
missing out on the final goal celebrations.
	   Boca Juniors missed their best chance to go level when Navas'
volley flew past the post after 39 minutes. They now face an uphill
battle in the second leg Nov. 4 in Buenos Aires.
	   Line-ups:
	   Palmeiras: Velloso, Arce, Junior Baiano, Cleber, Junior,
Rogerio, Alex (Darci), Zinho (Arilson), Almir, Paulo Nunes, Magrao.
	   Boca Juniors: Abbondancieri, Ibarra, Traverso, Samuel, Mattelan,
Schelotto (Gatti), Battaglia, Navas, Pereda, Rey, Gimenez.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ At least 60 people died early Friday
when fire raced through an upstairs discotheque jammed with
hundreds of young people in the city of Goteborg. About 100 others
were injured, many of them seriously.
	   ''We are still searching the building ... but so far we have
found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan Edmundson said on
national radio at 3:30 a.m. (0230 GMT).
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ''What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said. But local rescue
service leader Lennart Olin said there were signs that the fire was
set, the Swedish news agency TT reported.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in the
building of the local Macedonian Association, in a discotheque on
the second story of the brick building.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ``It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people
trampled on each other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked
out the windows and jumped out,'' said Fawz, who estimated there
were about 400 people inside.
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities and
the Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service
to help transport the injured.
	   ``I would think the total of injured taken from here is about
100; our vehicles have been put into shuttle service,'' Stefan
Pettersson, an ambulance coordinator at the scene, was quoted as
saying by TT.
	   Goteborg is Sweden's second-largest city, on the country's west
coast about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

	   It was unclear whether the hijacker was acting alone, or whether
he had survived the raid. Several reports claimed he had been
killed.
	   Transport Minister Arif Ahmet Denizolgun said: ``We have come
through this without any problems.''
	   The hijacking started Thursday evening, when one or more men
took over an Ankara-bound flight from the southern city of Adana
and demanded it be diverted to Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   Instead of heading to Switzerland, the six-member crew brought
the plane down at Ankara's airport, apparently after initially

neighboring Bulgaria for fuel.
	   Security forces reportedly deployed a 40-member assault team;
ambulances and doctors were called to the airport.

Stanford University researcher jailed in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chinese officials declining to comment. New to
some points. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTHA MENDOZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, California (AP) _ The U.S. government is trying to
help a Stanford University scholar who was arrested during a trip
to his Chinese homeland and has been imprisoned since January,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said.
	   Albright, speaking to business leaders Thursday in San Jose,
said she asked the American embassy in Beijing to ``be very
involved'' in the case of Hua Di.
	   Hua, 63, is suffering from cancer, but has been unable to get
treatment since Jan. 5 when he was arrested for leaking state
secrets.
	   Hua had returned to China for the first time since he left in
1989 during the Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy forces because
he was assured he could do so safely, Stanford officials said,
breaking their silence on his ordeal after ten months.
	   Albright said ``everything that I have seen about the case would
make it clear that there is absolutely no reason for him to be
held.'' She did not discuss whether the State Department has been
involved in the case before this week.
	   Chinese foreign affairs and military officials declined to
comment on Hua's case Friday.
	   The Foreign Ministry would not answer any questions about him,
said a spokeswoman who referred questions to the military. A
spokeswoman for the Defense Ministry also declined to comment.
	   A former high-ranking official in China's military, Hua was
charged with leaking state secrets for allegedly leaking Chinese
military secrets. In recent years, he has published reports in
international journals on China's nuclear and missile programs.
	   Stanford officials denied on Wednesday that he revealed any
state secrets in his work. They noted that Chinese military
officials had cooperated in his research.
	   Hua went to China to attend family memorial services.
	   He has languished in a Beijing prison without medical treatment,
said John Lewis, professor emeritus at Stanford's Center for
International Security and Cooperation.
	   Stanford Provost Condoleezza Rice and others discussed the
arrest after reports of it came out last weekend in a
Chinese-language newspaper in New York and in Hong Kong media.
	   Rice, former Defense Secretary William Perry, chairman of the
center's executive committee, and other Stanford international
security experts have written to the Chinese government on Hua's
behalf.
	   Several hundred American government, academic and cultural
officials were aware of the arrest, but they kept it quiet until
now because ``we agreed our major object was to get him out of that
prison and we needed to keep it out of the press to maximize his
chances for freedom,'' Lewis said.

Counselors hope hard-hitting course reforms men who pay for sex
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic JOHNS ILLO &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGIE WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ A man, a husband, sits at the end of a
courtroom pew. Peeking from under the bill of his baseball cap, he
glimpses images of dead prostitutes _ some just teen-agers _
flashing on the film screen. The trailer is gruesome: slides of
women and men ravaged by sexually transmitted diseases.
	   Across the room, two dozen other men _ sons, fathers, husbands,
boyfriends _ listen to the dangers of prostitution, hearing how it
degrades women and even kills them. Words like ``tricks'' and
``johns,'' both of which mean customers, dot the commentary.
	   All have visited prostitutes. Now they've come to face lectures
and horror stories, guided by counselors who hope they'll also
figure out why they paid for sex.
	   This is ``John School,'' Las Vegas-style, where men caught
paying for sex serve their sentence: An eight-hour class where they
learn more about prostitution and, perhaps, something about
themselves.
	   Based on a program in San Francisco, Las Vegas police and
municipal court began the reformatory school last December with
just 11 students. Since then, more than 600 men have taken the
class. (Although prostitution is legal in some Nevada counties, it
is illegal in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.)
	   The dlrs 350 class is anonymous and voluntary, but if they
complete it, a conviction for soliciting prostitution won't appear
on their record. That's an incentive _ and a chance to educate the
men. But why bother?
	   ``The focus needs to turn to the demand side of prostitution,''
says police Lt. Carlos Cordeiro, who once headed the vice section.
``Many prostitutes _ they're on drugs, they're crack addicts. It's
very, very difficult to change their behavior. The typical john is
your next-door neighbor ... . There's a better chance to change his
behavior.''
	   As the class begins, the men appear angry, frustrated to be
stuck. Some claim they have been wrongly accused. Many are from out
of town, with a round-trip ticket within reach.
	   Hardly anyone talks, but they shift in their seats and ask
questions when Detective Leon Glines shows grisly pictures.
	   ``That's really sobering reality,'' says 37-year-old from New
York, arrested in downtown Las Vegas. ``It's at the brink of making
someone sick.''
	   Of course, he wasn't trying to pick up a prostitute, this man
says. He just wanted to know why she beckoned him, but he couldn't
explain why he stopped.
	   Another man hired a prostitute because, he says, with his
girlfriend gone he had ``idle time.'' His voice trails off: ``If I
was in the house and had something to do ... .''
	   Yet another claims ``animal instincts'' took over.
	   As the day wears on, the stories they hear turn horrific. Sally
Huncovsky, a supervising probation officer at juvenile court, tells
of teen-agers lured into prostitution by pimps.
	   ``We've had girls that have had 500, 1,000, 1,500 sex encounters
with strangers. These girls are basically slaves,'' she says.
``What they think they gain is someone who loves them.''
	   The men are silent. Afterward, Ms. Huncovsky concludes that many
probably picked up a teen-age prostitute and didn't know it.
	   Plastic bags full of condoms circulate, but the men ignore them.
At day's end, many condoms remain in the courtroom. They may not be
able to explain to wives or girlfriends. Picking up prostitutes is
a secret these men keep even from their buddies.
	   Reform won't come easily. Roxane Clark-Murphy, coordinator for
the court's alternative sentencing, believes the solution is in
changing the way men think.
	   ``What makes you think there's a problem?'' one asks her.
	   With a wife of 23 years and a 2-year-old son, he doesn't believe
anything is wrong just because he used a prostitute for
``self-gratification.''
	   This man talks about how he works hard to provide for his
family, how his marriage has changed over the years. ``A lot of us
are grappling with this issue,'' he says, glancing around.
	   But Ms. Clark-Murphy persists, talking about how men are
socialized to provide for families financially. Emotional
responsibility is never discussed. But they do talk about how, as
youths, it was unacceptable for them to cry.
	   They become more talkative, and for the first time, others begin
to look around. ``What we're talking about,'' notes Ms.
Clark-Murphy, ``is changing behavior.''
	   She can back that up, too: Only one man has been arrested again
for the same offense since the program began in Las Vegas.
	   Something within the class has already changed. The men are
talking, sharing, asking questions. They're from all walks of life
_ businessmen with wedding rings, teen-agers without jobs. All have
a common denominator: None wants this humiliation again.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Anti-terrorist squads raided a hijacked
Turkish Airlines flight Friday after a seven-hour standoff at
Ankara's airport, shooting dead the hijacker and freeing the 39
passengers and crew.
	   There were no injuries to the hostages, Transport Minister Arif
Ahmet Denizolgun said.
	   ``Nothing happened to any of our passengers not even a nose
bleed,'' he said.
	   The hijacking started Thursday evening, when a hijacker took

attention, private NTV television said.
	   A freed passenger, Erhan Yatsiman told private television ATV
that the hijacker said he was acting to protest Turkey's crackdown
on Kurdish rebels.
	   It was unclear whether the man was acting alone; some reports
had put the number of hijackers at two.
	   The hijacking marred the nationwide anniversary celebrations
marking the 75th anniversary of the Turkish republic.

Dollar, Japanese stocks fall in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks moved lower Friday morning amid
continued worries over weak Japanese corporate earnings, while the
U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 165.44 points,
or 1.21 percent, to finish the morning session at 13,503.28. On
Thursday, the index gained 152.65 points, or 1.13 percent.
	   The dollar bought 115.57 yen in midday trading, down 0.79 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
116.93 yen overnight.
	   The Tokyo stock market initially staged a positive reaction to
news that Mitsui Trust and Banking Corp., a major Japanese trust
bank, was to withdraw from overseas banking.
	   Traders said sentiment later turned bearish, however, after a
round of buying as many investors sold major blue chips, including
Sony Corp. Sony shares ended morning trading at 7,340 yen (dlrs
63.82) per share, down 360 yen (dlrs 3.13) from Thursday's close.
	   Sony, considered of Japan's strongest companies, said earlier
this week that its group net profit for the full year ending March,
next year, will come to 170 billion yen (dlrs 1.48 billion),
sharply lower than its earlier projection of 215 billion yen (dlrs
1.87 billion) profit.
	   Traders said the weakness in Sony shares also pulled lower other
blue chips, including Toyota Motor, TDK and Fuji Photo Film.
	   Mitsui Trust and Sakura Bank Ltd., a major Japanese bank, later
announced drastic restructuring plans calling for massive job cuts.
Both Mitsui Trust and Sakura belong to the Mitsui group.
	   The cost-cutting move comes as Sakura and many other Japanese
banks scramble to secure funds to write off huge amounts of bad
loans amid the nation's worst recession since World War II.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 3.52 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,033.58. The
TOPIX rose 8.49 points, or 0.83 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
closed at 8,495.03 points in Thursday trading, up 123.06.
	   In foreign exchange, traders said there was some dollar-buying
by Japanese institutional investors and importers earlier in the
session, but the U.S. currency later met selling pressure from
foreign investors.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 0.855 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.870
percent, driving its price up to 108.40 yen from 108.25 yen.

At least 60 killed in fire in Sweden

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ At least 60 people died early Friday
when fire raced through an upstairs discotheque jammed with
hundreds of young people in the city of Goteborg. About 100 others
were injured, many of them seriously.
	   ''It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local
rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio,
describing the sight when rescuers first entered the building.
	   ``We are still searching the building ... but so far we have
found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan Edmundson told the
radio.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   But Olin said there were signs that the fire was set. ''The fact
that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire,''
he said.
	   Olin said he believed this was the worst fire disaster ever in
Sweden.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in the
building of the local Macedonian Association, in a discotheque on
the second story of the brick building.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told the Swedish news agency TT that he was out
on the dance floor when the blaze started.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ``It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people
trampled on each other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked
out the windows and jumped out,'' said Fawz, who estimated there
were about 400 people inside.
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities and
the Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service
to help transport the injured.
	   ``I would think the total of injured taken from here is about
100; our vehicles have been put into shuttle service,'' Stefan
Pettersson, an ambulance coordinator at the scene, was quoted as
saying by TT.
	   Olin said the building had been inspected by the rescue service
in April 1997 and ''fulfilled all possible demands as far as
emergency exits and the possibility for fast evacuation.''
	   Goteborg is Sweden's second-largest city, on the country's west
coast about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

CIA chief visits South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. CIA Director George Tenet met
Friday with South Korean Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek to review
the security situation on the divided Korean peninsula, defense
ministry officials said.
	   Tenet arrived in Seoul on Thursday accompanied by five aides.
Details of his itinerary, including the length of his stay, were
not known.
	   Ministry officials said Tenet's visit was for what they
described as routine consultations.
	   Topics of discussion included North Korea's firing of a rocket
into Japanese airspace on Aug. 31, they said.
	   North Korea has said it put a research satellite into orbit, but
the U.S. has been unable to verify that claim. Japan said the
launch was a test firing of a ballistic missile.

At least 60 killed in fire in Sweden

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A fire raced through an upstairs
discotheque jammed with hundreds of young people early Friday,
killing at least 60 people and injuring about 100 others, many
seriously, in Sweden's second-largest city.
	   ``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local
rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio,
describing the sight when rescuers first entered the building in
Goteborg, on the country's west coast about 500 kilometers (300
miles) southwest of Stockholm.
	   ``We are still searching the building ... but so far we have
found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan Edmundson told the
radio.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   But Olin said there were signs that the fire was set. ``The fact
that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire,''
he said.
	   Olin said he believed this was the worst fire disaster in
Sweden.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in the
building of the local Macedonian Association, in a discotheque on
the second story of the brick building.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told the Swedish news agency TT that he was out
on the dance floor when the blaze started with about 400 people
inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities and
the Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service
to help transport the injured.
	   ``I would think the total of injured taken from here is about
100; our vehicles have been put into shuttle service,'' Stefan
Pettersson, an ambulance coordinator at the scene, was quoted as
saying by TT.
	   Olin said the building was inspected by the rescue service in
April 1997 and ``fulfilled all possible demands as far as emergency
exits and the possibility for fast evacuation.''

Report: French apparel maker may set up export hub in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ French designer label La Chemise
Lacoste may decide within the next three months to make Thailand a
regional export hub for its line of apparel, a local newspaper
reported Friday.
	   Guy Latourrette, president of Devanlay, a manufacturer for
Lacoste, was quoted by The Bangkok Post as saying the French firm
favors Thailand over Asian rivals Hong Kong and Singapore.
	   Latourrette said that while the two other Southeast Asian
economies boast lower tariffs and better distribution systems,
Thailand enjoys a better geographical location, lower prices and
high production quality, the paper reported.
	   The Devanlay executive noted Lacoste earns 30 percent of its
total sales in Asia, and expects to see that figure grow to 50
percent as the company increases its presence in India and China,
the paper said.
	   A second export hub will likely be established in South America,
the paper quoted him as saying.
	   Lacoste officials have said that Thailand is the biggest
producer of counterfeit Lacoste products.

	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch wore itself out
pounding the Honduran coast and was downgraded to a tropical storm
early Friday. But floodwaters continued to rise, cutting off
communities from food, water and medicine.
	   Already, at least 36 people had died and officials had no word
at all from hundreds of small communities cut off by the storms in
Honduras and neighboring Nicaragua. Honduran officials said at
least 15,000 houses had been destroyed along the Atlantic coast.
	   More than 150,000 people had fled homes or hotels in the region.
	   ``God save Honduras!'' said President Carlos Flores Facusse
after flying over parts of the vast disaster zone left by more than
two days of rain-charged hurricane-force winds.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard airplane on Thursday was searching off the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border for a yacht reported missing with 31
people aboard.
	   Mitch, which on Tuesday ranked among the century's most powerful
storms, weakened as it moved slightly inland of the Honduran
coastline Thursday and lost much of its punch.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that at 0300 GMT Friday,
the storm was centered just inland, about 25 miles (40 kilometers)
south of Limon, Honduras.
	   Maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph (80 kph), down from 180
mph (290 kph) early Tuesday. The center said Mitch would probably
weaken if it remained over land, but could regain force if it
returned to sea.
	   On the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) off Honduras'
coast and popular with divers and beachcombers, at least 14 people
died and many houses were destroyed. There were few details because
the islands were cut off except for occasional phone service.
	   ``My God, this thing is getting ugly,'' said 13-year-old Juan
Padilla as he watched the swollen Chamelecon River sweep cars,
trees, cattle and pieces of houses down toward the Caribbean Sea in
La Lima.
	   In addition to the dead on the Bay Islands, Honduras reported
nine other deaths. Nicaraguan emergency officials appealed for
international aid Thursday, saying the death toll there had risen
to 12, with six still missing Thursday night.
	   Mexico said an American was thrown from his boat south of Cancun
on Monday and was presumed dead.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, a 240-foot (73-meter) sailing
yacht with 31 people aboard, was still missing, said the U.S. Coast
Guard, which sent a C-130 transport plane to search for it.
	   The Coast Guard said it had not found the four-masted schooner
by late Thursday, but said it was too early to be alarmed.
	   ``This kind of thing happens often. We obviously don't have a
hurricane out there every day but we try not to make conclusions,''
said Assistant Duty Officer Chet Darby in Miami.
	   The Fantome, which is owned by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, was
on a six-day cruise through Belize and Honduras' Bay Islands when
the storm hit, said Windjammer spokesman James Canty.
	   He said the boat radioed Tuesday that it was heading east to
avoid the hurricane, and hadn't been heard from since. He said the
passengers were of various nationalities.
	   Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had
been isolated, without power, telephones or clean drinking water in
areas where as much as 24 inches (61 centimeters) of rain fell
within six hours.
	   More than 72,000 people were staying in shelters, and countless
more were making do on their own.
	   In La Lima, 110 miles (177 kilometers) northwest of the capital,
Tegucigalpa, entire neighborhoods were in waist-deep water and
hundreds of families had set up tents _ made of scraps of tarp and
wood _ on the highway that runs through town.
	   ``Last night the water just kept rising, so we decided to come
onto the highway,'' said Jose Antonio Galindo, 36, who makes his
living collecting firewood.
	   La Lima is part of the Sula Valley, Honduras' richest
agricultural zone filled with banana plantations. Officials said 40
percent of the 250,000-acre (101,173-hectare) valley was flooded.
	   Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said grain, citrus and
banana crops had been damaged ``and the economic future of Honduras
is uncertain.''
	   In the short term, food, water and medicine already were running
out in communities isolated by the storm.
	   ``Today I just ate manioc with salt, and tomorrow I don't know
what I'll do,'' Maria Gonzalez, 28, said in the town of Tela on
Honduras' northern coast. She held her 6-month-old son Jose in her
arms.
	   In La Ceiba, which is cut off from the rest of the country by
two downed bridges, 10,600 of the city's 40,000 residents were
staying in 18 shelters, and only some had food. Treated water also
had run out, prompting warnings that epidemics could break out.
	   With the weakening storm seemingly anchored off Honduras,
officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency measures on the
Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. More than 20,000 tourists
had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort areas, leaving hotels at
about 20 percent of capacity.
	   Houston accountant Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend
Nina Devries had tried to leave Cancun but found all the flights
full.
	   ``It's been horrible,'' said Montgomery, as she and her friend
drank cocktails at an outdoor restaurant. ``We couldn't go out on a
boat, we couldn't go snorkeling.

Jeyaseelan misses chance at semifinal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUEBEC (AP) _ Toronto's Sonya Jeyaseelan continued her
inconsistent play, falling 6-3, 6-4 Thursday night to unheralded
Alexandra Stevenson at the Bell Challenge tennis tournament.
	   Jeyaseelan, 22, was out-classed in every aspect of the game by
the 17-year-old Stevenson, fumbling a chance to make it to her
second career quarterfinal.
	   ``This year, I've had a lot of ups-and-downs,'' Jeyaseelan said.
``I've had a lot of first-round losses and I haven't developed any
consistency. I think the mental part of my game is missing. I just
need some confidence and need to believe in myself.''
	   Jeyaseelan beat third-seeded Julie Halard-Decugis in the first
round, but had no answers against Stevenson. The American,
seemingly another in a long line of hard-hitting teen-agers who
aren't lacking confidence, used her big first serve to win many
free points.
	   ``My serve is a very big weapon, but I think I have a lot of big
weapons,'' said Stevenson, whose ranking has jumped more than 200
places to 142nd in the current year. Jeyaseelan, who was once
ranked in the top 100, has slipped to 124.
	   ``My goal is to just get as many points as possible,'' said
Stevenson. ``I don't care about the money.''
	   In another evening match, former tennis darling Jennifer
Capriati showed flashes of her old form before losing a thrilling
match to second-seeded Sandrine Testud 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (7-2).
	   Capriati had two match points at 6-5 in the third, but a
double-fault and a forced error led to the tiebreaker, where Testud
triumphed.
	   ``This has to be one of the best matches I've played since my
comeback,'' Capriati said. ``I'm obviously disappointed that I
lost, but I've had a couple of good runs in tournaments, and this
has to be one of them. I couldn't have played a better game than I
did when I had the match points.''
	   The two players combined for high-quality rallies that were
reminiscent of a final.
	   ``She proved that she can come back and play to a higher
level,'' Testud said. ``I hope she can take advantage of what she
did tonight and find a consistency.''
	   Earlier on centre court, fifth seed Chanda Rubin saved two match
points and overcame some sloppy play to beat lucky loser Mashona
Washington 4-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4.
	   Rubin, once a top-10 player, blew numerous chances in the second
and third sets before finally putting away the world's 193rd ranked
player.
	   ``She played really well and had nothing to lose,'' said the
affable 22-year-old. ``And I'd never played her before so I didn't
know what to expect. But I'm not really happy with the way I
played.''
	   The other quarterfinal place went to Jane Chi, who reached the
final eight for the first time in her career. Chi, an American
ranked 128th in the world, beat struggling Czech Denisa Chladkova
6-2, 6-2 in a match filled with unforced errors.

Norman back in the swing and at peace after long break
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An upbeat Greg Norman will return to
tournament golf in two weeks feeling fully fit, serene after his
enforced seven-month break and eager to return to the buzz of
competition.
	   The shoulder surgery which Norman required in April has dropped
him from the top of world golf to No. 13 on the rankings, but he
says he has no need to return to the summit.
	   Norman said Friday he had played seven practice rounds since his
operation, all within the past 10 days and was feeling better than
expected.
	   ``I've got a huge amount of satisfaction in my mind. I've got a
very unfiltered approach to life and golf right now,'' Norman told
a news conference. ``I knew the surgery was the right thing to do.
I didn't have any reservations.''
	   While optimistic, Norman conceded he had yet to test his game in
the heat of battle. ``But the way I feel right now, my ability to
play is just as strong, maybe just a little bit higher, than what
it was preceding the surgery. In other words, I'm 101 percent
fit.''
	   Norman's first challenge will come at his Shark Shootout from
Nov. 13 in Thousand Oaks, California. He will follow up with the
U.S. Skins and then return to his homeland for the Australian Open
in Adelaide and the Presidents Cup in Melbourne, both in December.
	   Norman said he was going back to the sport with the simple aims
he had when he started out as a pro.
	   ``Being No.1 has never been a priority of mine, however long I
was there,'' Norman said. ``I'm going out in 1998-99 with exactly
the same philosophy I went out with in 1977. To go out there and be
the best I can be.''
	   During his recent practice rounds Norman found it hard to adjust
to how far he was hitting the ball. The routine had gone and he now
has to think more about his power and his abilities.
	   But if Norman has any doubts about his mental preparation, he
has them well submerged.
	   ``From a competitive level it's like riding a bike,'' he said.
``Once I'm back in that competitive environment, once I walk to
that first tee, once I'm inside those ropes, that's what I cherish.
I have no fear of that not being there.''
	   Norman has enjoyed his time out of the game. He traveled the
world with his family, watched some Broadway shows, had some fun.
At 43 he is happy with his considerable lot.
	   ``To go back and be No.1? I don't care, if I don't I'm not going
to be bothered about it,'' Norman said. ``As long as I go back and
start winning and playing at the level I want, I'll be a happy
camper.''
	   He has cut his practice time from 6-8 hours a day to about 150
balls, to save wear and tear on his body. He hopes the decision to
scale back the time he spends working on his game to help him stay
fresh.
	   ``I get more enjoyment out of playing and practicing now than I
have done for the last 5-8 years because of my mental philosophy on
how to go about things,'' Norman said.

Australian state to provide baby food, other aid to Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian state of Victoria
will provide a wide-ranging program of aid to Indonesia to help it
weather the regional economic crisis under a memorandum of
understanding signed Friday.
	   Victorian State Premier Jeff Kennett and Indonesian Horticulture
and Food Minister A.M. Saefuddin signed the memorandum in the
Victorian capital city of Melbourne.
	   The program will initially provide assistance for babies in a
region just west of Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, where the
Victorian government will supply, transport and distribute products
developed in consultation with food scientists and nutritionists.
	   Kennett said the government would supply a blended formula for
six to 12-month old infants, to about 40,000 babies in the
Tangerang region in west Java.
	   The program, which will start up in December, would run until
the World Bank provided money for a similar program, something
expected between February and April next year.
	   ``I hope that Victorians will feel some ownership of the work we
do up there,'' Kennett said.
	   Victoria's government will also provide management assistance
for state-owned enterprises, assist in modernizing Indonesia's
railway system, and provide advice on farming.

Taylor downplays Ashes importance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor
has opened hostilities in the traditional Ashes war of words by
claiming the series is no longer the most important on the home
side's calendar.
	   Ever since Australia first played England in cricket more than
120 years ago, the biennial series have been the highlight for fans
and players alike. But the Australians, who have easily won every
series played since 1989, are now looking to other countries to
provide challenges.
	   ``I don't know about the Ashes being the ultimate,'' Taylor said
Friday. ``It's up there on a parallel with all the other series. We
want to win every series, whether it's in India, Pakistan, the
Caribbean, South Africa or wherever.''
	   He also denied suggestions England will have an advantage over
the home side because they will have had a better preparation by
the time the first test is played in Brisbane from Nov. 20.
	   Taylor, Ian Healy, Stuart MacGill and Michael Slater have
returned home from the tour of Pakistan while the remainder of the
Australians have stayed on the subcontinent for the Wills Cup in
Bangladesh and three limited overs games in Pakistan.
	   England selectors opted to send a second string side to
Bangladesh in order to keep its test squad together before the
series opener.
	   Most of the Australians, including Mark and Steve Waugh and pace
spearhead Glenn McGrath, will remain on foreign soil until just one
week before the Brisbane test.
	   But Taylor said when England toured four years ago, the
Australians also stayed in Pakistan until a week before the first
test.	   
	   ``The Australian cricket team has gotten used to the hectic
schedule. It's now part and parcel of being an international
cricketer,'' Taylor said.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Anti-terrorist squads raided a hijacked
Turkish Airlines flight Friday after a seven-hour standoff at
Ankara's airport, shooting dead the hijacker and freeing the 38
passengers and crew.
	   The hijacker was armed with a grenade and gun and declared he
was acting to protest Turkey's crackdown on Kurdish rebels,
according to accounts from the government and from passengers.
	   Security forces shot him at least four times in the 10-minute
raid, private NTV television said.
	   ``He didn't die immediately, but he was shot again,'' passenger
Yakup Aslan said.
	   There were no injuries to the hostages, Transport Minister Arif
Ahmet Denizolgun said.
	   ``Nothing happened to any of our passengers _ not even a nose
bleed,'' Denizolgun said.
	   Officials suspected the hijacking was timed to Thursday's 75th
anniversary of Turkey's founding as a secular republic. The
anniversary brought hundreds of foreign dignitaries and prompted
military parades, street concerts and fireworks nationwide.
	   The hijacker had taken over the Ankara-bound flight Thursday
evening demanding it be diverted to Lausanne, Switzerland. The
Swiss city is significant to Kurds as the site of a 1919 treaty
that blocked their hopes of a Kurdish state.
	   But instead of heading to Switzerland, the six-member crew
brought the plane down at the Turkish capital's airport, apparently
after initially misleading the hijacker into thinking the flight
was stopping for fuel in neighboring Bulgaria.
	   The hijacker agreed to release some passengers after hours of
negotiations. While his attention was diverted by the release of
those passengers, the anti-terrorist squad raided the parked plane
from the back, private ATV television said.
	   Last week, the same plane was prevented from taking off from the
Strasbourg airport by protesters trying to prevent French officials
from deporting a Kurd to Turkey.
	   Kurdish rebels have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984. The conflict has killed close to 37,000
people.
	   Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this year,
each time with no real weapons and with no injuries. The latest was
in September, when a man with a toy gun commandeered a domestic
flight to protest government restrictions on Islam.
	   In February, the hijacker was a man claiming to have a teddy
bear packed with explosives. Authorities said later he was mentally
ill.

Indonesia provides money to guarantee letters of credit for
</HEADLINE>
exporters

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government has
earmarked dlrs 5.5 billion to guarantee letters of credit for local
exporters hit by frozen international bank credit lines, a local
newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted Bank Indonesia Director Miranda Gultom
as saying the measure would help accelerate the recovery of
Indonesian industry and help the Southeast Asian country's
crisis-ridden economy.
	   ``There are seven letters of credit guarantee arrangements,
which have been or will soon be operational,'' she was quoted as
saying by the newspaper.
	   Miranda was quoted as saying that negotiations on providing
foreign capital for raw material exports have been initiated with
Brunei, China, Germany, the Netherlands and Singapore.
	   A widespread lack of confidence in the ability of Indonesian
banks to meet the terms of financing deals has led many foreign
financial institutions to reject letters of credit from Indonesia's
lenders.
	   Many Indonesia exporters need letters of credit to import raw
materials for their production.
	   Bank Indonesia, the nation's central bank, pumped public money
into banks earlier this year in a bid to alleviate the credit
crunch, but few exporters were said to have tapped into the funds
due to the high interest rates attached to them.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Geoff Courtnall scored on a penalty shot midway
through the third period as the St. Louis Blues beat the Detroit
Red Wings 3-1 on Thursday night.
	   Courtnall broke free after a feed from Scott Young and was
bearing down on goalie Chris Osgood when Aaron Ward began hooking
him to throw him off. Courtnall nearly scored anyway with a shot
that banged off the goal post.
	   On the penalty shot, Courtnall beat Osgood with a wrist shot
that sailed over the goalie's left shoulder.
	   Scott Pellerin and Al MacInnis also scored for the Blues. Doug
Brown scored for Detroit.
 &UR; Senators 3, Flyers 1 &QC; 
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Andreas Johansson scored twice and Radek
Bonk added a goal in an injury-delayed first period as Ottawa beat
Philadelphia.
	   The final 4:47 of the period was played after the first
intermission because of a injury to Ottawa's Andreas Dackell. The
right wing sustained a concussion and facial cuts requiring 15
stitches in a collision with Philadelphia captain Eric Lindros.
	   Dackell, cut by his own visor, was on the ice for about 12
minutes before being taken to the dressing room on a stretcher.
Lindros, who scored a shorthanded goal in the third period, was not
penalized on the play.
	   Damian Rhodes stopped 28 shots to help Ottawa end a 12-game
losing streak against Philadelphia dating to April 26, 1995.
 &UR; Canadiens 1, Bruins 1 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Brian Savage scored a power-play goal with 41 seconds
remaining in the second period as Montreal tied Boston.
	   Steve Heinze had a power-play goal at 15:32 of the first period
for the Bruins, who routed the Canadiens 9-2 on Wednesday night in
Montreal. Heinze has three goals this season and 100 in his NHL
career.
 &UR; Devils 2, Islanders 1 &QC; 
	   In Uniondale, New York, Bobby Holik and Dave Andreychuk scored
first-period goals and Martin Brodeur made 22 saves for New Jersey.
	   New Jersey, coming off a 4-0 home loss to Los Angeles on
Wednesday night, won for the third time in four games. Jason Dawe
scored for New York.

At least 60 killed in fire in Sweden

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ At least 60 people died early Friday
when fire raced through a building jammed with hundreds of
teen-agers attending an immigrant association's discotheque dance
in the city of Goteborg. About 190 others were injured, many of
them seriously.
	   ``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local
rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio,
describing the sight when rescuers first entered the building.
	   ``We are still searching the building ... but so far we have
found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan Edmundson told the
radio.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   But Olin said there were signs that the fire was set. ``The fact
that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire,''
he said.
	   Olin said he believed this was the worst fire disaster ever in
Sweden.
	   The Swedish news agency TT reported that 190 people were taken
to hospitals with injuries from the fire, and at least seven of
them were in serious condition.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in the
building of the local Macedonian Association. The immigrant group
had organized a disco dance for young people to celebrate Halloween
and officials said the crowd was mostly aged about 13 to 18. The
dance was held in the building's second story.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ``It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people
trampled on each other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked
out the windows and jumped out,'' said Fawz, who estimated there
were about 400 people inside.
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities and
the Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service
to help transport the injured.
	   Olin said the building had been inspected by the rescue service
in April 1997 and ``fulfilled all possible demands as far as
emergency exits and the possibility for fast evacuation.''
	   Goteborg is Sweden's second-largest city, on the country's west
coast about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A fire raced through an upstairs

Stojko returns to competitive skating, crowd's welcome
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM SUHR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ A day after admitting he liked to push his
sport's envelope, Elvis Stojko returned to competitive skating and
tried to prove his point.
	   The fact that the Canadian star tumbled trying a quadruple toe
loop _ allowed in a short program this year for the first time _
seemed to matter little to the three-time world champion, the Skate
America judges or the crowd.
	   Stojko still took home high marks _ even a near-perfect 5.9 by a
Japanese judge _ and enters Saturday's decisive free skate in
second place, shadowing reigning world champion Alexei Yagudin of
Russia.
	   Not bad for a guy who's been out the past eight months, trying
to mend a groin tear he aggravated en route to a silver medal in
February's Winter Olympics.
	   The announced attendance of more than 2,200 fans embraced his
return, offering up the night's loudest applause. One woman's held
a sign exclaiming, ``Elvis, you're still the king.''
	   Now on Saturday, he hopes his free-skate routine to the
``Merlin'' soundtrack works some magic in overtaking Yagudin and
fending off American upstart Michael Weiss, holding third after an
energetic, flawless routine to a Van Halen medley.
	   Russia's Alexei Urmanov, himself battling back from a groin
injury in hopes of returning to form that won him Olympic gold in
1994, enters Saturday's free skate in fourth place. On Thursday
night, he had skated to classical music but had problems, falling
once and salvaging his balance another time.
	   As the first event in the International Skating Union's Grand
Prix series, Skate America features Olympic-eligible skaters. The
series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks before
the world championships in Finland.
	   It's where Stojko wants to be, and he took a step that way on
Thursday night. So did Urmanov.
	   After edging Stojko for Olympic gold at Lillehammer in 1994,
Urmanov tore a groin muscle in the March 1997 world championship in
Switzerland, withdrew from that event and watched Stojko vault to
his third world title.
	   Urmanov missed all of last season _ including a chance to repeat
as Olympic champion _ but made his return a rewarding one, winning
a silver medal in last summer's Goodwill Games in New York. Stojko
hadn't competed since February, when he braved the injury and
captured silver at Nagano, Japan.
	   On Wednesday, Stojko and Urmanov had realistic expectations of
their Skate America outcome.
	   ``I'm not aiming anywhere _ not high or low. I'm just here to
compete,'' Stojko said. ``I'm more interested in getting my feet
underneath me. I don't need the added pressure of, `I've got to win
this.'''
	   Said Urmanov: ``I just don't want to skate terrible.''
	   Earlier this year, Yagudin skated to the world title in
Minneapolis after Stojko and Olympic champion Ilia Kulik withdrew.
At 18, Yagudin became the second-youngest world champion, arriving
at the top at least a year ahead of schedule while building upon
his fifth-place finish at Nagano.
	   Weiss was second in the U.S. championships the past two years.
Now 22, the Virginian won the world junior championships in 1994
and finished seventh at Nagano. Earlier this month in a meet in
Florida, he was second, two spots ahead of Kulik.
	   Earlier Thursday, France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat
won the compulsories in ice dance and Russia's Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze won the pairs short program.
	   Anissina and Peizerat, second in this year's world championships
and Olympic bronze medalists in February, were followed by Russia's
Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh. Italy's Barbara Fusar-Poli and
Mariusz Margaglio were third, heading into Saturday's free skate.
	   Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, the defending pairs world champions
and Olympic silver medalists, were followed by Canada's Kristy
Sargeant and Kris Wirtz and siblings Danielle and Steve Hartsell of
nearby Westland, Mich.
	   ``Tonight was just a good night for us,'' Danielle Hartsell
said, appreciative of the home ice, of sorts, and the friendly
cheers it produced. ``It was exciting for us because all of our
friends and family were here to see us.''
	   Friday's Skate America women's short program features world
bronze medalist Maria Butyrskaya of Russia and American Nicole
Bobek, the 1995 U.S. champion now trying to reestablish herself
after placing 17th at Nagano.
	   On Wednesday, Stojko described his past eight months as a series
of emotional highs and lows _ nothing compared to Bobek's run of
misfortune.
	   She hit her career's low point when her coach died of a heart
attack during the 1997 world championships, and then flopped at
Nagano while fighting bronchitis and a hip injury.
	   While practicing in Detroit two weeks ago, she crashed into the
boards, lost consciousness for several minutes and suffered a
concussion.
	   ``I'm OK now,'' Bobek said Thursday.
	   ``It was a certain era in my life like every competition has
been,'' she said. ``There's no need to dwell on the past. If I
dwelled on the past, I think I'd go berserk.
	   ``I feel I'm in control of my life.''
	   In bidding for a return to prominence, she again is training at
the Detroit Skating Club with Richard Callaghan, the coach who
helped make her the 1995 national champion and world bronze
medalist.
	   ``We're not all robots out there,'' she said. ``And I think it's
my time to bloom.''
