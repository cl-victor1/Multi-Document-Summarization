   NIGERIA-ASSESS (Abuja, Nigeria) _ News Analysis: Abuja is in
many ways suggestive of Nigeria as whole, a country still seeking a
firm basis for democracy and unity 38 years after independence. It
is this solidly democratic state that the country's new military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has now solemnly promised
Nigeria's 105 million citizens. By Roger Cohen.

<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS (Chihuahua, Mexico) _ A radical idea is gaining
momentum within Mexico's governing party: primary elections. For
six decades after its founding in 1929, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party so thoroughly monopolized Mexican politics that
elections were a mere ritual in which its candidates won election
to all but a handful of government posts. But in recent years,
one-party rule has come under assault in Mexico as elsewhere in the
world. By Sam Dillon.

   MACAU-GANG-WAR (Macau) _ In an isolated jail cell on a tiny
island next to this Portuguese colony sits a 43-year-old Chinese
man who has held Macau in thrall. Law enforcement officials here
say he is one of the most notorious organized crime figures in
Southeast Asia. His lawyer says he is merely a colorful businessman
whose penchant for publicity has landed him in a world of trouble.

the one thing voters in this fast-growing district north of Seattle
are sure to hear in her run for Congress is that she is also a
homosexual. As one of four open lesbians running for national
office this year, Ms. Cammermeyer is trying to do something no one
has ever done: become the first, openly-gay, nonincumbent elected
to Congress. By Timothy Egan.

CELEBRATING A RULING, AIDS GROUP RALLIES ON CITY HALL STEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see NY-CITY-HALL-PROTEST)  
 (bl)  
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Waving mocking placards of a smiling Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani stamped ``AIDS criminal'' in blood red, about 45 people
from a housing advocacy group rallied Tuesday for improved services
for people with AIDS on the steps of City Hall, New York's most
famous soapbox.
</P>
<P>
   The boisterous demonstration came a day after a federal judge in
Manhattan ruled that a city policy banning large groups from
holding news conferences on the City Hall steps was
unconstitutional, saying that the mayor had used the policy
selectively to allow groups like the Young Republicans to gather,
while blocking Housing Works, a combative advocacy group that has
been critical of him.
</P>
<P>
   With utter relish, the demonstrators Tuesday tested the judge's
ruling and crowded the stone steps of City Hall in front of news
cameras and reporters, as if for a class picture. The group
released a report that accused the Giuliani administration of
failing to comply with a year-old city law intended to strengthen
AIDS services.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters exercised their reaffirmed free-speech rights by
shouting at the top of their lungs, ``Hey, Rudy, it's the law,
duh!'' Police officers stood nearby but did not intervene. The
mayor was in the Bronx during the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the significance of the federal judge's ruling,
the co-executive director of Housing Works, Charles King, said the
Giuliani administration had been more restrictive than any other
administration in prohibiting people from exercising their right to
hold rallies and conduct other free-speech activities.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Works, an offshoot of Act Up New York, was organized in
1990 to provide housing, advocacy and other services to homeless
people infected with the virus that causes AIDS. The nonprofit
group is involved in a separate legal dispute with the Giuliani
administration over city contracts it claims were canceled as
payback for years of vitriolic protests.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest legal episode, Housing Works had recently
requested to hold a rally with as many as 50 people on the steps of
City Hall but was turned down. In response, a lawsuit was filed on
behalf of the group challenging the city's policy of limiting the
number of people to 25 at such events.
</P>
<P>
   ``These steps and access to them have been denied in an
arbitrary and capricious manner for too long,'' said City
Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat who joined the
rally, along with Councilman Thomas Duane, a Manhattan Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The two Council members were the sponsors of Local Law 49, which
was intended to protect and improve services provided by the New
York City Human Resources Administration's Division of AIDS
Services and Income Support. The division serves more than 23,000
poor people with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the division's clients have the right to benefits
like transportation, nutrition allowances and safe housing that is
appropriate for people with suppressed immune systems. But the
report released by Housing Works said the Giuliani administration
had violated the law in nine major areas, including requiring
people infected with HIV to submit to an ``eligibility verification
review'' to get services.
</P>
<P>
   In January the advocacy group obtained an order in state Supreme
Court to prohibit the city from continuing the reviews, but the
city has appealed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report said that thousands of infected people,
including 3,000 on public assistance, were unaware that they were
eligible for special benefits and services because the city had
refused to publicize and implement the new law's expanded
eligibility criteria appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   King said the mayor had held the law in contempt. ``We fully
expected a good faith effort, but there has not been a good faith
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office referred questions about the rally to a
spokeswoman for the city's Health Department, Sandra Mullin, who
did not respond to Housing Works' specific allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mullin said the city had done a great deal to help people
with HIV and AIDS. ``It's not surprising that Housing Works would
take this stance and simply ignore all that has been
accomplished,'' she said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the top floor of the Woodstock Hotel on 43d
Street, Thereza Feliconio could look out onto Bryant Park, the news
zipper around 1 Times Square and the dense collection of high-rise
buildings east of Broadway. She was a big-city person who loved
living in the heart of the city, and although she lived in a
subsidized residence for the poor, she dressed as if it were the
fanciest hotel in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always had her hair in place and nice makeup,'' said her
nephew, Ricardo Muniz, who frequently took her to dinner, movies
and the theater.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning at 8:30, one of the many chunks of steel that
broke free from a construction site across the street crashed into
her room, No. 1202, burying Ms. Feliconio, 85, and all of the
knickknacks and memories she had accumulated in her pink-accented
room over the years in a shower of plaster and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ground zero was the room Thereza Feliconio was in,'' said
Cynthia Dial, executive director of Project Find, which owns and
operates the 285-room, single-room occupancy hotel that caters to
the elderly poor. ``Her room was reduced to rubble.'' It took
rescue workers 20 minutes to dig through the wreckage to recover
her body, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feliconio, her nephew said, grew up in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in
a large and prosperous family. About 30 years ago, she moved to New
York City, where she made a living caring for elderly people. Her
only living brother, Carlos Feliconio, is flying to New York on
Wednesday morning from Hollywood, Fla., Muniz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She helped the disabled people, people who needed personal
care,'' Muniz said. ``She had the heart, the strength to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And she had a love of the lights and glitter that drew her to
live in Times Square, he said. ``She was active,'' Muniz said.
``She liked to go out, to dine out, to have nice lunches and long
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved Carmine's,'' he said, referring to a popular Italian
restaurant. ``We went to Phantom, Beauty and the Beast, musicals.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Muniz was at his office a few blocks away,
where he works as an airline ticket agent, when he heard about ``a
commotion.'' He went out to investigate. ``It was surreal,'' he
said. ``I bumped into a guy who worked at the hotel and he broke me
the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dial remembered Ms. Feliconio as a ``lovely, lovely quiet
woman.'' She had decorated her room herself, she said. ``She had
lots of nice furniture and knickknacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees described her as reserved and gracious, a woman of
medium height who gave everybody a quiet hello. She had lived at
the Woodstock for about 10 years, Muniz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never complained _ even when things were not going so
great,'' he said. ``She always pumped me up. She made me feel good
about life.''

GM SATURN FACTORY STILL OPEN, BUT FRUSTRATION SIMMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for an extensive rewrite of the first six grafs, which have
been expanded to nine grafs)  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRING HILL, Tenn. _ The biggest question in the auto industry
this summer is how the enormous factory here is still churning out
Saturn cars a month after strikes at parts factories in Flint,
Mich., forced every other General Motors assembly plant in the
United States to close.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that the 7,300 workers and their union have struck
an uncomfortable bargain. In the name of preserving the nation's
best-known experiment in cooperation between labor and management,
they have set aside union solidarity by assembling cars using parts
from Japan and at least one nonunion American company, instead of
parts from Flint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt OK about it mainly because the biggest thing is to
satisfy your customers,'' Stacey Young, a unionized wheel inspector
and strong supporter of the local union leadership, said as he
stood inside the entrance to the United Automobile Workers union
hall here.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the factory here keeps humming thanks to outside
suppliers, the autoworkers are furious because GM plans to build
future Saturn cars and a new sport utility vehicle using many parts
from elsewhere _ other GM factories, as well as outside suppliers
paying lower wages.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest expression yet of workers' frustration came on
Sunday, when they voted overwhelmingly to authorize their leaders
to call a strike if further negotiations failed to resolve the
local union's concerns. Yet in a sign of continued reluctance to
cause any harm to the GM division they helped to build, local union
leaders have since said that they will talk for at least 30 days
before actually starting a walkout. If the Flint strikes are
settled during that time, national leaders of the UAW are unlikely
to give their permission soon for any more local strikes, so as to
give GM and the union a chance to recover for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the workers' dissatisfaction here appears to be the
leading edge of a new source of conflict between GM and the UAW.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent strikes, including the 7-week-old strikes in
Flint, have been by workers demanding that the automaker invest
more in their factories and not switch production to outside
suppliers. But workers here are opposing even GM's new campaign to
reap huge economies of scale in its own factories by building a few
common parts in huge volumes for many models. In the case of
Saturn, workers do not want a new sport utility vehicle to use
engines, transmissions and dashboards built at other GM factories.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's only Saturn factory began producing cars eight
years ago. The UAW contract with GM here calls for substantial
participation by workers in everything from how work stations on
the assembly line are laid out to the long-range strategy of the
Saturn division. The factory quickly attracted hundreds of
delegations each year from companies and unions around the world.
Visitors marveled at how Saturn workers could be so productive and
get along so well with management in an industry and a corporation
known for fractious labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Workers had hoped that the success of the Saturn brand would
prompt General Motors to build more models here and even produce
most of the parts here, thus preserving the Spring Hill factory's
unusual self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn workers voted by a two-thirds majority in March to keep
their innovative labor contract, which has given workers a large
say, until now, in many business decisions. But relations with
management have deteriorated considerably since that referendum was
held, partly because of GM's plans to build the Saturn-brand sport
utility vehicle with relatively few parts from the factory here. GM
is also paying workers a second-quarter bonus of $390 apiece when
the union says $1,400 is owed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though many workers are particularly upset by their bonuses,
their leaders are more worried about the planned sport utility
vehicle. Though there has been no suggestion that GM will close the
7,300-employee factory here, employment will decline if less work
is done inside, Michael Bennett, the local union chairman, warned.
``They are looking at just basically outsourcing everything they
can, and run it through a lean assembly and still call it a
Saturn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hudler, Saturn's chairman and president, began meeting
here Tuesday with local union officials in an effort to reconcile
differences. But having created one of the nation's most successful
brands, GM is determined to put the Saturn name on more models, and
not just models produced by the workers here. GM is currently
expanding the Spring Hill factory and wants to use its equipment to
full capacity, so job losses are unlikely regardless of what
vehicle models or parts are produced here, one company official
added.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives have made no secret of their desire to improve the
automaker's economies of scale by building just a few vehicle
underbodies, engines and transmissions and then varying the sheet
metal that goes over them.
</P>
<P>
   GM, the world's largest automaker, previously used 22 vehicle
underbody designs, each costing more than $500 million to engineer
and sometimes differing by millimeters. Now the company has 14
chassis and plans to shrink the number to nine within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Anger started to build here two years ago, when GM decided that
a long-awaited Saturn midsize sedan, scheduled to go on sale next
year, would share an underbody with the Opel Astra sedan from GM's
Opel division in Germany. The Saturn SL will be produced in
Wilmington, Del., at a much older GM factory with a more
traditional union agreement than here.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn employees are particularly distressed to see work being
done elsewhere because the small-car market is withering, as low
gasoline prices have persuaded many Americans to buy sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks instead. Small-car sales dropped 7.6
percent during the first half of this year from the first half of
last year, while sales of sport utility vehicles rose 18.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn now makes only small cars, with prices ranging from
$10,595 for an economy version to $17,500 for a sports coupe with
lots of options. Even within the small-car market, Saturn has been
losing ground in the last two years to Asian competitors that have
used the weakness of their home currencies to offer lavish rebates
and other discounts. During the first half of this year, Saturn's
sales tumbled 9.4 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn's reliance on small cars worries even workers like
Barbara Mason, a transmission gear assembly worker here who
supports the current arrangement. ``Our biggest concern is job
security,'' she said. ``We need something to come online to
preserve our job security.''

</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was a respiratory ailment that he

   By the time McAllister replaced Sonny Fox as host of the
three-hour Sunday morning children's extravaganza known as
``Wonderama,'' in 1967, the program had been on the air for more
than a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   But McAllister quickly made it his own, enthralling children
with magic tricks, supervising the games and contests for children
in the interactive studio audience, introducing the cartoons, and,
for a while, even making his shaggy dog, Ralph, a part of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of his run, McAllister often worked with his
faithful sidekick, Chauncey, a ventriloquist's dummy to whom he
owed his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Philadelphia who grew up in Norfolk, Va., McAllister
became fascinated with magic and ventriloquism at 10. In high
school he spent so much time practicing his hobbies (and so little
time doing his homework) that his despairing parents promised to
buy him a dummy if he ever turned in a report card with all A's and
B's.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, his mother recalled on Tuesday, her son made at
least a B in all his classes, and she paid $45 for his reward, the
dummy he named Chauncey.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, during a 1953 family trip to New York in
honor of his high school graduation, as his parents slept, he
slipped out of his hotel room with Chauncey and stationed himself
outside the windows of NBC's ``Today'' show. The host, Dave
Garroway, was so charmed that he summoned McAllister into the
studio and later helped him get on Ted Mack's ``Amateur Hour,''
which he won.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief college stint, McAllister became host of a
children's program in Norfolk and later moved to a station in
Baltimore before getting his ``Wonderama'' job.
</P>
<P>
   Although the program, which was produced by Metromedia, was seen
only in New York and half a dozen other cities, they were all major
television markets, and for most of his run McAllister owned the
Sunday morning airways, attracting half the Sunday morning
audience, according to Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   (It was a reflection of television's attitude toward children's
programming at the time that when ``Wonderama'' was withdrawn at
the end of 1977, Metromedia attributed the cancellation to a
ratings decline that had left the program with a meager 36 percent
of the audience.)
</P>
<P>
   It was an index of the program's appeal to children from 4 to 15
that at the final taping, in December 1977, one of those in the
studio audience of 200 ``children'' was a 21-year-old who had
applied for his coveted ticket eight years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year of the cancellation, McAllister had developed a
new show, ``Kids Are People, Too,'' (named for his ``Wonderama''
theme song) for ABC, but although the show won an Emmy, McAllister,
in his 40s, was replaced as host after a few months by a younger
man.
</P>
<P>
   Chauncey had long since been retired, but McAllister's old love
of magic pulled him through. In addition to touring the country,
performing at amusement parks and elsewhere and lecturing on the
magician's art, he developed and manufactured magician's tricks,
among them one known as Molly McBubble (whose durable bubbles
McAllister would catch, put in his pocket and retrieve intact).
</P>
<P>
   McAllister, whose work was honored by the Society of American
Magicians and the International Brotherhood of Magicians, taught
magic at adult classes at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan and
reached a new generation of children through a video, ``Bob
McAllister's Amazing Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a child at heart, until he became ill a few months ago,
McAllister made his rounds of Manhattan magic supply shops on
skates.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister, who was married and divorced twice, is survived by
his mother, Peg McAllister of Virginia Beach, Va.; three daughters,
Susan Abbott of Clearwater, Fla., Robin McAllister of Manhattan and
Molly Jo McAllister of Ossining, N.Y., and three grandchildren.

CHIEFS OF NBA AND PLAYERS DECIDE TO RESUME BARGAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Revealing progress for the first time since the
National Basketball Association's owner-imposed lockout began three
weeks ago, commissioner David Stern and players' union leader Billy
Hunter met on Tuesday morning and decided to resume bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Hunter talked for 90 minutes over breakfast to discuss
a potential date for the first negotiations since talks broke off
after an unproductive 30-minute meeting between representatives
from the league and the players association June 22. Stern and
Hunter are expected to call each other Friday and set up a
bargaining session for early August.
</P>
<P>
   ``David and I met, and it was a cordial meeting, but it didn't
focus on the specifics of our negotiations,'' said Hunter, who is
the executive director of the players association. ``Instead, we
talked more generally about our desire to resume bargaining. I let
David know that my ultimate goal remains reaching an agreement both
sides can live with as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither side has budged on the key issues preventing
labor peace. If the dispute is left unresolved heading into the
season, the battle could lead to lost games for the first time in
league history. Eight days after the last bargaining session ended
abruptly, the lockout began. Until a new labor agreement is signed,
teams are prohibited from negotiating with, signing or trading
players.
</P>
<P>
   This also means that players whose contracts call for them to be
paid during the summer months are without their salaries. Acting on
their behalf, the players association requested arbitration with
John Feerick, the grievance arbitrator under the labor agreement
that expired at midnight June 30.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the NBA sued its players union, contending that the
league should not have to pay players during the lockout and that
it should not have to go to arbitration. The league also asked that
Feerick, who reduced Golden State guard Latrell Sprewell's
suspension from Stern for choking his coach, P.J. Carlesimo, be
removed as arbitrator on the grounds that his term had expired.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Feerick handed the players association a small
victory when he decided that he has the authority to decide if he
has jurisdiction to be the arbitrator in the matter, said a union
spokesman, Dan Wasserman. He will hear arguments from both sides on
July 30.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the dispute over the collective bargaining
agreement, owners want to put a ceiling on how much players can
earn in a system they reluctantly approved three years ago. Under
the old agreement, the owners had the right to reopen the deal if
player payroll exceeded 51.8 percent of basketball-related
revenues. Stern has said player payroll accounted for more than 57
percent of the revenues taken in by the league last year. That
figure has been seriously questioned by the players association.
</P>
<P>
   There is also one more major issue that divides the two sides,
one that the players feel is sacred: the Larry Bird exception. This
clause enables teams to pay their own free agents whatever they
want regardless of the salary cap, allowing the Bulls' Michael
Jordan to be paid $33 million last year when the cap for an entire
team was $26.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The players say it is up to owners to show fiscal
responsibility, and intend to resist changes in the system that
would result in a hard salary cap. Although neither side has budged
on the issues, they are scheduled to talk again. And after three
weeks of silence during the lockout, this is a breakthrough.

PAK'S EARLY SUCCESS SURPRISES EVEN HER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a derailment last week at the JAL Big Apple Classic, in
New Rochelle, N.Y., where she finished four over par following her
record-tying 23-under performance a week earlier, Se Ri Pak will
try to get back on track in time for the du Maurier Classic, Aug.
6-9, in Windsor, Ontario, the last major on the Ladies Professional
Golf Association tour.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, 20, has taken women's golf by storm in the United States by
becoming the first rookie to win two majors in the same year since
Juli Inkster in 1984, and the first woman under 21 to capture two
majors in a year. She followed her triumph at the McDonald's LPGA
Championship with a playoff victory in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Pak admitted in a conference call Tuesday from Warren, Ohio,
where she is in the field for the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic, that
her goal had been to win her first major in the year 2006. ``I'm
surprised that things happened so fast,'' she said. ``I was looking
to learn the golf courses the first few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak also said she was surprised at how many young people in her
native South Korea have taken up golf because of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear too many children start golf because of me,'' she said.
``I just want to be like Nancy Lopez. She's the top player, and
she's nice to people. I want to be remembered like Nancy Lopez. She
plays every tournament like it's important, so I want to push
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   With Lopez and Annika Sorenstam, the JAL winner, joining her in
this week's field, Pak will have plenty of motivation. She said her
father, Joon Chul Pak, has helped her over last week's stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind is settled down because he's my first teacher,'' Pak
said. ``I feel comfortable now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hustling Around the Course
</P>
<P>
   Watched by some 50 spectators, four members of Gardiners Bay
Country Club in Shelter Island, N.Y., played 117 holes in 15{ hours
Monday _ walking the course in the heat and humidity _ to raise
money for Junior Golf on Long Island and the entire metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   Playing from 5 a.m. until 8:30 p.m., the foursome raised $12,500
in completing six and a half rounds over the par-72 course.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Adipietro, an anesthesiologist at Mount Sinai Medical
Center, initiated the affair. He was joined by Barry Walz, a
contractor; Jay Card, a police officer, and Gary Blados, who works
in the pro shop and plays golf for St. John's University. Blados
led the group in scoring by averaging 67.5 strokes a round.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had blisters on their feet at the end, but it was all for
a worthy cause,'' said Robert DeStefano, the head pro at the club.
</P>
<P>
   No Help Needed
</P>
<P>
   Carl Alexander of Pine Hollow in East Norwich, N.Y., showed up
for the Met Open qualifying at nearby North Hills Country Club on
Monday to discover he had no caddie as he competed with 167 other
players for 18 spots in the tournament, which will be staged next
month at the Creek Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guy I was playing with I'd better do something on
the front nine because I'd get tired on the back nine carrying my
bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander proceeded to birdie six holes on the front nine and
finish at six-under 66 as the medalist at the 6,475-yard North
Hills course to qualify for his third Met Open. He finished tied
for sixth in the New York State Open last week.
</P>
<P>
   Doell Wins State Amateur
</P>
<P>
   Sara Doell rallied from a four-hole deficit after 27 holes to
capture the New York State Women's Amateur with a 2-and-1 victory
over Chawwadee Pompothong last week at St. Andrew's Golf Club in
Hastings-on-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Doell, of Webster Golf Club near Rochester, plays at Penn State,
and Pompothong, of Dunwoodie Golf Club in Yonkers, plays at Yale.
Pompothong dominated the 36-hole match through 27 holes, but Doell
played the next eight holes in four under par to win her first
state title.
</P>
<P>
   In other women's amateur play, Sue Sempler's streak of
consecutive Bergen Country titles came to an end at five last week
at Arcola Country Club in Paramus, N.J. Sempler finished tied for
third behind the winner, Kattie Allison, and Joni Clause.

INCOMING PLAYERS COULD BE BOON FOR SENIOR TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The old-timers find their way back to Dodger
Stadium for an exhibition from time to time. Tommy Davis lumbers
around the bases. Ted Sizemore chases after ground balls. Everyone
has a good time _ and no one pays the least mind to the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine a box score being kept. And standings. Imagine the
over-the-hill gang packing off to Cincinnati for another game _
that counts.
</P>
<P>
   Preposterous. And yet the Senior PGA Tour, launched in 1980, was
built on this very premise of providing a competitive showcase for
aging players who no longer could _ or cared to _ lock horns with
the young turks on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   It has experienced steady growth ever since, but there has been
a natural inclination to wonder how long the public would maintain
its enthusiasm for this fairly daring concept.
</P>
<P>
   It's a debate that swirls anew as the tour's finest come
wheezing into Los Angeles this week for the U.S. Senior Open, to be
played at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   Senior tour executives point to several indications that the
tour is in robust health, including rising purses (a sign of strong
sponsor involvement) and attendance. Most professional sports,
however, measure their popularity by television viewership, and the
news there has not been encouraging in recent years. TV ratings
plunged 20 percent in 1997, then flattened out this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, according to local organizers, the U.S. Senior Open,
despite being the most prestigious of the four major championships
on the senior tour, has proven to be a tough sell in Los Angeles,
both with the corporate high rollers and the common golf fans.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the tour wrestles with questions about its
identity. Should it be a showcase for legends of the game or a
competitive, wage-earning vehicle for a lot of over-50 golfers
you've never heard of?
</P>
<P>
   PGA commissioner Tim Finchem, who admitted he is asked about the
TV ratings ``just about every week,'' cited the strong showings in
other areas and maintained, ``The Senior Tour is going in the right
direction. (Its) best years are still ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one squinting hopefully toward the horizon.
Tour and TV executives point to a series of events that could
brighten the tour's future.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, Tom Watson turns 50 in September 1999; Finchem
says Watson has already committed to playing a full senior tour
schedule in 2000. Following closely behind Watson on the
eligibility parade will be Tom Kite and Lanny Wadkins, and then,
over the ensuing two years, Bruce Lietzke, Fuzzy Zoeller and '95
Masters champion Ben Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with Jack Nicklaus' stunning announcement that he didn't
feel spry enough to compete in this year's British Open, there is
hope that Nicklaus, who said he was pointing instead for this U.S.
Senior Open, can be coaxed into expanding his senior schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are cyclical, but you do get a bump once in a
while,'' Tim Crosby, PGA vice president of tournament business
affairs, said of the impending arrival of Watson, et al.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior tour has done very well by virtually every measure.
We're stronger than we've ever been, with the possible exception of
television, which last year took a little dip in the ratings. Our
tournaments are more stable and, quite frankly, financially
stronger than they've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   There is merit to the point. The tour will hand out $46.8
million in purse money this year, up 4{ percent from a year ago.
And although attendance at tournaments is not audited by the tour _
head-counting is left to local organizers _ it is said to be up.
Finchem said more than a dozen markets have sent out feelers of
interest in hosting a senior event, and that Dallas and Acapulco
will be added as tournament sites next year.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, why have a significant number of TV
viewers turned their noses up in recent years?
</P>
<P>
   Those monitoring the situation cite the ever-escalating
bombardment of choices for the viewer, a saturation of golf
programming on the tube and one undeniable magnet on other
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomena that was Tiger (Woods) last year I think kind of
overwhelmed the sport,'' said John Wildhack, vice president of
programming for ESPN, which carries the bulk of the senior tour
events (and will air the first two days of the Open). ``Because of
what he accomplished and the expectations, it may have, to some
degree, dwarfed the senior tour and the accomplishments of Hale
Irwin and the over-50 crowd that had a heck of a year....
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior tour seems to be in a period of stability right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics might call it stagnation. Woods is a compelling talent,
leading an assault of several popular young players on the PGA
Tour. The senior tour doesn't seem to have much to contend with it.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, a fan favorite who won nine major championships in the
'70s and '80s, could change that. More frequent sightings of
Nicklaus _ if he can overcome a chronic hip ailment _ most
certainly could. (The U.S. Senior Open will be only Nicklaus' sixth
_ but his last _ senior date this year.)
</P>
<P>
   The tour could certainly use a jolting infusion of star power,
at least in the eyes of some of the pioneers who once provided it.
Miller Barber recently bemoaned the fact that the legendary Arnold
Palmer, who still draws large galleries despite not having won a
Senior PGA event since '88, was given a 7 a.m. Sunday tee time at a
tournament in Pittsburgh (near his hometown of Latrobe, Pa.)
because of his poor play.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors such as Palmer, Chi Chi Rodriguez and Lee Trevino _
colorful souls who once commanded the marquee _ have been
overwhelmed by lesser-knowns who have seized the senior tour as a
meal ticket and intensified the competition accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing the two aspects, said the PGA's Crosby, ``is tricky.''
But he added, ``While it might be attractive to some to have an
event that is basically a traveling Hall of Fame or old-timers
game, golf fans still want to see the game played at its highest
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Said ESPN's Wildhack: ``I think it's a combination. Obviously,
you have players who are recognizable and performed very well on
the PGA Tour for upward of 25 years. There is appeal there because
there is familiarity with them and their accomplishments. You also
need to embrace and recognize the abilities of those who made the
senior tour a successful start of their playing career, guys like
Jim Albus and Tom Wargo. That should not be negated.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, TV will often devote as much air time to the Hall of Famer
well back in the pack as the whozits at the top of the leader
board.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Watson, Nicklaus and Crenshaw will ultimately enable the
senior tour to fuse the two concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago, when Tiger started hitting it big,''
said Crosby, ``it became clear that we don't have a monopoly on
charisma. There's no question that Tiger and young, colorful
players like (Phil) Mickelson, (David) Duval and Davis Love (III)
have been great for the PGA Tour. Perhaps, to a limited extent, it
has cannibalized some of the interest in the senior tour.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear the elder tour is eager to bite back. Once it finds
its teeth.

DREIFORT OK WITH BEING LIFTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pitchers usually have to be dragged out of a game
in chains when they have an opportunity to finish a shutout _ all
the more so when they're in position to register a one-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' Darren Dreifort, however, said Tuesday he had no
particular quarrel with being lifted for the ninth inning of his
impressive performance against Cincinnati on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a shot at one (a shutout), you want to go out
there and finish it yourself,'' said Dreifort, who worked eight
innings of one-hit ball in a 2-0 victory over the Reds. ``But we're
not in that position right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Dodgers, with four teams to jump over in the
National League wild-card race, aren't exactly operating on a broad
margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of the best way to win a ballgame,'' manager
Glenn Hoffman said of the decision to replace Dreifort with closer
Jeff Shaw for the ninth. ``No-hitter? Yeah, (Dreifort) stays out
there. But we had a healthy Shaw out there, loaded and ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dreifort) will get many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw underscored the wisdom of the call by striking out the side
on 12 pitches for his 26th save.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort nodded in assent. ``Especially where we are in the
season and the standings, you don't want to fool around and maybe
give away a big game,'' he said. ``They told me if we would have
scored two runs in the bottom of the eighth, I would have gone back
out there. But in a save situation, you've got to go to your
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to chance: Juan Castro got in some batting practice
Tuesday afternoon... twice.
</P>
<P>
   The infielder jumped into the cage in the broiling sun of
mid-afternoon, a time usually reserved for bench players. Then he
returned late in the afternoon for his regular session with the
other members of the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is known as a superlative defensive player _ he has done
some outstanding work at shortstop in the absence of the injured
Jose Vizcaino _ but he'd like to broaden that label some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a better hitter. I've been working a lot and I'm
going to keep working,'' said Castro. ``I'm not going to let it
go.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a lot of ground to make up. Castro is a career .190
hitter (.206 this year), despite having batted a cumulative .331
over his last two stays in Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Vizcaino, on the disabled list with a sprained right
ankle, hit from both sides of the plate, but the shortstop's work
in the field will determine his return to action. ``It's critical
for a middle infielder to have agility for both legs,'' said
Hoffman, who used to be one. Vizcaino is thought to be a week or so
away.... Second baseman Eric Young (strained right thigh) is
eligible to come off the disabled list Monday.

DUCKS HIRE HARTSBURG AS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB MIECH  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Unaffected by not being the Ducks' top coaching
choice, Craig Hartsburg accepted that post while hosting a poolside
barbecue on Monday afternoon at his Batchawany Bay summer home.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 miles north of the Michigan peninsula town of Sault
Ste. Marie, Hartsburg left his hideaway at 4:30 Tuesday morning for
a flight to Orange County through Toronto. He told wife Peggy to
tell all callers that he ``has gone fishing, at the Pond.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced as the Ducks' new coach late Tuesday afternoon at the
Pond, Hartsburg had hoped to take care of his first order of
business, talking with team captain Paul Kariya, by this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg was Chicago's coach last season when Gary Suter of the
Blackhawks belted Kariya with a cross check on Feb. 1. Hartsburg
vigorously defended Suter, and Kariya missed the final 28 games of
the season with postconcussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it wasn't intentional by Gary,'' Hartsburg said. ``I
know what type of player Gary is and what type of person he is....
It's a violent, tough game. It's unfortunate, the league and
Anaheim lost one of the best players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very bad for Paul, getting hurt. I was a player who had
to retire because of injuries, so I know what that's all about. To
me, it's over and done with now. I'll protect Paul as best as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducks general manager Jack Ferreira said Tuesday that he had
talked to Kariya about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said that (the injury and its aftermath) wouldn't faze
him one bit,'' Ferreira said. ``Craig Hartsburg didn't send Gary
Suter out to hit (Kariya).''
</P>
<P>
   It is the second move the Ducks made within a week to stabilize
the franchise, as former assistant general manager Pierre Gauthier
took over as president for the re-assigned Tony Tavares last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, 39, flew in Saturday for a second interview with
Ferreira, who held that title at Minnesota in 1989-90 when
Hartsburg was an assistant coach for the North Stars. He played for
the Stars from 1979-80 to '88-89, serving as team captain for his
final six seasons. Known as an attacking defenseman in the mold of
Ray Bourque, Hartsburg scored 98 goals. Injuries limited him to
only 27 and 30 games, respectively, in his last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Goring, an International Hockey League coach in Utah for
the last four seasons who coached the Boston Bruins for two seasons
in the mid-'80s, turned down an offer to coach the Ducks last
Wednesday. Goring reportedly felt he had been low-balled with a
take-it-or-leave-it annual salary of $400,000. Hartsburg signed a
three-year deal that is worth about $500,000 a year, which was what
Pierre Page earned last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks finished 26-43-13 last season, their worst record in
their five-year history. Page was fired on June 15, 10 months after
signing a three-year deal and 2{ weeks after assistants Don Hay and
Walt Kyle were canned.
</P>
<P>
   In that brief span, Ferreira realized the philosophical
differences between him and Page were too great to let them fester.
Ferreira said having a former NHL player in such a critical
position, background that Page did not possess, should be
invaluable to the Ducks. Ferreira intimated that Hartsburg's
background as an NHL coach is what enhanced his contract above the
offer made to Goring.
</P>
<P>
   In '95-96, Hartsburg took over an aging Chicago team and led it
to a 40-28-14 record. The Blackhawks swept the Calgary Flames in
the first round of the playoffs, then lost to the eventual Stanley
Cup-champion Colorado Avalanche. Chicago lost to Colorado in the
opening round the following season, and it missed the playoffs last
spring for the first time in 29 years. Soon after, Blackhawks
management fired Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Described by NHL followers as droll, dull and dry, Hartsburg
will focus on only one D-word with the Ducks _ defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win more battles than the other guys,'' he said.
``When you win more battles, you win more games. You have to play
with grit in this league to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, who declined to mention his assistant candidates,
said work ethic, discipline and a team-first attitude will
characterize the 1998-99 Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we'll be the best-conditioned team in the NHL,'' he said.
``Without that, those first three things don't mean anything. And
we will have enthusiasm. Everything will be done for the good of
the team. We'll play together, have fun together and win
together.''
</P>
<P>
   He said not being the Ducks' top choice was a ``moot point,''
that he is simply ecstatic to be a head coach in the NHL making
more money than he ever dreamed of earning as a player.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg said three years in Chicago taught him plenty about
himself, but he chose not to divulge his self-analysis. He said
he'll make some mistakes with the Ducks but that he'll learn from
them. Hopefully, he said, while winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a completely different situation than Chicago,''
Hartsburg said. ``Chicago was an older team that had only one
chance. (The Ducks) are a team that's young and will just get
better.''

EDITORIAL: A NEEDED, BUT RISKY, BAILOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 22:
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Russian economy is an unnerving prospect, so
it was prudent of the International Monetary Fund to release $4.8
billion from its new $11.2 billion Russian bailout package. But it
is far from clear that the Kremlin can carry out the reforms needed
to make the Russian economy more stable.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the fund has leaned on Boris Yeltsin
to deal with financial deformities. The Russian government has been
unable to come up with the money it needs to operate. That is
because the tax system is dysfunctional. Rates are inordinately
high, and few corporations or people bother to file tax returns.
The government has been forced to pay extraordinarily high interest
rates _ sometimes above 50 percent _ to borrow rubles, but it still
cannot meet its obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The government once again promised comprehensive changes in the
tax system. Much of its package was approved by Parliament, but
parts of it were defeated. That left the IMF with a tough choice:
Refuse to pay the money, and risk collapse, or give in on some of
the demands it made during negotiations for the bailout. It wisely
chose to trim the first payment by $800 million to send a message
that it was unhappy but still willing to provide needed money.
</P>
<P>
   President Yeltsin has imposed by decree some parts of the tax
package that did not win parliamentary approval. That is an
encouraging sign of his determination to make the needed changes,
but governance by decree is undemocratic and ultimately
self-defeating. It would be better if the Communist-dominated Duma
and Yeltsin could agree on a package that both secures the needed
money and has democratic legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also bought itself time by persuading investors to
exchange $4.4 billion in ruble-denominated treasury bills for new
dollar-denominated bonds that will not mature for as long as 20
years. That will save the country as much as $1 billion in interest
payments over the next year. But the risk is that the cost of the
dollar borrowing will soar if the government is eventually forced
to devalue the ruble. It may be a necessary gamble, but it is also
one that could backfire, particularly if the price of oil _
Russia's major export _ remains depressed.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is gambling in another way. With its latest commitment
to Russia, its own lending reserves are dangerously low if another
crisis develops suddenly. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, advised Congress on Tuesday that the need for
congressional action to provide the requested $18 billion in
additional IMF funding is critical. The House, which has delayed
too long, should promptly follow his advice.

EDITORIAL: GINGRICH'S KILLER AMENDMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 22:
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day it has become clearer that many moderate
Republicans are ready to defy Newt Gingrich and support the
Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill. That is why the speaker
is now accelerating his efforts to kill the legislation by trying
to lure Republicans into supporting amendments designed solely to
repel Democrats from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Today the House is scheduled to debate and vote on three such
``killer amendments'' designed by Gingrich and his agents to divide
the emerging bipartisan majority for cleaning up the system. We
urge lawmakers to stand firm, as they have in the past, and reject
those amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The target of two of the amendments is the National Voter
Registration Act, or motor voter law, which many Republicans have
hated ever since it was enacted in 1993. The law allowed for
mail-in registration and other steps that have expanded the number
of voters in poor and minority communities. One amendment would
repeal the mail-in registration requirement of the act and allow
states to drop voters from the rolls simply for not voting. Another
would allow states to require voters to produce photo
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans sincerely believe that the motor voter bill has
led to fraud. But they should realize that this concern has nothing
to do with the problem of curbing the influence of special-interest
money in elections. Should either of these amendments pass,
Democrats will defect from the Shays-Meehan bill, dooming its
chances. Another amendment that should be rejected would require
candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their funds within their
district. It is not intended to serve as reform, but to place a
particular burden on candidates in poor districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would end the practice of unrestricted
contributions of ``soft money'' by corporations, unions and
individuals to political parties. It would also limit fund-raising
for campaign ads by independent groups within two months of an
election. These are sensible steps that would prevent a repetition
of the worst abuses of the last election. A majority of House
members have successfully pushed aside other killer amendments
aimed at hurting labor unions. It may be difficult for some
moderate Republicans to vote against measures they believe in, but
to take Gingrich's bait will help him bury reform legislation that
the nation needs. &QL;

EDITORIAL: SO MUCH FOR ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 22`
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wondering why New York City is cursed with an abysmally
weak congressional delegation could find the answer this week in
Queens. Rep. Thomas Manton, the longtime incumbent from the Seventh
District, announced in the dark of night that he would not be
running for re-election. Before most of the active Democrats in the
district had even heard the news, Manton had engineered the
installation of a hand-picked successor in a method that appears to
guarantee a virtually uncontested election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Manton, who doubles as the Queens Democratic chairman, has been
a mediocre congressman at best, devoting most of his time to
district politics. His chosen successor, Assembly member Joseph
Crowley, has had an equally undistinguished career notable mainly
for party loyalty. The district is crammed with elected officials a
generation younger than Manton who would like to have had a shot at
the post, most of them far abler and more energetic than Crowley.
But the congressman waited until it was too late for any of them to
file for a primary challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The real losers, of course, are the voters in Queens, whom
Manton and Crowley have conspired to deprive of any real say in
choosing their member of Congress. Crowley, who might have had a
hard time winning a fair primary, has been forced down the
district's throat, and there is little the electorate can do about
it. The local Republican Party, which had a nonaggression pact with
Manton, refrained from nominating a serious candidate even though
the district might easily be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Congress, Manton will quickly be forgotten. But
back home he should be remembered as an emblem of the sickness that
permeates New York politics _ an attitude that elections are
unnecessary evils that get in the way of the serious business of
dispensing patronage.

EDITORIAL: THE NEW IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 22:
</P>
<P>
   New York City is the capital of the new global economy and also
America's traditional port of immigration. Put these together and
you get, as Deborah Sontag and Celia Dugger have vividly reported
in The Times this week, a new phenomenon of people living in two
homelands, old and new, virtually at once. Previous immigrants
remembered and even revisited their homelands. But this is the
first immigrant generation that can connect back home
instantaneously by cell phone, videophone and the Internet. Cheap
airfares and relaxed rules on dual citizenship also help many
people maintain lifelong relationships with their ancestral lands.
</P>
<P>
   One result is a changing New York City, which now counts an
all-time high of 2.7 million foreign-born residents. But the
consequences are also felt around the world as these immigrants
share their American experiences and American-earned dollars with
relatives and neighbors who stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   When Hamid Ali goes into a videophone parlor in the Kensington
section of Brooklyn, he can see as well as talk to his family back
home. But his calls also bring his sister in Pakistan into a more
intimate contact with America than she could ever get from
Hollywood movies and television. When Vinit Sethi goes back to
Jaipur, India, for his arranged marriage to Anshu Jain, he takes
his friends from the University of Pennsylvania along with him. It
is a meeting of two cultures in very personal terms.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of immigrant workers return each year from New York to
Chinantla, Mexico, for the annual fiesta of Padre Jesus. That
village has come to know New York, and appreciate its economic
opportunities, better than many Americans do. Chinantla owes its
economic survival to the $2 million a year sent back by its sons
and daughters who toil as waiters, garment workers and mechanics in
New York City. Some of these first-generation immigrants go back to
Chinantla to retire, assuring that their children, too, will make
regular trips back home.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast all this to a time when a ship voyage to New York took
several weeks, and even a steerage-class fare amounted to a
once-in-a-lifetime expense. Even for those who prospered, war or
persecution often barred the door back home. Now, Jesus Galvis can
serve on the Hackensack, N.J., City Council while running for a
Senate seat in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   New possibilities of global commuting are emerging and New York,
appropriately enough, stands at the center of a new transnational
immigrant culture.  &QL;

POWER MOVE: GREENE SURGES TO VICTORY IN THE 100 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ In the biggest 100-meter race of the season,
the world champion Maurice Greene defeated his training partner,
Ato Boldon, to win the Goodwill Games event in 9.96 seconds Tuesday
night. Considering that the race was run into a 2-mile-an-hour
headwind, it was one of the greatest 100 meters ever run.
</P>
<P>
   Boldon, of Trinidad, finished second in 10.00, while Donovan
Bailey of Canada, the 1996 Olympic champion and world record-holder
at 9.84 seconds, was seventh Tuesday night in 10.30 seconds.
Greene, who won the 1997 world championship in 9.86 seconds, and
Boldon, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist, train with coach John
Smith in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson continued his comeback from early season
hamstring injuries in the 400 meters with a time of 43.76 seconds,
the fastest time in the world this year before an appreciative
crowd of 9,756 at the Mitchel Athletic Complex. It is the first
time anyone has run under 44 seconds since April 1997, when Johnson
opened his season with a time of 43.75.
</P>
<P>
   Tyree Washington, who finished second Tuesday night in 44.43
seconds, made a move on Johnson in the backstretch and had pulled
slightly ahead entering the final turn. But Johnson has apparently
regained the endurance that he lacked earlier this season. He drew
ahead in the middle of the curve and hammered the final 150 meters
to win convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   This was the most dominant Johnson had been since he sustained a
leg injury in a 150-meter race against Bailey in June 1997. Over
the last month, he has finally overcome leg injuries caused by a
problem with the alignment of his hips and which led to repeated
interference with his training. Johnson became the only man ever to
win the 200 and 400 meters in the Summer Games in 1996 and has said
that only injuries have prevented him from regaining his Olympian
form. After Tuesday night, it would be perilous, even foolish, not
to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I needed was races after my injuries,'' Johnson said.
``I'm definitely on the road back to being as strong as I was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final heptathlon of a career that has produced two
Olympic gold medals in the event, Jackie Joyner-Kersee tied for
first place after three events but faded badly in the 200 meters to
fall into second place.
</P>
<P>
   Dedee Nathan of the United States won the 200 with a personal
best of 24.11 seconds and held the lead after the first day with
3,867 points, 34 ahead of Joyner-Kersee. Nathan ran the 100-meter
hurdles in 13.28, high-jumped 5-11\ and threw the shot put 47-5.
Joyner-Kersee ran 13.29 seconds in the 100-meter hurdles,
high-jumped 5-8} and threw the shot put 51-1} before fading in the
200 in 24.47 seconds. She will probably need a huge effort in her
specialty, the long jump, on Wednesday to have any chance of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, who is tenuously maintaining his
world record of 3:44.39 in the mile, won the event Tuesday night in
3:53.40, patiently waiting for three laps then drawing away with a
56.10-second final lap. However, the season's top performer, Hicham
el-Guerrouj of Morocco, did not compete.
</P>
<P>
   William Tanui of Kenya finished second in 3:54.05. Daniel Komen
of Kenya, the only person to run two miles under 8 minutes
(7:58.61), faded to third in 3:54.78. Steve Holman of the United
States went to the front early, but got tangled up and fell early
in the bell lap.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100 meters for disabled runners, Brian Frasure, who
trains in the same sprinting group with Marion Jones and coach
Trevor Graham in Raleigh, N.C., won in 11.44 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   With Greene, Boldon and Bailey, trash-talking in the open 100
meters has come to rival the bluster of professional wrestling.
Bailey has made thinly-veiled drug references to Greene and Boldon.
Greene has said that Bailey was using hamstring and tendon injuries
as an excuse to duck Greene and Bailey this season and to explain
away inevitable failure. The antagonism began in earnest at the
1997 world championships in Athens. Bailey entered as the 1995
world champion, the 1996 Olympic champion and the world
record-holder from the Atlanta Games. Greene had been a sprinter of
unfulfilled potential who moved last season from his home in Kansas
City, Kan., to train with Boldon and Coach Smith.
</P>
<P>
   By late summer of 1997, Smith had refined Greene's technique,
teaching him to use his speed more evenly and maintain it longer in
the 100 meters. In the past, Greene had often produced searing
starts only to run out of gas before the finish. Like a mechanic,
Smith took apart Greene's engine and put it back together again. He
won the 1997 national championship and arrived in Athens a month
later as a threat to Bailey's supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the semifinals at the world championships, Bailey looked
dismissively at Greene, asserting that he was over his nagging
injuries and said, ``I'm back.'' Greene replied, ``Yeah, but I
gotcha.'' And in the final he did, winning the world title with a
personal best of 9.86 seconds, tying the third-fastest time in
history. At 23, he had run as fast as Carl Lewis ever had. As he
crossed the finish line in Athens, Greene stuck his tongue out
scornfully at Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Greene set a world indoor record of 6.39 seconds
for 60 meters. In May, he ran the 100 meters in a 9.79 100 meters _
a half-second under Bailey's record and the same time that Ben
Johnson ran in his disgraced race at the 1988 Summer Olympics _ but
the wind was over the allowable limit for record purposes. A 9.84
race run last month at the national championships was also
wind-aided.
</P>
<P>
   Boldon began his sprinting career at Jamaica High in Queens, New
York City, when he was spotted on the soccer field by the track
coach, Joe Trupiano. He had moved from Trinidad to New York at age
14 with his mother. Boldon has credited his quick starts partly to
drills that Trupiano employed in the hallways at Jamaica High. One
of the drills required the sprinters to lay on the floor until they
heard Trupiano drop an eraser or a paper clip.

METS KEEP PIRATES FROM CROSSING HOME PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rick Reed provided one of his amazingly precise
pitching performances Tuesday night. So precise that the only
unanswered question was why Mets manager Bobby Valentine did not
leave him in to pitch the ninth inning and possibly record a
shutout. So precise that Reed's greatest concern after the 4-0
victory over Pittsburgh was how quickly he could pack for the
departure to Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of enjoyable night for the Jekyll-and-Hyde Mets
at Shea Stadium. The kind in which Todd Pratt replaced the injured
Mike Piazza at catcher and started the biggest inning the Mets have
fashioned in two weeks. The kind in which Todd Hundley looked a bit
more like himself at the plate and a bit more like a decent left
fielder on defense. The kind in which the Mets looked more like
wild-card contenders than pretenders, even if it was for one night.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Reed on the mound will do that. Spotting his fastball on
the inside corner and brushing the outside corner with breaking
balls and changeups, Reed confounded the Pirates for eight
determined innings. He throttled them on six hits while striking
out nine, including six who gazed at strike three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Reed is a real pro, and he has proven it to everyone who
has watched him,'' said Valentine, who used John Franco for the
ninth because Reed is pitching a day game in his next start and
because of the humid weather. ``We've had a couple of tough games
and he wanted to keep the rotation going.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Reed tamed the Pirates and because the Pirates put fancy
wrapping on New York's four-run third inning, the Mets finished a
disappointing homestand with a 5-7 record. Although the Mets tossed
three combined shutouts in the last five games _ contests started
by Reed, Hideo Nomo and Al Leiter _ it was not a rollicking 12-day
stay at Shea. But Reed (11-6) gave the Mets momentum as they hit
the road for seven games in five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got the four-run lead, it gave me some breathing
room,'' said Reed, who held the Pirates to 2 hits in 10 at-bats
with runners on. ``It makes a difference because you don't have to
be perfect. After we scored, I felt like a different pitcher.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Different from the pitcher who struggled in the first inning.
Tony Womack and Keith Osik singled to start the game, and Turner
Ward bunted them to third and second. Reed was in trouble, but he
rebounded to strike out Kevin Young and induce Jose Guillen to chop
a ball behind the mound.
</P>
<P>
   It was Pittsburgh's best chance, and even the modest Reed said:
``Getting out of that inning was huge. That was the ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt was not surprised that Reed survived the threat and gave
the Mets their first triumph over the Pirates in the last six
games. ``He has good concentration and he knows what he wants to
do,'' Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, who started because Piazza has a stiff right elbow, had a
double off Jason Schmidt (8-7) to start the third, the same Schmidt
who has not won in his last nine starts. Rey Ordonez pushed a nifty
bunt to second for a single that advanced Pratt to third, from
where he scored when Reed's dribbler slithered past Womack's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Edgardo Alfonzo rapped a two-run double down
the third-base line for a 3-0 lead, and Hundley later launched a
double to the left-center warning track to make it 4-0. Hundley
also had an assist from left field when he threw behind Lou Collier
and caught him straying too far off third base after Womack's
double in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roberto Clemente,'' Hundley said, joking. ``That's me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets still had runners on second and third after Hundley's
double and were hoping to enrich the most productive inning of
their homestand when the baseball show turned into a sideshow.
After the plate umpire, Bob Davidson, called Huskey out on a 3-2
fastball, Huskey jumped in front of the plate in protest and walked
away.
</P>
<P>
   Once Huskey returned to the dugout, Davidson heard a voice shout
at him, and he instantly ejected the Mets right fielder. Both
Huskey and Valentine streaked toward Davidson, with Huskey pointing
his finger in the umpire's face and hollering at him. Why were they
so perturbed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say anything,'' Huskey said. ``Someone said something
from the bench. It wasn't me.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he told Davidson that Huskey was innocent and
conceded that he had been the one barking from the dugout. Asked
what he had screeched, Valentine said, ``Damn.''
</P>
<P>
   There was laughter. Tuesday night, Reed's snazzy pitching
enabled the Mets to laugh.

CHEMICALS SUSPECTED IN DC-10 FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Transportation Safety Board said
Tuesday that it suspected the cause of an in-flight fire on a
Federal Express DC-10 in September 1996 was improperly shipped
hazardous material, volatile chemicals in a piece of biomedical
equipment. But Tuesday's final report on the incident stopped short
of identifying those chemicals as the definitive cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The five people on the Memphis-to-Boston flight escaped injury,
but the DC-10 and most of its cargo was destroyed in the fire,
which burned for four hours after the plane made an emergency
landing at Stewart Airport in Newburgh, N.Y. No one on the ground
was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The board also said that the accident showed that the Federal
Aviation Administration and the airline industry had not done
enough to minimize the risk posed by in-flight fires, even after a
crash that killed 110 people aboard a Valujet passenger plane in
the Everglades. That crash, caused by hazardous materials that were
packed improperly, occurred four months before the DC-10 caught
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the plane was mechanically sound, and that
the fire was started by cargo, but not cargo declared as hazardous
by the shipper. The plane was carrying cargo that was declared as
hazardous, but it was later found in containers that were intact.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect that the fire began in a DNA synthesizer,
used in the pharmaceutical industry. The synthesizer, built by
Chiron Corp., of Emeryville, Calif., had two highly volatile
chemicals in it.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that a review of the cockpit voice recorder
after the Federal Express fire showed that the crew had not put on
smoke goggles or oxygen masks, which experts say are crucial to
safety if a fire spreads quickly. Pilots say the gear is difficult
to put on, uncomfortable and severely restricts their vision.
</P>
<P>
   George Black, one of the five members of the safety board, said
that the incident showed the need for better training and equipment
that crews would be willing to wear. ``We're running the chance
that a crew that's already in trouble, with a fire and smoke on
board, not having adequate vision to properly land the airplane, if
they make it that far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA promised in November to immediately act on that issue,
but has not. In August 1997, 15 months after the Valujet crash near
Miami International Airport, the safety board recommended that the
FAA stress to pilots the importance of putting on goggles and
breathing equipment at the first indication of smoke or fire. Smoke
can fill a cockpit so suddenly, safety board experts say, that a
pilot who waits until smoke appears may be overpowered before
equipment can be put on.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA spokesman, Les Dorr, said that the agency was working on
a bulletin to make that point to pilots. The agency originally said
that it would issue the bulletin in November, but then decided to
check the condition and use of cockpit smoke goggles and masks
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact it does not appear that the industry is doing things
exactly the way they should,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, the chairman of the safety board, complained Tuesday
that the FAA had failed to inform the board when it decided not to
issue the bulletin in November, as it had promised.

Rockies' Brownson tosses 4-hitter
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Two hours, 10 minutes, no runs.
</P>
<P>
   That is pretty much all you need to know about what happened at
the Astrodome on Tuesday night. The Astros sped out of town ahead
of schedule but behind on the scoreboard thanks to Colorado Rockies
pitcher Mark Brownson, who tossed a four-hit shutout in his
major-league debut.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-0 loss snapped the Astros' four-game winning streak and
was their shortest game of the season. The Astros departed for a
five-game road trip to Los Angeles and San Diego after Tuesday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to get beat, you don't want to get beat
slowly,'' Astros center fielder Carl Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownson took care of that, making short work of the Astros
before a crowd of 28,718. The young righthander took a no-hitter
into the sixth inning and needed only 100 pitches to tag the Astros
with their third shutout loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we face a guy we haven't seen before, we don't seem
to fare too well,'' Astros catcher Brad Ausmus said. ``We were a
little flat, which compounded his mastery. He did well, and we
weren't good; that combination leads to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Zero also is the number of wins Astros pitcher Mike Hampton has
in his past five starts. If afforded a mulligan for the first
inning, Hampton was every bit as good as Brownson. Unfortunately
for Hampton, one bad inning was all it took to kill any hope of his
first victory since June 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies banged Hampton around for four runs in the first
inning, which was more than enough support for Brownson, who came
within one out of matching the Rockies' record for hitless innings
at the start of a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play in the Kerry Wood game (the Astros struck out 20
times and managed just one hit), but I think this was the best game
pitched against us all year,'' Everett said. ``You have to give
(Brownson) his due.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood helped the Chicago Cubs blank Atlanta 3-0 on Tuesday night.
The second-place Cubs moved to within four games of the Astros in
the National League Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   His sterling debut notwithstanding, there was nothing in
Brownson's Class AAA statistics that suggested he was capable of
stifling a team with as many offensive weapons as the Astros.
Brownson was 6-8 with a 5.13 ERA in 20 starts for the Rockies'
top-level minor-league club at Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a guy come up from the minor leagues and pitch
like that in his first game,'' Rockies manager Don Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownson had almost flawless command of a fastball, curveball,
changeup and slider, but Everett believes his best weapon might
have been his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he didn't have that deceiving motion, he'd be in trouble,''
Everett said. ``That really helps him. You could see his pitches,
but he had fastball arm speed on a changeup, and we were swinging
at his motion instead of swinging at the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, who snapped a six-game losing streak, didn't have
any problem solving Hampton in the first inning. Shortstop Neifi
Perez's seventh homer of the season opened the scoring, and his
buddies just kept piling it on. Vinny Castilla's RBI single, Todd
Helton's sacrifice fly and Mike Lansing's RBI double gave the
Rockies an early 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brownson retired 14 of the first 17 batters he faced
and kept the Astros off-balance by precisely locating his fastball
and by changing speeds masterfully. The 23-year-old rookie often
managed a 30-mph differential between his fastball and his breaking
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched well, and we didn't swing the bats particularly
well,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``He just beat us.
It was as plain and simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton spoiled the no-hit bid with a leadoff double to left in
the sixth inning. The pitcher was wiped out on the bases attempting
to move from second to third on Biggio's bunt single down the
third-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Brownson sat down the Astros in order in the seventh and worked
around Ricky Gutierrez's leadoff double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even think about (a no-hitter),'' Brownson said. ``I
noticed it in the fifth, but I was trying to be realistic. I never
thought I was going to no-hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton retired 19 of the 24 batters he faced after the first
inning and didn't allow another runner to advance beyond second
base with the exception of Castilla, who led off the sixth with a
home run. Rookie lefthander Trever Miller pitched a scoreless ninth
in relief of Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamp was aiming the ball early in the game,'' Ausmus said.
``He was trying to be too fine. He flip-flopped and got back to the
old Mike Hampton, though. The second half of the game was
definitely the Mike Hampton we know.''
</P>
<P>
   The spacious comfort of the Astrodome helped Brownson preserve
his shutout in the bottom of the ninth. Jeff Bagwell hit a towering
fly ball to the center-field wall, but Ellis Burks was there to
make the grab and secure the youngster's gem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you're facing someone who is just up from
Triple-A, you can jump on him right away,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said. ``That obviously wasn't the case tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't take long for it to become obvious.

CONE AND JETER MAKE SHORT WORK OF TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the night after, David Cone restored some
semblance of sanity to Yankee Stadium. The New York Yankees and the
Detroit Tigers did not play 26 innings, or even 17. They did not
take 5 hours 50 minutes to play the game that the Yankees won
Tuesdy night, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, with a little help from his friends, tucked the Tigers
away in a relatively crisp 2 hours 46 minutes, providing the
perfect antidote to the exhaustion that overtook the players the
night before.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to mount a strong case for his first full-season Cy
Young award, Pedro Martinez notwithstanding, Cone stymied the
Tigers on eight hits, allowed no earned runs, walked only one and
struck out 10 in eight innings. The game marked the 10th time in
his last 11 starts that Cone, who won the Cy Young in the
strike-shortened 1994 season, has permitted fewer than three earned
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers scored against Cone in the first inning, but they did
it with the aid of an error by Scott Brosius, who let Tony Clark's
bouncer get through him with runners at first and third. The Tigers
scored no more.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, on the other hand, staged a varied offensive as the
first two hitters in their lineup produced three runs with bats and
legs. Derek Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch each hit a home run in the
same game for the second time this season, and Jeter used a walk
and two stolen bases to put himself in position to score on a
sacrifice fly by Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to go extra innings,'' a weary Jeter had said
before the game, and he took steps to make sure the game ended in
the regulation nine.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Yankees' 70th of this magical season, the
first time in the franchise's glorious history that the team has
won 70 of the first 95 games. With 67 games remaining, the Yankees
need to win 47 to register the most victories in a major league
season.
</P>
<P>
   A 47-20 record computes to a .701 percentage. The Yankees' 70-25
season record produces a .737 percentage.
</P>
<P>
   In gaining his 14th victory, most in the majors, against three
defeats, Cone has an .824 winning percentage. His 3.44 earned run
average is misleading because he gave up 16 earned runs in his
first two starts. Subtract those spring training-like performances,
and Cone has a nifty 2.51 ERA, a figure that more accurately
reflects the impressive pitching that the 35-year-old right-hander
has provided this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' master did his best pitching Tuesday night in the
first and seventh innings.
</P>
<P>
   After the first-inning error by Brosius left runners at first
and third with one out, Cone struck out Luis Gonzalez and retired
Geronimo Berroa, always a dangerous Yankee Stadium hitter, on an
infield popup.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bako, who at that point had caught 28 consecutive innings
over two nights and three games, led off the seventh with a single
to center field, the third of his four hits. Deivi Cruz, the ninth
batter in the Detroit lineup, then struck out. So did Brian Hunter,
who extended his series futility to no hits in 18 at-bats over two
nights and three games.
</P>
<P>
   But Damion Easley rapped a grounder past a diving Brosius for a
double that sent Bako to third. Bobby Higginson, whose two-run home
run made Monday night's second game closer than the Yankees liked,
was the next batter, but Cone did not let him repeat his effort. He
threw a third strike past him, and the threat, that quickly, was
ended.

   NEW YORK _ A roomful of Rothschilds is as rare as a bottle of
their 1945 Chateau Mouton (the first year a painting appeared on
the label). But there they were, at the Plaza Hotel: Sir Evelyn De
Rothschild and Lionel De Rothschild from London, Baron David De
Rothschild and Baron Eric De Rothschild from Paris, and Robert De
Rothschild of New York.
</P>
<P>
   They had gathered to toast A. Stanley Gluck, who has handled
personal investments for several generations of the English and
French branches of the legendary banking dynasty over the last 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen them all,'' said Gluck, who has done everything from
manage their money to transport their paintings in armored trucks,
``but to be in one room at the same time is a little bit unusual.
They sometimes go to weddings.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes they wonder just how old Gluck is. ``Baron David
used to ask me when I'd turn 65,'' he said. ``I always told him I'd
let him know. Now he has figured out I was only 10 years younger
than his father.'' That makes Gluck 79.
</P>
<P>
   Walk, Don't Run
</P>
<P>
   The fastest woman on earth went 0 miles an hour for a long time
Tuesday. Marion Jones, who ran 200 meters in 21.80 seconds on
Monday at the Goodwill Games, was trapped in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to get 15 blocks down the street,'' said Ms.
Jones, a North Carolinian who was not sure just where the jam had
been. ``It took an hour and a half. It was a chauffeured car.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it have been quicker to get out and run? ``No,'' she
said, ``it was hot out there, and I run short and fast, not long
and far.''
</P>
<P>
   A Rod and a Drum
</P>
<P>
   The financier Ronald Perelman was definitely not drumming up
business. Called to the stage by Rod Stewart during a concert at
Southampton College in Long Island, N.Y., Perelman sat in as the
drummer for the finale, ``We're Havin' a Party.'' This was after
Stewart sweated through his repertory, including ``Do Ya Think I'm
Sexy?''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had been introduced by Robert F.X. Sillerman, the
college's $1-a-year chancellor, whose deep-pocketed SFX
Entertainment has become a sprawling music-promotion conglomerate.
Among the 5,000 people sprawled on a campus lawn were Stewart's
wife, Rachel Hunter, and Kelsey Grammer, star of the sitcom
``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   A New Leaf
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad put together the whole deal,'' Cristina Greeven said of
Manhattan File, the magazine Rainer Greeven bought with help from
some investors and which she resurrected with a party at Lot 61, a
restaurant on West 21st Street.
</P>
<P>
   Greeven _ who Ms. Greeven said had spent $2 million to $3
million buying the magazine _ was summering in Portugal. She was
left to celebrate the occasion with her very social crowd,
including Alexandra and Alexander Von Furstenberg and the filmmaker
Whit Stillman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greeven _ the editor of Manhattan File since 1994 _ said she
had not had control over what was published until her father made
her an owner. She said the seller was News Communications, a
company controlled by Wilbur Ross Jr., the husband of Lt. Gov.
Betsy McCaughey Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing all this society stuff,'' Ms. Greeven, 28, said
of the old Manhattan File. ``It wasn't me.'' She wants to make
Manhattan File ``a younger Vanity Fair,'' with more coverage of
celebrities and fashion.

DODGERS BEAT REDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
NOTE: THIS VERSION WILL STAND 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
Or the big tease?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next couple of weeks could determine the Dodgers' intention.
And their direction. But they are beginning to bear watching.
</P>
<P>
   In beating the Cincinnati Reds 4-2 on Tuesday night before
30,452 fans at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers won for the sixth time
in their last nine games and crept _ with colossal exertion _ to
two games above .500 (51-49) for the first time since mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   The effort had a familiar look: a strong performance by a
starting pitcher, in this case Ismael Valdes, some gritty work by
the relief staff, and just enough output from the usual offensive
suspects, Gary Sheffield, Eric Karros, Adrian Beltre and Raul
Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   It has put the Dodgers in the thick of the National League
wild-card race, and undoubtedly has interim general manager Tommy
Lasorda squirming over whatever move he might want to make next.
</P>
<P>
   This probably can't qualify as a surge _ not for a team that has
locked on .500 a total of 24 times this year. But it's a glimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to get anything, we need some kind of consistency
to get a streak going,'' said manager Glenn Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next couple of weeks, the Dodgers could be put to the
test in that regard. In a 12-game stretch, nine of the meetings
will be divided among a division leader (Houston, beginning tonight
at Dodger Stadium) and two of the teams that lie ahead of L.A. in
the wild-card standings (Philadelphia and New York). The latter two
series will be played on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's game was the type that tends to boost a team's
confidence, because it didn't come without considerable effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, leading 4-1 to start the seventh inning, quickly
faced a bases-loaded, one-out situation after Valdes faltered and
Sheffield and Mondesi crossed signals under a fly ball in
right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Radinsky got one critical out when he retired the
dangerous Reggie Sanders, a pinch hitter, on a pop to second.
Radinsky, after starting out 3-and-0 to the next man, pinch hitter
Barry Larkin, yielded a walk to force in a run. But the Dodgers
survived disaster when Dmitri Young lined to Karros at first base
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was 4-2, and since the Dodgers now have Jeff Shaw in
their bullpen, that meant they had a realistic chance of holding
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jeff closing the door, he's a closer who can do the
job,'' said Valdes, who improved to 8-9. ``He throws strikes. He
knows what to do out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's giving the Dodgers a luxury they haven't enjoyed in
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, acquired from the Reds for Paul Konerko and Dennis Reyes
on July 4, turned away his former team for the second straight
night. Hoffman called on him early, in the eighth inning, with a
man on, two out and ... Konerko at the plate?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Yet another bizarre sight in this Twilight Zone season for
the Dodgers. Shaw got a fielder's choice grounder in that
confrontation, ending the inning, then went 1-2-3 in the ninth for
his 27th save _ and his fourth in as many opportunities since
joining the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told (Hoffman) a lot of work is not unusual for me, the
eighth inning is not unusual for me,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The way he's pitched lately, he should make sure he keeps his
arm limber. Shaw has retired 22 of the 24 batters he's faced, seven
by strikeout, since arriving here.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, meanwhile, continued a solid stretch of work that began
six weeks ago and has included two complete-game shutouts. He
worked 61/3 innings on five hits and two runs, striking out six _
two of them on called third strikes to end innings with a runner in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does well when he locates his fastball because he has very
good offspeed stuff,'' said catcher Charles Johnson. ``When he can
throw his fastball in and out (corners of the plate) he's tough,
because he can get people out with his breaking ball. You can't
just sit on one pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, by contrast, sat on a few from Reds starter Brett
Tomko (9-7) in the early innings _ and squashed them.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Beltre hit the second home run of his
major-league career, a bomb to center to drive in Karros, who had
singled.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Sheffield, with a single, and Karros, with a
double the other way, each drove in a run.
</P>

   That was it for the Dodgers attack. Valdes welcomed the four
runs, though _ it was more output than the Dodgers had provided in
12 of his previous 20 starts this season. &UR; !end! &LR;

BULKED-UP SHIVER EYES REDEMPTION COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>

By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys center Clay Shiver admits
he was in a little over his head last season.
</P>
<P>
   And a little underweight.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his first as a starter, the former Florida State
standout absorbed much of the blame for the Cowboys' offensive line
problems. Playing at 265 pounds _ light for the average NFL center
_ left Shiver ineffective in run-blocking. And his inexperience
left him ineffective protecting quarterback Troy Aikman from the
pass rush up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Shiver accepts the criticism, however. He knows he's not the
same player he was last season. He doesn't even look the same. In
the off-season, he bulked up with 15 pounds of muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the new guy, I made some mistakes a veteran wouldn't
have made,'' Shiver said of last season. ``There were a few times I
had some breakdowns. But with the record we had, everybody had
their share of mistakes. That's something we are all going to have
to bounce back from, including myself. I've gotten quite a bit
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Shiver, a third-year veteran, said ``having 16 games of
experience'' helps his confidence coming into this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was almost like my rookie year,'' Shiver said. ``I
had six snaps my rookie year, so it was nonexistent. With a whole
year of snaps, it'll be a different year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey says Shiver's biggest problem last
season was size and strength. His lack of physical power hampered
the Cowboys running game. Gailey said he's satisfied with Shiver's
off-season conditioning work and is confident his play will
improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We evaluated him real closely in the off-season,'' Gailey
said. ``We talked about him being more physical. He started fairly
heavy last year, but as season wore on, he lost weight. We talked
about him maintaining weight and strength. He has gotten a lot
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Shiver likely will never be as big as Gailey would
prefer _ he likes the 340-pound lineman _ Gailey said the Cowboys
were going to take advantage of Shiver's small size and use him in
unique ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of potential,'' Gailey said. ``Because of his
size, he gives us the ability to do some things that other teams
don't have. We can pull and get to the corners. A lot of teams
don't pull their centers.''
</P>
<P>
   Also affecting Shiver's performance was the litany of injuries
along the Cowboys offensive line last season, causing constant
upheaval in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the toughest things that was really a struggle for us
and what was overlooked was that we had injuries,'' Shiver said.
``People were in and out of the lineup. That caused us to
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the line rotation affected Shiver more than anyone.
``Communication and continuity on the offensive line is vital,''
Gailey said. ``When you lose that unit philosophy it takes its
toll. It hits the guy with the least experience the hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to Gailey's implementation of the shot-gun
formation, Shiver feels like a veteran these days. While his
teammates struggle to learn the nuances of the shot gun, Shiver is
drawing on his college experience at Florida State where he snapped
the ball to Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really comforting to know we got a guy that's done it
before,'' Gailey said. ``He did almost every snap there for a while
at Florida State.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiver said the shot-gun experience gives him a chance to prove
other aspects of his game like ``directing people and making the
right calls.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Guard Nate Newton doesn't want to talk
about his weight, or lack thereof, but at least he's talking.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old veteran ended his vow of silence with reporters
Tuesday after morning workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to talk about weight, I am not going to talk to
you. If you want to talk about me advancing and being a part of
this team, or you want to talk about the offensive line, I'll talk
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, listed on the training camp roster at 320 pounds,
accepted part of the blame for last season's offensive line woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was injured the whole year and never got in top shape, so I
put a lot of that on me,'' he said. ``I put like 60 percent on me.
... I am a Pro Bowl player and last year I came out and I was an
average player. I let everybody down, but most of all I let myself
down.''
</P>
<P>
   He said last season's disappointment motivated him to get back
to the form that earned him All Pro recognition from 1992-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I had to do to get back here,'' he said. ``Whether
it was me losing weight, or keeping my mouth closed or not going
out and having a good time or whatever, I'm here.'' ELLIS SITS OUT
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft choice Greg Ellis didn't participate in
practice Tuesday after experiencing back spasms, Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey said. He is listed as day-to-day. Gailey said Ellis, a
6-foot-6 defensive end, has no history of back problems. FIRST
WORKOUT THRILLS TEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   Safety George Teague participated in his first full practices of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenalin was flowing all last night, up until today,''
Teague said. ``It feels extremely good just to able to get back and
run around full time.''
</P>
<P>
   Teague's activities were limited to stretching and conditioning
last week while he recuperated from arthroscopic knee surgery last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any problems with my knee,'' he said. ``It
hasn't flared up. It didn't hurt or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Teague long to get in his first solid hit. He
gave Billy Davis a hard shot after Davis had caught a pass over the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   In his second stint with the Cowboys, Teague is among four
players trying to fill the free safety position vacated by Brock
Marion, who signed as a free agent with Miami. Teague's competition
includes second-year players Kenny Wheaton and Omar Stoutmire and
third-year player Charlie Williams. SHOTGUN LOADED
</P>
<P>
   Gailey expressed disappointment last week with how the offense
picked up from where it left off at the last minicamp in the first
week in June, saying he thought players looked rusty.
</P>
<P>
   He was much happier with how the players looked Tuesday when
they began practicing the shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked back up on the shotgun better than we did the base
offense,'' Gailey said. ``I guess the overall timing, having thrown
the ball around for three or four practices, enhanced our picking
back up on the shotgun.''
</P>
<P>
   The shotgun, absent from the Cowboys' playbook most of this
decade, will be used in third-and-long and two-minute situations.
HE SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmitt is the starter and I'm just here to complement him on
offense in any way I can, whether it's 10 carries \Rper game\S or
30, or maybe catching a pass out of the backfield. I'm comfortable
with that.'' _ Chris Warren,

M'S TORRID JULY CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Just in case the citizens of Florida's
Suncoast hadn't already heard it, Ken Griffey Jr. spent a good deal
of his pre-game clubhouse media session Tuesday night disavowing
any interest in home run races. Particularly those with his name in
them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a game matching teams moving in opposite directions, he
went out and stirred some more home run conversation, splattering
his 40th to center field as the Mariners kept a good July going
with an 8-3 victory over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about (Mark) McGwire,'' Griffey said. ``I don't
worry about Sammy (Sosa). I worry about the guy that's 60 feet in
front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw, he never thinks about it,'' Jay Buhner ribbed loudly, a
couple of locker stalls away, after the M's had registered their
seventh victory in eight games. ```What do I need, 21 more?'''
</P>
<P>
   Before this night, Griffey had exactly five hits in 30 career
at-bats against lefthander Wilson Alvarez. He had three more in his
only tries against Alvarez, whose forgettable season Griffey and
the M's made a little more unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez (4-8), who hasn't won since May 15 and who lost seven
weeks to shoulder tendinitis, was tagged for three doubles in a
four-run Mariner first, and later, homers by Griffey and Russ
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's 40th came 27 days earlier than his 40th of 1997, which
he struck on Aug. 17. In a season when he hit 56, he had 24 after
Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the M's perking with a 12-5 record this month,
and, even at 9{ games behind Texas, sustained the notion that their
season may not yet be kaput.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have very easily rolled over a month ago, two months
ago, and said the season's over,'' said Jamie Moyer, who went eight
innings and evened his record at 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't accomplished anything yet, but it could be fun.
It's going to be fun trying to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight brings a confrontation notable on two counts: It is a
fetching matchup of Randy Johnson against the Rays' All-Star,
righthander Rolando Arrojo, whose 11 victories and 2.87 ERA lead
all American League rookies.
</P>
<P>
   In this same stadium late in May, when reports had him all but
dealt to the Dodgers, Johnson was widely believed to be making his
last start as a Mariner. Two months later, he could be doing that
again, although the club's resurgence weighs against it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would accept the kind of run support Moyer got from the
M's Tuesday night. The first pitch Alvarez threw was kissed for a
double into the right-field corner by second baseman Rich Amaral,
and the last one Alvarez launched was hit for a double to almost
the same spot by catcher John Marzano.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the M's had all seven of their runs, and although Moyer
wasn't razor-sharp _ allowing homers by Bubba Trammell and Bobby
Smith _ he didn't have to be. The expansion Rays are hitters only
in a loose sense _ they have been shut out a shocking 13 times, and
upon entering the game with 345 runs, they trailed the next-worst
AL run-producing team, Kansas City, by 69.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mariners, there was very little to quibble about. For
one, Davis, playing his third game in left field, had a two-run
double to go with his homer, and he caught a fly ball in left. He
had had two other chances in left field in his earlier appearances,
and erred on both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russ has been swinging the bat real well,'' Mariner manager
Lou Piniella said. ``And he got himself a fielding average, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's, so often leaky in the field, were almost superlative in
this game. Alex Rodriguez first made a pretty play on a difficult
chopper and then ran down a blooper in short left. And David Segui
denied Fred McGriff with a lunging, backhand stab of a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are rallies that aren't getting started,'' Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only sour note was the flareup of Buhner's left
knee, necessitating his removal from the game in the second inning.
Piniella said he probably will be rested tonight, to welcome the
grass in Baltimore after another off-day.
</P>
<P>
   A media contingent of 15-20 left Piniella to crowd around
Griffey, getting little but trying, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's lot of home runs,'' Piniella mused, pondering Griffey's
40, which still trails McGwire's 43. ``My God, we're only in July.
It's scary.''

RANGERS, GONZALEZ `DEEP SIX' ROYALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Texas Rangers do not rely on the home
run.
</P>
<P>
   This lineup achieved success using the two elements manager
Johnny Oates deems most critical for offensive prosperity: on-base
percentage and hitting with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's 15-5 victory against the Kansas City Royals
served as an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman Stadium served as a launching pad on this warm, muggy
evening, and the Rangers discharged six home runs measuring 2,393
feet _ the length of more than 61/2 football fields.
</P>
<P>
   That made little impression upon Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go around hitting six home runs every night,'' Oates
said. ``Now, I like the runs. I'll take the runs. It was nice to
put the big number up there in the first inning, but you know I'm
not an advocate of the home run. I'm an advocate of the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve Rangers runs crossed the plate as a result of a home run.
Designated hitter Juan Gonzalez, who had three of the Rangers' 17
hits, drove in five runs with two 400-foot blasts and a run-scoring
single.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, perhaps right fielder Mike Simms _ a platoon player who
starts against left-handed pitchers _ supplied the evening's most
significant at-bat with his three-run home run in the first inning
off Royals left-hander Jose Rosado (4-8).
</P>
<P>
   Simms extended the inning with a 414-foot home run with two
outs, and a three-run home run later in the inning by center
fielder Roberto Kelly gave the Rangers an nine-run advantage before
the Royals' first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Simms continues to be extraordinarily productive in his role.
The home run gives Simms 26 RBI through 94 at-bats this season.
That represents an RBI per 3.6 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's me,'' said Simms, who matched his
single-season best with his ninth home run. ``I think that's a
credit to the guys hitting in front of me and getting on base. I
can't take any credit for that. A player can't get any RBI if no
one is on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies their secret.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers built the American League's most prolific offense
with their on-base percentage and ability to hit with runners in
scoring position. The Rangers entered Tuesday night's games leading
the league in hitting with runners in scoring position (.307) and
ranked second in on-base percentage (.355).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the two most prolific offensive teams in this league _
the Rangers and Yankees _ entered Tuesday night's games ranked
seventh and 10th, respectively, in home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the six home runs represented the second-most
during a single game by the Rangers, who launched seven against the
Twins on Sept. 13, 1986, at the Metrodome. Gonzalez's performance
gave him six home runs and 22 RBI during seven games this season
against the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps lost in this slugfest was Rick Helling's complete-game
victory. The right-hander's effort represented the Rangers' first
complete game since May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (13-5) surrendered five runs (four earned) on seven
hits, including two home runs, but he did not issue a walk. Helling
threw 102 fastballs in his 126-pitch appearance for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hot out there,'' Helling said of the 95-degree heat.
``All I wanted to do was get our team off the field and into the
dugout as quickly as possible. I basically said, `Here it is. Hit
it if you can.'''
</P>
<P>
   It resulted in some well-hit balls, but Helling produced the
desired result.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what he was supposed to do,'' Oates said. ``He got a
big lead, and he threw strikes. They hit a bunch of balls on the
nose right at our outfielders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers sent six unplayable balls over the heads of Royals
outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   That mattered little to Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you how many hits we had,'' Oates said. ``I had to
guess at the number of home runs we hit.''

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ The biggest joke going around the Seahawks'
training camp involves one of the team's largest players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been kidding House that they're going to have to
announce the defense before every game this year because he can't
run out of the tunnel,'' Grant Williams, a third-year tackle, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So much for respecting your elders.
</P>
<P>
   Howard ``House'' Ballard will be 35 in November, midway through
his 11th and probably final NFL season. His arthritic right knee is
a constant reminder of just how much he loves this game and will
miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Why else would Ballard continue to play?
</P>
<P>
   One of the most lasting memories of the past few seasons is the
6-foot-6, 330-pound Ballard down on all fours and looking as if he
will need to be dragged from the field while his teammates jog back
to the huddle. Somehow, some way, Ballard struggles to his feet,
limps to the line of scrimmage and makes a key block on the key
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``House has a very high pain tolerance,'' said Gregg Smith, who
coaches the offensive line. ``He cannot look very good running
around, but when it's time to do it, he's going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure Ballard will be around to get it done, he sees
limited action in the afternoon on days when the team practices
twice. Ballard also won't play a lot in preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's healthy and can play, he's one of the best tackles
there is,'' Williams said. ``No players have ever given him
problems. The only thing that's ever slowed him down is his own
body.''
</P>
<P>
   And only recently. Until late last year, Ballard had played 154
consecutive games, starting 138 _ third longest among active
players behind the Oilers' Bruce Matthews (160) and the Steelers'
Dermontti Dawson (143). And then it was a fractured right forearm
that forced Ballard to sit out the final six games.
</P>
<P>
   But Ballard's knee has been bothering him the past few years _ a
memento of playing on four straight Super Bowl teams with the
Buffalo Bills (1990-93) and his entire career with clubs that play
on artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Seahawks sent Ballard back to Seattle during
training camp to have a magnetic resonance imaging test on the
knee. Ballard was hoping it would detect torn cartilage or
something else that could be removed to relieve the pain. Instead,
he was told if he continued to play it would be in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we just have to deal with,'' Ballard said.
``God is looking out for me, and we have been put in a situation
where the right play has been called at the right time. Some times
when we're really hurting really bad, the right play needs to be
called so we can recover for a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard is well aware of the long-term consequences of what he
is doing. He knows at some point he'll probably need an artificial
knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes down to that, there's nothing we can do to change
it,'' he said. ``We'd rather have that than the feeling that we
left the game when we could have played one more year.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something else you should know about Ballard. Some
athletes speak in the third person. He speaks in the plural. When
he says ``we'' he means ``me.'' Hey, when you're that big and go by
the nickname ``House,'' you deserve to be a ``we.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Ballard's fifth season with the Seahawks, who signed him
as a free agent in 1994. But he's the anchor on a line that has
been in constant flux. Kevin Glover, who was signed in free agency
this year, is the team's fourth starting center in Ballard's
tenure. He has played alongside three different starters each at
left tackle, left guard and right guard.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard also is the leader of this group. He presides over the
locker room court that doles out fines to the linemen for various
offenses, and Ballard's word is final.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Ballard is still a pretty good football player, gimpy
knee and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just last night we were watching (practice) film and you hear,
`Good job, House.' Or, `Good footwork, House,''' Williams said.
``He's just amazing.''

ALIVE AND KICKING, SEAHAWKS STARS ACCEPT SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ You're sitting in your living room, watching TV,
when one of those new Seahawk ads comes on.
</P>
<P>
   You know the ads: A mass of Seahawks running down a rain-soaked
street in downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Then you get the snippets and cameos and one-liners of some of
the Seahawks' young marquee players.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Springs, Walter Jones, Ricky Watters, Joey Galloway,
Michael Sinclair and Jason McEndoo _ all fresh and funny and
looking to make a good impression.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, fifth-year defensive tackle Sam Adams steals the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Adams adds a slam-dunk ending to the spunky ad. He goes
one-on-one against the camera as the 285-pounder shouts an urgent
message to anyone out there inclined to be a Seahawk fan:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo. We're alive and kicking. Wassup? Are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Adams starts to get up out of his chair. His eyes bug open
wide. The frame freezes with Adams staring wild-eyed and energetic
_ a look you can't quite forget.
</P>
<P>
   You know the TV spot has attitude and is destined to be a hit,
like the Paul Allen Seahawks are aiming to be after all the money
he has spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had me in there screaming and hollering and jumping
around. I like to rap a little, sing. But I was in there yelling
for so long. I was trying to get that out to the (producers): `Man,
I've been in here forever,''' Adams said Tuesday, as Day 2 of
two-a-days did not seem to diminish the club's enthusiasm and
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   According to Adams, there is little doubt the Seahawks are
moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   When Adams first came to the Seahawks as a first-round pick in
1994, ``It was cold. It was cold and old and dragging around. It
was slow. Mentally slow. And the attitude. It was sluggish,'' Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, it's peppy and spry and you look around and everyone
knows and feels that we should win. Not that we can possibly win if
we play well. We're supposed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this ad campaign is to bring Seahawks into your
living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the Mariners and Sonics. The (fans) know those people.
Why do they know those people? Because they're out there busting
their butt to get the players acquainted with the community,''
Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   What's most amazing about this marketing campaign is that the
Seahawks actually have a slew of talented, charismatic and slightly
camera-hungry players capable of pulling this thing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like the spotlight, you shouldn't be playing pro
football,'' Springs said. ``We're just trying to drum up some
interest in the team, let people know that just because we're
athletes, because we're football players, we aren't mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just let them know a little bit about us personally. And the
commercials can only help. When you know people are out there,
watching you on TV, supporting us, we have a heavier weight on our
shoulders. ... We cannot let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   With this kind of sincere mission statement, it's clear that the
days of Seahawk public relations straight out of ``Cops'' and
``NYPD Blue'' are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days of ex-Seahawk Patrick Hunter, intoxicated,
rolling his truck into a car outside a Bellevue bar.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days of allegations against running back Chris
Warren slapping a woman's rear end in an Eastside nightclub; the
curbside arrest of ex-back-up cornerback Orlando Watters, whose car
registration was expired and who police found with marijuana; coach
Dennis Erickson's major mistake of driving after too many drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Long gone, it seems, is the nightmare of receiver Brian Blades'
horrific decision to take a loaded gun into the middle of a family
dispute and wind up with his beloved cousin dead.
</P>
<P>
   You almost feel guilty just bringing up these things, especially
since some members of the front office have been with the
organization since Day 1. There was never a question the Seahawks'
organization had a heart and a soul in the community. But there was
so much negative stuff that brought this organization to its knees,
you wondered if it could ever shine again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think your team reflects your management,'' two-time Pro
Bowler Sinclair said yesterday. ``Like with the Behrings. No
offense to them, but we carried the attitude of what was going on
in our upstairs office. Your top-echelon teams, your Super Bowl
teams, they have great front offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the players are ready to deliver the goods, in a snappy,
spry and fresh fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As professional athletes, we have to carry ourselves in a
professional manner, on and off the field. The job goes 365 days a
year,'' Adams said. ``As soon as we step off the field, we have to
carry ourselves in a manner that's respectable and acceptable in
the public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The public eye is so used to the bad stuff, it's blinking in
amazed relief.

DODGERS BEAT REDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Or the big tease?
</P>
<P>
   The next couple of weeks could determine the Dodgers' intention.
And their direction. But they are beginning to bear watching.
</P>
<P>
   In beating the Cincinnati Reds 4-2 on Tuesday night before
30,452 fans at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers won for the sixth time
in their last nine games and crept _ with colossal exertion _ to
two games above .500 (51-49) for the first time since mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   The effort had a familiar look: a strong performance by a
starting pitcher, in this case Ismael Valdes, some gritty work by
the relief staff, and just enough output from the usual offensive
suspects, Gary Sheffield, Eric Karros, Adrian Beltre and Raul
Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   It has put the Dodgers in the thick of the National League
wild-card race, and undoubtedly has interim general manager Tommy
Lasorda squirming over whatever move he might want to make next.
</P>
<P>
   This probably can't qualify as a surge _ not for a team that has
locked on .500 a total of 24 times this year. But it's a glimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to get anything, we need some kind of consistency
to get a streak going,'' said manager Glenn Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next couple of weeks, the Dodgers could be put to the
test in that regard. In a 12-game stretch, nine of the meetings
will be divided among a division leader (Houston, beginning tonight
at Dodger Stadium) and two of the teams that lie ahead of L.A. in
the wild-card standings (Philadelphia and New York). The latter two
series will be played on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's game was the type that tends to boost a team's
confidence, because it didn't come without considerable effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, leading 4-1 to start the seventh inning, quickly
faced a bases-loaded, one-out situation after Valdes faltered and
Sheffield and Mondesi crossed signals under a fly ball in
right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Radinsky got one critical out when he retired the
dangerous Reggie Sanders, a pinch hitter, on a pop to second.
Radinsky, after starting out 3-and-0 to the next man, pinch hitter
Barry Larkin, yielded a walk to force in a run. But the Dodgers
survived disaster when Dmitri Young lined to Karros at first base
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was 4-2, and since the Dodgers now have Jeff Shaw in
their bullpen, that meant they had a realistic chance of holding
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jeff closing the door, he's a closer who can do the
job,'' said Valdes, who improved to 8-9. ``He throws strikes. He
knows what to do out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's giving the Dodgers a luxury they haven't enjoyed in
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, acquired from the Reds for Paul Konerko and Dennis Reyes
on July 4, turned away his former team for the second straight
night. Hoffman called on him early, in the eighth inning, with a
man on, two out and... Konerko at the plate?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Yet another bizarre sight in this Twilight Zone season for
the Dodgers. Shaw got a fielder's choice grounder in that
confrontation, ending the inning, then went 1-2-3 in the ninth for
his 27th save _ and his fourth in as many opportunities since
joining the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told (Hoffman) a lot of work is not unusual for me, the
eighth inning is not unusual for me,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The way he's pitched lately, he should make sure he keeps his
arm limber. Shaw has retired 22 of the 24 batters he's faced, seven
by strikeout, since arriving here.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, meanwhile, continued a solid stretch of work that began
six weeks ago and has included two complete-game shutouts. He
worked 61/3 innings on five hits and two runs, striking out six _
two of them on called third strikes to end innings with a runner in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does well when he locates his fastball because he has very
good offspeed stuff,'' said catcher Charles Johnson. ``When he can
throw his fastball in and out (corners of the plate) he's tough,
because he can get people out with his breaking ball. You can't
just sit on one pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, by contrast, sat on a few from Reds starter Brett
Tomko (9-7) in the early innings _ and squashed them.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Beltre hit the second home run of his
major-league career, a bomb to center to drive in Karros, who had
singled.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Sheffield, with a single, and Karros, with a
double the other way, each drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for the Dodgers attack. Valdes welcomed the four
runs, though _ it was more output than the Dodgers had provided in
12 of his previous 20 starts this season.

   Open positions of short sales on the New York Stock Exchange
increased 1.97 percent in the last month, to 4.13 billion shares on
July 15, surpassing last month's record of 4.05 billion shares, the
exchange reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figure equaled 1.6 percent of all shares listed on
the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   On the smaller American Stock Exchange, short interest fell 0.4
percent as of July 15, to 194.38 million shares from 195.07 million
shares, the exchange reported.

   A short position is created when an investor sells shares that
have been borrowed. If the share price falls, the investor can
profit by buying shares at a lower price to replace the borrowed
ones.

   While an increase in a short position may indicate a rise in
bearish attitudes toward stock prices, the volume of short

   ADVERTISING
</P>
<P>
   Kinko's Inc. in Ventura, Calif., said on Tuesday that it had
named TBWA Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif., to handle its worldwide
account, with billings estimated at $40 million. The creative
portion had been handled by the Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney unit of
Publicis S.A. in Chicago, while the media portion had been handled
by CPM Media Management in Chicago; both agencies and Kinko's
parted ways in May.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a two-month review that had been
narrowed to TBWA Chiat/Day, part of Omnicom Group, and two other
finalists: Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in New York, part of the Lowe Group
unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and Ogilvy &AMP; Mather New
York, a unit of WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The Kmart Corp.is joining the ranks of retailers promoting their
private-label jeans lines with a national television campaign for
its Route 66 brand. The commercials are unusual for Kmart in their
hip, contemporary attitude meant to reach younger consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The coming back-to-school shopping season is ``the perfect time
to appeal to the teens and younger customers,'' said Larry Davis,
vice president for advertising at Kmart in Troy, Mich. The Route 66
line, which has been around for two years, has been expanded to
offer clothes for boys, girls, men and women; it competes against
brands like Canyon River Blues, sold by Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., and
Arizona, sold by the J.C. Penney Company.
</P>
<P>
   The two commercials in the campaign, created by Kmart's lead
agency, Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis, are infused with an
edgy attitude that contrasts markedly with Kmart's general market
advertising. That is underlined in the theme: ``Route 66. Clothes.
Jeans. It's not Mainstreet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the commercials appeal to the young, spirited
customer,'' said Joe Sapienza, product development director at
Kmart, ``and that is obviously whom we are targeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, for which spending was not disclosed and which
just began, will run for four weeks, Davis said, to be followed by
additional commercials in the fall. Campbell Mithun is majority
owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of Pepsico Inc. said on Tuesday that it
had expanded its relationship with the BBDO Worldwide unit of
Omnicom Group in New York by naming BBDO Asia-Pacific to handle
creative duties for the Pepsi-Cola and Mountain Dew brands in
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam, and media planning and account management duties for its
Mirinda and 7Up brands in those countries. The duties, with
billings estimated at $40 million, had been handled by offices of
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of WPP Group PLC. BBDO
Asia-Pacific was awarded the assignments after a review that also
included another unit of WPP, the J. Walter Thompson Company. BBDO
now handles Pepsi-Cola brand advertising in 59 countries.

   ``The project that I have been working on is done,'' said Ms.
Doan, 44, who has worked for Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, part of Saatchi &AMP;

Hogan memorabilia leaving Colonial 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The widow of golf legend Ben Hogan has
reached an agreement with U.S. Golf Association officials to move
the brunt of Hogan's memorabilia from Colonial Country Club to the
USGA Museum and Library in Far Hills, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Parties with knowledge of the negotiations confirmed the
agreement Tuesday, but said a binding contract has not been signed.
Andy Mutch, USGA curator, said a formal announcement of the
agreement is planned for later this week at the U.S. Senior Open in
Pacific Palisades, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Hogan, widow of the nine-time major champion who died
last July, was unavailable for comment Tuesday because she was at
the Senior Open attending a function to honor Hogan on the 50th
anniversary of his 1948 U.S. Open victory. The 1948 Open was held
at Riviera Country Club, site of this week's Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some time this week, the announcement will be made,'' Mutch
said, noting that the planned Hogan display will fill a
1,000-square-foot room at the USGA museum, also known as Golf
House. ``The contract hasn't been signed, sealed or delivered ...
but we plan to issue a press release from the Senior Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee Kelly, lawyer for the Hogan family, stressed that the deal
is not final and declined further comment. But several Colonial
members said Tuesday they are prepared for the majority of Hogan's
collectibles, which have been on display for four decades at the
club's Ben Hogan Trophy Room, to move to Golf House by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all disappointed, but there's no hard feelings on
anybody's part,'' said Marty Leonard, daughter of Colonial founder
Marvin Leonard and the person Valerie Hogan first informed of her
desire to move the collection in accordance with the wishes of her
late husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their business and their decision,'' Leonard said.
``Selfishly, I'd love to have them stay here for a lot of reasons.
For Colonial. For Fort Worth. But we need to respect their private
wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonial members said Valerie Hogan has expressed a desire to
move the memorabilia to a venue that is more accessible to the
masses and offers heightened security measures. The USGA museum is
home to the world's largest collection of golf-related memorabilia
and receives 25,000 visitors per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been told before Hogan's death that he wanted ... the
whole world to be able to see these items, rather than just people
in this locality,'' said Clark Martin, Colonial president. ``He was
an international figure. I guess his stuff should be put where the
most people will enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the proposed agreement, Mutch confirmed that some
artifacts would remain at Colonial. But most items, including
Hogan's four U.S. Open medals, will head to Golf House.
</P>
<P>
   Security measures at Golf House, said Martin, would be superior
to those at the club. During the time the Hogan artifacts have been
on display at Colonial, there have been two burglaries _ one in
1980, when all items were recovered, and the other in 1992, when
Hogan's 1953 Hickock Belt was taken and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan received the jewel-encrusted, 18-carat gold buckle and
alligator belt for being selected the outstanding professional
athlete of the year. At the time of its disappearance, it carried
an insured value of $35,000. Apparently, the second burglary
weighed heavily in deliberations about housing the Hogan
collection, appraised at $650,000 by one expert in 1990, at Golf
House.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Golf Digest, Valerie Hogan said of the
potential move: ``I know it's quite a blow to Colonial. But it was
Ben's wish and my wish that we wanted those things where they'll be
safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where the majority of Hogan's trophies are housed,
Leonard said the club would maintain a display honoring the
five-time Colonial champ in the Ben Hogan Trophy Room. A committee
already has been formed to discuss renovation of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will come up with another memorial for him,'' Leonard
said. &QL;

MASSI EMERGES AS WINNER OF 122-MILE STAGE IN PYRENEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing) (rl) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCHON, France _ The Tour de France entered the Pyrenees
Mountains Tuesday, and a sense of order returned to the overall
standing: Jan Ullrich, Bobby Julich, Bo Hamburger, Laurent Jalabert
and Luc Leblanc.
</P>
<P>
   Gone were Laurent Desbiens, Andrea Tafi and Jacky Durand, who
ruled the roost during the last few days and now are no higher than
Tafi's 54th place. Proving that anything is possible with enough
courage and savvy, however, an unlikely winner emerged after the
122-mile stage across the fabled Circle of Death peaks.
</P>
<P>
   That was Rodolfo Massi, an Italian who rides for Casino and not
one of the major climbers. He benefited from a long breakaway with
Cedric Vasseur, a Frenchman with GAN, and Alberto Elli, another
Italian with Casino, to give the French team its third victory in
10 stages of this 85th Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Massi did no work during most of the breakaway from the first
climb _ the daunting Aubisque peak, rated in the highest category
of difficulty _ through the second climb, the similarly rated
Tourmalet. Team strategy called for him to ride in the slipstream
of Elli and Vasseur, saving his strength for the last two climbs,
the Aspin and the Peyresourde, both rated first category, or a
notch lower than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth climb, Massi took off, leaving his weary teammate
and the unwitting Vasseur behind. Massi had enough power left to
hold off a late charge by Marco Pantani, an Italian with Mercatone
Uno, the winner of the recent Giro d'Italia and _ on the 364 other
days of the year _ a far superior climber to Massi.
</P>
<P>
   But Pantani reverted to his habit of unleashing his charge too
late and once again finished a Tour stage in second place. The
winner was timed in 5 hours 49 minutes 40 seconds, or 36 seconds
faster than Pantani across the finish line after an 8.1-mile
descent from the Peyresourde into Luchon.
</P>
<P>
   Third in the stage, which started in Pau, was Michael Boogerd, a
Dutchman with Rabobank, 59 seconds behind. Clocking the same time
were nine other riders, including Ullrich, a German with Telekom
and the defending champion; Julich, of Glenwood Springs, Colo.,
with Cofidis, and Leblanc, a Frenchman with Polti.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich regained the overall leader's yellow jersey, which he
yielded to Desbiens on Sunday. The German is 1:18 ahead of Julich.
Hamburger, a Dane with Casino, is third, 2:17 behind the leader,
with Jalabert, a Frenchman with ONCE, 2:38 behind and Leblanc 3:03
behind. The 151 remaining riders get another chance to climb
Wednesday before a day off on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An ecstatic Julich attempted to be blase afterward. ``Last year
I had goose bumps when I finished with the leaders in Morzine,'' he
said. ``This time I knew my place was with the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen riders quit the race in the Pyrenees, some out of
exhaustion, some because of crashes on foggy and slippery roads.
The major casualty was Francesco Casagrande, the Italian leader of
Cofidis, whom Julich was obligated to work for. With Casagrande
gone, the American becomes the team leader for whom everybody else
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody'' includes another American with Cofidis, Kevin
Livingston of Austin, Texas, a strong climber who finished 14th
Tuesday, 1:58 behind, and ranks 18th overall, 5:38 behind. He will
very likely excel Wednesday in the final climb to the Plateau de
Beille, which will make its debut in the Tour but which Livingston
knows from his second-place finish last year in the Tour de
l'Avenir.
</P>
<P>
   The weather turned overnight, dropping from a reading of 104
degrees to half that atop the climbs. A heavy fog and swirling
mist, especially on the first climb, contributed to the
difficulties, making descents from the four peaks treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor was the absence of the Festina team, which
was expelled in a drug scandal late Friday. The team's nine riders
are usually dominant in the mountains and would surely have
attacked Ullrich and the other favorites early in the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Mass., who rides with United States
Postal and who lost more than 18 minutes Monday when he suffered
heatstroke and finished in a daze, was able to brave the conditions
and complete Tuesday's stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said he has had stomach troubles for the last month and
that he was not able to keep down any food or drink on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from such a high to such a low in two days,'' he said,
referring to his second place in the individual time trial on
Saturday to his 160th place Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he was game to see how he would do in the Pyrenees
when he spoke in Pau before the start of Tuesday's stage. ``I put
my body through a lot yesterday,'' he said. ``How it reacts today I
don't know. You can only push your body so hard and then it doesn't
want to go any harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton finished the mountain stage in 126th place, among a big
group of riders bringing up the rear, 31:34 behind Massi. In his
way, he rode just as courageous a race as the winner.

<P>
   ``If they asked you to put your hand in the fire I suppose you'd
do it?'' your mother always sighed. Well if you are a trainee at
one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Seven trainees at Eagle Life Star were hospitalized after a
daylong ``motivational course'' at a hotel near the company's
headquarters in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of problem-solving games, trainees removed their
socks and shoes and were invited, for the final exercise, to walk
on a bed of hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Star Life said a ``full and frank internal inquiry'' was
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the joys of motivational weekends. What is it about
management theorists that they think if you have not spent a
weekend together learning how to get from one side of the room to
the other without touching the floor, or energetically paintballing
each other in the countryside, then your company will never make
the Fortune 500 list?
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind such courses is that workers should learn more
about each other, learn to trust their colleagues and become highly
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The reality can be that people end up injured, humiliated or
falling out, and the majority of the bonding happens in the pub _
just like a normal weekday.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Isaacs, spokeswoman for Eagle Life, was keen to point out
that the firewalking was the culmination of seven months of
training and that, in the past, they had found similar courses
``highly motivational, team building, confidence building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, they had restricted themselves to
adventure courses. ``We're looking for things that will help people
discover how they can use their initiative.'' Which, according to
the chief of an electronics company who has been on a different
firewalking course, is not always what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh they say no one is compelled to walk across the coals but
you're made to feel such a jerk in such a subtle way if you don't
do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all such a big show. They get people all hyped up and
then they're left to go flat. They often have very good material,
there are good techniques but in the end it's all made into a show
and I think that's prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Common techniques that are used on management courses also
include hugging and kissing your neighbor in order to ``break down
comfort zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Impact Development Training uses what it calls a ``pamper pole''
_ a telegraph pole that you climb to the top of and then jump
through a trapeze. This, it is said, is designed to develop support
and trust.
</P>
<P>
   Those who use such services are fiercely protective of them.
While conceding that the most recent outcome was less than ideal,
Isaacs said that other Eagle Life Star courses had been very
successful in building up team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been on courses themselves are less sure. A
management consultant is still sulking about one course he went on
some years ago. ``You had to make something out of limited
materials; paper, scissors etc., and see which would travel
furthest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a paper boat but the people who won made a catapult. I
suppose it's all very well, but there's no skill in the
construction of catapults like there was with our boat. Everyone
normally ends up falling out anyway when someone starts an argument
because you won't do it their way.''
</P>
<P>
   And one former bank worker remembers with gritted teeth another
motivational course: ``We had to prepare a presentation for the
last day, to be given at 8 a.m. It was basically made up of
impossible tasks so that by 4 a.m. we were all hyper on blood sugar
boosts or killing each other with tiredness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got it sorted by about 6 a.m., only to be told as
we walked into the presentation room that there were no
presentations _ it was to monitor how we operated under stress.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? ``Everyone got drunk and shagged each other.''
Well at least some kind of bonding was achieved. &QL;

training and that, in the past, they had found similar courses
``highly motivational, team building, confidence building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, they had restricted themselves to
adventure courses. ``We're looking for things that will help people
discover how they can use their initiative.'' Which, according to
the chief of an electronics company who has been on a different
firewalking course, is not always what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh they say no one is compelled to walk across the coals but
you're made to feel such a jerk in such a subtle way if you don't
do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all such a big show. They get people all hyped up and
then they're left to go flat. They often have very good material,
there are good techniques but in the end it's all made into a show
and I think that's prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Common techniques that are used on management courses also
include hugging and kissing your neighbor in order to ``break down
comfort zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Impact Development Training uses what it calls a ``pamper pole''
_ a telegraph pole that you climb to the top of and then jump
through a trapeze. This, it is said, is designed to develop support
and trust.
</P>
<P>
   Those who use such services are fiercely protective of them.
While conceding that the most recent outcome was less than ideal,
Isaacs said that other Eagle Life Star courses had been very
successful in building up team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been on courses themselves are less sure. A
management consultant is still sulking about one course he went on
some years ago. ``You had to make something out of limited
materials; paper, scissors etc., and see which would travel
furthest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a paper boat but the people who won made a catapult. I
suppose it's all very well, but there's no skill in the
construction of catapults like there was with our boat. Everyone
normally ends up falling out anyway when someone starts an argument
because you won't do it their way.''
</P>
<P>
   And one former bank worker remembers with gritted teeth another
motivational course: ``We had to prepare a presentation for the
last day, to be given at 8 a.m. It was basically made up of
impossible tasks so that by 4 a.m. we were all hyper on blood sugar
boosts or killing each other with tiredness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got it sorted by about 6 a.m., only to be told as
we walked into the presentation room that there were no
presentations _ it was to monitor how we operated under stress.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? ``Everyone got drunk and shagged each other.''
Well at least some kind of bonding was achieved. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It is a cultural encounter that foreshadows the
future of the United States _ but white America is so far taking
precious little notice.
</P>
<P>
   In its gleaming new convention center that sits right across
from the restored Amish market, this quintessentially WASP city of
William Penn is hosting upwards of 15,000 representatives of the
National Council of La Raza, the country's biggest organization of
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic delegates are conspicuous in a city center that
normally bustles with white and black. In the long corridors of the
convention center, there is a subdued air of Latin festivity and
the quiet buzz of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   From the mainstream U.S. media, however, you would hardly know
that the Hispanics were around _ a point that rankles perpetually
with their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics have been quietly advancing and earning a place in
this country in a way that is not always understood in many of the
cities of the nation. And Philadelphia, we are afraid, may well be
one of them,'' said a bilingual editorial in Al Dia, one of the
region's clutch of Spanish-language newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   An article in Hispanic magazine put it more emotively: ``We are
_ whether we like it or not _ in the midst of the Hispanization of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are the America's fastest-growing ethnic minority.
Currently numbering around 30 million (11 percent), they are
expected to overtake the number of blacks within seven years.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2050, but probably before, Hispanics will comprise
more than 25 percent of the U.S. population and their growth will
be the main reason why, by that date, white Americans will find
themselves just another minority in the country they have regarded
for more than two centuries as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The vast implications of this demographic shift _ especially for
white Americans _ have hardly begun to be addressed, although they
lay at the heart of President Clinton's year-old initiative on race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Where the population at large fears to tread, however, business
and _ more tentatively _ politics, are starting to venture.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition hall in the Philadelphia convention center is
crowded with exhibitors, more than 500 in all, from department
store chains to car manufacturers, from community action groups to
health and housing watchdogs, all courting the burgeoning Hispanic
market.
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speaker at lunch Monday was the first lady, Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother is standing for political office in Florida, one of
seven states where the Hispanic minority has electoral clout, so
`name recognition' is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker is the mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani,
in what is billed his ``first major address to a national Latino
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani does not need their votes _ he was reelected by a
landslide last year. The Republicans, on the other hand, do, as
they look to this autumn's midterm congressional elections and the
presidential race in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Their standing with Hispanic voters has been severely harmed by
California's anti-immigration measures which led, in the words of a
Republican consultant's report, to the ``utter collapse of the
Hispanic vote'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both parties must consider one salient fact of
political life. As early as the next presidential election, the
Hispanic constituency will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The big states of Texas and California, with 86 electoral
college votes between them, are already 25 percent Hispanic.
Hispanics are significant minorities also in Florida, Arizona, New
Mexico, Illinois, New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   This explains why there is now a rush by both parties to have
some sort of Hispanic representation on their presidential ticket
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In recent elections, the question has been when or whether it
would be politically decisive to have a black or a woman on the
ticket. Now, there is speculation that Bill Richardson, a former
senator from New Mexico who is about to go from the ambassadorship
of the U.N. to the post of Energy Secretary, is being considered as
a possible running mate for Al Gore for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's mother is Mexican, he is bilingual and popular with
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, son of the former president, present Governor of
Texas and a favored Republican candidate, has been assiduously
wooing Hispanic voters, helped by a Mexican sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Those who object that Hispanics cannot be treated as a
homogeneous ethnic minority or even as a solid voting block have a
point.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanics of California and Texas are predominantly recent
immigrants from Mexico and Central America and their families;
their opposition to tougher restrictions on immigration and
benefits has pushed them into the arms of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, where the bias is towards Cuban exiles, with strong
anti-Castro sentiments, the vote has been Republican. In New
Mexico, where Hispanics constitute almost 40 percent of the
population, political sympathies are less clearly differentiated.
</P>
<P>
   At the La Raza convention this week, Hispanics are going out of
their way to present themselves as responsible and successful
Americans, a minority that has the highest male employment rate and
some of the best health indicators of any in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on the monolingual mainstream, however, of a sizeable
minority that speaks a different language has yet to be gauged. In
California and Texas, it has already caused tension, with
California withdrawing funds for bilingual education, and Texas
employers dismissing workers who persist in speaking Spanish
between themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic mix in those states today is that of America in 50
years' time. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Up, down or sideways for U.S. interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Alan Greenspan started his twice-a-year Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony to U.S. Congress. It is an event which has taken on
enormous significance _ probably far too much _ as anyone involved
in the markets deconstructs each word of Dr. Greenspan to try and
judge when and which way the Fed might jump.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the testimony what should we think? You have to start
with the condition of the U.S. economy, where things are changing
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago it seemed that growth was bounding on, but
quite suddenly it seems that the East Asian crisis has struck.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the first quarter was 5.4 percent annual rate; growth
in the second _ well, we won't have the figures until July 31 but
the estimates I have seen range from plus 1 percent to minus 0.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, it is at least plausible that there will be a
recession in the U.S. this year.
</P>
<P>
   We are only just into the third quarter so it would be silly to
guess the outcome there. But if the second does turn out to be
minus something and the General Motors strike rolls on much longer
it is certainly within the bounds of possibility that there will be
two quarters of negative growth, the technical definition of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   This recession, if it were to take place, would be largely an
externally triggered one. There has been a sudden, sharp
deterioration in the U.S. trade account. Exports of the U.S. to
East Asia have collapsed while imports (on the back of that strong
home demand) have remained pretty high.
</P>
<P>
   Largely externally triggered, but not entirely, there may also
been a swing in the inventory cycle taking place, with a buildup in
the second quarter and a fall now. This at least is the view of the
U.S. economic team at HSBC.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.S. policymakers are in a bit of a quandary. On the one
hand it would be unwise to tighten policy now in the face of a
possible recession, albeit a brief one.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand while there is little visible sign of an
upsurge in inflation, the strong first quarter did push up
inflation a bit, and price rises are towards the top end of the
industrial world scale.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of demand in the economy probably remained as high in the
second quarter as in the first, an unsustainable 5 percent annual
rate. And of course asset prices, particularly the price of
financial assets, remain at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this, the question is whether the collapse in demand
from east Asia has done the Fed's work for it. It almost certainly
has. Had the American economy not taken the east Asian hit, it
would have had to take an interest rate hit.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few months the mood of most Fed members (though
less Greenspan's) has been that the Fed should incline towards a
modest tightening of policy.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of demand in east Asia and the knock-on impact of
this on the U.S. seems likely to put any rise in interest rates on
hold. Expect that signal to emerge this week from Greenspan. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (275-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that is right _ and the markets will hit the fan if it is not
_ what next?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is UK-based and has spent much time in the U.S. this
year will notice a marked difference in the mood between the two
countries. In the UK there is a widespread appreciation that the
country might move into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Actually there is less immediate practical evidence of that than
there is in the U.S. We are facing a slowdown at the moment but
there is nothing in the indicators yet which suggests that there
was negative growth in the second quarter. But that is not the
perception. We are aware of the dangers of overheating, for people
keep in talking about these.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., by contrast, hardly anyone outside the narrow
sphere of economics believes that anything might be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There has been concern that the millennium bug might create a
recession by disrupting the world's computer systems, and of course
there are the worries about east Asia noted above.
</P>
<P>
   But there is very little perception that there might be the
threat of recession from within the U.S., in particular that the
widening trade deficit might be unsustainable. Instead everyone
focuses on inflation: no inflation, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is therefore extremely ill-prepared for bad economic
news.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic demand has been sustained in large measure by the
willingness of foreigners to cover the U.S. current account
deficit, and the ability of American consumers to continue
financing their own spending by building up financial assets in the
stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Question: how will America react to bad economic numbers? My
guess is that one negative GDP number, assuming it is negative,
will not do much harm to confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The almost mystical faith that Americans seem to have that
somehow or other the Fed can manipulate interest rates to sustain
growth forever can probably stand the odd blow.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is further out. It is that the east Asian slump will
continue to deteriorate and that it will prove more contagious to
the U.S. than at present appears to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, if you are U.S.-based, to take on board the full
fragility of the world economy at this moment. Greenspan's judgment
on these dangers has proved pretty accurate in recent months, and
it will be particularly interesting to see how his view has moved
as the story has unrolled.
</P>
<P>
   So I think the thing to look for this week will be twofold.
First, listen more to what Greenspan says about the world and not
so much what he says about America.
</P>
<P>
   And second, watch the reaction in the U.S.: to what extent does
the ``R'' word, recession, come into the headlines?
</P>
<P>
   It would be safer for the rest of us if American opinion was
more aware of the fact that the economic cycle is not dead, just
sleeping. &QL;

   Up, down or sideways for U.S. interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Alan Greenspan started his twice-a-year Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony to U.S. Congress. It is an event which has taken on
enormous significance _ probably far too much _ as anyone involved
in the markets deconstructs each word of Dr. Greenspan to try and
judge when and which way the Fed might jump.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the testimony what should we think? You have to start
with the condition of the U.S. economy, where things are changing
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago it seemed that growth was bounding on, but
quite suddenly it seems that the East Asian crisis has struck.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the first quarter was 5.4 percent annual rate; growth
in the second _ well, we won't have the figures until July 31 but
the estimates I have seen range from plus 1 percent to minus 0.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, it is at least plausible that there will be a
recession in the U.S. this year.
</P>
<P>
   We are only just into the third quarter so it would be silly to
guess the outcome there. But if the second does turn out to be
minus something and the General Motors strike rolls on much longer
it is certainly within the bounds of possibility that there will be
two quarters of negative growth, the technical definition of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   This recession, if it were to take place, would be largely an
externally triggered one. There has been a sudden, sharp
deterioration in the U.S. trade account. Exports of the U.S. to
East Asia have collapsed while imports (on the back of that strong
home demand) have remained pretty high.
</P>
<P>
   Largely externally triggered, but not entirely, there may also
been a swing in the inventory cycle taking place, with a buildup in
the second quarter and a fall now. This at least is the view of the
U.S. economic team at HSBC.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.S. policymakers are in a bit of a quandary. On the one
hand it would be unwise to tighten policy now in the face of a
possible recession, albeit a brief one.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand while there is little visible sign of an
upsurge in inflation, the strong first quarter did push up
inflation a bit, and price rises are towards the top end of the
industrial world scale.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of demand in the economy probably remained as high in the
second quarter as in the first, an unsustainable 5 percent annual
rate. And of course asset prices, particularly the price of
financial assets, remain at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this, the question is whether the collapse in demand
from east Asia has done the Fed's work for it. It almost certainly
has. Had the American economy not taken the east Asian hit, it
would have had to take an interest rate hit.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few months the mood of most Fed members (though
less Greenspan's) has been that the Fed should incline towards a
modest tightening of policy.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of demand in east Asia and the knock-on impact of
this on the U.S. seems likely to put any rise in interest rates on
hold. Expect that signal to emerge this week from Greenspan. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (275-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that is right _ and the markets will hit the fan if it is not
_ what next?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is UK-based and has spent much time in the U.S. this
year will notice a marked difference in the mood between the two
countries. In the UK there is a widespread appreciation that the
country might move into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Actually there is less immediate practical evidence of that than
there is in the U.S. We are facing a slowdown at the moment but
there is nothing in the indicators yet which suggests that there
was negative growth in the second quarter. But that is not the
perception. We are aware of the dangers of overheating, for people
keep in talking about these.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., by contrast, hardly anyone outside the narrow
sphere of economics believes that anything might be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There has been concern that the millennium bug might create a
recession by disrupting the world's computer systems, and of course
there are the worries about east Asia noted above.
</P>
<P>
   But there is very little perception that there might be the
threat of recession from within the U.S., in particular that the
widening trade deficit might be unsustainable. Instead everyone
focuses on inflation: no inflation, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is therefore extremely ill-prepared for bad economic
news.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic demand has been sustained in large measure by the
willingness of foreigners to cover the U.S. current account
deficit, and the ability of American consumers to continue
financing their own spending by building up financial assets in the
stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Question: how will America react to bad economic numbers? My
guess is that one negative GDP number, assuming it is negative,
will not do much harm to confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The almost mystical faith that Americans seem to have that
somehow or other the Fed can manipulate interest rates to sustain
growth forever can probably stand the odd blow.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is further out. It is that the east Asian slump will
continue to deteriorate and that it will prove more contagious to
the U.S. than at present appears to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, if you are U.S.-based, to take on board the full
fragility of the world economy at this moment. Greenspan's judgment
on these dangers has proved pretty accurate in recent months, and
it will be particularly interesting to see how his view has moved
as the story has unrolled.
</P>
<P>
   So I think the thing to look for this week will be twofold.
First, listen more to what Greenspan says about the world and not
so much what he says about America.
</P>
<P>
   And second, watch the reaction in the U.S.: to what extent does
the ``R'' word, recession, come into the headlines?
</P>
<P>
   It would be safer for the rest of us if American opinion was
more aware of the fact that the economic cycle is not dead, just
sleeping. &QL;

<P>
   A new era in cancer therapy could be opened later this year with
the launch of a vaccine which tackles the disease in a new way and
could spell the end of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Melacine is the first cancer vaccine which has been developed as
a treatment for advanced melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin
cancer which claims 2,000 lives a year in the UK.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is expected to win approval from the U.S. Food and
Drugs Administration within the next six months after trials in
patients showed ``promising'' results.
</P>
<P>
   A further five or six cancer vaccines are in the pipeline and
are expected to be launched within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts predict that they could spell the end of
chemotherapy _ treatment with large doses of toxic drugs whose
effects can be worse than the disease _ and usher in kinder
therapies for people with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer vaccines are so-called because they work by harnessing
the body's immune system to fight the disease. They differ from
conventional vaccines because they are given as a treatment rather
than to prevent disease.
</P>
<P>
   They are the first new class of drugs for cancer in a decade
since the taxanes were developed in the late 1980s. These include
the drugs Taxol, for advanced ovarian cancer, which is derived from
the bark of the Pacific yew tree and Taxotere, for advanced breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is the first cancer for which researchers have
identified antigenic molecules on the surface of the cancer cells
which act as a trigger for the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Melacine, made by the U.S. biotechnology company Ribi
Immunochem, is one of a number of vaccines being developed for
melanoma which primes the immune system to recognize the molecules
and boosts the immune response to destroy cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Angus Dalgliesh, director of the Gordon Cancer Vaccine
Laboratory at St. George's Hospital, London, said: ``Cancer
vaccines may well take over from chemotherapy. They will probably
knock out chemotherapy in some adjuvant regimes (where it is given
with other drugs).''
</P>
<P>
   Most cancers had been developing for years in the body before
they were diagnosed during which they turned the immune response
off. The idea of cancer vaccines was to reawaken the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Where cancer vaccines are going to work is in cases
where a solid tumor is removed and there is a high chance of the
cancer coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the people who will get the vaccine to kick start the
immune system. In most cases it will only delay the inevitable but
if you can do that with a non-toxic treatment that will be a
valuable advance.'' &QL;

   The country's first hemp beer is being consumed in London's bars
and clubs. But anti-drug campaigners need not worry _ you would
need to drink 3,000 bottles to get stoned.

<P>
   A German company has teamed up with an English importer to bring
the grass-flavored drink to Britain.

   Asbjorn Gerlach, one of the founders of the Berlin-based Bier
Company, said: ``Hops and hemp are very closely related. In 1996,
when growing hemp became legal, we decided to try making beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using hemp as a flavoring agent in beer is a very old idea and
was popular in the Middle Ages. The drink has a slightly fruity,
grassy flavor but tastes very similar to lager.''
</P>
<P>
   The strain of hemp used for beer-making is a sister plant of
cannabis and contains only minute amounts of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlach said: ``You would have to drink so many bottles that it
would kill you before you got stoned. We are not promoting cannabis
_ we are promoting hemp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have called the beer `Turn' because we want people to turn
their minds to the idea of using hemp. It is good for the
environment. To make paper it takes 12 hectares of rainforest but
only one hectare of hemp.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Haddow, an Englishman living near Munich, was already
exporting chocolate from Germany to Britain when he came across the
new 4.9 percent brew and instantly had the idea of introducing it
to the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Haddow and his nephew Paul set up in business and have so far
exported Turn to England and Denmark. It is also bound for France,
Italy, Spain and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Haddow said: ``Brian is a real fan of German beers and hemp
beer tastes very similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are targeting the 18- to 32-year-olds in trendy London bars
and clubs. After that we want to take it to the rest of the
country.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ For 85 years, the Owens Valley in central
California has been sucked dry by the city of Los Angeles, its
natural spring and lake water diverted to feed the sinks, jacuzzis
and lawn sprinklers of the ever-expanding metropolis 250 miles to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of recrimination and threats of legal action,
Los Angeles has at last agreed to take responsibility for some of
the environmental havoc it has wreaked.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from new federal air-pollution legislation, the
city has promised to treat the dustbowl _ once a lake _ at the
heart of Owens Valley with a mixture of water, vegetation and
gravel in an effort to curb the worst source of particle air
pollution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached between the two sides last week, 22
1/2 miles of the lake bed will be treated by 2006 at an estimated
cost of 120 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The city will continue to treat further stretches of the lake
after that until air quality meets standards set down in the
federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The water of Owens Valley was the key to the massive expansion
of Los Angeles in the first few decades of this century, and _ as
Roman Polanski and Robert Towne evoked in their acclaimed film noir
``Chinatown'' _ also a symbol of the bad faith, big business
interests and corruption that has accompanied the uncontrolled
sprawl of America's biggest and wildest metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers of Owens Valley sold their land in 1913 to a group
of businessmen posing as cattle ranchers who in fact were acting as
agents for the city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The locals were thus cheated not only of their water and their
livelihoods, but also of the compensation to which they might have
been entitled if the city authorities had approached them directly.
</P>
<P>
   While the new water source paved the way for the settlement of
the San Fernando Valley immediately north of Los Angeles _ making a
handful of property speculators very rich into the bargain _ the
Owens Valley economy descended into a slump from which it has never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Owens Valley has been prone to storms of white dust
containing arsenic and numerous toxic metals that cause heart and
lung ailments in the local population. The battle to force Los
Angeles to take responsibility for the disaster has been waged in
earnest for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest, and arguably the most important, of a
series of concessions that L.A. has made over its water supply in
recent years. Interest groups at Mono Lake, another 50 miles
further north, prised similar concessions from Los Angeles a few
years ago, but only after protracted legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new deal, Los Angeles stands to lose about 40,000
acre-feet of water per year, enough to service 80,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   But by settling the issue now it averts the risk of a the far
deeper and more costly commitment to environmental cleanup, as
initially demanded by the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control
District, representing the interests of Owens Valley. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ The king of Moldova's gypsies, Mircea Cerari, has
delivered a posthumous blow to a stereotype that has for centuries
dragged down his people _ the view that they are a band of
wandering cobblers and fortune tellers who know about as much about
technology as they do about by-laws and soap.
</P>
<P>
   Cerari went to his grave this week not with a pair of large gold
earrings, nor a pack of well-thumbed cards, or a horseshoe or a
pile of copper pots.
</P>
<P>
   According to local news reports, he was buried with his
computer, fax modem, and cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the perceived value of the trophies that lie alongside
him, which also include a vodka-stocked bar, that organizers of his
interment reportedly insisted that concrete was poured over the
grave to deter thieves from breaking in.
</P>
<P>
   His death at the age of 59, from diabetes-related illness,
appears to have dealt a blow to the large gypsy population in
Moldova and the surrounding former Soviet States.
</P>
<P>
   According to Moldova's ``Flux'' newspaper, almost 15,000 gypsies
from around the region went to the funeral on Monday in Soroca, 80
miles north of Moldova's capital, Kishinev.
</P>
<P>
   His death means that his place as king, or leader, of Moldova's
gypsies now falls to his son, Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   Cerari's equipment suggests that he has done somewhat better
than most of the several hundred thousand other gypsies who, after
trekking across half the planet from northwest India in the 14th
century, somehow ended up in the remnants of the Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   Age-old prejudice against the gypsies _ or, more properly,
``Rom'' (The word ``gypsy'' derives from Egypt, from where they
were for centuries wrongly thought to have come) _ has been fanned
anew by economic malaise, nationalism and a rise in neo-fascism.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems some have made it in the post-Soviet world. The
Mercedes-driving self-proclaimed gypsy king Cioaba in Romania, for
example, is said to wear more gold than a Saudi prince.
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge that you cannot reasonably expect to take such
earthly lucre with you does not appear to have deterred Cerari, who
presumably believed in a cyber-active afterlife, firing off e-mails
from the depths of his white marble tomb.
</P>
<P>
   That view also seems to have carried weight the usually
skeptical Associated Press, which ran a headline Tuesday announcing
that ``Moldova's Gypsy King is dead _ but not out of touch.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politics is a little dull in America at the moment,
but help is at hand. J Danforth Quayle, the former vice president,
is emerging from the shadows to get his campaign for president on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The man who taught American students how to spell ``potatoe'' is
back in the saddle again.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has a serious chance of the Republican nomination for the
Presidency in the 2000 election. He was, after all, a congressman
at 29 and senator at 33 as well as vice president. He is a favorite
of many conservatives, especially on the religious right, and he
scores well in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But what will count against Quayle, inevitably, is his startling
verbal track record.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the word potato that he has managed to mangle: in
the annals of American politics, Quayle has delivered some of the
most astonishing sentences and paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   His legendary ability with language comes close to brilliance,
producing quotations that are a parody of the pol-speak that every
American politician must learn.
</P>
<P>
   He has come up with little gems that echo the empty rhetoric of
his colleagues, but with far greater simplicity. ``If we do not
succeed,'' he said once, ``we run the risk of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, his utterances have been near misses at important
truths. ``I believe we are on an irreversible trend towards more
freedom and democracy _ but that could change,'' he said on another
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it is hard to divine what, exactly, is going on in his
head. As he himself once said, ``Verbosity leads to unclear,
inarticulate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Or even more riveting: ``What a waste it is to lose one's mind.
Or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest we believe that this habit has been exorcised in the years
away from the spotlight, Quayle popped up on television recently to
demonstrate his insight into the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just be very clear that the Republican Party will
select a nominee that will beat Bill Clinton,'' he said. This is an
admirable aspiration. But Clinton, sadly, is prohibited by the
Constitution from running in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll in May by CNN, USA Today and Gallup showed
Quayle as one of the top four possibles alongside the Texas
governor, George W. Bush, (son of the former president), Elizabeth
Dole (wife of former candidate Robert) and Jack Kemp, another
former candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is discreetly putting his hat in the ring. He has a
political action committee gathering funds, Campaign America, based
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He made a campaign swing through Iowa, a key state, recently,
using the opportunity to take a poke at Bill Clinton and his team,
which he called ``the most scandal-plagued administration in the
history of our republic.''
</P>
<P>
   He is quietly recruiting friends and associates to work on his
campaign, which is likely to gather steam in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   He is distancing himself from his one-time patron, George Bush,
and will put himself forward as an anti-establishment candidate _
an odd position for a man who has spent most of his adult life in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for the Republican candidacy at the moment is
George W. Bush, who is, by the standards of the Republican Party in
1998, a relative moderate.
</P>
<P>
   There are other candidates who will try to snatch the support of
the religious right, but none has Quayle's name recognition, and
few have his fund-raising potential and contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes about him will not exactly help, but Quayle has become
better at deflecting them and even capitalizing on his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you shake this image that you had during your
vice-presidency as sort of a bumbling vice president who couldn't
spell?'' he was asked on a recent television show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' he replied. ``I'll let all the perfect
spellers support Al Gore and those who have trouble spelling should
support me.'' On that basis, he could be on for a landslide
victory. &QL;

   PARIS _ As the inventor Samuel Morse might have said: .. - /
.-.. - - - - - - -.- ... / .-.. .. -.- . / SOS / &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ..-. - - - .-. / - .... . / - - - - - .-. ... . / -.-. - - - -..
.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looks like ... --- ... for the Morse Code. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The communications code made famous by a thousand war movies and
tapped out as the Titanic slipped beneath the waves is fast giving
way to computers and satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months, use of the Morse Code will be abolished on
all oceangoing passenger ships and cargo vessels above 300 gross
tons.
</P>
<P>
   It will have been 100 years since the first maritime distress
signal was sent in Morse by a lightship in the English Channel,
reporting the grounding of the steamship Elbe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a wonderful romantic image of the radio operator
tapping out a final radio message as the ship sinks beneath him,''
said Roger Kohn, a spokesman for the International Maritime
Organization in London. ``But the question is, does anyone
survive?''
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 with the loss of some 1,500
lives prompted the first international Safety of Life at Sea
conference, which called for vessels carrying more than 50
passengers to be equipped with a radio-telegraphic apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, most vessels have been upgraded to conform to
the global maritime distress and safety system adopted by the
International Maritime Organization 10 years ago, and which become
universally mandatory next year. The system relies on satellites
and a network of ground-based radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   A ship in distress today no longer has to worry whether an
emergency signal is received by other vessels in the vicinity. Kohn
said the message would be picked up by a radio station somewhere in
the world, which would coordinate a rescue action using all the
resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Achille Lauro, which caught fire and sank in the Indian
Ocean in December 1994. Its SOS was received by a ground station in
Norway, which quickly directed a flotilla of ships to the scene,
enabling all but two of the 979 passengers and crew to be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   If the Titanic had had the same kind of radio and satellite
equipment, Kohn said, all aboard could have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of wireless and Morse enabled the code to be
used as a universal means of communicating at sea, with dots and
dashes, or long tones and short, standing for the letters of the
alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   It may come back into vogue if the world's electronic sinews
collapse one day or are knocked out by enemy attack _ in fact, the
Pentagon still trains Morse operators for such an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohn said its defects include limited range, slowness,
tendency to be disrupted by atmospheric conditions and the
difficulty of training operators. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fretting about how much the cost of college will have soared by
the time your kids are ready for four years in ivory-tower bliss?
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly appealing strategy is a prepaid-tuition plan,
which lets parents lock in tuition money now _ regardless of what
the costs are by the time Junior matriculates.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 made many attractive adjustments
to these plans, so this is a good time to look them over.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, prepaid-tuition plans and tuition-savings plans are
state-run programs that allow families to pay a fixed sum of money
(in either monthly installments or a lump sum) for as many as 17 or
so years before a child is ready to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   With a prepaid plan, the money is guaranteed to cover tuition
later, regardless of the cost when a student is ready to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   With a savings plan, money is socked away now for college, but
if tuition has increased beyond what the plan anticipates, the
parents or student are responsible for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With both plans, the money grows tax-deferred and, upon
withdrawal, is taxed at the student's income rate, not the
parents'. Since most students will fall into the 15 percent
bracket, there can be considerable tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   The key advantage to a prepaid-tuition plan is that parents lock
in a specific tuition price for a state school at the time they
begin investing, regardless of how much tuition increases for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the amount parents pay is based on the age of their
child and the projected year of college entrance. Parents also
select how many years of college they would like to save for and
for which type of school, but there is no need to specify a school
at the time investing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of a newborn in Mississippi, for example, can pay a lump
sum of $9,141 now or make 216 payments of $80 a month to cover four
years at a state university that begin in the year 2015 (based on
the average tuition and fees at public colleges, with a factor for
inflation).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of the lump-sum payment is that you start earning
interest on the entire amount right away.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1998, 14 states had prepaid-tuition plans, and five
had savings plans. According to the College Savings Plans Network,
in Lexington, Ky., another 20 states intend to launch programs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a specific plan, call CSPN
(606-244-8175), or visit its Web site at www.csg.org/cspn.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, states are now allowed to accept
money to prepay room and board in addition to tuition. The law also
loosened the rules for which type of school and for which state the
money can be used.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the plans were once good only for publicly
supported schools in the state in which the family lived, many
states now allow families to use the money at any accredited two-
or four-year school _ public or private _ in the country.

<P>
   Fretting about how much the cost of college will have soared by
the time your kids are ready for four years in ivory-tower bliss?
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly appealing strategy is a prepaid-tuition plan,
which lets parents lock in tuition money now _ regardless of what
the costs are by the time Junior matriculates.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 made many attractive adjustments
to these plans, so this is a good time to look them over.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, prepaid-tuition plans and tuition-savings plans are
state-run programs that allow families to pay a fixed sum of money
(in either monthly installments or a lump sum) for as many as 17 or
so years before a child is ready to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   With a prepaid plan, the money is guaranteed to cover tuition
later, regardless of the cost when a student is ready to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   With a savings plan, money is socked away now for college, but
if tuition has increased beyond what the plan anticipates, the
parents or student are responsible for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With both plans, the money grows tax-deferred and, upon
withdrawal, is taxed at the student's income rate, not the
parents'. Since most students will fall into the 15 percent
bracket, there can be considerable tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   The key advantage to a prepaid-tuition plan is that parents lock
in a specific tuition price for a state school at the time they
begin investing, regardless of how much tuition increases for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the amount parents pay is based on the age of their
child and the projected year of college entrance. Parents also
select how many years of college they would like to save for and
for which type of school, but there is no need to specify a school
at the time investing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of a newborn in Mississippi, for example, can pay a lump
sum of $9,141 now or make 216 payments of $80 a month to cover four
years at a state university that begin in the year 2015 (based on
the average tuition and fees at public colleges, with a factor for
inflation).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of the lump-sum payment is that you start earning
interest on the entire amount right away.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1998, 14 states had prepaid-tuition plans, and five
had savings plans. According to the College Savings Plans Network,
in Lexington, Ky., another 20 states intend to launch programs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a specific plan, call CSPN
(606-244-8175), or visit its Web site at www.csg.org/cspn.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, states are now allowed to accept
money to prepay room and board in addition to tuition. The law also
loosened the rules for which type of school and for which state the
money can be used.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the plans were once good only for publicly
supported schools in the state in which the family lived, many
states now allow families to use the money at any accredited two-
or four-year school _ public or private _ in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Junior ends up at Harvard or Bennington, you'll simply have
to pay the difference in cost. Grandparents are also allowed to set
up a plan in the state where their grandchild lives.
</P>
<P>
   The savings plan will prove too conservative for some investors
_ the plans shoot for just a 5 percent to 6 percent gain, though
the tax advantages shouldn't be overlooked.

   Fretting about how much the cost of college will have soared by
the time your kids are ready for four years in ivory-tower bliss?
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly appealing strategy is a prepaid-tuition plan,
which lets parents lock in tuition money now _ regardless of what
the costs are by the time Junior matriculates.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 made many attractive adjustments
to these plans, so this is a good time to look them over.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, prepaid-tuition plans and tuition-savings plans are
state-run programs that allow families to pay a fixed sum of money
(in either monthly installments or a lump sum) for as many as 17 or
so years before a child is ready to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   With a prepaid plan, the money is guaranteed to cover tuition
later, regardless of the cost when a student is ready to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   With a savings plan, money is socked away now for college, but
if tuition has increased beyond what the plan anticipates, the
parents or student are responsible for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With both plans, the money grows tax-deferred and, upon
withdrawal, is taxed at the student's income rate, not the
parents'. Since most students will fall into the 15 percent
bracket, there can be considerable tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   The key advantage to a prepaid-tuition plan is that parents lock
in a specific tuition price for a state school at the time they
begin investing, regardless of how much tuition increases for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the amount parents pay is based on the age of their
child and the projected year of college entrance. Parents also
select how many years of college they would like to save for and
for which type of school, but there is no need to specify a school
at the time investing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of a newborn in Mississippi, for example, can pay a lump
sum of $9,141 now or make 216 payments of $80 a month to cover four
years at a state university that begin in the year 2015 (based on
the average tuition and fees at public colleges, with a factor for
inflation).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of the lump-sum payment is that you start earning
interest on the entire amount right away.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1998, 14 states had prepaid-tuition plans, and five
had savings plans. According to the College Savings Plans Network,
in Lexington, Ky., another 20 states intend to launch programs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a specific plan, call CSPN
(606-244-8175), or visit its Web site at www.csg.org/cspn.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, states are now allowed to accept
money to prepay room and board in addition to tuition. The law also
loosened the rules for which type of school and for which state the
money can be used.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the plans were once good only for publicly
supported schools in the state in which the family lived, many
states now allow families to use the money at any accredited two-
or four-year school _ public or private _ in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Junior ends up at Harvard or Bennington, you'll simply have
to pay the difference in cost. Grandparents are also allowed to set
up a plan in the state where their grandchild lives.
</P>
<P>
   The savings plan will prove too conservative for some investors
_ the plans shoot for just a 5 percent to 6 percent gain, though
the tax advantages shouldn't be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid-tuition plans offer more of a hedge against runaway
inflation. ``States monitor tuitions and make sure earnings keep up
with tuition inflation,'' says Kathy Tyson, research manager at
CSPN. ``With savings plans, states try to earn as much money as
they can on them, but there's no guarantee they'll keep up with
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   If your child decides to pursue his or her acting dream and
forgo a college education together, there may be a considerable
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as Wisconsin, charge a 1 percent fee to
withdraw money from the plan. Others, such as Florida, will return
your money but without the interest it accrued _ a considerable
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more reason to insist that the little ones finish their
education. &QL;

<P>
   When an argument misses the whole point, the result is likely to
be irrelevant, confusing, or just plain wrong. Much of the debate
about the future of Social Security misses the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not whether Social Security is fundamentally sound
or fundamentally bankrupt, or whether privatizing Social Security
with some kind of giant 401(k) plan would provide us with a more
comfortable old age. At its core, the risk we face has nothing at
all to do with what we now call financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement has become a central issue of national concern
because the number of retirees is going to grow more rapidly than
the number of people of working age, and that problem intensifies
with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   The great uncertainty, then, is whether the economy will be able
to produce sufficient goods and services to support the retired
baby boomers in the style to which they have been accustomed, while
still leaving enough for the younger working members of society to
live in the style to which they would like to become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the real risk is in the productivity of our economy.
</P>
<P>
   All the money in the world piled up in retirement funds will be
worthless unless the economy can provide the stuff we will want to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing accomplished by money flowing in and out of
retirement funds is the determination of who gets what, not how
much is available. Money is the ticket to the show but does not
determine what the show will be.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that more people can enjoy the show if we
can increase the number of available seats. That is why I emphasize
that the standard of living the aging baby boomers can enjoy will
ultimately depend far more on the productivity of the nation than
on the financial arrangements we concoct to fund their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Then how do the financial arrangements enter the picture?
Consider the process by which we finance our everyday spending or
pay off our creditors.
</P>
<P>
   If we are regularly writing checks to pay our bills, or drawing
cash by check or from the ATM, we must be sure to have some way of
replenishing our bank accounts. Money has to come in from
somewhere, or we will go belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   People with jobs bank the wages and salaries they receive from
their employers. People who do not work must look elsewhere to
raise cash _ welfare, monthly pension-fund receipts, a friendly
relative, interest and dividends on investments, or the proceeds
from liquidating assets that have been accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Note that every one of those sources depends in turn on payments
from somewhere else. For example, the government will not mail
welfare benefits or pay the interest on its bonds unless citizens
pay their taxes or buy the bonds issued to cover budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend payments on equities won't be forthcoming unless
corporations can find a market for their output. The accumulated
assets cannot be liquidated if there are no buyers for those
assets.
</P>
<P>
   This illuminates the true function of retirement funds. A
retirement fund owns stocks and bonds and other investments but
cannot itself finance the spending of the retirees unless the fund
has money in the bank first.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, no matter how much shares of stock and no matter
how many bonds the fund owns, no pensions can be paid unless the
bonds and stocks are paying an income or unless the market is
receptive to buying the investments the fund chooses to liquidate.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, then, retirement benefits are financed from outside
the fund rather than by the fund itself. Retirement funds are
merely conduits; they determine who gets what, not how much is
available _ which means that the true function of the assets in
these funds is to serve as collateral to secure the claims of
future retirees on future production.
</P>
<P>
   But no restructuring of Social Security, no privatization or
other type of reform, will do the trick unless the economy is
prosperous _ unless taxpayers have jobs, corporations can pay
dividends, borrowers can meet their interest payments when due, and
the capital markets are buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   The people who miss the whole point worry that the Social
Security trust fund will be depleted before most of the baby
boomers can claim their rightful share. Yes, if that dread moment
were ever to arrive, the collateral held to secure the promise of
Social Security would no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean society would necessarily let its senior
citizens starve; it means only that their needs could not be met by
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Even if reform assured the existence of some form of collateral
for retirement benefits in the years ahead, the existence of that
collateral is still no guarantee that society will be able to
provide senior citizens with the wherewithal to pay for their
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for the sake of argument, that we did reform Social
Security. Suppose, too, that the economy of 2010 cannot produce
enough to satisfy the needs of both those who are employed and the
larger number who are retired.
</P>
<P>
   If the collateral of the retirees _ the value of the securities
they own _ is large, the retiree claim will be excessive and the
working people will see their living standards decline.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting social tension will push the working group to
insist upon their rightful share. Wages will escalate, either
causing inflation or disrupting the reliable flow of interest and
dividends and the vibrant market on which asset liquidation
depends. Then the purchasing power of the retirees' collateral will
be much less than today's expectations seem to promise.
</P>
<P>
   The financial arrangements are not the solution. They are part
of the problem. The solution is in economic prosperity over the
long run. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Note that every one of those sources depends in turn on payments
from somewhere else. For example, the government will not mail
welfare benefits or pay the interest on its bonds unless citizens
pay their taxes or buy the bonds issued to cover budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend payments on equities won't be forthcoming unless
corporations can find a market for their output. The accumulated
assets cannot be liquidated if there are no buyers for those
assets.
</P>
<P>
   This illuminates the true function of retirement funds. A
retirement fund owns stocks and bonds and other investments but
cannot itself finance the spending of the retirees unless the fund
has money in the bank first.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, no matter how much shares of stock and no matter
how many bonds the fund owns, no pensions can be paid unless the
bonds and stocks are paying an income or unless the market is
receptive to buying the investments the fund chooses to liquidate.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, then, retirement benefits are financed from outside
the fund rather than by the fund itself. Retirement funds are
merely conduits; they determine who gets what, not how much is
available _ which means that the true function of the assets in
these funds is to serve as collateral to secure the claims of
future retirees on future production.
</P>
<P>
   But no restructuring of Social Security, no privatization or
other type of reform, will do the trick unless the economy is
prosperous _ unless taxpayers have jobs, corporations can pay
dividends, borrowers can meet their interest payments when due, and
the capital markets are buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   The people who miss the whole point worry that the Social
Security trust fund will be depleted before most of the baby
boomers can claim their rightful share. Yes, if that dread moment
were ever to arrive, the collateral held to secure the promise of
Social Security would no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean society would necessarily let its senior
citizens starve; it means only that their needs could not be met by
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Even if reform assured the existence of some form of collateral
for retirement benefits in the years ahead, the existence of that
collateral is still no guarantee that society will be able to
provide senior citizens with the wherewithal to pay for their
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for the sake of argument, that we did reform Social
Security. Suppose, too, that the economy of 2010 cannot produce
enough to satisfy the needs of both those who are employed and the
larger number who are retired.
</P>
<P>
   If the collateral of the retirees _ the value of the securities
they own _ is large, the retiree claim will be excessive and the
working people will see their living standards decline.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting social tension will push the working group to
insist upon their rightful share. Wages will escalate, either
causing inflation or disrupting the reliable flow of interest and
dividends and the vibrant market on which asset liquidation
depends. Then the purchasing power of the retirees' collateral will
be much less than today's expectations seem to promise.
</P>
<P>
   The financial arrangements are not the solution. They are part
of the problem. The solution is in economic prosperity over the
long run. &QL;

<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

   What a great time to be selling a house. Buyers are manic over
low interest rates. The new tax law lets sellers pocket up to
$500,000 in tax-free gains.
</P>
<P>
   But you're hardly the only seller on the block, so your chalet
could probably use, say, a grand's worth of attention. You'll
recoup the investment many times over when your house sells faster,
at the price it's really worth.
</P>
<P>
   Have a trusted friend walk through the property and point out
everything that's wrong, says Diane Shrewsberry, a real-estate
agent with Coldwell Banker.
</P>
<P>
   It'll hurt, but it's important, because you've stopped noticing
the tear in the screen, the lock that sticks, and the, uh, aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Take a walk yourself through a few builders' models, then steal
ideas, says Michael Holigan, host of the television series ``Your
New House.'' If white interiors are the rage now and you've got
busy wallpaper, start painting.
</P>
<P>
   Many buyers drive up to a house then refuse to go in because
something minor about the exterior turns them off, says
Shrewsberry.
</P>
<P>
   A new mailbox is an inexpensive way to make a good first
impression. So is a new welcome mat or even a new front door (or a
coat of paint on the old one.)
</P>
<P>
   Some more tips:
</P>
<P>
   Unclog the driveway. If your cars don't fit in the garage, park
in the street, says Ralph Roberts of Ralph R. Roberts Real Estate
in Detroit, Mich. Keep the garage door closed and trash cans out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape. Plant whatever should be blossoming that time of
year, says Daryl Jesperson, president of RE/MAX International in
Denver, Colo. De-landscape, too: Overgrown trees make a house look
small; overgrown bushes block light.
</P>
<P>
   For indoor improvements, concentrate on the kitchen and master
bath, ``where people picture they'll spend most of their time,''
says Holigan. Essential: Wallpaper bathrooms. Re-caulk around tubs
(yellow caulk shows sales). Hang new shower-curtain liners.
</P>
<P>
   Think bright. Install higher-watt bulbs in low-light areas, like
closets. Make sure every single bulb in the house works. ``It's
quite a blooper when the lights don't come on,'' says Holigan.
</P>
<P>
   Simplify. Clear kitchen counters. De-junk closets, drawers and
medicine cabinets. If the space doesn't look big enough for your
stuff, it won't look big enough for theirs, says Jesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rely on a realtor to provide info on schools in your area,
says Holigan. Leave information packets from local schools on your
kitchen counter, with your name, address, and phone number on top.
</P>
<P>
   Create a packet about your house, too, says Roberts. Have a
mortgage broker write out the cost of buying your home with various
percentages down. A buyer who might have considered the place too
expensive could realize that it is within range.
</P>
<P>
   By including the amounts of your monthly tax and utility bills,
you'll make buyers suspicious of homeowners who don't.
</P>
<P>
   A final caution: Once you've restored the house to its original
glory, be prepared to start wondering why you're moving out in the
first place. &QL;

offering the following articles for sale. Please contact us for
availability your country. Best regards, Karl Horwitz
</P>
<P>
   1. TALKING 'BOUT THEIR GENERATION In this exclusive interview,
rock child Sean Lennon and his girlfriend Yuka Honda (of the group
Cio Matto,) talk about his parents (John Lennon and Yoko Ono) and
their legacy, their own music, their latest release, ``Into The
Sun,'' and their Asian heritage. By Jim Cho. From A Magazine :
Inside Asian America. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
NATASHA RICHARDSON : ESCAPING THE STARDOM TRAP Fresh from her Best
Actress Tony Award for ``Cabaret,'' Natasha Richardson will star as
the mother in Disney's remake of ``The Parent Trap.'' The actress
is hotter than ever, despite having resolved not to fret about
career considerations. In this interview she talks about her roles,
her marriage to Liam Neeson and the challenges of growing up as the
daughter of the controversial Vanessa Redgrage. By Jeanne Wolf.
1,400 words + photo. (N/A England.)
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
CHRISTINA APPLEGATE IS LOOKING FOR A 'MAFIA' HIT As boy-crazy Kelly
Bundy on the TV series ``Married ... With Children,'' Christina
Applegate, 26, won many fans - as well as an image as a trashy,
empty-headed beauty. She has been busy trying to change that image.
In this interview she talks about her two newest projects : In
``Mafia,'' a spoof of gangster movies, she plays a Mafia girlfriend
who becomes president of the United States. In the autumn she will
return to television playing a single mother in the sitcom
``Jesse.'' By Jeanne Wolf. 1,400 words + photo. (N/A England.)
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
THE DANCING ANDROID A legless virtual android called Adonis has
been taught to ``dance'' the macarena as a first step in a project
designed to help robots learn by imitation. By Mark Ward. From New
Scientist magazine. 1,000 words. (N/A Australia, New Zealand,
Brazil.)
_______________________________________________________________ 5.
LAVINIA CURRIER : THE DEBUTANTE Even with wealth and connections,
it was no easy task for Lavinia Currier to produce her first
full-length film, ``Passion in the Desert,'' (based on a short
story by Balzac about a Napoleonic army officer lost in the Sahara
and his encounter with a leopard.) ``It was an odyssey,'' she says
about the five-year-long gestation of the film. In addition to the
difficult desert environment in Jordan where the movie was filmed,
the real challenge was presented by the film's central character -
a leopard. (Of all big cats, the leopard is the least predictable
and most deadly.) Interview by James Reginato. From W magazine.
1,700 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
SWEDISH DISH Swedish actress Lena Olin may have worked with Ingmar
Bergman while still a teenager, but in American films she tends to
play every nationality but her own. She was a Czech artist in''The
Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' an Eastern European in ``Enemies :
A Love Story,'' and a Russian assassin in ``Romeo Is Bleeding.''
This month she is at the centre of the romantic comedy ``Polish
Wedding,'' playing the proud but poor, vibrant matriarch of a
Polish family in Detroit. Olin, who doesn't make a movie unless
she's inspired, says this role was too good to turn down. By Joshua
Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
SAMUEL L. JACKSON : NEGOTIATIONS ARE HEATING UP In ``The
Negotiator,'' Samuel L. Jackson enjoys arguably the biggest role of
his career. It is the latest step forward for a man who began as a
promising young black actor but now, at 49, ranks with America's
finest actors of any colour. Jackson talks about the new movie, his
penchant for adopting a different ``look'' for each role, how he's
stayed off drugs and alcohol after nearly losing his life to
addiction a decade ago and why he'd like to produce and/or star in
a 'thinking man's slasher movie.' By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words +
photo
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
ADAM BEACH : 'SIGNALS OF RESPECT' There may be very few major
actors of Native American descent, but Adam Beach, 25, is
determined to change that. His film ``Smoke Signals'' has become an
unexpected art-house hit. It was written, produced and directed by
Native Americans and may be his ticket to the top. Beach talks
about the movie, his difficult youth after the deaths of his
parents in tragic accidents, his struggle to be authentically
Native American, without defining himself exclusively as Native
American, and why he thinks the film speaks to whites as well. By
Ian Spelling. 1,300 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
ANGELA BASSET Onscreen, whether in ``Malcolm X,'' or ``Boyz 'N the
Hood,'' actress Angela Bassett is always larger than life. In ``How
Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' she finds a softer edge. Based on
Terry McMillan's sexy bestseller, the film is about a successful
woman's Jamaica vacation romp with a younger man. Interview by
Louise Farr. From W magazine. 1,500 words + photos.

 &HT;    A beach-lover's guide to shells
 &HT;    By Gayle Pallesen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANIBEL, Fla. _ Still rosy with sleep, the sun emerges from warm
gulf waters and begins a lethargic ascent. Hunched over, eyes glued
downward, waves licking my ankles, I am ready. It's not yet 6:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   I temporarily shove aside the words of author Anne Morrow
Lindbergh: ``The sea does not reward those who are too anxious, too
greedy, or too impatient.'' I want to be first. I want to pick up
what treasures the sea has sprinkled along the shoreline during the
night. I am a shell hunter and, for me, the hunt has begun.
</P>
<P>
   What better place than an island with more than 20 miles of
beaches and 300 species of shells? Sanibel Island is rated by some
as the third-best shelling place in the world, outranked only by
Australia's Great Barrier Reef and the Philippine islands.
</P>
<P>
   My toes grasp something sharp. I reach into calf-deep water and
pick up a fighting conch. Too many barnacles. Dull finish. I toss
it back. ``Patience, patience, patience, is what the sea teaches,''
Lindbergh's words echo. Before long, I step on another sharp shell.
This one's a keeper: a shiny chocolate brown fighting conch.
Dropping it into my mesh drawstring bag, I begin walking the
shell-laced shoreline in search of lightning whelks and lace murex.
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet 7 a.m. and I still virtually have the beach to
myself. I stoop to pick up a moon shell when, from behind, I hear
the sound of footsteps crunching shells. A young Wisconsin couple,
plastic grocery sack in hand, rapidly pass by. They, too, want to
be first to pick through the night sea's offerings. About 30 feet
in front of me, they slow down and resume the ``Sanibel stoop,'' a
term describing hunched-over shellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience and faith. One should lie, empty, open, choiceless as
a beach _ waiting for a gift from the sea.'' Bunk. Maybe that
worked for Lindbergh, but not here on Sanibel, where there must be
more shellers per square inch than any place on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of white ibis dine at surf's edge. I walk a little faster
while scouring a blanket of miniature and broken shells.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged beanpole from North Carolina with knee-dirty tight
jeans, a ball cap and bifocals easily out-paces me. I stop him to
admire the specimens in his net. Where else but Sanibel would I
stop a stranger in tight jeans and ask to examine his banded tulip?
</P>
<P>
   By 7:45 a.m., I compare bags with an older couple from Colorado.
Theirs isn't nearly as full. I tell them they need to be out at
sunrise to find more keepers. ``Now that's a good trick,'' says the
appreciative fellow with the gray mustache.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is here on this Gulf of Mexico island that lies
off the coast of southwest Florida. Everything evolves around
shells, from pre-breakfast conversations to the city seal featuring
a fighting conch. Shells rule.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the island's streets are named after shells. Off the
main thoroughfare of Periwinkle, you'll find Tulip, Paper Fig,
Golden Olive and Pen Shell Lane. Condominiums and motels carry on
the theme with names such as Junonia of Sanibel and King's Crown.
The plastic grocery bags at Bailey's General Store have a shell
identification chart. Guides and shops are plentiful. I didn't spot
a Shell gas station, but there must be one.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons the shelling is so good on Sanibel.
</P>
<P>
   Aligned in an east-west direction, the island's boomerang shape
snags many of the shells that generally move northward. Because
there are no offshore reefs, the sandy bottom allows shells to roll
ashore intact. The warm water is conducive to colorful shells.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to scour the beaches is the winter months, because
northeasters tend to blow in lots of shells. Storms always produce
good shelling. Locals say El Nino-related storms this past winter
produced some of the best shelling in years.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let their, ``You should have been here . . . '' line
get to you. I found a good array of shells during five days in
June. I went out at sunrise and again at low tide.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I didn't find a prized junonia, but then only one in 1,000
shellers finds one of the 4-inch brown-spotted beauties. I read
somewhere you make the local paper if you find one. It took one
local guide 17 years to find a junonia. I bought one. They run
between $10-$30.
</P>
<P>
   One day, I spent $45 to hire a shelling guide for four hours.
Julie Matthews, a delightful third-generation boat captain, took me
to North Captiva, an island accessible only by boat. Dolphins
bobbed in bay waters on our way there. Otters scattered across the
beach as our boat approached.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the windswept look of uprooted horizontal trees
weathered by salt air and sun. I loved walking the beach and the
early morning isolation. The only thing missing were shells. The
night before, the sea decided to deliver its treasures elsewhere.
That's the way it is. The next day, or the day after that, the same
beach might have been loaded.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned the sea is a fickle sort. Some nights, she turns
the shoreline into a display case for her finest jewels. Other
nights, she just puts out the trash: A dive boot. A tennis ball. A
plastic bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hanley, owner of Neptune's Treasures and an island expert on
shells, says it's like finding 50 cents in a parking lot: being in
the right spot at the right time. Hanley should know. He is the
owner of what he says is the world's largest horse conch, 24 1/2
inches, on display in his shop.
</P>
<P>
   Without any coaching, Hanley pulls out a photo album. There he
is, age 10, shelling on Sanibel in 1944. Beside him is a woman in a
flowing dress collecting shells in a basket. ``In the '40s, you
could shell all day and not see anyone,'' Hanley reminisces.
``Today, you see a shell and you bump heads with someone else going
to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't fewer shells. There are more people going for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   Take State Road 80 west to Interstate 75 just east of Fort
Myers. Go south on I-75 to Daniels Parkway exit, and west to
Summerlin Road. Turn left and stay on Summerlin (which becomes
McGregor Boulevard) until you reach the causeway for Sanibel.
</P>
<P>
   There is a $3 bridge toll.

 &HT;    How to be a successful Sanibel sheller
 &HT;    By Gayle Pallesen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Be aware of a Sanibel law banning the collection of any live
shells on the island. The rest of Lee County allows two live shells
per species per person per day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sample several gulf-side beaches. Good spots include: Turner's
Beach at Blind Pass, which separates Sanibel and Captiva. It's a
popular stretch and scallops are usually in abundance. Bowman's
Beach is known for sand dollars and skinny dippers. Lighthouse
Point is where you sometimes find starfish. All have public access,
restrooms and parking (75 cents an hour).
</P>
<P>
   _ Smother yourself with waterproof sun block, SPF 15 or higher,
particularly your back side. If no-see- ums are out, also use
insect repellent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wear sunglasses and a hat. In addition to shielding the sun,
the hat keeps hair from falling in your face while bent over.
Sunglasses remove glare both on the water and on wet glittering
stretches of shells, making it easier to spot shells worth picking
up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carry a mesh, draw-string bag and a short-handled scoop net.
Both can be purchased at dive, fishing or shell shops. Plastic bags
are not very good for shell collecting because they retain water
and sand, which adds weight and contributes to breakage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Study the tide charts. Low tide is considered by most the best
time to shell since the surf has receded and left behind a new
batch of exposed shells. No matter the tide, sunrise is always a
good time to check out what washed ashore during the night before
dozens of others follow in your footsteps. After a storm,
particularly a winter northeaster, is an ideal time to search for
shells.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use your toes as well as your eyes. Walking in calf-deep or
shallower water is a good way to feel larger shells. Unbroken
fighting conchs and lightning whelks can be found this way. There
is a risk, however, with bare feet in the water: sharp shells can
cut feet and sting rays like the warm, shallow gulf waters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for ledges in the water near shore, places that dip down
where shells have lodged in their trek to wash ashore. A scoop net
comes in handy here since often it's hard to see individual shells.
This a good way to collect miniatures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't get discouraged if one day you don't find many keepers.
The same stretch the next day may produce a windfall.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO CLEAN SHELLS
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash in fresh water to remove sand and algae.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spread out to dry, but don't put shells directly in the sun
for any length of time because the sun fades the colors. Once dry,
shake out the excess sand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shells with furry coats of algae or stains will need to soak
overnight in a mild solution of bleach and water (a cup of bleach
to a gallon of water). If you are in a hurry, use a stronger
solution for a shorter time. Sand dollars also bleach white in the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a stiff-bristled brush to remove stubborn algae coating. A
firm toothbrush works well on smaller shells. For removing
barnacles, use a metal dental pick, which can be purchased at shell
shops.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once shells are clean, you can restore them to their original
luster with either a clear spray available at shell shops or a
mixture of baby oil or mineral oil and lighter fluid. One book
recommends seven parts lighter fluid to one part oil. Another
source suggests a half and half blend.

 &HT;    To Zoila Lopez, faith in Cuba less important than faith in God
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Zoila Lopez put her faith in the Cuban revolution for
38 years. She cut cane during sugar harvests. She donated blood for
Cuba's internationalist soldiers. She dutifully taught her son that
God didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Her allegiance was rewarded by membership in the PCC, the Cuban
Communist Party, an honor reserved for the revolutionary vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Then the former teacher and bookkeeper found God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I belong to the really eternal party,'' said Lopez, 54, a
dark-eyed woman with tinted red hair and a lean face wrinkled from
years of sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found the party of the father, Christ and the lamb of
God,'' she said in Spanish, spelling out the communist party's PCC
acronym with Christian terms.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez told her story as she sat in the pews of a Methodist
Church in the Havana suburb of Playa, a former middle-class
neighborhood now part of the proletarian urban landscape. Two years
ago, Lopez walked into the church at the invitation of a friend.
When she heeded a call from the pulpit asking non-believers to walk
to the altar rail, her life changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all my life I was taught materialism, ideology and
Darwin's theory of creation,'' she said. ``Now my eyes are open to
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times a week, Lopez rides her bicycle or takes a bus to
the church from her home 30 minutes away in Jaimanitas. She says
her son, 30, calls her a ``robot'' and ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   After her conversion, Lopez carried her Bible to her job at the
Ministry of the Interior and preached to whomever passed by,
including colonels in the state security apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party has accepted Christians as party members
since 1991, but on-the-job preaching crossed the line. Lopez was
sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said she resigned from the party last month because she
did not want to be part of an organization opposed to the preaching
of the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   She uses a Biblical story to draw parallels to next year's 40th
anniversary of the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro. She points
out that the children of Israel were lost in the wilderness for 40
years before they were led to the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's just an idea,'' she said, with a wink. ``But
40 years is a perfect number in the Bible.''

 &HT;    A life full of joy
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ The first time he finished his leg of the
boy's 200-yard freestyle relay, she cried. But, of course, Terri
Harmon cries at ``the first everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time some kid unknowingly hurt his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The first time a doctor told her he was not quite right.
</P>
<P>
   But that was 10 years ago, my goodness, she can hardly believe
it. And today, when a young mother, maybe even a woman who's
pregnant with a Down syndrome baby, calls to inquire about this or
that, she cannot wait to tell them the absolute, positive truth:
</P>
<P>
   Frank is fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   And she cried once, and only once, about Frank's wacky
chromosomal count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything else has been tears of joy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank has had just pretty much a regular life,'' says Harmon.
``We started that right from the beginning. All these things,
they're not easy. But they just seem like the next thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not easy? You can say that again. Like on the day Boca Raton
YMCA swim team coach Andra Pobat read the names for the 200-yard
freestyle relay _ Jonathan, Khary, A.J., Frank, Andra called out _
and Terri Harmon stood there entertaining a very worthwhile
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Is Coach Andra nuts?
</P>
<P>
   Frank on a relay team? All the other sports they had done had
been individual things, so Frank could compete at his own pace.
Bowling. Gymnastics. She thought swimming would, again, be an
individual thing. But Coach Andra was standing there, telling her
and all the other kids that Frank was going to compete as a team
member. He was going to swim the relay.
</P>
<P>
   And Frank might be fabulous, but he's not exactly fast.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Harmon stood there, mind whirling as it always does,
expecting the kids to roll their eyes. She waited for them to hem
and haw about how slow Frank was and how they'd never, ever win an
event if he was on their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never said a peep,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And here's why:
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make any difference,'' says teammate Khary Llewellyn
``I knew he'd be all right.'' _ _
</P>
<P>
   It's a Saturday, competition day, and it's at least a million
degrees in the shade, but Frank is calm and cool as he sits,
poolside, in his strappy blue-and-white lawn chair. He's so
relaxed, you'd think he was on a cruise.
</P>
<P>
   There are 120 wet children roaming around the Boca Raton YMCA
swimming pool, whining and wondering when is it their turn to swim,
when can they have a snack, but Frank is scarfing down his Corn
Pops and chugging from the 1-quart bottle of Zephyrhills water as
if to say, Guys, this is the life.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is.
</P>
<P>
   And when it's Frank's turn to take the starting block, he
strolls over to where he should be and dives into the water when
the starting whistle goes off, and he swims and he kicks. And about
half way through the race you think, oh, geez, he's going to stop,
he's going to flip from freestyle to backstroke, he's going to
stand up and wave to the crowd, he's going to drown himself hanging
on the lane line.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank does none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   What he does do, however, is come in dead last, but that makes
it easier for everyone to give Frank the full attention he
deserves. The crowd cheers and yells, and the sounds echo in the
Boca YMCA's fancy indoor-outdoor swimming pool arena, and Frank is
smiling as he kicks and breathes and kicks and breathes. He
finishes 14 seconds behind everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Then he climbs out of the water, sits down in the lawn chair and
has himself a few more chugs of that Zephyrhills and another box of
cereal, this time Honey Nut Cheerios, as his little brother
Matthew, 7, orbits around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our boys work hard,'' says their father, Scott. ``That's all
we can ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The following would be Frank Harmon's favorite day.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast at McDonalds, pancakes, probably, then maybe a little
television, but only if Arthur was playing on PBS. Then he and Dad
would vamoose into the yard, where they'd fiddle around with the
lawn mower and then fiddle around with the car. Frank has his own
toolbox. And then afterward, cheeseburgers for dinner and an Arthur
story at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you be the one to tell his mother that Frank's life is not
filled with joy.
</P>
<P>
   And the other day, after the photographer had shown up at the
swim meet and after the reporter had tried to make a quick friend
out of Frank, Terri Harmon and her first-born son were driving to
Publix. Harmon was curious. Just how much of this newspaper-story
thing did Frank understand?
</P>
<P>
   Who was that photographer taking pictures of? she asked Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Me, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that reporter, his mother asked, who was she interviewing?
</P>
<P>
   Me, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, Frank, why do you think a reporter and a photographer would
want to come and do a story on you?
</P>
<P>
   Because I'm the best swimmer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's The Fabulous Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Harmon is president of the Gold Coast Down Syndrome
Organization Inc. For information about the group, or its 5K walk
this fall, call (561) 451-2163.

 &HT;    Firefighting measures on hand at Port of Palm Beach
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In January, the Port of Palm Beach went
through a situation similar to the July 20th emergency aboard the
Ecstasy cruise ship. Fortunately, it was only a practice run.
</P>
<P>
   But in the event one of the port's three cruise ships catches
fire after leaving port, the U.S. Coast Guard has two boats with
fire pumps at its Lake Worth Inlet Station, Petty Officer Andrew
Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   The pumps take water from the sea through the boat's fire system
and shoot water on the vessel in distress, Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's enough to fight a particular fire depends on the
size of the ship, the extent and kind of fire, and where it is on
the ship, he said. Ships also must adhere to international and
Coast Guard rules about fire safety, according to Bill Nurthen,
chief executive officer of Contessa International Cruise Line Inc.
These rules, Nurthen said, include:
</P>
<P>
   Fire retardant materials must be used in a ship's construction.
</P>
<P>
   Fire fighting equipment, including hoses, extinguishers, fire
doors, sprinkler systems and signs pointing to the equipment must
be in place.
</P>
<P>
   Crews must be trained to isolate and combat a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continually drilling on board with lifeboat drills and
fire drills,'' said John Thomas, president of Palm Beach Casino
Lines, which operates the Palm Beach Princess. Coast Guard
inspections are conducted annually and quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire at sea is one of the things every mariner is very
concerned about,'' Nurthen said. The regulations ``are stringent
for a purpose _ and we're glad they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Contessa and Palm Beach Princess both sail under the Panamanian
flag, but they still must adhere to the same safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're calling on our port, carrying our citizens and not
meeting our standards, we can enforce it,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr.
Michael Lapinski in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a fire while the ship's still in port, the
Riviera Beach fire department would handle fire and rescue, Deputy
Port Director Martin Mets said. The port is equipped with fire
hydrants, sea water hydrants and fire extinguishers.
</P>
<P>
   And, Mets added, ``The first line of defense is the ship's
crew.''

   National health database scary
</P>
<P>
   By Rowland Nethaway
</P>
<P>
   c: 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Before his arrest and conviction for the murder of
168 of his fellow citizens in Oklahoma City, Timothy McVeigh used
to hang with a group of delusional friends who convinced themselves
that the American government was the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh and his fellow anti-government conspirators believed
that the government was building a national database so it could
track every citizen.
</P>
<P>
   America's deadliest terrorist even believed that a tiny chip
encoded with his personal data had been implanted in one of his
buttocks before he was discharged from the Army.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded paranoid and goofy, but not long ago Pentagon
officials talked about replacing dog tags with tiny chips encoded
personal data under the skin of service personnel. The data chip
could speed up the identification troops killed in action and help
doctors treat wounded soldiers and sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Something like a portable bar-code reader could retrieve a
soldier's name, rank, serial number, medical history, religious
affiliation, next of kin and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Now we learn that the Clinton administration has given its
blessing to two-year-old congressional proposal to have the
government create a central database that will gather, track and
store cradle-to-grave medical histories on every American.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
included the ``unique health identifier'' proposal. The Department
of Health and Human Services was instructed to create a coding
system for employers, insurance companies, health-care providers
and ultimately individuals. The goal is to cut administrative costs
by simplifying billing and paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Two days of public hearings on this proposal concluded recently
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of sounding like an anti-government conspiracy nut,
I don't like the idea of the government gathering up my complete
medical history and then patting me on the head and telling me I
don't have anything to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   A national databank with the health and billing history of every
American should simplify record keeping and assist health-care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans should be wary of government promises that it will
keep all personal medical information private.
</P>
<P>
   The government couldn't even keep the secrets of the atomic bomb
out of enemy hands. And every few weeks some 14-year-old who
successfully hacks his way into an impenetrable computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration first proposed giving every American
a health I.D. number back in 1993. Now Health and Human Services
officials are considering the use of Social Security numbers for
the national health I.D. numbers. They also propose giving police
and medical researchers access to private medical histories.
</P>
<P>
   Access to Social Security numbers already is out of control.
Employers, insurance companies and even local bowling leagues have
a list of Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies already track the purchasing and financial
histories of Americans. Some companies tie that information with
government data available on individual citizens. A person's
personal medical history added to that mix would destroy the
concept of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike anti-government conspirators, I trust government
officials who say they only want to help. From experience, however,
I also trust that the government will somehow screw it up. I don't
want my medical history to appear on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more secure to encode medical histories on tiny
chips implanted under the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than choose between a Franz Kafka nightmare and the
``X-Files,'' it would be better to just improve the current system.

 &HT;    Tugboats 'main line of defense' in ship fires
 &HT;    By Michael Utley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tugboats that fought a scorching fire on July 20 aboard a
Carnival cruise ship off Miami Beach are part of a critical safety
net at Florida's major ports.
</P>
<P>
   Tugs normally spend their days pushing and pulling massive ships
through narrow port channels, nudging them ever so gently into
tight berthing slips. But when fire strikes, these same nondescript
tugboats are expected to arm their water cannons with sea water and
blast the flames into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the main line of defense in the event of a fire like
that,'' said Jack O'Connell, a vice president with Fort
Lauderdale-based Hvide Marine Inc., which operates tugboats at
several major ports, including Port Everglades, Port Canaveral and
the Port of Tampa. ``If something happens at sea, the tugboats are
really all you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 tugboat operators in Florida. They are paid by the
ship owners who use their services, based on an hourly or job rate.
</P>
<P>
   All tug operators are licensed by the U.S. Coast Guard, but not
all boats have firefighting capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The two tugboats at the Port of Palm Beach, for instance, do not
have high-powered water cannons. But the Coast Guard has two boats
there with firefighting capabilities. And in an emergency,
officials can bring in tugs from Fort Lauderdale, said Deputy Port
Director Martin Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful tugboats, like those operated by Hvide, can
use their cannons to kill a fire with 17,000 gallons of water a
minute. The water is sucked from the sea and pressurized.
</P>
<P>
   The cannons also can be filled with foam to contain a fuel spill
or smother a gasoline fire.
</P>
<P>
   At the Port of Miami, the tugboats that fought Monday's fire are
operated by Coastal Tug &AMP; Barge. Company officials were not
available for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their firefighting capabilities are critical to upholding the
safety standards at Florida ports,'' said Nancy Leikauf, a vice
president with the Florida Ports Council in Tallahassee.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Need a bite? Feed the facts into Web site 
By Elizabeth Lee  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day, ordering dinner over the Internet may be easier than
phoning the pizza joint down the street.
</P>
<P>
   That day is not here yet. Even Tim Glass, president of the
Internet dining service Cybermeals, will admit that.
</P>
<P>
   But he believes it's coming.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Seattle-based Cybermeals allows Atlanta computer users
to place takeout or delivery orders for 200metro Atlanta
restaurants. Its roster includes Mellow Mushroom, Mick's and
Takeout Taxi. In the next week, it will add Buckhead Gourmet
Delivery, which serves 65 restaurants from Alpharetta to
Virginia-Highland. Coming soon: Papa John's Pizza and A&AMP;P delis.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, it has signed up 20,000 restaurants and struck
marketing alliances with some big names on the Net, including
America Online, Yahoo! and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Diners register their addresses at the site
and indicate whether they want delivery or takeout. Mapping
software determines which restaurants are nearby and provides a
list of choices, with menus. Orders can be placed immediately or
saved for repeat use.
</P>
<P>
   Once an order is placed, the site sends it to the restaurant by
fax, computer-voiced phone call or computer-to-computer link. The
customer receives an e-mail confirming the order.
</P>
<P>
   To be listed on the site, restaurants pay a fee or a cut of the
sales, generally 5 percent to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ordering sounds time-consuming, and it can be, depending on
Internet traffic and use of the site itself. When The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution tried the site two months ago, the ordering
process took 25 minutes. More recently, a lunch order for three
took 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants that have signed up with the service say they want
access to a new market. So far, though, reviews are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely still a work in progress, but it seems to be
getting better and better and better,'' says Karen Jacobson of the
Peasant Restaurant Group, owner of the Mick's chain.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty's Barbecue, near Emory University(Ga.), reports only a few
Cybermeals orders so far. ``It's something that's going to take
awhile to catch on,'' says owner Linda Thompson. ``It's not costing
us very much, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckhead Gourmet, which delivers from such restaurants as
Romano's Macaroni Grill, Tanner's and Tom Tom, is counting on
corporate catering to bring in online business. Owner Harris
Tessler isn't sure about other users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to order online is possibly the wave of the
future,'' Tessler says. ``You almost want to talk to a human being
when you place an order, you want to know how it'll be prepared.
... That's the downside of it. The upside of it is, you don't have
to talk to humans.''
</P>
<P>
   You also don't have to take your hands off the keyboard if
you're at work or log off the computer to use the phone if you're
at home. In fact, that's how Glass, who was casting about for an
Internet business, came up with the idea for Cybermeals.
</P>
<P>
   He was watching a Sandra Bullock movie, ``The Net.'' When
Bullock's character ordered a pizza through her computer,
inspiration struck. A business was born.
</P>
<P>
   While Cybermeals works to add restaurants _ 100,000 is the
national target _ and improve its software, it waits for the
convergence of TV and the Internet. When that happens, ordering
online will be as easy as hitting the clicker, Glass believes _ or
thumbing through the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that we're early,'' he says. ``It's starting to
become more useful for people.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Picture this: Web cams proliferating 
By Jim DeBrosse and Tim Tresslar  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Homer Ramby credits the ``WayneCam'' with an
extra big turnout for this year's Wayne Twp. Volunteer Fire
Department Fish Fry.
</P>
<P>
   The camera, perched atop a telephone pole at Miami and Main
streets a block from the firehouse, uploads an image of downtown
Waynesville onto the Internet every 20 minutes, where it can be
seen by anyone sitting at a computer from Switzerland to Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good publicity,'' said Ramby, a 57-year-old volunteer
firefighter who set up the cam site
(www.interaxs.net/pub/wtfd/livecam.htm) in August. ``You can check
24 hours a day and see what downtown Waynesville looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   If that prospect doesn't thrill you, then try the late-night
scene at the Walnut Hills Bar on Dayton's Brown Street
(www.walnuthills.com), where patrons may be sampling one of the
tavern's 100 brews or listening to alternative rock music. ``It
feels like you're in the bar, and that's the idea,'' said co-owner
Dennis Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   From small towns to hip urban watering holes, web cam sites are
proliferating on the Internet faster than the most voracious
cyberspace voyeurs can double-click. Communities, businesses and
not-so-private people are linking camera views to computers with
the aim of promoting, advertising or, in some cases, exposing
themselves for 15-megabytes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ringley, whose Jennicam page (www.jennicam.org) is the
best-known of all the web cam sites, lures half a million viewers a
week who are either bored, or lurid, enough to watch her putter
about her Washington, D.C., apartment and occasionally step out of
her shower undressed.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of web cam sites capturing everything from
building construction (like Wright State University's new academic
building at www.media.wright.edu/raidercam.html) to live births,
from toilet stalls (don't ask) to college dorm rooms, from mundane
business offices to dramatic water falls
(www.fallsview.com/falls.html).
</P>
<P>
   What's perhaps more amazing is that so many techno-peepers are
tuning into so little, said Bryan Pfaffenberger, an Internet
historian at the University of Virginia and author of Protect Your
Privacy on the Internet (John Wiley, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the whole web cam site phenomenon puts its finger on
some sort of need that computer users have to extend their
perceptions to far-away locales _ even if what they see is
completely boring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a trend that's certain to accelerate as the price of
cameras continues to tumble and software becomes even easier to
install, experts say. Two years ago, the equipment and software for
a web cam site cost as much as $5,000. Today, you can set up a site
for less than $200. The smallest cameras, some as cheap as $50, are
now about the size of colored markers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cameras are only going to get smaller and cheaper. I think
every kid is going to get one _ and sneak it into his big sister's
room,'' quipped Jim Sterne of Target Marketing, an Internet
marketing consultant firm based in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   At the Walnut Hills Bar in Dayton, which launched its web site
two weeks ago, a sign is going up to warn patrons that their suds
sipping and socializing may be viewed 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as my parents aren't surfing the Net, it's fine with
me,'' said Greg Cassimatis, a 23-year-old regular who often shares
a table in full view of the bar's web cam.
</P>
<P>
   The candid shots at Walnut Hills, which change every two
minutes, are part of a new web page that includes a menu, a jukebox
list, a beer page, a chat room, links to The Grateful Dead websites
and a Dear Abby knock-off authored by bartender Mike Altomare,
dubbed ``Ask Big Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Walnut Hills Bar has alway been a pretty hip place, and
this is hip,'' Stewart said. ``This crowd is into computers,
tattoos and alternative music.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart admits he still doesn't know what purpose is served by
turning his barroom into a fishbowl, but he's fascinated by the
creative possibilities. ``We're kids playing, is what we are,'' he
said. ``We're just having fun with it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Waynesville, where town officials tend to be very
serious about their WayneCam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are curious about Waynesville,'' said Village
Manager Kevin Harper. ``We have a reputation for being the antiques
capital of the world, and I think people like to get on our website
and see what they're getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   During the town's annual Sauerkraut Festival, an extra cam is
mounted atop the Sauerkraut Ball trailer, alternating views every
10 minutes with the WayneCam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to be hundreds of miles away and be able to see
hundreds of thousands of people having a good time,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a publicity tool, Sterne says, web cam sites are only as
effective as the advertising and Internet search engines that
promote them. Otherwise, he says, it's like having an unlisted
phone number in the Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing that, if you build it, they will come,''
he said. ``You have to tell people (your web site) is there.''
</P>
<P>
   It might also help to give viewers something to watch. The
WayneCam, for instance, shows a two- or three- block stretch of
Main Street, where only the cars and ant-like pedestrians change
every 20 minutes. To protect privacy, the camera is far enough away
that faces and car licenses can't be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Boring? Maybe, but Ramby says the site has had more than 28,000
``hits'' from computer users in 39 countries, including Switzerland
and Germany. ``We had one person say it looked like such a nice
town they were thinking about moving here because of the cam,''
Ramby said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Ely, a spokeswoman for Wright State University, wasn't
sure why anyone would want to watch the web cam trained on
construction of the school's new academic building. ``We never
looked at this thing until you called,'' she said. ``Who would want
to watch them construct a building?''
</P>
<P>
   But then she and her staff discovered a movie at the same web
site (www.media.wright.edu/sitecam/movies/crane2.mov) that records
a crane accident at the building site. ``Then we were all in there
watching the crane fall over _ and over and over and over,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaffenberger said Wright State may have the makings of a
world-class web cam site. ``You really start to get a lot of hits
on your site, it seems, if it's especially and exquisitely
pointless,'' he said.

NEW YORK TIMES WEB SITE ENDS FEE FOR FOREIGN USERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to expand the popularity of its World Wide Web site
outside the United States, The New York Times said Tuesday that it
had eliminated the fee for access from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Since its creation in January 1996, the site, www.nytimes.com,
has been offered free in the United States and has attracted more
than 4 million registered users.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had, however, charged foreign subscribers $35 a month.
Fewer than 10,000 users outside the United States have elected to
pay it.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nisenholtz, president of The New York Times Electronic
Media Co., said the decision to end the fee resulted from
``understanding the pricing dynamics on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an audience outside the United States that wanted
the product badly, but it was not large enough to create an
advertising marketplace we considered scalable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts said they expected that increased
advertising revenue from abroad should make up the revenue lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, The Times will do much better driving
the advertising than they ever will on the subscription side,''
said Lauren Fine, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The policy is effective immediately. Foreign users will be
charged the same fees as domestic ones for access to the crossword
puzzle and retrieval of past articles from the archives. They range
from $2.50 an article to $9.95 for five articles a month.

Measuring Net use is big topic at I-World 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Even as the Web matures, with more users logging on
every day, there is still a fundamental questionthat goes
unanswered: Who is out there surfing the Net and how can it be
proved that anyone at all is surfing the Net?
</P>
<P>
   The lack of an answer makes advertisers wary. Unlike
television's Nielsen ratings and the magazine industry's Audit
Bureau of Circulation, the Web has no single measurement service
every Web site and advertiser can agree on.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring success is one of the burning questions at Internet
World, the industry's largest and most influential trade show that
opened here Tuesday. Relevant Knowledge, an Atlanta-based company,
came to this show hoping it can provide an answer and help create a
standard. It's in the business of measuring the popularity of Web
sites in much the same way Nielsen does for TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will never be peace in the measurement business,'' said
Jeff Levy, co-founder of Relevant Knowledge, who came to I-World to
discuss Web measurement, along with competitors Media Metrix and
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Packo, president of Media Metrix, raised the issue of
how measurement companies will adapt once high-speed Internet
access becomes available to a significant number of homes. Most
measurements are currently done with software installed in PCs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole phenomenon of set-top boxes has the potential to
turn measurement on its head,'' Levy says. He said a company like
his or Media Metrix could install the measuring devices as part of
the Web TV, cable modem or other high-speed broadband service.
</P>
<P>
   ''When that happens, you'll have a set-top box that is capable
of telling you when people turn the volume down and you'll have
that capability in 10 million homes. Broadband is a new world for
TV measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Web measurers can see the future of their industry,
they are still grappling with the present.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now the measurement field is new and young,'' Packo
said. ''It's not a surprise that a lot of people are working on it.
There is room for multiple measures, but eventually one standard
will emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Atlanta-based Internet companies at the show include
Internet service provider MindSpring and cable company Media One.

SEEN ANY BAD MOVIES LATELY? 
BY TOMMY CUMMINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're one of those who finds fault with any kind of movie,
the creators of Bad Movie Night (www.hit-n-run.com) might be
looking for you ... as a reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Movie Night is a clearinghouse for reviews of bad movies and
bad impressions of good movies. A movie can be either an overhyped
summer release or a 49-cent rental from the local video store.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Movie Night was created last fall on the night that movie
buffs Ken Wilson, Chris Bjuland and Scott Murdock, of Kansas City,
Mo., saw ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We began making it our goal to see a bad movie each week and
post our reviews,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   The site's stated goal is to create a Bad Movie Academy, an
elite group of 100 people who are allowed to post movie reviews on
the site and participate in other events such as the annual Bad
Movie Night Awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``To become a member, a person must complete a rather difficult
100-question trivia quiz and then submit a sample movie review from
a list of bad movies of our choosing,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   The site is similar to the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation,
which tracks the worst movies and performances of the year and
awards its Razzies. The difference is that Bad Movie Night
maintains a database of bad movies.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Movie Night isn't the only site to examine bad movies. A
sampling:
</P>
<P>
   Oh, The Humanity! The Worst Movies on Earth
(www.ohthehumanity.com): This elaborate site takes a different
tack: It posts reviews of B movies, not A movies that are bad.
</P>
<P>
   Ken's World of Awful Movies (www.nrx.net/badmovies): This
well-organized site has lots of reviews of B movies and the best
network of links, including a couple to B-movie queen Chesty Morgan
worship pages.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Turkey Awards:
(members.tripod.com/\Pcosmics/TurkeyAward): This site is for
B-movie fans who want to look up the Turkey Awards given by Harry
and Michael Medved, authors of ``The Fifty Worst Films of All
Time.'' _ Tommy Cummings dragon\Nstar-telegram.com

HOW TO CURE A HANKERING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By TOMMY CUMMINGS  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hankering to visit Arlen?
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Fox's ``King of the Hill'' can tell you all about Arlen,
Texas: Tom Landry Middle School, Mega-Lo Mart, guys with farmer
tans swilling beer in front of their homes, occasionally grunting
``Yup.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Seal of Ruston, La., is such a fan that he created a
chamber-of-commercelike Welcome to Arlen, Texas
(members.tripod.com/\Pbradseal/arlen) page that brings the
fictional suburb to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was created to help people learn about the town where the
TV show takes place,'' Seal said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Arlen, Texas is not quite virtual reality, but it's a
start. Since May 1997, Seal has been building his concept of Arlen,
going so far as to declare himself mayor and name a library for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Arlen, Texas doesn't quite follow the show _ no
Mega-Lo Mart, no Landry Middle School _ but it is one Louisiana
State University football fan's look at Texas life.
</P>
<P>
   Examples are in the Arlen High School profile in the section
about education. Seal writes that acceptable alibis for excused
absences are Dallas Cowboys games or trailer-park accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Texans will point out that the Cowboys play Sundays, Monday
nights, Thanksgiving or the rare Saturday, so that alibi won't fly.

 Apples Makes a Comeback in Classrooms and Wall Street  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanne Hayes has been tracking computer sales in the public
school market for 15 years. But when she finished crunching the
latest numbers the other day, even she didn't believe them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in five years we saw an upswing in orders
for the Mac,'' she said. ``We went nuts. I ran the numbers again
just to make sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, who is president of Quality Education Data, a market
research firm in Denver, said after surveying 5,000 public schools,
she found that 38 percent of all new computers ordered for the
coming school year are Macs.
</P>
<P>
   That's up from 32 percent of new orders last year.
</P>
<P>
   And though schools will still buy two Windows PCs for every Mac,
Hayes said Apple's rebound will be her headline when QED releases
its report later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attribute a lot of it to (Steve) Jobs' leadership,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no denying the Steve factor yesterday, as Apple
reported earnings that were nearly double Wall Street's
expectations. Analyst Craig Cline of Seybold Media, who follows the
desktop publishing market, said Apple is doing a little better in
that key market as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cline said publishing types, all Mac-o-philes to the bone, are
jazzed about the new G3 Macs. Yet they still find themselves
holding their noses and buying Windows systems.
</P>
<P>
   Cline cautioned against euphoria, because Apple still has a long
way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to drink the Kool-Aid and say everything's
totally turned around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Mac fans have every reason to cheer today, investors might
be wary of jumping into Apple, whose shares have risen so
spectacularly since Jobs took over last summer, from the low teens
to $34.44 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   George Shirk, editor of The Insider's Newsletter in Florida,
notes that Apple execs and board members haven't been buying the
company's stock, with the exception of Edgar Woolard, who recently
bought 3,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one reason insiders buy their company's stock and
that's because they anticipate higher share prices,'' Shirk said.
``If we saw more insiders buying, we'd say these guys are
bullish.''
</P>
<P>
   So hats off to Apple for great earnings and solid gains in the &QL; 
K-12 market share. But be careful with the stock, for now.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; The laugh test: &LR;  Legal documents rarely make good reading, but
I got a chuckle out of the response Intel filed this week to the
Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it was no surprise that Intel said it has no
microprocessor monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   But who would have expected this: ``Intel denies that a new
entrant (to the microprocessor industry) would have to establish
both product reputation and technical compatibility with a computer
operating system and the application software desired by a
significant number of computer users.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Intel have us believe users are ready to throw out their
current hardware and software should a niftier chip comes along?
</P>
<P>
   Mac fans could only wish that were true! But the FTC will try to
prove that Intel benefits from the so-called ``network effect.''
That is, the more people who use its chips, the more likely it
becomes that Intel microprocessors will keep new chips from
entering the market.
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said his company ``would explain
the nature'' of the company's statement as the legal process
continues.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Junk revival? &LR;  Junk bonds got a bad name in the 1980s because
they financed so many leveraged-buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Chamberlain, an investment banker with Morgan Stanley,
said junk bonds have come into favor over the last few years as a
way to finance high-tech firms that need cash but aren't ready for
initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example is provided by competitive local access
providers, or CLECs. These are companies like Covad or NorthPoint
that compete with Pacific Bell in selling high-speed Internet
access and other telecommunications services to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain said privately-held CLECs have collectively raised
$6 billion to $8 billion in junk financing to pay for the wires and
switches to create their networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This significant inflow of bond financing has come at a time
when equity investors have seen substantial risks in putting money
into businesses that compete against Pac Bell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So bond buyers, who can get 10 percent returns on investments
secured against million-dollar machinery, have stepped in to
finance the CLECs.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain expects the CLECs to go public one day. Meanwhile,
if junk bonds kick start this industry, it could start a pattern
for other capital-intensive tech industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Real Gold Rush?  &LR; Everyone wants to jump on the Internet
bandwagon, including lawmakers in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Already more than 50 pending bills in the House and Senate seek
to regulate _ or de-regulate _ everything from pornography and
e-mail, to taxes and private information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This outpouring of legislative interest prompted venture
capitalist Floyd Kvamme to tell my colleague Mark Simon that
although some of the bills were well-intentioned, they reminded him
of one of life's three great lies, ``I'm from the government and
I'm here to help.''
</P>
<P>

 Apple's Profit Beats Expectations  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing a dramatic financial comeback, Apple Computer
yesterday wowed Wall Street by reporting a quarterly profit that
was almost twice what analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by strong sales of its Power Macintosh G3 and cost
cutting, the Cupertino computer-maker earned $101 million (65 cents
per share) during its fiscal third quarter ended June 26. Analysts
were expecting 33 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time items, Apple earned $75 million (50 cents) in
the latest quarter. In the same period a year ago, Apple lost $56
million (44 cents).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely gratifying to see results that match the
talent at Apple,'' interim Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in an
interview yesterday. ``It was sad a year ago, when we had just lost
something like a billion dollars. Obviously, some people had to go
and we had a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Apple's third-straight quarterly profit came from cost
reductions. The company has laid off hundreds of people, integrated
its Claris software subsidiary into the parent company and closed
its Newton unit, which made handheld computers.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's sales actually slid 19 percent, to $1.4 billion in the
third quarter from $1.74 billion in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   But profits grew largely because the company was selling more
computers with higher profit margins, namely the Power Macintosh
G3. The company has sold more than 750,000 of the speedy computers
since they were introduced last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said Apple is also benefitting from better sales
forecasting, more efficient manufacturing and a smaller, focused
product line that doesn't intimidate consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly profit was Apple's third in a row. The company
earned $102 million in the previous two quarters combined. The
latest profit is the largest since third quarter of June 1995, when
Apple made $103 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Apple can make money in the current quarter, the company will
post its first profitable year since 1995. The company lost nearly
$2 billion in fiscal 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give Jobs high marks for the Apple resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is like the cleanup hitter who drove in the men that
(former Apple CEO) Gil (Amelio) put on base for him,'' said Lou
Mazzucchelli Jr., vice president of Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co.
Inc. ``Some of what you see _ the operational cuts and efficiency
in Apple's organization _ was started under Gil's watch and carried
out by (chief financial officer) Fred Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people questioned whether Steve would capitalize on
the situation, but he has,'' Mazzucchelli said.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts say the company is hardly home free. They
point out that Apple's quarterly sales and unit shipments are
lagging from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turmoil of the last few years may have driven away too
many fence sitters to Windows machines,'' said analyst Steve Dube,
of Wasserstein Perella in New York. ``Apple's primary objective is
to stabilize its installed base. Right now, they would be happy to
avoid further erosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are also concerned about the company's middling market
share. Apple's share of the domestic personal computer market has
stalled at 4 percent, according to Dataquest Inc., a San Jose
market researcher.
</P>
<P>
   But Apple executives insist the company's market share will grow
with the August 15 introduction of its $1,299 iMac home computer.
``Our sights are set on an aggressive foray into the consumer
market,'' Apple's Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Market researchers predict the company could ship as many as
400,000 of its iMac home computers by the end of September. ``The
reaction has been off-the-charts,'' Jobs said, pointing out that
177 software programs have been designed or updated for the iMac in
two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The table has been set for growth,'' said Charles Wolf,
director of equity research at Credit Suisse First Boston in New
York. ``And we will see that when iMac sales begin to take off in
the September quarter. Finally, Apple has some focus _ and Steve
has everything to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jobs' performance as CEO has led to a groundswell of
support among Macintosh enthusiasts, developers, Apple executives
and board members for him to drop the ``interim'' from his title.
</P>
<P>
   But the Apple co-founder insists he isn't ready to take the
permanent plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months ago, I woke up and decided that ...I will do as
best as I can for as long as I can and not worry about what other
people think,'' he said. ``My focus is on my family, Apple and
Pixar (where Jobs is CEO), in that order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino company's stock _ which had sunk to $12.94 per
share in December _ rose $1 yesterday to $34.44 _ a
two-and-a-half-year high. Trading in Apple was halted before
yesterday afternoon's announcement. It will reopen today.

APPLE'S EARNINGS EXCEED ANALYSTS' EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Confounding the skeptics yet again, a resurgent
Apple Computer Inc. blew by Wall Street analysts' earnings
estimates Wednesday for the third consecutive quarter. Apple said
it sold a record number of its G3 Macintosh computers and that
profit margins improved in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Apple reported its results after the market's close, but in
anticipation of a strong quarter, Apple shares closed at $34.44, up
$1, a new 52-week high, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company's revenues were as expected, but that
higher margins boosted earnings due to Apple's selling a greater
percentage of high-end machines. Revenues might have been higher
had the company been able to meet demand for its new Powerbook
laptop models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great quarter,'' Steve Jobs, Apple's interim
president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview.
``Operational excellence has returned to Apple.''
</P>
<P>
   For its third fiscal quarter, which ended June 26, Apple
reported earnings of $101 million, or 65 cents a share, fully
diluted, compared with a loss of $56 million in the comparable
period a year ago. Revenues dropped 18 percent to $1.4 billion,
from $1.7 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's third-quarter 1998 earnings included a $26 million net
gain from nonrecurring items, including an after-tax gain of $33
million related to the initial public offering of ARM Holdings PLC,
and a $7 million charge related to the acquisition of technology
from Macromedia Inc. Without these nonrecurring items, the
company's net income for the quarter would have been $75 million,
or 50 cents per diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Apple to earn 33 cents a share, according
to First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said Apple could
continue to outperform expectations in the quarters to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing a pretty good job building excitement around the
iMac,'' he said, referring to a new $1,299 Macintosh for the
consumer market. ``They've created an atmosphere in which people
want to buy the Macintosh again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One measure of Apple's new discipline as a business is that the
company increased inventory turns from 13 to 22 in the quarter,
which helped drive down costs and lowered its exposure to declining
component prices. Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer,
said in a conference call with securities analysts, that the
company's goal was to increase inventory turns to 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking a Dell-style balance sheet,'' said Kunstler,
referring to Dell Computer Corp.'s industry-leading minimal
inventory levels. ``From a shareholder's perspective, that's got to
be very sweet to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Macworld convention this week in New York, Apple answered
a number of concerns that had been raised about the iMac,
announcing that it would include a 56K modem rather than the slower
33K device it had originally been shown with, and unveiling three
external floppy disk drives. In addition, Apple said software
developers had announced commitments for 177 new programs or
upgrades for the Macintosh since the iMac was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much more comfortable with the iMac proposition than I
did before Macworld,'' said Charles Wolf, an analyst with C.S.
First Boston. He said he expected Apple to sell 275,000 iMacs to
schools and home consumers in the fourth quarter; 400,000 in the
December quarter and 1 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than anything Compaq has for the consumer market
under $2,500,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the launch of the iMac would bring Apple's profit
margins down by a couple of percentage points, but he added that
the company expected a substantial gain in unit volumes from the
new machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sights are set on a very aggressive foray into the
consumer market,'' he said during the call with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Although in the past Apple has discovered after launching new
products that it had miscalculated demand or had encountered
production difficulties, Jobs said the company was gearing up for
the iMac launch and would be ready this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make a lot of iMacs this quarter,'' he said.
``Even making a lot, there's no way we will meet demand this
quarter. We hope to meet demand next quarter. That's just the way
it is when you have a hot product.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 10 million existing home users of the
Macintosh, and new computer users who want to get access to the
Internet, Jobs expects the iMac to win back customers from the
Wintel camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thing to remember is many of them were not born with a PC in
their mouth,'' he said. ``Many of them defected from the Mac and we
can win some of them back.''

MAKE YOUR PITCH ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So, you figure Curtis Hanson and those slacker
boys, Affleck and Damon, got lucky when they won Best Screenplay
Oscars this year, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Think you could do better but didn't have the money to option a
James Ellroy novel and forgot about your boy-genius buddy from the
projects who ended up at MIT until you saw ``Good Will Hunting''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, this is Hollywood, so your confidence in your abilities,
however well-placed, is far from unique. But now you and other
budding screenwriters can show off at least a tad of talent online
in the Rough Cut Screenplay Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rough Cut Web site, screenwriter David Goyer _ who has
written such films as ``Dark City'' and ``The Crow: City of
Angels'' _ will post the first 10 pages of a new science-fiction
screenplay beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Then each week, people can submit five to 10 pages of their
version of the script's next chapter through the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Rough Cut staff will cull through the entries and post the
best one each week until the tale reaches a suitable size and plot
resolution, typically at around 100 to 120 pages. Then Goyer will
pen the concluding several pages, tying together the script's loose
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how it's going to work either; that's the beauty
of it,'' said Andy Jones, Rough Cut's editor in chief. ``It is all
a very brave new world, which is what the Internet is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Each week's winning entry earns its writer $100, a pretty good
chance of winning a grand prize drawing for a laptop computer and,
most importantly, an official writing credit if the screenplay is
made into a movie, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Writers are encouraged to be wildly creative with their plot
twists and to make casting suggestions as well, said Jones, who
described the script's premise so far as ``very much a `Blade
Runner'-esque meets `Dark City' experience so far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts out with a character who has an ability to change
appearances and uses a lot of gadgets,'' Jones said. ``All we know
is, he wants to have himself killed off.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, ladies and gentlemen, start your word processors.
</P>
<P>
   Submission rules and all the other fine print are available at
www.roughcut.com. Rough Cut is the film-oriented Web site for the
TNT cable channel.

<P>
   NET MAGAZINES: Two well-done new magazines have hit the stands
covering aspects of the Internet, though from very different
directions.
</P>
<P>
   One is Business 2.0, Imagine Media's business-minded successor
to the ``suspended'' Internet magazine the Net. Business 2.0
focuses, unsurprisingly, on e-commerce and other financial aspects
of the wired world. But there are nuggets to be gleaned from the
biz talk that are of interest to a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   One story focuses on movie studios' use of Web sites to build
pre-release buzz for films, mentioning how Dean Devlin used the
long-running ``Godzilla'' site as a key part of the mega-buildup
for the movie, which wasn't as good as the Net site. Another
terrific (and still-running) site mentioned in the story is
``Starship Troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another story detailing the ``25 most intriguing minds of the
new economy'' includes the founder of Bangladesh's revolutionary
Grameen Bank and Los Angeles Kings co-owner Philip Anschutz, who
also started Qwest Communications, the upstart company whose
state-of-the-art fiber-optic network and dirt-cheap prices are
threatening to turn the long-distance phone business upside down.
</P>
<P>
   And a regular page of Internet statistics includes some
eye-popping numbers: The number of World Wide Web sites quadrupled
between January 1997 and April 1998 to 2.3 million, while the
number of U.S. adults online increased from 31.5 million to 41.5
million between July and December of last year. And the ratio of
women to men is now close to even.
</P>
<P>
   The other magazine of note is Brill's Content, which focuses on
all things ``nonfiction,'' including the Internet, which has earned
a reputation for somewhat woozy distinctions for veracity.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, run by the great journalist Steven Brill, made a
splash recently for Brill's own devastating detailing of
corner-cutting journalists and problematic prosecutors in l'affaire
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine has much else to recommend it, including good
stories on the struggle for survival by Salon, the terrific online
magazine, and how Internet ``portal'' sites such as Yahoo! are
being paid big money to give other sites prime spots on their front
pages while competitors aren't even indexed.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC ON THE WIRES: Fast-moving changes in the music business
caused by the Internet and new recording technology will be the
subject of a panel discussion called ``Downloadable Music:
Revolution or Revitalization,'' 7 p.m. July 23 at the Hotel Nikko
in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists include David Kessel, president of IUMA/Offline
Records, and Wendy Hafner, marketing manager for Intel's music
division.
</P>
<P>
   The event costs $25 for the general public, and tickets must be
purchased in advance. For more information, call (310) 392-3777,
Ext. 214.

COMPAQ POSTS SECOND-QUARTER LOSS, OFFERS GLIMPSE OF FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Compaq Computer Corp.'s purchase of Digital Equipment
Corp. gave the Houston-based computer maker its first quarterly
loss since the dark days of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But the earnings report issued Wednesday also offered an
intriguing glimpse into Compaq's future.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq posted a loss of $3.62 billion, or $2.35 a share, for the
second quarter of the year. That number almost matches the $3.63
billion charge related to the acquisition of Digital, which was
completed June 11.
</P>
<P>
   The company warned earlier this year that its second quarter
would be much like the first quarter, with profits and sales flat
due to deep price cuts necessary to move a glut of business
computers out of inventory.
</P>
<P>
   That warning proved accurate. However, before the Digital
charge, Compaq actually earned a small profit _ $32 million, or 2
cents a share, on sales of $5.8 billion. That compares to a profit
of $257 million, or 17 cents a share, on sales of $5.5 billion in
the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   But that small gain would not have happened without the
additional sales from owning Digital for just over two weeks.
Digital brought $1.1 billion to Compaq's coffers in that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Compaq Classic (Compaq without Digital) was a
disaster in this quarter,'' said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Piper
Jaffray in Minneapolis. ``The good news is that they can't do much
worse. They can only go up from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, disputed Kumar's
characterization, saying that Compaq had met its goals for the
second quarter and would concentrate in the third quarter on
integrating Digital into its operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A neat part of that story is that, after we paid for Digital,
and took the Digital debt off the balance sheet, we still have $4.6
billion in cash, and that's significant,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Compaq has reduced the number of desktop, notebook and
file server computers sitting on the shelves of its resellers to
about 3 1/2 weeks of inventory, while the goal for the quarter was
four weeks. In order to accomplish that, Compaq shut down its
Houston factory for two weeks in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Kumar said his own checks of resellers show that inventory
of high-end file servers is closer to 10 weeks, and consumer
systems sold in retail stores is about five weeks. The server glut
is made up of systems that use older technology such as Intel
Corp.'s Pentium Pro processors, Kumar said, and thus is harder to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to take it,'' he said. ``You have companies like
Dell coming in and selling Pentium II servers at Pentium prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts were not as glum.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Poyner of Oppenheimer in New York said Compaq has gotten the
worst of its inventory problems behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tactically, the focus is going to be on doing what they said
they'd do with the consolidation, putting the companies together,''
said Poyner. ``They're going to have to spend the quarter blocking
and tackling and getting everything done just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason has said Compaq will spend the current quarter working on
integration issues, and by the fourth quarter will begin to see
financial benefits. He held to those predictions on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because Compaq executives said in advance that the company would
post a loss, investors weren't alarmed. Compaq's stock closed
Wednesday at 33 9/16, down 1/8, after being up on early trading.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first red ink in Compaq's history as a public
company. Compaq posted an 82 cent-a-share loss in the third quarter
of 1991, the year the company's financial situation imploded.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.63 billion Digital charge is made up of three components:
$3.2 billion to write off in-development technology, $291 million
for shutting down Compaq facilities and laying off Compaq workers
and $139 million for other ``operating adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Another $2 billion in charges has also been taken, but it was
rolled into the $9 billion price Compaq paid for Digital, a company
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq expects to lay off 17,000 people worldwide as a result of
the Digital merger, with 2,000 of them being from the ``Compaq
Classic'' work force. About 1,000 of those layoffs will take place
in Houston, though those have nothing to do with Digital. Those
layoffs are the result of Compaq's moving to a ``built-to-order''
system in its local factories.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons Compaq bought Digital was for its $6
billion services and support operation. The figures released
Wednesday show that division already is having a significant impact
on Compaq's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter of last year, Compaq's services business _
the installation, design and support of computer systems _ was just
$110 million. For the second quarter of this year, that number
jumped to $460 million, mostly due to the brief period that Compaq
owned Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Compaq expects to earn between $12 billion and $15
billion annually in service revenues after the turn of the century
as a result of the Digital purchase. At the time of the
acquisition, Digital's services arm was bringing in about $6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that number has been flat for several years,'' said Kumar.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Compaq expects services to account for 20 percent of
its overall revenues. Poyner said those will be be high-profit
revenues, because the service business has margins averaging about
30 percent.

COMPAQ POSTS SMALL SECOND-QUARTER PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOANN MULLER   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. put its house in order last quarter, and
is now turning its attention to a bigger challenge: squeezing more
profits out of its newly acquired Digital Equipment Corp. unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based computer company posted a small profit before
charges for the second quarter _ more than analysts had expected _
by slashing prices on machines that had clogged distribution
channels since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's operating profit was $32 million, or 2 cents a share,
compared with $465 million, or 30 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue climbed 5.7 percent to $5.83 billion, which included
Digital sales since the buyout closed on June 11, from $5.52
billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's earnings were pounded by several factors,
including the slowdown in Asia, pricing cuts, and indications of
slowing PC sales in this country. Nevertheless, operating earnings
were slightly above Wall Street forecasts, which called for Compaq
to break even in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Previously announced one-time costs associated with the Digital
acquisition resulted in a net loss of $3.63 billion, or $2.33 a
share, for the period. The charges included $3.2 billion for the
write-off of technology, $291 million for restructuring related to
job cuts and closing of facilities, and $139 million for other
``operating adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, said the key
challenge last quarter was to clear out excess merchandise that
piled up when corporate demand for PCs slackened, hurting Compaq's
first-quarter earnings. By cutting prices, Compaq succeeded in
reducing its inventory at distributors to 3 1/2 weeks' worth from
as high as 10 in January, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Compaq's earnings received a small, unexpected
boost from Digital's services business, which he said has the
highest backlog of orders in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 33 million Compaq shares were exchanged Wednesday, but
the price didn't move much. That's because Compaq stock had already
been on the rise for weeks. It climbed about 30 percent since the
beginning of the second quarter as the company assured investors
that inventory problems were being addressed. Wednesday, Compaq
fell 1/8 to 339/16, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Compaq's biggest challenge is to smoothly meld
Digital's operations into its own, while wringing out excess costs.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the former Digital, especially in New England, are
bracing for layoffs and other cutbacks. Compaq has said it will cut
17,000 jobs _ 15,000 of them at Digital _ as it integrates the two
companies' operations. But so far, it has announced only 5,000 cuts
related to the consolidation of its manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the other 12,000 jobs coming from? That's the
biggest issue,'' said Louis Mazzucchelli, a stock analyst with
Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. ``There's no way to sugarcoat
that, and it's not going to be pretty. But they've got to get that
done sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason said the remaining job cuts will occur over the next year,
but declined to provide details.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzucchelli and other analysts said Compaq will have a tough
job trying to blend Digital's culture into its own while paring
costs in the highly competitive computer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to get back to a growth posture as soon as they can.
And everyone's going to be shooting at them as they become a more
visible target.''

COMPAQ REPORTS LOSS FOR QUARTER DUE TO DIGITAL ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. reported a second-quarter loss of $3.63
billion Wednesday, resulting largely from its acquisition of
Digital Equipment Corp.. But Compaq eked out a tiny operating
profit that beat analysts' expectations of a break-even quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While the quarterly results had few surprises, Compaq, analysts
said, appeared to have made progress at reducing the excess
inventory at distributors and dealers that has eroded earnings in
recent quarters. The challenges now are to maintain sales momentum
amid tough competition and to successfully integrate Digital into
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, based in Houston, said last month that it was closing
six plants overseas and eliminating 5,000 jobs, including 1,000 at
its Houston headquarters. The company is planning to cut 17,000
jobs as it absorbs Digital, and another recent acquisition, Tandem
Computer. The cuts will leave Compaq with a work force of 67,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, Compaq lost $3.63 billion, compared with
earnings of $257 million, or 17 cents a share, fully diluted, in
the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 7 percent, to $11.52
billion, from $10.79 billion in the second quarter of 1997. Second
quarter 1998 earnings include charges of $3.63 billion related to
the Digital acquisition; without these charges, Compaq had earnings
for the quarter of $32 million, or 2 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts expected the company to break even,
according to a survey by First Call Corp., an investment research
company.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Compaq ended down 12.5 cents, at $33.5625, in very
heavy trading on the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has struggled to compete with Dell Computer Corp., which
sells direct to customers, builds each computer to order, maintains
very little inventory and thus has lower costs. Last year Compaq
announced it was moving to a build-to-order business model but
retaining the dealer channel, and that it would reduce its
inventory. In the transition to the new model, however, Compaq
flooded the dealer channel with product, leading to a glut of PCs
and fierce price cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they made good progress in driving down the inventory
during the quarter, but my sense is it needs to come down a little
further,'' Todd Bakar, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist of San
Francisco, said. He said he was also concerned about ongoing
pricing pressure. ``A lot of the sell-through in the quarter came
with very aggressive pricing and promotions, so you have to ask
what sort of unit growth they can sustain going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq executives said the third quarter would be a transitional
one as the company managed the integration of Digital and worked to
bring that company's cost structure in line with its own. Analysts
noted that at 24 percent of sales, Digital's sales, general and
administrative costs were roughly twice those of Compaq, and would
have to be reduced sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the decisive steps taken to position our products
competitively in commercial channels worldwide and reset goals for
the newly combined companies, we are now moving aggressively to
achieve targeted levels of performance and growth,'' Earl Mason,
Compaq's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said.
``We continue to believe earnings for the combined companies will
be accretive as early as the fourth quarter.''

GOVERNORS URGE SENATE TO AMEND BILL ON INTERNET TAXATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By NICOLE TSONG   
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's governors urged the Senate on Thursday
not to adopt a six-year ban on new Internet taxes, saying states
could lose billions of dollars as commerce on the Internet
explodes.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors'
Association, told the Senate Finance Committee that states already
lose $4 billion annually from not being able to tax mail-order
sales. And he estimated that by 2002, states would lose between $15
and $20 billion in revenue from a sales-tax ban on both mail-order
and Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce on the Internet continues to grow as consumers
increasingly turn to their computers to buy goods ranging from
stocks to books. By the year 2002, $300 billion worth of business
will be conducted on computers, according to Commerce Department
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Scheppach urged the committee to drop the Senate's proposal for
a six-year ban on Internet taxes and adopt a measure similar to a
House bill that calls for a three-year moratorium on new Internet
taxes. The House bill also would ban the practice of making
customers pay taxes in both the resident state and the state from
which the good arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Scheppach also warned against a permanent ban on Internet taxes,
saying retail businesses that were unable to sell their products
over the computer would be at a ``perpetual disadvantage'' to
competitors who were on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Harley Duncan, executive director of the Federation of Tax
Administrators, an organization that represents state tax
collecting agencies, also criticized the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Senate measure used very broad language that would
make it difficult for state tax agencies to interpret which types
of business transactions on the Internet should be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan also called on the Senate to pass a measure similar to
the House bill, which he said would provide tax collectors a better
idea of what can and cannot be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   The House measure, which was passed in June, also would
establish a temporary two-year commission, made up of business
executives and officials from state and local governments, that
would work on ways to fairly tax the sale of goods on the Internet.

ELDERLY CYBERSURFERS CLICKING ONTO INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By BOB DART  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ E-mail is a great way to keep up with the
grandkids, but that's just one benefit senior cybersurfers are
discovering as they venture on line in growing numbers, experts
told a Senate committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are currently faced with two world-wide revolutions _ the
convergence of aging or longevity and the explosion in technology _
both of which are driving the transformation of society,''
explained Craig Spiezle, Microsoft's director of market
development. ``People over the age of 60 represent the
fastest-growing segment of computer and Internet users.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, retirement communities will find that fast
cable modem connections to the Internet are as important as nearby
golf courses in attracting elderly residents, predicted Mary
Furlong, chairman of ThirdAge Media, an online business providing
information to older Americans and the companies trying to reach
them.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasts of an expanding elderly population that is rapidly
becoming cyber-saavy came at a Senate Special Committee on Aging
symposium on ``Older Americans and the World Wide Web: The New Wave
of Internet Users.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a variety of reasons, many of us view the Internet and
other forms of technology as tools of the young,'' said Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the committee chairman. ``Although young
people are often the first to use new forms of technology, it often
benefits older people just as much or even more.''
</P>
<P>
   While the elderly are going on line at a faster rate than other
age groups, they still make up only a small portion of the wired
community. Only about 5 percent of senior households own and
actively use a home computer, compared to about 45 percent of
households over all, said Spiezle.
</P>
<P>
   But those demographics will change quickly in an aging global
population. ``Every week, worldwide, 1 million people turn 60. In
the United States alone, 10,000 people turn 50 every day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these trends, Microsoft is looking to the elderly to
provide not only customers for its software but also for future
employees in an era where there is already a shortage of high-tech
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view mature Americans as a key solution to this skills
gap'' and have begun programs ``to tap the wealth of experience
seniors bring to the workplace and to help them develop and
cultivate their technological skills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Older people are not the technophobes or cyber-klutzes that they
are often portrayed to be, said Herbert Ernst, a retired government
computer scientist who trains his contemporaries at a SeniorNet
learning center in suburban Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jewish Council for the Aging center, he said, ``most of
us e-mail our family and friends almost daily; many are members of
on-line groups ...and a colleague of mine asks, 'How did we ever
get along without it?.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the elderly quickly find the Internet to be
indispensible, said Micki Gordon, director of the Center for
Productive Aging. She said they use e-mail to communicate with
family and friends, chat rooms to exchange information with others
who have similar interests, games such as Solitaire to keep their
minds engaged, Web sites to find information on Social Security,
health care, investments and genealogy, and media links for keeping
up with news and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Logging onto the Internet ``prevents isolation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many elderly Americans are going to their community libraries
for computer training and for an on-line connection, said Jeanne
Hurley Simon, chairperson of the National Commission on Libraries
and Information Science. About 73 percent of the nation's 15,718
libraries provide public access to the Internet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some communities have created ``cybermobiles'' _ similar to the
familiar bookmobiles utfitted with computer workstations with
Internet links. When the cybermobiles roll out to introduce
homebound senior citizens to the Internet, she said, ``it provides
a whole new meaning to the term ``Information Highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the elderly do get hooked into the Internet, they log on
more often and surf longer than other users _ perhaps because they
have more time, said Furlong.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezle said Microsoft is working with the American Association
of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Council on Aging and other
organizations to introduce older Americans to the Internet and give
them the needed technological training. About 35 million households
of people over the age of 60 don't have a home computer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than two-thirds of the group without PCs says they simply
don't see the need,'' Spiezle said. ``But this attitude almost
always changes with the recognition that such technology presents
the opportunity to be employed in a good-paying job, extend one's
independence and allow individuals to remain productive and
creative.''

 Computer Researchers Show Off Latest Gizmos  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of technology's most creative thinkers gathered in Silicon
Valley yesterday to describe and show off their latest ideas, which
ranged from a talking couch that tells you when your nap is over to
a pair of eyeglasses that double as a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that usually see themselves as competitors _ including
Microsoft, Xerox, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple and IBM _ sent
researchers to the New Paradigms in Computing annual conference at
IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers showed off their latest gizmos, while others
just talked about them.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Bell, who helped invent Digital Equipment Corp.'s
successful VAX minicomputer, describeda ``guardian angel'' that
you'd wear on your wrist that would have sensors to keep track of
blood pressure, heart rate, insulin levels and would alert you when
something goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who is now working at Microsoft's San Francisco research
lab, is working on a ``cyber admin'' that would catalog everything
you read and could call up anything from fragments of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Brewster Kahle, inventor of the landmark WAIS program for
finding documents on the Internet, described the newest invention
of his San Francisco-based company, Alexa: an intelligent Internet
navigator intended to learn from users.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Selker, the IBM fellow who organized the event, talked about
a world where tiny computers are everywhere, all responding to
humans' needs or wants _ keeping clothing comfortable and doing
blood tests without finger pricks.
</P>
<P>
   His contributions yesterday included the talking couch and a
``digital coach'' exercise machine that prodded a user on with a
drum beat and the voice of a Arnold Schwarzenegger-like trainer
urging, ``Come, let me pump you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Hayes-Roth, known for her work in artificial
intelligence, demonstrated software agents being developed by her
San Jose-based startup, Extempo. A dog named Max and a wizard named
Merlin were among the characters Extempo designed to make working
with a computer more like working with a person.
</P>
<P>
   Thad Starner, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology media lab, showed off the funny, thick eyeglasses that
also work as a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're actually fashionable frames from France,'' noted
Starner, who has been wearing the computer glasses for the past two
months.
</P>
<P>
   The glasses are connected by a cord to a hand-held keyboard
called the Twiddler, which is the size and shape of a hot dog bun.
Starner carried the keyboard in one hand and carried a credit
card-size computerwith a Pentium processor in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Using the computer and looking into a tiny screen embedded in
the glasses, Starner can take notes, read and answer e-mail, search
the Internet _ essentially do most anything you can normally do
with a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason you have to have a desktop machine,'' said
Starner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desktop and laptop will go away because this is much
better for your eyes and hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The central theme of the conference was pervasive computing _ a
world in which computers are seamlessly integrated into daily life.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the computer scientists in the crowd were
enthusiastic about this prospect: several had concerns about
invasions of privacy and one raised the specter of computers being
``incredibly intrusive and invasive everywhere.''

MY COMPUTER SURFS WITHOUT ME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I have been advised that it is wiser to leave
my computer on at all times. The problem is that four out of five
days, I wake up with my home page displayed rather than my desktop.
Someone told me that the computer does in fact call my Internet
server several times during the night. I wonder if this is a glitch
in my PC or if some piece of downloaded software may be doing this.
_ Haunted
</P>
<P>
   Dear Haunted: Your PC is doing exactly what it's supposed to do.
Well, it's doing what Microsoft wants it to, and that's all that's
important. In fact, I think there's some sort of federal law to
that effect, or there will be when Microsoft gets through with
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bill and his merry band of marauders think that the Internet
is just an extension of your desktop, and that data from it should
be just as readily available as if it were on your own hard drive.
A continuous connection to the Net is perfect for that scenario,
but because most of us can't afford that luxury, Windows 98 and the
most recent versions of Win95 will make a connection when needed.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you have a program that periodically checks the Internet
for whatever, your computer is probably dialing on its own. Either
that, or Mulder and Scully are right. Look for a check box on your
Internet dialer screen that says ``Connect as needed'' or some such
thing and uncheck it to put a stop to automatic dialing.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be such a weenie about turning your computer off.
Nobody's got the right answer to that one. Continuous use will
eventually wear out the drive and fan motors; turning it off and on
jolts the circuits and eventually fries something. Who cares? Live
dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Open Microsoft Word and type in the phrase
``unable to follow directions.'' Highlight the phrase, then go to
Tools/Thesaurus (Shift-F7 works, too) and look at the results. Now
the question: Is this the Department of Justice's most fervent wish
for Big Bill? _ Perplexed
</P>
<P>
   Dear Perplexed: Actually, I think it may be a sign that my
ex-girlfriend found a job as a Microsoft programmer.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I have to respond to ``Tom.'' ``(Note: Tom
wondered if women whose husbands spy on their online adventures did
something to earn the mistrust.)'' I think my husband is doing
similar tricks, and, no, I don't deserve it. Some husbands are
suspicious of everything, even when NOTHING is going on. And, just
maybe, if they spy long enough, their wives will get so sick of it,
they might just run away with a computer geek. _ Fed Up
</P>
<P>
   Dear Fed: Meet you at the Hyatt next Tuesday afternoon, just
like always?
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Your column often uses the words ``anal'' or
``anal retentive.'' I'm not sure what you really mean. Could you
please explain? _ Puzzled
</P>
<P>
   Dear Puzz: Just read the next letter.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: You do your readers a great disservice with
your feeble, childish attempts at humor. People foolishly come to
you seeking help, and all they get in return are sophomoric
insults. You would be well-advised to take a more serious,
businesslike tone, like the informative columnists in ``PC
Magazine'' and ``PC World'' who actually know what they are talking
about. _ Badly in Need of Bran
</P>
<P>
   Dear Badly: Does that answer your question, Puzzled?
</P>

WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE BEFORE THE INTERNET?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to believe, but the use of graphical browsers to surf
the World Wide Web is just over 5 years old. Mosaic, the first
software to let users see images on the Web, was originally
released in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For those who rely on a connected computer for work and play, it
seems like a lot longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   Can you recall what you did to warm a plate of leftovers before
the microwave? I suspect in just a few more years serious Webheads
may have a hard time remembering what it was like to order flowers
by phone or browse a bookstore in the 3-D world.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, so perhaps I exaggerate. But you get the point _ few
communications media have changed the world as quickly as the Web
... at least for those who use it regularly. And the numbers of
those who do continue to grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Web changes the lives of those who embrace it,
the Web itself is changing.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, just having a Web site was enough to draw
attention. If it rated as a cool site _ whatever that means _ then
so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the number of sites could be measured in the
thousands. It was not unlike the dawn of television, when early
adopters gathered around sets to stare at test patterns. A little
eye candy went a long way.
</P>
<P>
   But with millions of Web pages online, getting and holding
visitors' attention now requires that a site offer something of
value. The Web has gone from being a curiosity to being a seriously
useful tool.
</P>
<P>
   If you use the Web on a daily basis, chances are there are a
handful of sites you return to regularly for a variety of services.
In some cases, they may have supplanted other ways you used to get
the same information.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I no longer call an airline when I want to find out
when a particular flight is arriving. Instead, I visit TheTrip.com
and use its flight tracker at www.thetrip.- &QL; 
com/flightstatus/.
</P>
<P>
   Choose an airline and a flight number, and not only will the
site tell you when the plane is expected, but it will even tell you
how many miles it is from the destination airport.
</P>
<P>
   When I want directions to a particular location, I no longer
look it up on a paper map. Instead, I visit MapQuest at
www.mapquest.com. This is one of several sites that let you enter
starting and destination addresses to get door-to-door directions,
complete with a map.
</P>
<P>
   You do have to be careful with these because the directions
aren't always perfect. If I'm in doubt, I'll double-check MapQuest
against Maps On Us at www.mapsonus.com, a similar service.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm shopping for computer components, I'll try ZDNet's
NetBuyer at www.netbuyer.com, which lets you compare prices at
dozens of different online vendors. Tell the site you want to find
prices on, say, 9-gigabyte and bigger hard drives with an Ultra ATA
interface. You'll get plenty of choices, sorted by manufacturer,
complete with prices.
</P>
<P>
   However, be aware that some of the bigger computer vendors
aren't listed, including CompUSA (www.compusa.com) and Cyberian
Outpost (www.outpost.com).
</P>
<P>
   When I want to check out the weather _ not that there have been
many changes around here from the hot-and-dry forecast lately _ I
don't wait to hear it on radio or TV. Instead, I drop by
Intellicast at www.intellicast.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are other weather sites _ including the Weather
Channel's at www.weather.com _ Intellicast is easily the
friendliest and the fastest. Weather sites tend to bog down when
the atmosphere acts up, but Intellicast stays fairly speedy even
when there is lots of weather news.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the single most useful Web site in Houston is the
Real-Time Traffic Map at traffic.tamu.edu/traffic.html. It shows a
map of the city's freeway system, color-coded to indicate freeway
speeds. Click on any colored segment to get the average speed of
traffic on that road. If you're not in Houston, you can get similar
maps for nearly 30 U.S. cities at TrafficNet at
www.accutraffic.com.

A MODERN MIXER FOR THE HIGHLY WIRED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MICHAEL SAUNDERS   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Nobel Prizes were awarded for lack of social skills,
telephone circuits would sizzle from all the long-distance
congratulations passed between Stockholm and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Hand in glove with Boston's role as one of the country's
technology centers is its reputation as safe harbor for all sorts
of brilliant characters who can expound for hours on fluid dynamics
but get that deer-in-the-headlights look when asked something
complex, such as whether he or she is currently dating someone.
More than just fodder for endless ``Dilbert'' comics, this social
isolation is something that Bob Ayers is trying to eliminate _ at
least for a few hours at a time. Ayers created a successful lecture
series, The Next 20 Years, that has evolved into a modern mixer for
the country's most highly wired.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the middle of the idea is that everyone in the new media
industry is working ridiculous hours and they don't get to meet
each other often except over e-mail,'' Ayers said, reached by
telephone in his San Francisco office. ``Things happen when you
throw people in a darkened room with cocktails and live jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold these events in clubs because we want to shake up the
inherent stodginess. It's better to bring a lot of the most
established people into a place that's more edgy, than the
opposite,'' Ayers said. ``We want to put people up there on stage
who have interesting thoughts and want to share them, we want to
show people new technology. But we also want them to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Next 20 Years is an amplified spinoff of a San Francisco new
media-industry salon called Last Saturdays that Ayers started in
1993. The ideal panel, Ayres explains, is a mix of visionaries and
business minds, dreamers butting heads with pragmatists, all of
whom can breathe life into dry theory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC;  What we've been playing with: Live Act from Magix
Entertainment, an engaging product that wraps a comprehensive music
editing tool in a slick interface designed to appeal to teenagers
and young adults. Think of Live Act ($50) as a musical Lego kit
that enables users to build songs out of discrete blocks of sound.
That's true with all editing tools, but Live Act (unlike its
stablemates in the Magix product line) goes beyond basic sample
sequencing and playback by allowing users to play music in real
time.
</P>
<P>
   Most forms of electronica are represented in the sample pool _
ambient, acid jazz, drum and bass, hardcore techno, etc. _ so the
music created is usually very propulsive and beat heavy. By
altering pitch and tempo, and editing out certain notes, even the
most twinkly Hi-NRG track can be given a speaker-thudding dub
treatment. One quibble here: the sample quality is excellent but
purposely kept a little thin, possibly because add-on sample discs
are available for $20 each.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to jump right in and start playing, but reading
the clearly written manual will enhance the process and steepen the
learning curve. Experienced users of other editing packages (the
excellent Cakewalk is among the leaders) will immediately notice
that there's no graphical representation of the arranged samples.
This was only a minor annoyance that faded after about an hour of
tinkering, and besides, Live Act is definitely not meant for
professional use.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Live Act are sound editing tools used in its
predecessors, Music Maker 3.0 and Music Studio 3.0. Music Maker is
a basic sample arranger, while Music Studio includes sequencing
software that greatly expands the sonic palette. Live Act combines
these, adds real-time composing functions, and includes .avi video
clips that were packaged in deluxe versions of Music Maker and
Music Studio.
</P>
<P>
   We couldn't get excited about the rudimentary video editing
features in any of these products. They were only marginally
interesting, and tended to be RAM hogs on a P-166 with 16 megs RAM.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  In a year of excellent real-time strategy games,
MechCommander has muscled its way to the top. This new game from
Fasa Interactive and Microprose elevates and enhances the RTS
component of the venerable MechWarrior series by incorporating
first-rate graphics with some of the best artificial intelligence
we've seen in a while.
</P>
<P>
   In several missions, enemy mechs lure you away from the
objective you're supposed to be defending, while a flanking force
creeps in from the opposide side. Similar tactics were used in all
the MechWarrior games; none, however, had this level of emphasis on
resource management and strategic combat.
</P>
<P>
   The screen interface is both clear and detailed, with realistic
video clips of other combatants that boost the adrenaline rush. So
far, it has evicted Total Annhilation from the disc drive and we're
waiting to see if it can hold the fort against Dominion: Storm Over
Gift 3, the highly anticipated RTS game from Ion Storm.
</P>
<P>

released by Disney on the heels of the animated film, and Pajama
Sam 2, the little blue caped crusader whose latest adventures seeks
to prove that ``Thunder and Lightning Aren't So Frightening.''

NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently dismissed Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 98 operating
system as barely worthy of notice. Then I saw the sales figures.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know the economy's in great shape. Why else would so many
consumers pay $90 for software that's not worth half that? Compared
to Windows 95, which was a dramatic improvement from earlier
versions of Windows, Windows 98 is just a lot of tweaks and bug
fixes. Yet according to the research firm PC Data, Windows 98 is
selling as fast as Windows 95 did _ 500,000 copies in its first
four days. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   But another aspect of the upgrade saga came as no surprise.
Customers gripe that Windows 98 is buggy and difficult to install
on many computers. Already, Microsoft says it will release a
``service pack'' in September with fixes for Windows 98 bugs. It's
a new chapter in an old story _ Microsoft's notorious habit of
selling software before it ripens.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many reports of conflicts between Windows 98 and
older computer hardware. For example, some of the new Windows
features, such as better battery power management on laptops, will
only work if your computer has an updated set of instructions
called a BIOS. These BIOS instructions are permanently stored on a
chip inside the machine, which can be updated as necessary. In
addition, when you run Windows 98, some add-on hardware devices
like sound cards need updated drivers _ the little programs that
let the devices talk to the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   A number of major computer companies, including Compaq Computer
Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., have posted discussions of these
problems on their Web sites. In some cases, the companies urge
consumers not to install Windows 98 until they've also obtained the
necessary BIOS or driver updates. So check with your machine's
maker before you do something rash.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was a problem for me when I installed a reviewer's
copy of Windows 98 on my home machine a couple of months ago. For
one thing, it's got a new BIOS on the motherboard. Besides, I
wasn't brave enough to install the new software on top of Windows
95. I did that once with a beta version of Microsoft's Internet
Explorer 4.0 browser, and it took me two weeks to get the machine
working properly again. So I took the coward's way out, and did a
``clean install'' of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   I used an excellent utility called System Commander Deluxe that
lets you chop a drive into multiple segments, or partitions, and
treat each one as if it were a separate drive. System Commander
lets you put a different operating system on each partition, and
boot up whichever you like _ DOS, Windows, OS/2, Linux, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   So it was easy to stick Windows 98 on a newly-created partition
where it wouldn't do any harm. Of course, I had to reinstall my
Windows software onto the new partition, but with CD-ROMs, that
doesn't take too long. And if anything had gone wrong, my old
Windows 95 setup and all my data files were safe.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got some extra room on the hard drive, you might want
to use this method. System Commander Deluxe runs about $70, but
there's a $30 ``lite'' version especially for Windows 98 installs.
</P>
<P>
   But after hearing many upgrade complaints, I decided to install
Windows 98 on my Windows 95 partition. I don't believe in suicide
missions, so I took precautions to make the process as smooth as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   I made copies of my important data files, just in case. Next, I
cleaned out a folder called C:/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/StartUp.
This is a folder for programs that start automatically whenever you
boot up. Reboots happen a lot during Windows 98 installation, and
purging this folder can prevent conflicts and speed up the process.
Just copy the contents of the folder to another location, and put
them back once you've finished the installation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I ran Norton Disk Doctor to repair any damaged files on
my hard drive, as well as Speed Disk, which sorts the files on your
disk for maximum efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't have the Norton Utilities, Windows 95 has two
similar products_Scandisk and Disk Defragmenter.
</P>
<P>
   And it all worked. Windows 98 installed smoothly and hasn't
given me a hint of trouble so far. My only problem is figuring out
why so many people are actually buying this thing.

NETSCAPE ANNOUNCES NEW WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT BEER   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Netscape wants to be America Online.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message the troubled Mountain View, Calif., company
pushed Thursday along with its new Web browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a major release,'' proclaims Netscape's Bob
Lisbonne, senior vice president of client products. ``It's a sea
change for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communicator 4.5, available free on the Net starting
Thursday (www.home.netscape.com), contains features that will only
work with Netscape's Netcenter portal site.
</P>
<P>
   A portal is a Web site that acts as a jumping off point to the
rest of the World Wide Web. Think of portals as the Internet's
version of TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   Portal sites _ led by Yahoo _ have been the hottest Internet
stocks on Wall Street this summer. Netscape wants to cash in on
that popularity by imitating AOL, the long-standing portal king.
</P>
<P>
   ``But AOL has their content to work with,'' Lisbonne says. ``We
have the entire Internet.'' The new Netscape browser sports a host
of mail, address book and browsing features that automatically link
the user directly to corresponding features on Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the browser will automatically call up a link to a
specific Web site _ like www.disney.com _ when a user types in
Mickey Mouse. The feature works off a 1.5 million word dictionary
that creates those Netcenter links.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has a skin-of-their-teeth Web browser market lead over
Microsoft, at 52.2 percent vs. 45.6 percent (third-party browser
makers hold the remaining 2.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Allen Weiner, of Dataquest in San Jose, sees the new
browser as less of a sea change than a ``shell change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's half a revision,'' he says. ``It's really meant as a way
for Netscape to solidify its position. It's meant to slow down
Microsoft a bit.''

MICROSOFT WORKERS BACKED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A U.S. district judge in Seattle ruled on Wednesday in favor of
employees of Microsoft Corp. who had been denied health and
retirement benefits and discount stock purchases because they were
classified as employees of ``temporary'' agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Carolyn Dimmick rejected Microsoft's argument in the
class-action lawsuit that any benefits should be apportioned
differently to workers who signed temporary personnel contracts in
1990, 1991 or 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs said thousands of Microsoft employees
had been denied benefits, but neither side would say how many could
now be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen K. Festor, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he did not
expect a ruling on damages for ``at least several months.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cullinan, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the plaintiffs
were trying to expand a ``very narrow group'' of workers referred
to in earlier court decisions upholding the plaintiffs' rights to
benefits.

MICROSOFT LOGS GAIN OF 28 PERCENT IN EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Showing practically no financial pain from its antitrust
battles, Microsoft Corp. reported a 28 percent gain Thursday in its
fiscal fourth quarter earnings, modestly exceeding Wall Street
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also said it had already sold more than 1 million
copies of its new operating system software, Windows 98, to
consumers. The company began to sell the new software only last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is the leading maker of personal computer
software, reported its financial results after the markets' close.
In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft shares closed at $117.375, unchanged.
In after-hours trading, shares fell to $116.875.
</P>
<P>
   Although the release of Windows NT 5.0, Microsoft's more
powerful operating system, has been delayed, probably until the
fiscal year 2000, analysts said the fundamental business was so
strong that it might continue to provide earnings in excess of
estimates next year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials showed little concern about a substantial
increase in general administrative costs, which include legal
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one impact is that our legal costs are up quite a large
amount,'' Greg Maffei, the company's chief financial officer, said
in a telephone interview. He said the antitrust suits, filed by the
Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general in May, had not
affected revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is gratifying that it appears consumers are looking to the
quality of the products and are buying them,'' Maffei said. ``The
reality is it was a great quarter. Windows 98 is off to a flying
start, and we had good revenue from Windows 98 in the quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended on June 30, Microsoft earned $1.36
billion, or 50 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.06 billion,
or 40 cents a diluted share, in the comparable period a year ago.
Revenue rose 26 percent, to almost $4 billion from $3.18 billion in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., which tracks earnings
estimates, had expected Microsoft to earn 48 cents a share,
although the so-called whisper number, offered to customers
verbally, was 50 cents, exactly as reported. Revenue was about $200
million above most estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenues up 26 percent was higher than expected, and they also
added $425 million to deferred revenues, bringing that to $2.9
billion, so that is a pretty terrific showing,'' said Rick
Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next three quarters we're looking at slower growth
because the product cycle is a bit slower,'' Sherlund said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent years Microsoft has termed a certain amount of sales
``unearned revenues,'' to reflect a more realistic accounting of
software sales cycles. Using this system, the company said it
recognized $150 million in revenue from Windows 98 in the fourth
quarter, but deferred 35 percent of that, so only about $100
million appears in its results.
</P>
<P>
   Although some analysts add the deferred revenue back to arrive
at a presumed total, Maffei cautioned against this practice. ``Some
creative analysts continue to misuse spreadsheet products by adding
back unearned revenues,'' he said. This is done partly to justify
the increase in Microsoft's price to earnings ratio, from 35 in
1996 to 48 in 1997, to 66 now. ``Consider the obvious,'' he said.
``The stock is more expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have in the past, Microsoft officials cautioned that the
company's growth rate was slowing and would continue to slow.
Although this quarter's earnings and revenue growth rates are
strong, they pale in comparison with earnings growth of 82 percent
and revenue growth of 41 percent last year. ``The growth rate for
this quarter is higher than most analysts are predicting for next
year, and I agree,'' Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Microsoft earned $4.49 billion, or $1.67 a diluted
share, up 30 percent from $3.45 billion, or $1.32 a diluted share,
in fiscal 1997. Fiscal 1998 earnings reflect a $296 million
write-off associated with the acquisition of Web TV. Revenue rose
28 percent, to $14.48 billion from the $11.36 billion reported for
fiscal 1997.

   40 Percent of Big Companies Face `Millennium Bug'
</P>
<P>
   The ``millennium bug'' _ the inability of some computers and
programs to deal with the transition to the next century _ has
already bitten 40 percent of the United States' biggest computer
users.
</P>
<P>
   That's the finding from the latest edition of a periodic survey
of how Fortune 500 companies are coping with computing's year 2000
challenge. Put simply, the problem is that many computers and
programs fail to recognize that the year 2000, often represented in
computer code by the digits 00, comes after the year 1999,
represented by 99.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Americans think of the year 2000 problem as an
event that will strike almost a year and half from now, the number
of computer programs with warranties, leases and other business
activities that involve schedules running into the next century
climbs each month and will soar early in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cap Gemini America, a New York-based consulting firm that has
been sponsoring the surveys by Rubin Systems Inc. since 1995, said
that the number of companies encountering year 2000 trouble jumped
sharply early this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, 87 percent of the companies that had already
encountered problems had experienced at least one disruption in
normal computer processing.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of those with trouble had programs that made
financial miscalculations when confronted with year 2000 dates, and
some of the mistakes lost money for the companies. More than
one-third of the problems were in customer-service programs, and 44
percent had difficulties involving suppliers or distribution of
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``That supply-chain figure is low because people haven't really
started testing it yet,'' said James Woodward, senior vice
president and head of Cap Gemini's year 2000 consulting and
remedies group.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey also showed that the number of companies
focusing on contingency planning jumped to 72 percent from 3
percent in April. That, Cap Gemini said, reflected the growing
recognition that year 2000 complications are more common, harder to
locate and more expensive to fix and test than was originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate America is finally dealing head on with the Year
2000,'' Woodward said.

   Microsoft Innovator To Venture Further Out
</P>
<P>
   Peter Neupert, the Microsoft executive responsible for some of
the company's most innovative, and risky, new media deals, has
picked a new career with at least as much risk: venture-capital
investing.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next month, the 11-year Microsoft veteran will join
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, the Silicon Valley investment
force behind At Home, Amazon.com and Excite, among others.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft's vice president for news and publishing, Neupert
was instrumental in the formation of MSNBC, the company's
cable-television joint venture with General Electric, and played a
key role in creation of Microsoft's online magazine, Slate. Brook
Byers, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, said the firm has known
Neupert for years and come to respect his understanding of ``tech
meets the consumer and media worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kleiner Perkins, he will focus on electronic commerce deals
and have the title ``CEO in residence,'' which appears to refer
more to his residence than Kleiner Perkins', since he will continue
to live and work in Seattle _ and not in San Francisco and Menlo
Park, Calif., where the firm has its offices.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner Perkins now has one other CEO in residence: Jerry Held,
who was previously head of software development at Oracle Corp.
Another person who held the title, Frank Fisher, left last month to
become the actual chief executive of a cardiology medical-device
venture in which Kleiner Perkins is an investor.

<P>
   The House Commerce Committee has resolved a key conflict over
legislation to protect intellectual property in the computer age,
approving a bill that would seek to ensure that new digital
prohibitions do not trample on the ``fair use'' doctrines of
traditional copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, intended to carry out two international
treaties on digital copyrights, had already passed the Senate and
been approved by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the Commerce Committee struggled for the last month to
devise a compromise between the owners of copyrights _ primarily,
movie and record producers and software developers _ and schools
and libraries, which feared that they could lose the right to make
the same kind of limited-use copies of digital material as they
have been able to do with printed matter.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing factions struck a deal on Friday, and the Commerce
Committee sent the amended version to the House floor later in the
day. But before the full House can vote, lawmakers must reconcile
the bill with the earlier version approved by the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, called the WIPO Copyright Treaties
Implementation Act, was introduced nearly a year ago to carry out
agreements intended to protect music, movies and other intellectual
property from piracy. It proposed outlawing the devices used to
circumvent encryption, as well as the act of circumventing those
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers said that such a ban was needed to keep thieves from
using any loopholes as a license to make illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   But schools and libraries feared that such restrictions would
hinder their ability to make the kinds of ``fair use'' copies that
copyright law has traditionally allowed.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise amendment by Rep. Scott Klug, R-Wis., would defer
the circumvention matter for two years while the secretary of
commerce reviewed the problem. After two years, the
anti-circumvention rule would go into effect. But the amendment
would also give the secretary the right, every two years, to waive
the rule for any class of works where technological safeguards were
blocking users' lawful access to copyrighted material.
</P>
<P>
   Klug said the measure provided a good balance between the
sometimes conflicting interests of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it goes a long way to guarantee that in the new age in
which we have unlimited access to information that we make sure
that access doesn't come with a price,'' he said.

   Microsoft's Apple Stake Is Hardly Altruism
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft Corp. invested $150 million in Apple Computer
last August, the action was viewed as a kind of self-interested
donation. In the bargain, Apple agreed to drop a lingering patent
suit against Microsoft and also agreed to use Microsoft's Internet
Explorer as the standard browser on its Macintosh machines.
</P>
<P>
   With Apple then in dire financial straits, Steve Jobs, the
company's co-founder and acting chief, said the appropriate
response from the Apple faithful was to ``treat Microsoft with a
little gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, the deal appears to have been a shrewd
investment for Microsoft in other respects. Apple's shares have
outperformed Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 5, 1997, the day before its deal with Apple was
announced, Microsoft shares have advanced 65 percent, after
adjusting for a 2-for-1 stock split in January. On Friday,
Microsoft stock closed at $117.9375.
</P>
<P>
   But over the same period, the Apple stock price has surged 87
percent, closing Friday at $36.875. Hardly a charity case for
Microsoft, whose $150 million investment is now worth $280.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jobs had been criticized for unloading all but one
of his Apple shares in the spring of 1997, only a few months after
he had sold his Next Software Inc. to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most of Jobs' personal wealth is in Pixar Inc., the
animation studio that in partnership with Disney made ``Toy Story''
and whose next film, ``A Bug's Life,'' is scheduled to open in
theaters in November.
</P>
<P>
   Another astute investment, it seems. Pixar's stock price has
more than doubled since August 1997, closing at $48 on Friday.
Jobs' 68 percent stake in Pixar is now worth more than $1.4
billion. Certainly no charity case, either.

INTERNET BROADCASTING: RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a piece of twine and run it between two empty dog food cans
and you have a sound transmission system with the approximate
quality of many audio broadcasts over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the stage of Carnegie Hall with 10 million $100 bills and
you would see the amount of money that investors have poured into
Broadcast.com Inc., a company devoted to putting radio and
television programs on the Internet. Investors are apparently
willing to overlook the current technical limitations of Internet
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the first day of trading after Broadcast.com's
initial public stock offering, the company's shares opened at $68,
nearly four times higher than its $18 offering price. That was the
biggest initial jump in the history of stock offerings in the
United States. The shares shot up to as high as $74 before closing
at $62.75. At that price, Broadcast.com has a total market value of
$1.06 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1995 by Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban,
who began by putting the broadcasts of a Dallas radio station onto
the Internet through a computer in a friend's bedroom. Cuban, 39,
had run a computer consulting firm and a technology investment
fund. Wagner, 37, is a lawyer and a certified public accountant.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Cuban's share of the company stock is worth more than
$350 million. Wagner's stake exceeds $200 million. Broadcast.com
executives were unavailable for comment because the company is in
its government-mandated quiet period.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com, which is based in Dallas and recently changed its
name from Audionet, now offers transmissions of 345 radio stations,
flickery images from 17 television stations, games from 350 sports
teams and other talk and music programs.
</P>
<P>
   In return for helping broadcast stations extend their reach,
Broadcast.com receives some on-air commercial time slots to sell to
advertisers. It also can sell audio advertising that Internet
listeners hear before joining the program of their choice. The
company also sells on-screen ads that the audience members can view
while they are listening.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com also has a second business, broadcasting corporate
presentations, like meetings for analysts, over the Internet,
offering a lower cost alternative to telephone and video conference
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the company say that as the technology for Internet
broadcasting improves, Broadcast.com is in a prime position to
capitalize on a medium that could be far more compelling than the
text-based Internet is today.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts point out that the risk in its plans are at least
as great as the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, the company is small, and spending nearly twice
as much money as it is taking in. In 1997, it lost $6.5 million on
revenue of $6.9 million. And the company's prospectus filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission says it expects the losses
to continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, there appears to be little the company can do to
defend against competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can do what they're doing,'' said David Simons,
managing director of Digital Video Investments, a research service.
``Net investors are impervious to the notion of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet both ESPN Sportzone and CBS Sportsline have their own
Internet broadcasting service that competes with Broadcast.com's
sports services. And Broadcast.com has exclusive Internet rights to
only some of its programming. Other programs can be carried by its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com does have some programs that it will probably not
have to fight to keep, though. It runs a site called
www.policescanner.com, for example, which transmits the emergency
service radio broadcasts from New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. Not
only is that programming free _ it is supposed to sound like it is
coming in on two dog-food cans and twine.

COMPANY TARGETING JUNK E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A company with perhaps the most ambitious
commercial attempt yet to combat junk e-mail plans to announce on
Monday that it has begun distributing a test version of its system,
which is intended to intercept unwanted messages as they travel
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The system has been designed by Bright Light Technologies Inc.,
a well-financed start-up company based here, which has already won
contracts with four major Internet service providers: AT&AMP;T
Worldnet, Earthlink Networks, Concentric Networks and USA.net.
</P>
<P>
   Junk e-mail, often known as spam, is seen as a growing problem
by the nation's Internet service providers because of the burden it
places on computer disks, network capacity and the staff time of
network operators. At some networks the volume of spam, which
consists of commercial solicitations ranging from get-rich-quick
schemes to pointers to pornographic sites on the World Wide Web,
sometimes exceeds 50 percent of all electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   But spam is also reviled by many Internet users as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most commercial solicitations are viewed as an unwanted
nuisance,'' said Don Schutt, vice president of consumer advocacy at
Concentric Networks Inc., a network services company based in
Cupertino, Calif. ``But when parents see that their children are
receiving unwanted pornographic messages, they go ballistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bright Light's founder, Sunil Paul, said that his
inspiration for the company came when his wife expressed shock at
receiving an unsolicited pornographic message.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a solution to the problem of spam was a vital concern,
he said, because many businesses are now beginning to run on
electronic mail and cannot afford the clutter and distractions
posed by spam.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, a co-founder and former executive of Freeloader, an
Internet software company, as well as a former executive at America
Online, said his new company had raised $5.5 million in venture
capital backing from Accel Partners and individual investors who
include author and newsletter publisher Esther Dyson and Benjamin
Rosen, chairman of Compaq Computer.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which also has a strategic alliance with Sendmail
Inc., which developed and supports the most widely used software
for routing e-mail over the Internet, has built a tracking system
that will detect spam sent to special decoy addresses established
for that purpose. All other copies of those messages can then be
blocked with a ``spam wall'' that will be installed on the
mail-server computers of Internet service providers and corporate
users.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Light also has a technology alliance with Software.com, a
software developer focusing on electronic mail systems for large
Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of other technology-based efforts to combat
spam, including special filtering features in the Sendmail server
and a blocking service maintained by a group of volunteers known as
the Black Hole List. But spam presents service providers with
thorny problems, including the problem of ``false positives'' _
mail blocked because it seems to be spam but actually is not.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this problem, the heart of the Bright Light system is a
monitoring center where human operators assess messages that have
been trapped by the decoy e-mail addresses. But Paul acknowledged
that even the most sophisticated filtering system will fail to stop
all spam, as spammers learn to adopt to the new countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   One big problem in combating spam is that the cost of sending
spam is remarkably low. Spammers can go into operation by
purchasing a piece of software that costs as little as several
hundred dollars and then purchasing lists of e-mail addresses that
are also inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Bright Light system will permit network operators to let
users choose whether they want the spam filter on or off or set to
filter only certain categories of spam.
</P>
<P>
   Testing of the Bright Light system is scheduled to begin on
Monday, with an eye toward commercial operation by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said Bright Light will produce a spam index to help gather
better statistics on the actual network impact of junk e-mail. The
company also plans to post a spam ``calculator'' on its Web site
(www.brightlight.com), which will enable Internet users to compute
an economic cost of spam, based on the assumptions they enter.
</P>
<P>
   Several states have passed laws outlawing spam and there at
least six bills pending in Congress attempting to control junk
e-mail.

CONGRESS CHALLENGES STATE INTERNET FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taxes on Internet users' access to cyberspace may become a
contentious political issue this fall in eight states.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for controversy at the state level is congressional
legislation called the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which the House
passed unanimously last month. The Senate, after a hearing last
week by its Finance Committee, is expected to vote on the measure
soon. The legislation would effectively ban taxes on Internet
access, but it includes a grandfather clause that would allow eight
states with existing taxes to continue to impose them.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch. The legislatures of the eight states would
have to vote to re-enact their taxes, and governors would have to
sign the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Some state and local government officials say that this
requirement is a back-door route to killing the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a grandfather clause; that's a dead man's clause,''
said Eugene Gavin, the commissioner of the Department of Revenue
Services in Connecticut, one of the eight states.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Shafroth, policy director for the National League of
Cities, said: ``All eight states have Republican governors, and for
seven it's election time this fall. And there is such incredible
terror these days when anyone accuses you of wanting to raise taxes
that at most two of these states will have the courage to re-enact
their existing tax law.'' In addition to Connecticut, the other
states are Iowa, Ohio, North Dakota, New Mexico, South Dakota,
Tennessee and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Shafroth and other critics of the bill say that its content is
being heavily influenced by the lobbying campaign dominated by
America Online, the nation's largest Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lobbying is 90 percent AOL,'' Shafroth said.
</P>
<P>
   Shafroth and Gavin said that because America Online had refused
to collect and turn over sales taxes on its subscriber fees, it was
eager to find some way to escape liabilities owed to the eight
states and to four others that will not try to re-enact access-fee
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Fishbein, an America Online lawyer working on the bill,
said that ``the grandfather clause is a compromise for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We favored no grandfather clause,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   America Online does not collect state and local taxes on
subscriber fees because it believes it is not obligated to, she
said, but it does collect such taxes in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The company's terms of service for subscribers explicitly stated
until recently that America Online would not pay any sales or use
taxes that might be due. Within the last month, however, the
company posted a change to those terms, which now advise
subscribers that ``you are responsible for all charges incurred,
including applicable taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fishbein would not comment on the potential tax liability
America Online would face if it were forced to pay these taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The size of America Online's potential liability, including
interest and penalties, could easily reverse the positive cash
flow, which came to less than $6 million, that the company reported
in its most recent annual financial statement. Connecticut alone
says it is owed $3 million through September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If America Online cannot find a way to block these tax bills, it
would be faced with either having to go back and bill customers,
who may not react warmly to having a separate charge added months
or years after they used the service, or paying the bill itself.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Fishbein declined to comment on the effect that the
re-enactment provision of the federal legislation would have in
achieving America Online's goal of ending the Internet taxes in the
eight states. ``I'm a tax lawyer, not a political consultant,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fishbein also said she was aware that there was a widely
held impression among opponents of the bill that America Online was
virtually alone in pressing to eliminate the access-fee taxes. That
impression exists, she said, because America Online is based in
Dulles, Va., a suburb of Washington, and is therefore highly
visible on Capitol Hill. She said that virtually every Internet
access provider was active in seeking a ban on the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin, the Connecticut tax official, said that America Online
was the only company that had fought his state's sales tax on
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   He said the state recently surveyed thousands of individuals and
businesses asking for ``areas of our tax system that are
troublesome for you, and not one person or business _ not one _
brought up taxing Internet access.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is solely an AOL issue,'' he continued. ``Every other
major online provider, like Prodigy and Erols, is charging the 6
percent tax to the consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut will collect $7 million this year, he said, and has
cut the tax to 4 percent from 6 percent, with annual reductions
until it is phased out on June 30, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL says our tax is unfair, but if anything, other businesses
should say we are being unfair to them because they pay the full 6
percent and AOL and other Internet access providers only have to
pay 4 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online has filed a lawsuit in state court to block
collection of the $3 million the state sought through September
1996.
</P>
<P>
   All eight states that would have to re-enact their Internet
taxes have legislative races this fall, and all but North Dakota
have gubernatorial elections.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors
Association, said that governors gave in to the provision
reluctantly in negotiations over the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good practice for the federal government to tell the
states they have to re-enact a law if they want to keep it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Tax Freedom Act is seen by cyberspace industries as
critical to the growth of electronic commerce. These companies say
that having to comply with the sales tax rules of 30,000 local
governments would overwhelm them and lead to multiple taxes on some
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you are an AOL subscriber in Connecticut and you took your
laptop on a trip and accessed the Internet from your hotel room,''
Ms. Fishbein said in a hypothetical example. ``That access would be
subject to the Texas sales tax on information services.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the tax issues raised by Internet access and commerce
were never contemplated when most sales tax laws were adopted in
the Great Depression or even in Connecticut's law, which was
adopted in 1975 primarily as a way to tax the purchase of data put
online by companies and law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., a co-sponsor of the Internet Tax
Freedom Act, said at the Senate hearing last week that the Internet
``should be a global, tariff-free zone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said talk that taxes could smother
an infant electronic commerce industry was absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet companies are not struggling to come up with
capital,'' he said, adding that the proposed act would bias tax
policy in favor of electronic commerce.

THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM VS. THE OPERATING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask 10 computer scientists to state which features define an
operating system, and you will probably get 10 different answers.
Ask what those features will be four years from now, and the
responses will range from some vague variation on current systems
to visions of vast, potent networks that empower individual
computers with a sort of communal energy.
</P>
<P>
   Asking such questions is not an academic exercise. The nature of
the operating system, the master program that breathes life into
computer hardware, is at the heart of the Justice Department's
lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp. of antitrust violations. And yet,
just last week, Sun Microsystems Inc. announced a product called
Jini that is designed to negate the need for Microsoft's Windows
and other operating systems used today.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sun's approach catches on, whether Microsoft can prevail
in both the marketplace and the courtroom or whether software takes
some other, unexpected evolutionary leap, it is clear that the
technology is now moving too fast for anyone to predict the future
of the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus of the government's suit is Microsoft's inclusion
in Windows of its Internet Explorer browser for navigating the
World Wide Web, to the detriment of its rival in the browser
market, Netscape Communications Corp. But there is also concern
about Microsoft's linking of the opening screen in Windows to
Internet sites and services that are owned either by Microsoft or
by companies that pay Microsoft fees for this blue-chip real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Microsoft won a victory on the first issue when a
federal appeals court panel, ruling in an older government suit,
said that Microsoft could bundle a program with Windows if the
bundling provided a benefit to users.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the judicial system versus the operating system is a
mismatch. One of the slipperiest challenges facing government
lawyers is that no one, jurist or engineer, can say with any
certainty which features belong in an operating system and which do
not. At the same time, the government learned a hard lesson in its
13-year antitrust case against IBM Corp. in the 1970s and early
1980s. Even then, the gears of the digital revolution were turning
faster than the wheels of justice. The government eventually
abandoned its case, acknowledging that whatever their original
merits, the charges had become ``technologically irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were days of relatively slow development for computer
technology. In contrast, Sun's announcement of Jini suggests that
the current pace of change could leave the legal system performing
surgery on a beast that evolves from one species to another on the
operating table.
</P>
<P>
   Employing a concept known as distributed computing, Jini
redefines the computer, its peripherals and sundry other gadgets as
a community of devices functioning together within a dynamic
network as a single virtual machine. Microsoft is known to be
developing a similar concept that it calls Millennium. Before
distributed computing can make operating systems like Microsoft's
Windows, Apple's Macintosh OS and the various flavors of Unix
obsolete, however, wireless networks will have to evolve to a
quality and price that makes connectivity ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   That is likely to take several years. For the time being, the
only link between a processor and everything else that goes inside
and outside the box we think of as a computer is the operating
system. And the question of which functions belong within the
master program and which belong in independent applications
software is a matter of debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is there is no clear line to draw,'' said Patrick
Bridges, a doctoral student in computer science at the University
of Arizona who runs a Web site about operating systems. Some, he
said, stick to very basic functions while others are more
all-encompassing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NYT-07-19-98 1721EDT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Windows is of the all-encompassing variety. Its ancestor, the
original MS-DOS used in the first IBM PC in 1981, was basic. It did
little more than control the keyboard, monitor and floppy-disk
drives. Indeed, DOS is an acronym for disk operating system. It
could be stored on a single 360,000-byte floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   As hardware evolved, Microsoft added support for hard-disk
drives, CD-ROMs, audio, video, networking, type fonts, fax modems,
Internet browsing and a host of other new technologies, usually at
no additional cost to the consumer. Windows 98, which went on sale
in June, contains 13 million lines of code and requires up to 295
million bytes to store.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that inflation can be laid to the evolution of the
operating system from an inward to an outward orientation. Where
DOS was manipulated by typing arcane commands on an almost empty
screen, Windows, like the Macintosh and other graphical operating
systems, now controls almost every aspect of a user's experience
with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Manipulating the user's very perception of what a computer is
and does has become key to Microsoft _ and alarming to competitors
and the Justice Department's antitrust division _ because for more
than 90 percent of the people who buy computers today, Windows is
the gateway to an explosion of electronic commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argues that integrating the Internet into Windows
benefits users and that at any rate, it has the right to innovate.
Indeed, as each new version of the operating system has been
introduced, Microsoft has come under fire from the trade press and
consumers for its failure to incorporate one or another feature.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, Microsoft says, is becoming such a fundamental
part of computer use that access to it should be part of the
operating system, just as other types of networking already are.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department and Microsoft's critics say that
Windows has an insatiable appetite for functions and features that
used to be provided by separate programs and other companies. The
result, they argue, is a stifling of innovation and competition.
</P>
<P>
   From a traditional computer science point of view, the issue
seems simple: The operating system is software that is basic to
running the computer and is needed by virtually all users; an
application is software that performs a particular function and is
needed by only some users _ for example, a program simulating air
flow over a wing, an accounting program or a spreadsheet or
word-processing program.
</P>
<P>
   The two types of software have a symbiotic relationship. Without
an operating system (and, indeed, the earliest computers in the
1950s did not have them), each program would have to include its
own instructions for such mundane tasks as finding a spot on the
disk to store information. Some early MS-DOS word processing
programs had to contain instructions for connecting to many types
of printers. Today that responsibility falls to the operating
system. The operating system frees programmers who develop
applications from having to reinvent the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Operating systems began to be more concerned with the user
experience when Apple executives discovered the work of researchers
at Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1980s.
Apple first imitated Xerox's ``graphical user interface,'' which
allows the machine to be controlled using windows, a mouse and
pop-down menus, on its ill-fated Lisa. But with the introduction of
the Macintosh in 1984, the graphical interface became the future
direction of standard for personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean that it is always an integral part of the
operating system; it can also be a sort of digital facade, or
shell. For example, users of Unix, an operating system used in
engineering workstations and bigger machines, have a choice of
several user interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Windows was also a shell bolted onto MS-DOS, and
there were several other windowing shells from which to choose.
With the introduction of Windows 95, Microsoft fully integrated the
graphical interface with the underlying operating system, so that
today it is impossible to distinguish between the user's experience
and the machine's function.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case with the Macintosh from the beginning,
Windows takes responsibility for the basic look and feel of the
application programs that run on it. Without this kind of
standardization, users would have to spend a much longer time
learning how to operate each program. Microsoft argues that as
technology evolves, once-specialized functions become essential and
should be part of the operating system. While this can kill the
market for some kinds of software, it also makes the development of
other kinds faster and easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when we add services to the operating system
and somebody has to shift their business as a consequence,'' Brad
Chase, marketing vice president for Windows at Microsoft, said.
``But it's trivial compared to the opportunity it's created for the
industry and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some competitors say this process is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you focus on the things Microsoft's not doing there's
plenty of opportunity,'' said Enrique Salem, chief technical
officer for the Symantec Corp., which provides software that
extends the functionality of the operating system. Many of the
improvements Symantec sold for Windows 3.1 were incorporated by
Microsoft into Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   And even Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has made a
career challenging attacking Microsoft, said the emphasis on
keeping something out of the operating system is ``in many ways the
weakest part of the government's case.'' Rather, Reback said, the
government should promote competition by breaking up the software
giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be in a position to decide what goes in or
out'' of an operating system, he said. ``The market should do it.''

WELL-TOLD AFRICAN STORY IS PURE PLEASURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ``AHMED'S REVENGE''; By Richard Wiley, (Random House, $23.95) 
 
By STEVEN E. ALFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Wiley's outstanding new novel ``Ahmed's Revenge'' is by
turns a mystery, a love story, a social portrait of an emerging
African nation and a tale of a scarred relationship between father
and daughter. In combining these elements so successfully, Wiley
reminds us why reading novels is so much fun.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 Nora Hennessey Grant, Kenyan-born and England-educated,
and her new husband, Julius, bought a farm minutes outside ``the
dusty Maasai town of Narok.'' Before meeting Julius, Nora was ``a
city girl who thought a lot about her fingernails.'' Now she finds
herself in the struggle to maintain a successful farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the rain came or when our evening reading didn't suit us,
we would sometimes get out Julius's maps and notice that our farm,
along with those of Isak Dinesen near the town of Karen, and
Elspeth Huxley out Thika way formed an obtuse triangle, with Julius
and me at the pinnacle, which seemed right to us since we were
alive and young and farming while those other two were not, one
long gone and one buried, both of their lives mythologised in books
and film and on the BBC.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1974, when the book opens, the Grants are well-established
coffee growers, exporting valuable Kenyan beans across Europe. One
night in Nairobi, Julius and Nora have a fight, and Julius leaves
the hotel. Nora decides to follow him and discovers that Julius has
been harboring a secret from her _ not a mistress, as she had
suspected, but a business deal that looks both dangerous and
illegal. Nora keeps her knowledge of his apparent misdeed a secret
from him.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to their farm, they are startled one evening by the
arrival at their pond of a lost baby elephant, ``the breathing
equivalents of tornadoes in the American Midwest,'' quickly
followed by hungry lions. In a riveting scene awash with the
convincing messiness of a real event, we witness the lions' attack
on the elephant, followed by their awareness they are being watched
by Nora, Julius and some of their farmhands. The lions then attack
the people, and in the terrifying rush a rifle goes off, wounding
Julius. Taken to a Nairobi hospital by helicopter, Julius has his
arm amputated. Facing a long and painful recovery, suddenly,
without warning, he dies. The grief-stricken Nora slowly realizes,
to her horror, that Julius did not die of surgical trauma; he was
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Julius' death brings from England Nora's aging father, Nathan
Hennessey, once minister of wildlife for Kenya. Nora must then deal
not only with her sudden, painful solitude but with the realization
that her difficult and distant father was somehow involved in
Julius' death.
</P>
<P>
   This beautifully paced story brings a surprise with every new
scene. Nora's social relations with Detective Frederic Mubia, a
red-suited, fundamentalist Christian, seem to echo the uneasy
relations between colonialist England and former colony Kenya. Her
seemingly chance meeting with Ralph Bunche N'deru, ``a travel agent
and safari man'' and a former schoolmate, allows Wiley to develop
an uncommon and unpredictable relationship between a resentful but
ambitious man and a widow whose new and unusual status brings with
it a welter of confusing emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Julius' death ``from the accidental configurations of a vile and
hateful day'' brings her in touch as well with the Kenyan upper
class, among them Miro, an opera singer and childhood acquaintance,
and Mr. N'chele, ``a fervent nationalist and a former political
candidate'' whose son figures prominently in the evil that lay
behind Julius' demise.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to solve the mystery of the murder, Nora finds that
she has ``been surrounded by clowns with vendettas or slip-knot
minds: the Mad Hatter and his doctor, a religious policeman in a
red suit, and the father of my enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   She discovers that ``I had not loved the wrong man but had loved
the right man, who had acted wrongly, and what a difference there
was in that, what power it gave me, what renewed strength. Julius
hadn't betrayed me ... but had betrayed, instead, an aspect of
himself. And, oh, how he'd grieved for it, oh, how clearly he'd
known what he had done.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reconciliation with her husband's memory does not, however,
allow her to come to terms with her father. In the portrait of the
relationship between the father and the daughter we realize that
this is a tragic story in the classical sense, in which the sins of
the father are visited upon the child, in this case a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahmed's Revenge'' is composed of three parts, reflecting those
of a life: ``We live our lives in three acts: the first to know we
are alive; the second, to try to understand, the third, to work and
grow.'' Richard Wiley has presented us with a marvelous study of
Kenya, of husbands and wives and fathers and daughters and, most
mysteriously, the human heart.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: CONCEPT DU JOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Synergy _ that notorious buzzword of the '80s routinely invoked
to sanctify hundreds of ultimately failed mergers and acquisitions
_ is back in heavy rotation.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it is being called into play by the media industry.
With the cable televisionary Geraldine Laybourne departing Walt
Disney Co. to start her own television and Internet studio, and
with the magazine mogul Tina Brown leaving the resolutely
mono-media New Yorker to do a print-film-television start-up for
Miramax Films, ``synergy'' has become the media world's
high-concept du jour.
</P>
<P>
   Boiled down, what the term describes is parking old content in a
new garage: If you liked the movie, then you'll love the TV show,
the book, the magazine piece, the video game, the soundtrack, the
action figures, the desk accessories and _ au courant! _ the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years ago, when interactive digital media were first
appearing, old-line media executives had another name for this.
They called it ``repurposing.''
</P>
<P>
   But was it ever a bust. The overwhelming number of failures
(among the most notable a CD-ROM of Life magazine covers) gave the
concept a black eye and made it hard for a budding interactive
entertainment industry to find any buyers for its own inventive
gestalt.
</P>
<P>
   That gestalt _ call it the New Synergy _ is all that the digital
world has come to represent: interactive and decentralized and
networked right down to its DNA. New Synergists believe that what
traditional companies try to pass off as ``synergy'' will continue
to fail until they embrace digital, interactive media and its
emerging role in pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Martinez, the chairman of a San Francisco-based interactive
production company, Postlinear Entertainment, is a New Synergy
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   In what he dubs the ``postlinear world,'' an entertainment
property starts simply as a very loose story structure, ``populated
only with characters and ambient conflicts.'' From those loose
elements, Martinez said, you can create films, games, comic books,
whatever you like.
</P>
<P>
   But because media companies now want to control all the options
for any project _ or ``chew all the flavor out of the gum,'' in
Martinez's words _ the only way for independent producers like
Postlinear to succeed is by the flukiest, most unpredictable of
phenomena, a crossover hit.
</P>
<P>
   These are rare indeed; the most successful is Carmen Sandiego,
the dashing international thief whose career as a star of
television and books was begun in a Broderbund Software video game.
More recent is Lara Croft, the vastly endowed cyber-Barbie star of
a popular video game, Tomb Raider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lara's Book,'' by Kip Ward and Douglas Coupland, author of
``Generation X,'' was published this month. Paramount Pictures will
release a Tomb Raider movie in 1999, and the ``Lara Croft Come
Alive'' CD is already on shelves in France. Croft worship has
spawned more than 2,000 Web sites in many languages, including The
Croft Times (http://www.cubeit.com/ctimes/).
</P>
<P>
   Amid today's Internet boom, with industries left and right
making the global network the core of their businesses, many New
Synergists are amazed that traditional media companies continue to
treat the Net as some ancillary distribution medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you not care about the Internet?'' Martinez said.
``The Internet is becoming a superset of all other media. At some
point, interactive media producers are going to have to create
flat-out digital labels as the first medium and move them into
things like film and TV _ not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``other way around'' problem has plagued other notable New
Synergists, as well. Allee Willis and Prudence Fenton, two of the
most innovative artists in the interactive world, have just come
off a bad trip of more than five years trying to sell their
cutting-edge Willisville interactive media project to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Highly acknowledged artists in many genres _ including
songwriting, animation, film and television production _ they
developed an entertainment environment that defined New Synergy.
Willisville _ a ``cul-de-sac on the information superhighway''
populated with bizarre and charming characters _ was to have its
richest presence on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Willisville was built for fluid, continuing connections to and
from television, shopping, e-mail, creativity tools and more. But
in the days when they were shopping the project, the reaction was
always the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was really excited to see it,'' Ms. Willis said.
``We'd go through elaborate conversations before we took these
meetings and say, `We are in complete opposition to the way
entertainment is being developed for the Web. We don't think the
idea is to have a TV show and go online and buy a T-shirt and be
able to chat with the actors.' And everyone would say, `Of course,
we believe in a totally radical approach; we're the place for
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she added, ``their eyes would cross as soon as we'd start
talking about it, and they'd start talking about doing these stupid
`Web-isodes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lammers, chief executive of the children's entertainment
company Headbone Interactive, was luckier than Ms. Willis. She will
take Headbone's popular ``Elroy'' video game character to the TV
screen this fall. But it took years to sell television executives
on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustrating part of dealing with traditional media
companies is they've got a huge business and infrastructure to
support, so they limit the creative risk they're willing to take,''
Ms. Lammers said. ``You can cross over from TV to the Web, but the
most original material, the brain surgery stuff, is going on in the
new media because that's the hard part.''

PLANNING CAN HELP REDUCE SURVIVORS' COSTS AND ANGUISH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Joanne Reich visited her parents recently, they
showed her their grave site, gave her their lawyer's business card
and discussed their funeral plans, even though they don't
anticipate a service any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister thought it was gross and creepy. I thought it was
healthy,'' says Reich, support-services manager at Omega House, a
hospice for AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Face it.
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't like to think about death, much less discuss
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think talking about it maybe brings it on quicker,''
says Darryl J. Roberts, author of ``Profits of Death'' (Five Star
Publications, $17.95), a consumer book on how to cut funeral costs.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts finds that when he talks about his area of expertise at
dinner parties, people express some uneasiness and then become
fascinated with the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``But doing something about it is a whole different story,'' he
says. ``We really have a responsibility to face up to it and do the
necessary research to prepare for it, and that's what we don't
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and other experts agree that a little planning can make
a world of difference when the time comes _ not only in reducing
the cost of the funeral but also in sparing survivors anguish and
indecision about doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of death, families are so emotional and
vulnerable,'' says Molly Harrison, senior clinical social worker at
The Hospice at the Texas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more of that whole decision-making process that's either
done ahead of time or by someone else carrying out the wishes (of
the deceased) just tends to make it less stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospice offers a booklet, ``Let the Choice Be Mine,'' to
help patients plan their funerals or memorial services. It includes
space for instructions on everything from hair and makeup
preferences to the type of service desired.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts says the family should sit down ahead of time and
discuss the person's wishes and research the best money-saving
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody goes out and just buys a refrigerator, right? They wait
for a sale, look it up on the Internet or read Consumer's Digest,''
he says. ``But most funerals are bought when a loved one dies.
That's the worst time.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to do when someone dies is to hire a death-care
consultant, he advises. For a few hundred dollars, the consultant
researches the best prices on funeral merchandise and services.
Roberts says a consultant can shave several thousand dollars off
the cost of a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Lambert, owner of a Houston-based consultant service called
Funeral Shoppers, says most families are baffled by the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funeral homes are like car dealerships. There are some
wonderful ones, but a lot of them will rip you off in a
heartbeat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert, who charges 10 percent of whatever a family saves by
using his services, coaches clients to resist high-pressure sales
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   He advises them to request a price list before visiting a
funeral home, to ask to see every casket on the price list, to
never buy anything on the first visit, and to compare prices with
competing funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't or don't want to hire a consultant, Roberts
suggests taking someone along to the funeral home who is less
emotionally involved.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert is wary of prepaid funeral plans. ``Everybody ought to
preplan their funerals, but you don't need to prepurchase, because
once a funeral home has your money, they have you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to prepay a funeral, Roberts advises buying
an insurance policy from your local agent rather than a funeral
home, which may try to push a less economical dollar-for-dollar
policy.
</P>
<P>
   If you purchase a prepaid policy, make sure the price is
guaranteed and the policy can be transferred to another funeral
home in case you move out of the city or state.

MANY UNIVERSITIES ARE GOING `VIRTUAL' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PAMELA BURDMAN   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the University of Colorado at Denver put
courses online to boost its adult education program last year,
almost 80 percent of those who enrolled turned out to be on-campus
undergraduates who preferred the convenience of logging on at
midnight to waking up for an 8 a.m. lecture.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't what officials expected, but it may have been a
glimpse of their future. All across the country, going to college
is acquiring a whole new meaning as higher education undergoes a
virtual transformation, one that some predict will make traditional
campuses the dinosaurs of the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted by physical location or summer breaks, the cyber
classes have captured the imagination of college leaders and public
officials seeking to educate more students for less money. Even
corporate executives are eyeing a piece of the higher-education
market, worth several hundred billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   But critics are questioning the very premise that more high-tech
is better when it comes to education. They worry that colleges are
forgetting the merits of a traditional college education in favor
of simply dispensing information and churning out degrees. How,
they ask, will virtual colleges help students learn how to interact
with others and become good citizens?
</P>
<P>
   ``This step in the electronic direction is . . . a
depersonalizing of education,'' said Ed Condren, a Chaucer scholar
at UCLA. ``It suggests that facts or degrees make one an educated
person _ instead of considered thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Distance learning has been around for years, through
correspondence courses, satellite television and CD-ROMs. Many,
perhaps most, college classes already use e-mail communication and
Web sites with multimedia teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   But virtual classrooms go a big step further, completely
replacing face-to-face sessions with online lectures, reading
assignments and discussion groups. Some of them are self-paced, but
often groups of students proceed through assignments on roughly the
same schedule. That allows for continuous, though asynchronous,
classroom discussion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pioneers of this approach to learning is the
for-profit University of Phoenix, with online headquarters in San
Francisco and nearly 4,000 students in virtual classes. Students
are also taking entire courses online at many of the nation's
traditional institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
   California schools are among those moving most aggressively into
the new domain, through alliances with high-tech corporations. And
they are proceeding so quickly that experts can only speculate
about how many students are taking courses online.
</P>
<P>
   -- At UC Berkeley Extension, about 1,300 students are taking
courses via America Online, and Dean Mary Metz says the school
hopes to have enrolled a total of 5,000 by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   -- At UCLA, about 750 students were enrolled in about 220
extension courses this spring through the Home Education Network,
which was recently renamed OnlineLearning.Net. According to
President John Kobara, the company has the rights to put all 4,500
UCLA Extension courses on the Internet, though some faculty members
dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   -- At Golden Gate University in San Francisco, 600 students are
taking 30 summer courses through the school's CyberCampus. Golden
Gate has used the services of two Bay Area companies _ Convene and
Well-Engaged _ to deliver the courses. Before long, speculates
Provost Chris Lefferts, half of the university's students could be
in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Association of Schools and Colleges has already
accredited 30 virtual degree programs on the West Coast, including
a doctoral program in Transformative Learning and Change at the
California Institute of Integral Studies and a master's program in
nursing leadership at Sonoma State University.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those courses are available via the California Virtual
University, an electronic catalog of online courses at 89
accredited schools throughout the state. CVU was started by
Governor Pete Wilson to promote virtual education by bringing the
state's world-class universities together with leading high-tech
and entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   CVU was designed to compete for students with the Western
Governors' University, an institution formed by 17 other states and
Guam. But there is one big difference: WGU will grant degrees,
while the California program works as an information bank to help
students locate courses and degree programs in the state that are
offered online.
</P>
<P>
   Both CVU and WGU were touted as ways to teach more students with
less money. But so far the cost savings are theoretical at best.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges typically don't even know how much money they are
spending on information technology, said Christopher Oberg of the
Claremont Graduate University, a former college administrator. ``We
are loath to find out what it costs, because we fear the answer
will make us look silly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Rand Corporation concluded that colleges could
trim costs by replacing faculty with technology, but author David
McArthur said most schools are reluctant to do that because they're
trying to prove the online medium works through more teacher
contact, not less. Designing courses on the Web is also more
expensive _ anywhere from $20,000 to $3 million per course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distance learning is a wildfire,'' said Michael Lambert of the
Distance Education and Training Council. ``It's going to cost three
times as much if you continue along this current track.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts on the new techniques insist that, done right,
online learning involves more, not less, teacher-student
interaction than traditional classes _ the very reason why it's not
necessarily cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more work,'' said Golden Gate University Associate
Dean Mary Canning, who teaches a course in taxation online. ``My
students have to e-mail their assignments to me on a weekly basis,
then I mail back comments on their assignments. In the classroom, I
can tell by their faces when I'm losing somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Harisim, a professor at Simon Fraser University in
Vancouver and director of a study of distance learning methods
throughout Canada, reports that students actually participate more
online.
</P>
<P>
   That's because in traditional classrooms, the professor uses 80
percent of the allotted time and a handful of students dominate the
rest, said Harisim. Online courses, on the other hand, allow more
participation by students who are shy, speak a foreign language or
are slow to formulate their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Harisim worked with a group of graduate students who actually
preferred the virtual classroom to the real thing. ``They said they
got to know one another better,'' she recalled. ``They said it was
a meeting of minds. They got to know what everyone was thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   While traditionalists insist that the best learning can only
happen in a classroom, Harisim said even poor online classes may be
no worse than large lecture courses in which students never so much
as look a professor in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Whether particular programs are up to snuff ultimately will be
decided by accreditors. But Steven Crow of the North Central
Association of Colleges and Schools, an accrediting association in
Chicago, said accreditors generally accept the premise of online
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly concerned about the quality of learning
that can be delivered through the Internet any more than I'm
concerned about the quality delivered through sending out CD-ROMs
or videotapes, and those things have been going on for a long
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Research to date suggests that Crow has good reason to be
optimistic. ``In study after study,'' said Langdon Winner of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, ``what is found is
that some students do a little better, some students do a little
worse, and for the rest there is no significant difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say the real virtue of the virtual classroom lies
not in cutting costs, but in expanding access to a college-age
population that over the next decade will increase by 3 million
students nationwide, including nearly half a million in California.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Rodota, Wilson's deputy chief of staff, said it is still
unclear how many of those ``Tidal Wave II'' students the state can
realistically educate online. ``A significant portion of those
enrollments will be addressed through distance education,'' he
said, ``but the definition of significant is yet to be known.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainties, many governors seem confident that
the public's money is better spent creating virtual colleges than
building campuses.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey by the Education Commission of the States, a
majority of governors said they place a high value on technologies
that let students take classes any time, anywhere. Few stressed the
need for students to have a traditional on-campus experience.
</P>
<P>
   Of 35 governors who responded to the survey, 34 said technology
is their first-choice strategy for improving access to a college
education.
</P>
<P>
   This thinking is already beginning to play out:
</P>
<P>
   CSU's newest campus, on the old Fort Ord site in Monterey Bay,
has plans to enroll a majority of its projected 25,000 students
online. And though UC is planning a 10th campus, in Merced, that
campus is being designed with cyber-age technologies in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Such stories leave some professors suspicious that the move
toward electronic learning is a thinly veiled way to automate
education, turn courses into widgets and lay off faculty members.
At the very least, they say, these plans for undergraduates seem
inconsistent with the oft-stated purpose of virtual classrooms: to
reach those adults who can't spare the time from work or family to
visit a college campus.
</P>
<P>
   In interview after interview, students, teachers and parents
said that going to college with live professors is an option that
shouldn't go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like edutainment or Socrates with a soundtrack,''
said Maria Quintero, who just finished her junior year at Pomona
College. ``We want flesh-and-blood professors _ people to inspire
us, to infuriate us, to motivate us.`
</P>
<P>
   Though fewer of today's college students are 18- to
24-year-olds, the idea of those students going to school online
gives pause even to fans of the virtual campus.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Frey, 40, of Gualala, a student at Golden Gate's
CyberCampus, is a case in point. Because she lives two hours from
the nearest college campus, the Internet made it possible for her
to pursue a master's degree _ and made her a devotee of virtual
learning.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't even consider that option when her 18-year-old
daughter was looking into colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``An 18-year-old needs that feeling of campus life and what it's
like to go to college,'' said Frey. ``If everything is online, they
don't have a chance to broaden their horizons.''
</P>
<P>
   Even cyber enthusiasts say the medium has its limits. ``I
wouldn't want to teach an acting class over the Web,'' said
Lefferts of Golden Gate University. ``I would not want to teach
crisis-intervention skills over the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Michael Lambert of the Distance Education and Training
Council: ``The adult learner loves it, but I have three sons, and I
would not want them to be distance learners.''
</P>
<P>
   Few believe that campuses will be discarded altogether, and most
experts think the college education of the future will include some
combination of online and on-campus instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, I think we'll always have campuses,'' said Sally
Johnstone of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education
in Colorado. ``We have to send these children away. There's more
that goes on at a campus than listening to a faculty member.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would question whether 10, 15 years from now it will be
the norm that a kid goes to a campus for four or five years. What's
so magical about that?''
</P>

NETTING A JOB THROUGH SPECIALIZED WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CAROL EMERT   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Dahl had been given notice by his employer and needed to
find a new job fast.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper classifieds were of little help because Dahl's field _
funeral-parlor marketing _ is an esoteric one. But after 20 minutes
surfing the World Wide Web, Dahl, a resident of Cleveland, found a
want ad at Funeralnet (www.funeralnet.com) that seemed promising.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, he received a response to an e-mail query, and
in two days, he had a face-to-face interview. One month after his
Web search began, he was on the job at Brunner Funeral Home, 20
miles from his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so easy, as opposed to sending out resumes in the mail,
waiting a week and then getting a postcard saying, `You may hear
from us in six more weeks,''' said Dahl, who before his Web search
had mailed out dozens of paper resumes with no results.
</P>
<P>
   Dahl's experience is not typical, of course. Job hunting over
the Web generally involves a substantial time commitment and many
megabytes of frustration, just like conventional job searches.
</P>
<P>
   But Dahl's case does illustrate the value of the Web for
job-seeking in highly specialized fields. In the mortuary business,
for example, there are no nationwide trade publications, so a Web
site is the perfect way to reach members in the geographically
diverse industry.
</P>
<P>
   In just the past two years, hundreds of helpful Web sites have
been created with information for highly specialized groups. Some
of the sites are strictly employment related while others,
including Funeralnet, list classifieds as one of many features.
</P>
<P>
   Employment experts recommend that job seekers try targeted Web
sites before approaching humongous career sites such as America's
Job Bank (www.ajb.dni.us) whose hundreds of thousands of job
listings can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a smattering of examples of specialized sites:
</P>
<P>
   _ Starchefs (www.starchefs.com), which started as a
consumer-oriented Web site with recipes and chef profiles, has
become an important employment resource in the restaurant industry.
It currently lists about 300 job listings and 200 resumes for chefs
and other restaurant personnel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty Plus of Northern California (www.sirius.com/40plus)
posts resumes for professionals aged 40 and over. To use the site,
people must pay a membership fee, attend meetings and volunteer
time to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   _ Saludos Web (www.saludos.com) offers a job bank and a resume
database for Spanish-speaking professionals and recent college
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Produce Job Exchange (www.producejobs.com) lists resumes
and jobs for positions such as produce brokers and grocery store
vegetable buyers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Layover.com (www.layover.com) is a key resource for truckers
who stay connected to the non-interstate world through their
laptops. It contains listings for full-time jobs and individual
hauls for independent truckers, as well as information on labor
disputes, trucker health and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asia-Net (www.asia-net.com) matches job openings with job
seekers who speak English and Asian languages such as Japanese,
Korean or Mandarin. Asia-Net posts helpful information such as a
salary index and job listings. It also e-mails new listings to a
database of 40,000 bilingual professionals, mostly in technical and
financial fields.
</P>
<P>
   _ List Foundation (www.listfoundation.org) caters mainly to
multimedia types. It lists Bay Area jobs and other information for
the South of Market crowd, including apartment classifieds and art
gallery openings.
</P>
<P>
   _ COACH (www.coachhelp.com) lists football-coaching openings as
far away as Australia and has resumes for coaches of all sports.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women in Technology International (www.witi.com) offers job
and resume databases, employer profiles and electronic networking
opportunities for women in technical fields.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines are the best way to find relevant Web sites. Dahl
said he found Funeralnet quickly by plugging in the search words
``funeral industry'' on Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Another good resource is the book Career Xroads
(www.careerxroads.com), by Gerry Crispin and Mark Mehler, which is
updated annually. The 1998 version lists the 500 top job-hunting
sites, and next year's may have as many as 700.
</P>
<P>
   Job seekers may be charged a small fee, such as $20, to post a
resume on some sites, but most get paid only by employers.
</P>
<P>
   Asia-Net, for example, charges employers $795 to e-mail job
notices to thousands of potential applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites operate their classifieds for free. Funeralnet and
Starchefs, for example, provide the ads as a service to both
employers and job seekers. Starchefs is thinking about starting to
charge, though, now that its classified section has become so
popular, said site co-founder Fern Berman.
</P>
<P>
   Career Xroads co-author Mehler advises job hunters to use
services that e-mail job notices to them, rather than posting their
resumes in Web databanks. That minimizes the chance a current
employer will come across the resume, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites will post ``blind'' resumes _ without names, home
addresses and, sometimes, current employers _ to protect job
candidates' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   COMPANY SITES
</P>
<P>
   Job postings on corporate home pages are another good way for
Web job seekers to target their searches as long as they know for
which companies they want to work.
</P>
<P>
   QVC Inc., for example, uses newspaper classifieds less often
since it began posting jobs on its Web site (www.IQVC.com). This
year, more than a quarter of new hires responded to job notices on
the corporate home page, said Jean Brown, manager of human
resources at the Westchester, Pa.-based cable network.
</P>
<P>
   IQVC's job section is getting so much traffic that QVC is
planning to launch a separate employment-related Web site, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the standard job listings, a few businesses post
interactive exercises to help job hunters evaluate whether they
would be a good fit at the company.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Texas Instruments' ``Fit Check'' (www.ti.com)
allows potential applicants to answer a range of questions on
topics such as whether they prefer a smoke-free environment,
whether they are team players and what type of corporate dress code
they like best.
</P>
<P>
   Then, TI compares the applicants' responses to the answers that
fit best with Texas Instruments' corporate policies and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting's Web site (www.ac.com) allows potential
applicants to plug in various criteria such as their area of
expertise, salary requirement, preferred city of residence and
willingness to travel. The site then churns out matches.
</P>
<P>
   To research potential employers, Mehler recommends Hoover's
Online (www.hoovers.com), a storehouse of corporate information.
E-mail addresses for human resources staff or other personnel at
your employer of choice often can be found through the HotBot
search engine (www.hotbot.com).
</P>
<P>
   Advice on laying out a resume for computer purposes can be found
at the Web site of Resumix (www.resumix.com), a maker of staffing
software.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER OPTIONS
</P>
<P>
   If the targeted Web sites don't bear fruit, Mehler suggests that
applicants check one of the mega job sites such as Monster Board,
Career Mosaic (www.careermosaic.com), Online Career Center
(www.occ.com) and Nation Job (www.nationjob.com).
</P>
<P>
   Other good sites include Job Smart (www.jobsmart.org), which
specializes in California-based jobs, and Career Path
(www.careerpath.com), an assemblage of classifieds from 58
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent college grads should check out JobDirect
(www.jobdirect.com), JobTrak (www.jobtrak.com), JobWeb
(www.jobweb.org) and BridgePath Employment Services
(www.bridgepath.com).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the plethora of resources available on the Web, Mehler
encourages job applicants to use conventional search techniques as
well, especially networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is still just a tool _ it will never replace
face-to-face communication,'' Mehler said. ``I believe in three to
five years, the maximum the Web will have is 25 to 35 percent of
the job market,'' up from an estimated 3 to 5 percent today.

Mac News: Periodic refinements help operating system 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to the software that controls its
computers, Apple Computer abandoned revolution for evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when, every couple of years, the company
released a major new version of the software that controls its
computers. Now modest upgrades come like clockwork every six months
_ a major achievement in and of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, none of these semiannual upgrades has been
anything special. But taken as a group over the past two years,
they represent significant change. For example, Apple Computer has
slowly but surely changed what users see on the screen. It has also
sped up routine tasks such as copying files.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Apple Computer plans to release another six-month
upgrade. It will be called OS 8.5. Once again, the upgrade contains
nothing earth-shattering. Yet there are plenty of small but useful
improvements. Here's a description of some of the more important
changes scheduled for OS 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   At long last, Apple Computer has gotten around to updating its
Find command. With OS 8.5, this command will become a three-tabbed
window. One tab will let you search your computer by file name,
another by content within a file and the third will launch a search
across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another helpful new feature is called Keychain. It is a database
that will let you store all your Net IDs and passwords in one place
on your computer. All you'll have to remember is one password,
which unlocks the Keychain database.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but surely Apple Computer has been changing the look of
its OS. Now the company will let you do it. OS 8.5 will let users
customize virtually any or all of its appearance, including
windows, menu bars, icons and scroll bars.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of scroll bars, these too are getting overhauled in
OS 8.5. The biggest improvement is something called ``live
scrolling,'' which automatically updates a window's contents in
real time as you scroll.
</P>
<P>
   OS 8.5 will also let you, as an option, add double scrolling
arrows to both sides of the scroll bar. That will give any window
up and down arrows at both the top and the bottom, reducing use of
the mouse to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements include consolidating some control panels,
which let you set how some features work. For example, one Internet
control panel will act as a front end for setting all online
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about OS 8.5, check out a recent article on
the MacWorld home page. You'll find it at http://www

`PEOPLE HAVE BECOME MORE OPEN' AS CUSTOMIZED FUNERALS PAY TRIBUTE
TO DECEASED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trims, optional ending) 
 
By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When their adult son died in a car accident, the
prominent Houston-area family had definite ideas on how they wished
to bury him.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives requested that his two honey-colored Labrador
retrievers stand guard at each end of the casket during the
service. Afterward, they wanted a lavish reception with Beluga
caviar and premium liquor before the trip to the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   When they made it clear they would go elsewhere if the funeral
home couldn't meet their demands, Bob Jones, president of Geo. H.
Lewis &AMP; Sons, didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your caterer or ours?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral service went off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the most well-behaved dogs,'' Jones recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Such a customized funeral is no longer that unusual. Whether for
the rich and famous or the unknown, services are increasingly
paying tribute to the deceased in ways that would have been frowned
upon a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Scripture, prayer and sermons remain an integral part of
many services, today's funerals also regularly include photographs,
heartfelt eulogies from the person's friends and favorite secular
songs.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral homes report that the theme song from the movie
``Titanic,'' Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On,'' is a favorite
at services throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Other top requests include Whitney Houston's ``I Will Always
Love You,'' Bette Midler's ``The Wind Beneath My Wings,'' Dion's
``Because You Loved Me'' and Led Zeppelin's ``Stairway to Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Balloons and floral arrangements shaped like a golf club, guitar
or other hobby are not uncommon. In some cases, the departed's
paintings, furniture and beloved pets have been brought in for the
service.
</P>
<P>
   There's also likely to be an open bar along with the open
casket. An industry newsletter, Funeral Monitor, recently noted
that in Texas, the operative principle at a growing number of
funeral homes is ``having your wake and eating there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have become more open,'' says etiquette expert Annie
Cater, who reports that much of the cocktail-party chatter she's
heard lately is from people planning their funerals. ``Now it's
become a celebration of their time on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cater, who turns 70 next year and has no immediate intention of
passing on, has already mapped out her funeral plans. When the time
comes, she wants to be cremated and have her ashes divided into
little blue boxes from Tiffany jewelers for her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I am going to every social event in Houston,'' she says.
``My friends are taking me with them wherever they go. I am going
to have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Funerals also are increasingly adding high-tech touches. Some
families are having services videotaped and inserting e-mail
addresses in obituary listings to facilitate the sending of
condolences.
</P>
<P>
   During some services, events of the deceased's life have been
shown on videotape, says the Rev. Michael Patrick Williams, senior
pastor of the Joy Tabernacle Church in northeast Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting more touchy-feely about everything,'' he says.
``You see that on the talk shows. People are willing to get up and
tell very personal things about themselves. There's a real sense
that it's OK to be soft.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the service for Princess Diana last year included
soft touches never before seen at a royal funeral. Elton John sang
a new version of the pop song ``Candle in the Wind,'' dedicated to
the princess. The Bible reading, a passage from 1 Corinthians,
contained references to faith and hope more commonly heard at
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Helen Havens, rector of St. Stephens Episcopal Church
in Houston, says she heard some grumblings that the service wasn't
``straight prayer book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought it was splendid,'' Havens says. ``The family was
fiercely trying to make it Diana's and not stiff and stodgy. I
think it reached the people, and it reached me.''

   Four-legged creatures played a part in recent memorial services
for Linda McCartney, who was an animal-rights activist before she
succumbed to breast cancer in April.
</P>
<P>
   In London, two of her Shetland ponies were led to the front of
St. Martin-in-the-Fields church. In New York, Pamela Fowler Grace
of Cat Spring rode her brown-and-white-dappled Appaloosa down the
carpeted aisle of Riverside Church while Paul McCartney talked
about his late wife.
</P>
<P>
   At both services, the former Beatle remarked that the inclusion
of animals would have have been his wife's favorite part of the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it's not only the rich and famous who have tailored such
individualized services.
</P>
<P>
   When electrician Elting ``Jerry'' Deyo died four months ago
after suffering a debilitating stroke, his relatives decided to add
some personal touches to the funeral after talking with officials
at Brentwood Funeral Home in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They included photographs of him from various times in his life
and added a floral arrangement in the shape of a guitar, since he
had played in a band for many years. The funeral procession passed
by several nightclubs where he had performed, and his son played
guitar at the grave site.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral home also videotaped the service for the family,
adding photographs and music to the ``tribute video.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a keepsake,'' says his widow, Janis, who has shown
the video to some who were unable to attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   She adds that her husband, who didn't want the family to make a
fuss over a funeral, would have liked what took place. ``It
couldn't have been better,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Such personalized services were a rarity when Molly Harrison
went to work at The Hospice at the Texas Medical Center 11 years
ago; funerals were usually formal and traditional, she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many memorial services she attends include pictures,
posters and testimonials.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She recalls a recent service for a young girl in which her
kindergarten classmates sang, everyone released pink balloons, and
her mother spoke movingly about the ways the child had touched
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ripped your heart out, but it was very cathartic,'' says
Harrison, senior clinical social worker at the hospice. ``So much
of what a funeral service should be is to begin the grief process.
It's a ritual that we need to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harrison credits the hospice movement with helping to break down
some of the taboos surrounding death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people are getting a little more time at the end
of their lives to put things in order,'' she says. ``What it's done
is make talking about death a more acceptable thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The national debate about assisted suicide and a person's right
to die has led some people to talk about their personal wishes on
such issues, she believes.
</P>
<P>
   With many families dispersed geographically and lacking family
homes to retire to after funerals, some look to the funeral home
for more than services and burials.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Jones of Geo. H. Lewis &AMP; Sons began receiving
inquiries from families about catering funeral-related events. In
response, the funeral home added a room called ``The Pavilion'' at
its Galleria-area location in southwest Houston, where mourners can
gather for cocktails and canapes.
</P>
<P>
   The room has a full kitchen with china, crystal stemware and
uniformed staff. Valet parking is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you used to do at home, you can do here,'' says Jones,
who has handled the funerals of such notables as Howard Hughes and
Howard Marshall, the husband of Anna Nicole Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Etiquette expert Cater finds nothing wrong with such activities,
as long as they're done in good taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal choice. To have the opportunity for friends
and relatives to get together and do their mourning in their own
way is a very gracious thing to do. It gives you some closure for
the person you've lost,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Williams agrees that personalizing a funeral can go a
long way in helping the grieving process. He recalls a somber
funeral for a man who had committed suicide that was brightened
when some of his friends got up and spoke about the pranks he'd
pulled in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought a needed balance and added a very human dimension
to the service,'' he says. ``The Bible says laughter is good
medicine.''

Tech Tools: Which graphic format depends on your needs 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week, we answered some questions posed by reader
Bob Wildau. We'll continue this week with some more from him
concerning the various graphic compression formats, which he finds
bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confused by all the various systems for handling
photographs on the computer and various peripherals, i.e. BMP vs
JPEG, JPG vs. GIF, etc. I have software from HP Photo and LviewPro,
plus whatever comes with Win 95, but I can't make any sense out of
them. Is there any one such system one could rely on for everything
and throw the others away?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the graphics compression formats one encounters are
proprietary, and native to a particular graphics program. For
instance, BMP (it stands for bitmap) is the standard format used
for Windows and Windows Paint. Then you have TIF and EPS and PCX
and so on and so on.
</P>
<P>
   GIF (Graphic Interchange Files) is the standard devised for
graphics storage by CompuServe. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic
Experts Group and is shortened in file names to JPG. GIF and JPG
are the standard formats used for graphics on the Internet and the
World Wide Web, apparently the direction in which Wildau is
heading.
</P>
<P>
   The chief difference in all these formats is the quality of the
image and the space it takes up in storage. Typically, the
proprietary formats such as BMP and TIF will be many times larger
than the same image stored as GIF or JPG. JPG is a ``lossy''
format, which basically means some data is lost in compression and
the resulting image will not be as sharp as the original, but most
people cannot see any difference.
</P>
<P>
   Scanner software will allow the user to save a file in any of
several different formats, depending on what the end use will be.
If this software is attached to a quality draw program, as it
usually is, the draw program will probably convert a file from one
format to another. Thus if someone sends you a photo in TIF format,
you can translate it into JPG.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closely related,'' Wildau writes, ``I will soon have to
specify for folks who want to add a head shot to their listings on
an organizational Web site what size of picture to have scanned
into what type of graphics file, but I don't understand the
relationship between the size and quality of the original picture,
the amount of digital detail on the scan (thus the size and
cumbersomeness of the file), and the quality of the resulting image
on the Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   I should think that it would be worth Wildau's time to invest in
a scanner for his home office and have these people send him the
photograph to be scanned; otherwise there's bound to be confusion
if he tries to specify resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the scanning software with which I am familiar, the size of
the picture depends upon the resolution specified. The image can be
scaled down as required in a graphics program, but the size, and
thus the space requirements, of the original will remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   However, if someone sends Wildau a photo that is far too large,
he needs only to scale it to the size he wants, save that version
and get rid of the larger original version.
</P>
<P>
   To judge quality, some experimentation will be necessary.
Computer graphics experts can take a lousy photograph and make it
look good using a program like PhotoShop, but that's a career.
Obviously, the ordinary user doesn't want to spent the effort
necessary to become an expert in doctoring pictures. This is
another good reason to do all the scanning yourself.

Cyberscene: Psst! Net gives you a chance to snoop 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've spent much time on the Internet, you've
probably received a junk e-mail or two offering you the chance to
buy a book or register at a Web site that would let you in on the
secrets of how to obtain personal information about others on the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   Usually it's dressed up as a chance to get the information for
background employment checks or to learn the kind of personal
information that others can find out about you using the Net. But
the real appeal is to the human urge to snoop _ to learn how much
your neighbors paid for their house, find out if your best friend
ever filed for bankruptcy, or just to check out your daughter's new
boyfriend ... the one who always looked a little shifty.
</P>
<P>
   Let's spend today snooping on the snoopers and see just what's
available on the Web and how it is used. The first lesson to learn
is that personal information is available on the Net. The second
lesson is that much of it is the same sort of information you could
obtain free at government offices. The Net just makes snooping
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites that offer personal information do so as a business.
You pay for what you get. For today we'll ignore those sites and
concentrate on the places where you can get information free.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at a site that does charge but offers users a chance
to get a free taste. It calls itself KnowX, ``Your Courthouse on
the Web,'' and can be found at http://www.knowx.com/. If you
confine your searches to the off-peak hours _ before 11 a.m. or
after 6 p.m. _ you'll be able to search several categories,
including real estate property records, death records and telephone
numbers, at no charge. In some cases, if KnowX finds specific
records, you'll be told the actual transcript of the record can
only be obtained by paying a fee (sometimes as little as 95 cents
or as much as about $7 a record).
</P>
<P>
   A site like KnowX is just the place to find out about liens,
bankruptcy filings, lawsuits and death records. But some of the
most interesting tidbits aren't as official. That's why any
snooping should include a good search of the Web. After all, now
that almost everyone has a Web site and uses that site to publish
the most boring and sometimes intimate details of their life, it's
an obvious place to look.
</P>
<P>
   When you're searching for information about a person who isn't
famous, stay away from the Yahoo! search engine. It is indexed
according to topic and doesn't actually search the text of each Web
page. Instead, use a search engine such as AltaVista at
http://altavista.digital.com.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you're looking for information about me. Take a tip
from a good fisherman and cast a wide net first. Simply enter my
name. With AltaVista use a + symbol in front of each search word;
otherwise you'd get hits for all pages that contain references to
``Bill'' or to ``Husted,'' when what you really want is all pages
that contain references to ``Bill Husted.'' Once you've gotten a
sampling from the broad search, you can narrow it, perhaps using
the name of the city where I work and the newspaper ``Atlanta'' and
``Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Next try searching the newsgroups _ that's where people post
messages about a broad variety of topics _ using a search engine
called DejaNews at http://www.dejanews.com/. Since the newsgroups
are chatty places, you'll often find out what most reporters
already know _ people love to talk about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you can check out telephone numbers and addresses at
the excellent Switchboard site (http://www.switchboard
</P>
<P>
   .com/). You can also get e-mail addresses from the same site.
</P>
<P>
   None of these sites will turn you into an international super
spy. But if you search for information about yourself, you will
undoubtedly discover an astonishing amount of information and come
to realize the information superhighway is a two-way street.

TechnoBuddy: Possible problem with custom installation in WindowsBy Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Windows 98 isn't an important program, it's just a
minor upgrade. That's what everyone says. If you've followed the
introduction of Microsoft's newest Windows in the magazines, on TV
or in the newspaper, you've heard it for yourself. I've written
those same words.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if Windows 98 is such a minor deal, then why can't we all
stop writing about it? Here I am writing about it again today
--scared to death you'll slam down the newspaper and think: Why
can't that TechnoBuddy guy write about genealogy programs, or
faster modems or how to use your PC to grow the perfect tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, when a program is introduced that will be
--sooner or later -- used by almost everyone who has a PC, then it
is a big deal. Windows, after all, is the platform used to run all
your PC programs. Just a little shiver from that platform and your
whole computing world shakes.
</P>
<P>
   I started out believing -- and writing -- that Windows 98 is a
worthwhile improvement over Windows 95. I said, and still believe,
that it seems more stable and less likely to freeze; works faster;
and has features that are real improvements over Windows 95. I've
been using it for months now, if you count time spent with test
versions, and have had few problems. I wouldn't want to go back to
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But I keep hearing credible and frequent reports -- from
friends, from the Internet and other publications -- that disturb
me. Almost all of them are about user problems that occur when
installing Windows 98. I don't much like being in the rumor
business, but when things get to the point where Microsoft feels
compelled to acknowledge and deny the rumors -- a July 10 press
release said: ``Contrary to recent reports, the majority of PCs can
be upgraded to Windows 98 without any trouble'' -- it's time to
tell you what I've heard and let you decide.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are consistent in saying trouble with Windows 98 is
most likely to come during the installation. And luckily there's a
specific pattern that will let me give you some advice that -- if
there really is an installation glitch with Windows 98 -- will give
you a good chance of avoiding problems yourself. The pattern
suggests most of the installation woes come when people take the
option for a custom installation.
</P>
<P>
   When you install Windows, you'll be given two choices. You can
accept the default installation option and let Windows itself
decide what portion of the program to install and where to put it,
or you can make the decisions for yourself. I'm suggesting, for
starters, you choose the default installation option. The good
thing about doing this is you can always go back and use the
Add/Remove Software icon in the Control Panel to add and remove
portions of Windows after the installation.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing I suggest is you go to the Microsoft Web site at
http://www
</P>
<P>
   .microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl/default.htm and check out the Windows
98 ``hardware compatibility list.'' You'll find a listing of PCs
and other hardware with known incompatibilities with Windows 98.
That list is too long to reproduce here. But you'll want to check
it out before installing Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Then, make sure your PC meets the minimum system requirements to
run Windows 98. You'll also find that information on the Web site
but -- and this is a boiled-down version -- you must have at least
a 80486DX/66 processor and a Pentium is much better; 16 megabytes
of RAM; and about 195 megabytes of free hard disk space. Keep in
mind that is the minimum. If your machine fits somewhere on the
borderline, it might be smart to pass on Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as long as I am in the rumor business today, I hear
Microsoft is coming out with what is called a patch. That's a small
program, which would be distributed free from the Microsoft Web
site, that would patch, or fix, some of the installation problems.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, here's my advice. If you haven't yet installed
Windows 98 and don't feel a pressing need to do so, wait a couple
of weeks or a month to let some of the dust clear. If you do need
to install it now, use the default installation and make sure your
PC exceeds the minimum system requirements.

Portable CD player comes with 'wardrobe' 
By Michael E. Kanell  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not enough to have the technology and
cutting-edge sound. Apparently you've got to have the right color,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson Consumer Electronics is banking on that combination to
sell its new personal compact disc players, hoping younger
consumers -- the company says it's pitching to Generation X -- will
care as much about looks as features.
</P>
<P>
   Personal CD players have the youngest buyers in audio, says
Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   The RCA RP-2240 from Thomson comes with interchangeable,
translucent lids in green and purple -- as well as the standard
gray. ``The consumer ... has the option of changing the look of the
product as often as they would like with the swap-top lids,'' said
Sharon Seward, audio marketing manager at Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   The RP-2240 comes with a feature called ``Smart ESP,'' which
might seem a little bit like magic. The feature lets the user
remove the CD from the player -- while continuing to listen to the
music. Put the CD back within about 40 seconds and the music never
misses a beat, says Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, although that trick works and might mystify your
friends, the real purpose of the technology is to protect the
listener from audio shocks should the CD player get a good bump
while in motion. That ``buffer memory'' lets the player keep
playing by pulling from 40 seconds worth of data it keeps in
storage. If the CD gets bumped momentarily off-track, the music
continues.
</P>
<P>
   The RP-2240 comes with stereo headphones and has a suggested
retail price of $89.
</P>
<P>
   Information about Thomson's RCA equipment is available from the
company by phone at 1-800-336-1900 or via the company's site on the
Web (http://www.nipper.com).
</P>
<P>
   Smart keyboard
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody wants to lug a laptop everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Many professionals, salespeople and stenographers -- not to
mention journalists -- want to take notes wherever they go, but
resign themselves to their pens and paper when they consider the
high-tech options.
</P>
<P>
   A laptop can be clumsy, heavy, fickle and expensive. The smaller
alternatives, like the trendy Palm Pilot, are viewed with
skepticism by those of us with illegible scrawls and, besides, they
are designed more for a list of errands than say, transcribing the
brilliant words of the marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   There is, as it happens, a compromise position between laptop
and pen.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent Peripheral Devices makes a ``smart'' keyboard that
will let you type extensive notes, store them and then upload them
to your computer later. The full-size, two-pound keyboard comes
with a four-line display, and the company says it can run for 300
hours on three AA batteries -- far better than any laptop.
Computerworld magazine calls it ``rugged,'' which would be another
obvious advantage over most laptops. Still one more is the price:
about $230.

   Bug portrait
</P>
<P>
   So, Mr. and Ms. Hotshot, write-code-in-your-sleep, know-it-all
computer expert, just what does that Millennium Bug look like?
</P>
<P>
   You know about the problem. Many computers, especially in the
early days of information technology, were programmed to use two
digits for the year. With the approach of Jan. 1, 2000, businesses
and large organizations around the world are presented with the
challenge of making sure that computers are cleansed of the
proclivity to see that morning as the first day of 1900.
</P>
<P>
   But forget the jargon and digits. Draw a picture.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you draw well enough, you just might win $2,000.
That's how much Pick Systems will pay the winner of its slightly
tongue-in-cheek contest to find the best drawing or drawings of the
Millennium Bug. Although the contest is meant as something of a
joke, Pick Systems is in the business of finding solutions to the
Millennium problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than take the approach of Chicken Little, who ran
around crying `The sky is falling, the sky is falling,' Pick has
decided that a little humor can go a long way; therefore we intend
to poke some fun at the issue while offering strategies to solve
it,'' reads the contest form.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing of the bug will be judged on its ``creativity,
graphic design layout, marketability, humor and appropriateness to
the problem,'' says Pick.

   Spam scams
</P>
<P>
   A lot of us are all to familiar with spam.
</P>
<P>
   More formally known as unsolicited commercial e-mail, spam is
what many of us find in our Internet mail boxes each morning. An
awful lot of it is really an invitation to fraud, or at the very
least a chance to throw away money, according to the Federal Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC last week released a list of the 12 most common scams
found in spam.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection, said the agency came up with the ``Dirty Dozen'' after
sifting through more than 250,000 junk e-mail messages that had
been forwarded by consumers to the special mailbox set up to
collect spam. (That mailbox is uce(at)ftc.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet service providers are better than others at
protecting members from spam. The largest online service, America
Online, is the most visible example of a provider that has had
trouble doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most common spam scams, according to the FTC:
</P>
<P>
   -- The business opportunity scam, in which a ton of income is
promised for a small investment of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   -- The bulk e-mail scam, in which you are promised profits -- in
exchange for your purchase of e-mail addresses. Bulk e-mail
violates terms of service for most Internet providers and, besides,
most of the lists are unreliable, Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   -- The easy credit scam, in which credit and loans are promised
on easy terms.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, visit the FTC site on the Web
(http://www.ftc.gov), write the agency (Consumer Response Center,
Room 130, Sixth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20580) or call the FTC (202-382-4357).

 Syquest Looks for Advice  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Normally, when a company enlists the advice of an investment
bank, it's tantamount to proclaiming, ``We're for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the case with Syquest, Chairman Ed Marinaro said
yesterday after the troubled disk-drive maker announced that it has
asked CIBC Oppenheimer to help chart its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is clearly to remain independent and to be able
to expand our business base considerably,'' Marinaro said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, CIBC Oppenheimer, will advise Fremont-based Syquest on
strategic partnerships, joint ventures and even possible
acquisitions that Syquest may consider.
</P>
<P>
   Syquest makes drives that let personal computer users store
large amounts of data on removable cartridges. Its chief rival is
Iomega, maker of the Zip drive.
</P>
<P>
   Like other disk drive companies, Syquest has been murdered by a
prolonged slump in the industry _ the result of a glut of drives
and a weaker-than-expected PC market.
</P>
<P>
   But Syquest's troubles go deeper than that. The company has
suffered three years of steady losses, and its stock has been
sliding.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Syquest would appear to be a fine takeover target. But
Marinaro doesn't see it that way. He believes that Syquest has
turned the corner in a two-year turnaround and is poised for a
financial rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Behind much of Marinaro's optimism is SparQ, a $199 drive whose
cartridges can store 1 gigabyte of data. (That's 700 times what you
can get on a floppy.)
</P>
<P>
   Because the SparQ made its debut last November, Marinaro said it
has outsold Iomega's Jaz drive, its only competitor. The Jaz, which
also holds 1 gigabyte per cartridge, sells for $100 more than the
SparQ.
</P>
<P>
   Syquest's revenues of $47 million in its March quarter were the
highest in more than a year, though it still suffered a net loss of
$31.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The constant trail of red ink _ more than $200 million since
1995 _ has helped sink Syquest's stock. In August of 1995, the
shares peaked at $18.88. Yesterday, they were unchanged at $1.41.
</P>
<P>
   If Syquest isn't exactly a stellar performer, it's in a lot
better shape than when Marinaro took over in February of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week on the job, I had to raise $1 million to meet
the payroll. That's how bad things were,'' he said. ``Syquest was
on the verge of being a bankrupt company.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinaro, a 36-year computer industry veteran who had been CEO
of Network Computing Devices, embarked on a program to cut
operating expenses, which had strangled profit margins for early
Syquest products.
</P>
<P>
   He financed the company's survival through private stock
offerings that raised several hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed did a great job of rounding up financing to keep the
company in good shape while they rebuilt the product line to get
out of the hole,'' said Dick Porter, president of research firm
DiskTrends.
</P>
<P>
   The private stock placements had a serious side effect, however.
The stock in those deals consisted of preferred shares, most of
which have since been converted to common stock _ thereby badly
diluting the common shares. The number of outstanding shares has
soared from 12.5 million two years ago to 127 million.
</P>
<P>
   Marinaro said Oppenheimer ``will be instrumental in
restructuring our capital accounts and raising incremental funds as
the need arises.'' The goal, he said, is to put Syquest in position
for a secondary public offering next year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Syquest is cash-positive, with about $10 million on hand
and with long-term debt of less than $2 million. It has about 300
employees in the Bay area, and another 2,000 at its manufacturing
plant in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   However, its future success is far from assured. For one thing,
said Dataquest analyst Fara Yale, ``Iomega isn't going to roll over
and let Syquest to continue to take market share away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is new competition from Castlewood Systems, a startup
company also based in Fremont which was founded by Syed Iftikar _
who also founded Syquest.

 Getting Home Address OffA Web Site  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How do I get my home address removed from someone's Web
site? Over the past month I have had over 50 young men show up at
my front door at all hours of the day and night (i.e., midnight and
4 a.m.). They are apparently all Web-surfing and are given my
address as the place to meet for a massage. Am I doomed to this
mode of home wrecking, or is there something I can do to end this
growing nightmare?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Now THAT'S a computing problem you don't see every day!
What you should do is contact the owner of the Web site _ or better
yet, have your lawyer do it _ and get your name taken off the site.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to do is get the address of the site from one of
your unwelcome visitors. Then you can find out who runs the site by
using Whois, a service of Network Solutions. That's the company
that registers most of the world's Internet domain names (such as
Apple.com, the domain name for Apple Computer's site). You'll find
Whois at http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois.
</P>
<P>
   Whois lets you search for any domain name ending in .com, .net,
.org or .edu. You should be able to find the name of the person or
company who registered the site, as well as the name, address and
phone number of the site administrator.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How can one become a Web programmer? What programming
languages do you have to know, and how can you go about finding a
job?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Jennifer Cannella, a technical recruiter in the Santa Clara
office of the Elan agency, says the prospective Web programmer
should be fluent in HTML, Java, Javascript and Perl. In addition, a
foundation in C++ is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Good ways to search for a job include contacting agencies like
Elan, going to job fairs and perusing the Internet, where many
companies post job openings on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   One good site is the Westech Virtual Job Fair, at www.vjf.com.
You can submit an electronic resume and search for positions that
are posted by major technology companies. There's also a list of
real-world job fairs, including a Westech Career Expo set for
tomorrow and Thursday at the Santa Clara Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  When I retrieve my e-mail there is a full page of headings
showing where the message came from and how it came to me. It goes
on and on and on. Is there a way I can choose to show only the
person sending the e-mail and the subject? I'm using Netscape 4 as
my Internet browser.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Boy, I wish every question were this easy. Go to the View
menu in the Netscape e-mail window and choose Headers. There you'll
find three choices: All, Normal and Brief. All, which is the option
you apparently are using now, gives you all the routing information
for a message. The reason there's so much of it is that e-mail can
go through many computer systems on the Internet enroute to you.
</P>
<P>
   The Normal option shows the subject of the message, the date it
was received, the address of the person who sent it and the address
of the person or mail list to whom it was sent. The Brief shows the
sender, the subject and the recipient. And that sounds like your
best bet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  We would like to copy our address book contacts from
Outlook 98 to a floppy disk. We were told it cannot be done. Can
you advise us?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  It can be done, and pretty easily at that. Here's how. With
your Address Book open, choose Select All from the Edit menu. This
will highlight all your addresses in blue. Go back to the Edit menu
and choose Copy. Then open up a word processor like Microsoft Word
and use the Paste command in the Edit menu to copy all your
addresses into the new document. Finally, save the document to a
floppy disk. I'd recommend saving it in Text Only format, which
will let you open it on any Windows PC, regardless of which word
processor it has. Also, you can use the new file to make a neat
printout of all your addresses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   America Online members, this one's for you. You don't need a
computer with AOL installed on it to check your AOL mail. You can
do it with any Internet connection by going to www.aol.com/netmail.
This new feature, called AOL NetMail, is currently in a testing
phase, but it seems to be pretty solid. It lets you sign on and
displays your AOL mailbox (you can't get any other AOL features,
however). You can send and receive messages just as you would if
you logged into your AOL account.

 Surfing the Web for Wedding Gifts  
 By Julia Angwin   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering the number of things you can do online these days _
everything from gambling to broadcasting a live birth _ it's
surprisingly difficult to shop for wedding presents in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That's because most places with popular wedding registries _
such as Bloomingdale's, Crate &AMP; Barrel and Williams-Sonoma _ have
not put them online. The only major retailers that offer online
bridal registries are Macy's, JCPenney and discounter Service
Merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most retailers run on very thin margins,'' said David
Alschuler, director of electronic commerce research at the Aberdeen
Group in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's a challenge for them to make big
investments in new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the companies that make popular bridal gifts are loathe to
sell online for fear of alienating the stores that carry their
wares.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Black &AMP; Decker's Web site has a bridal area that
suggests wedding presents, but doesn't let Web surfers purchase the
DustBusters and rice cookers.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Fear of undercutting Black &AMP; Decker sales to
department and specialty stores, according to Christina Blosser,
who oversees the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still more important to not jeopardize the already
established relationships (with retailers) than to move
aggressively in the online environment,'' said Blosser.
</P>
<P>
   However, a few Web entrepreneurs have stepped in to fill the
gap, offering consumers a one-stop shop for a diverse selection of
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, most sites have a limited selection of
traditional bridal items. Rather, cyber-registries are more likely
to carry nontraditional items such as soaps, candles, camping gear
and even tickets to events.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Palo Alto newlyweds Virginia Wei and Michael Han
registered last month on Ucopia (www.ucopia.com) for golf lessons,
symphony tickets, a video rental card and museum passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very busy; we spend very little time at home,'' said
Wei, who is an attorney at Wilson, Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati in
Palo Alto. ``Our family and friends were delighted that they could
purchase something for us that comported with our lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ucopia, which is based in San Francisco, offers everything from
gift certificates for skydiving and cooking lessons to expensive
knickknacks from hip South of Market boutiques. It also carriessome
items from more traditional retailers such as Strouds and Smith &AMP;
Hawken.
</P>
<P>
   Ucopia charges retailers a commission, but also charges the
shopper from $1.50 to $5 per transaction. The 3-month-old site
eventually plans to charge couples $45 to register online.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most people, the fee is no big deal in exchange for the
convenience,'' said Dave Gulezian, the 30-year-old Stanford MBA who
co-founded the site with fellow alumnus Brian Anderluh.
</P>
<P>
   Ucopia's main competitor is the The Wedding Network (www.wed
dingnetwork.com), which also offers alternative gifts but doesn't
charge couples or buyers for the transaction, instead taking a
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Wedding Network offers wine clubs from Virtual Vineyards and
cigar shipments from Corona Cigar Co., as well as sporting gear
from GrandWest Outfitters and The Flyfisher.
</P>
<P>
   Wedding Network Executive Vice President Larry Smith said he's
hoping to add some more traditional goods to the slim lineup of
china and linens, but it's a slow process because many retailers
are worried about losing their customers to an online competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of wedding sites but there aren't a lot of
registries because it's not easy,'' Smith said. ``It's very
difficult to work with retailers to develop it.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, some Web sites such as TheGift.com have tried
to bypass retailers altogether by buying directly from
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the manufacturers are willing to participate. For
example, KitchenAid _ which makes the popular bridal gift item, a
stand mixer _ refuses to work with online registries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is that we're so powerful in the bridal
industry that we bring more to the table than they do,'' said
KitchenAid spokesman Brian Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   And other manufacturers refuse to let Jeff Swearingen, the
founder of TheGift.com, order small quantities of items.
</P>
<P>
   So he has actually purchased a warehouse-full of china, crystal,
silverware, blenders and grills _ in anticipation of future bridal
registry customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tells me I'm nuts,'' he said. ``But I'd rather sit
on some inventory for a few months than make a customer wait a few
months'' for an item they've purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Swearingen is also opening a store in nearby Dallas so that he
can lure Internet-leery manufacturers to sell to him.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that his business is a long shot, but he believes that
in a few years online bridal registries will become the standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say that we're building a luxury liner in ankle-deep
water,'' he said. ``Next year we'll be knee-deep.''

 High Tech Trying Hard to Keep `Temporary' Workers Bill Alive  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, the high-tech lobby is fighting to keep alive one of
its top legislative priorities: a congressional bill to increase
the number of ``temporary'' skilled workers from overseas who can
fill jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In May, when SB1723 sailed through the Senate on a 78-to-20
vote, it looked like high-tech was going to get the increase it
sought in the quota of workers who could be brought here under the
controversial H-1B visa program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the odd alliance of an anti-immigration Republican
leader in the House of Representative and the labor-friendly
Clinton administration has H-1B legislation listing badly _ if not
sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Two Silicon Valley lawmakers, Representatives Tom Campbell,
R-Campbell, and Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, are trying to broker a
compromise between the Senate bill, which the tech industry likes,
and the current House version, which it hates.
</P>
<P>
   But with only 24 days before Congress goes out of session, the
clock is ticking on an issue that has tempers running high.
</P>
<P>
   ``As divided as the two sides are, I'd be the most surprised
person in the world if they manage to pull off a compromise,'' said
Carl Shusterman, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the debate began favorably for the tech lobby, which
created headlines earlier this year by warning of a dramatic
shortage of high-tech workers, especially programmers.
</P>
<P>
   With industry blessing, Senator Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.,
drafted a bill to increase the quota of foreign workers _ now
65,000 _ who can come here each year on six-year work permits.
Three-quarters of the Senate, including both California members,
voted to raise that quota to a high of 115,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bill landed in the House Judiciary Subcommittee on
Immigration, where Representative Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a bulwark
of anti-immigration sentiment, added two innocuous-sounding riders
that made the tech lobby draw a collective gasp.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's HR3736 would require that companies seeking to import
H-1B workers make two ``attestations'' _ that they have tried and
failed to hire qualified Americans, and that no U.S. workers were
laid off to create vacancies for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-industry lawyer Susanna Igleheart Bogue said those
provisions would enable disgruntled workers to get the Department
of Labor to investigate any firm that hired H-1B staff _ leading to
expensive administrative law proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech firms would rather leave the H-1B quotas alone than
accept attestation,'' Bogue said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Campbell is supporting Smith's attestations in
principle, while looking for language that doesn't make the
industry gag. He's asked lobbyists Mary DeBeal of Hewlett-Packard,
Tom Gann of Sun Microsystems and Mike Maibach of Intel to negotiate
with Smith directly.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren, meanwhile, is reportedly trying to get the White House
to reverse or at least soften its threat to veto any H-1B bill that
lacks attestations. But a Senate source says Lofgren's out of luck,
because Clinton's mind is made up.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness of industry's position is laid out in a July 7
e-mail _ which found its way to me _ in which Intel lobbyist
Jenifer Eisen lays out the facts: by industry's count, Smith then
had 240-to-270 votes for his bill, attestations and all. Passage
requires 218 yeas.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, will reportedly get Abraham and Smith together later this
week to bang out a compromise in which the attestations would not
apply to the first 65,000 workers admitted under H-1B visas, but
would be required for workers who come in under the new, higher
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, William Archey, president of the American
Electronics Association, insisted yesterday that a bill palatable
to industry would emerge from the House and make it to the
president's desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the right side of the angels on this,'' Archey said
confidently.
</P>
<P>
   By which I think he meant he'll be spending a lot of time on his
knees in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>

 Consummate Hoax _ Virgin Cybercast Was Online Scam  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was all a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   A sensational planned ``cybercast'' of two 18-year-olds losing
their virginity live on the Internet _ which had generated
headlines nationwide _ actually was a money-making scheme designed
to reel in millions of unsuspecting people in an online version of
``War of the Worlds,'' according to one of the organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never was any intention of an online deflowering; the
whole thing was a scam,'' said Seth Warshavsky, president of
Internet Entertainment Group, an online adult entertainment company
which was to supply the computer equipment to broadcast the event.
</P>
<P>
   Warshavsky said he decided to go public after learning that the
site wouldn't live up to its advertising because he feared backlash
from angry customers.
</P>
<P>
   Warshavsky _ whose Seattle-based company is best known for
marketing the sex video of actress Pamela Anderson and rocker Tommy
Lee _ said yesterday that organizers of www.ourfirsttime.com told
him they planned to charge Internet users $5 each to view the
August 4 event and then announce at the last-minute that the
couple, ``Mike and Diane,'' had decided they were not ready for
sex.
</P>
<P>
   According to Warshavsky, organizers expected to make $5 million
from the event.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which carried photos of the couple and their ``diary
entries,'' now has a message that says Mike and Diane will not
consummate their relationship. ``Unfortunately, the cat is out of
the bag, so to speak,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation underscores how the Internet has become a hotbed
for unfounded gossip, innuendo and _ in some cases _ fraud,
industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is like the real world: It is full of a lot of
good information and a lot of disinformation and B.S.,'' said
Stanton McCandlish, program director at the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a civil libertarian organization in San Francisco.
``Consumers need to increase their critical thinking and not
believe everything they read _ both online and offline.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been severalnotorious falsehoods online during the
past several years, including a fake document asserting that TWA
Flight 800 was shot downby a missile and a purported commencement
speech by Kurt Vonnegut that turned out to be a column written by a
Chicago journalist.
</P>
<P>
   But none has generated as much media coverage or Web hits as the
Net virgins.
</P>
<P>
   Warshavsky said Ken Tipton, a former video-store owner and
operator of the site, wanted to produce an international sensation
on the scale of Orson Welles' ``War of the Worlds'' radio
broadcast, which some 60 years ago fooled millions of Americans
into thinking that Martians had invaded New Jersey. Tipton even
used the pseudonym ``Oscar Wells'' as part of the elaborate scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Tipton was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vega, a Los Angeles-based free-speech lawyer and spokesman
for the ``young'' couple, also could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a notice posted on IEG's Web site, he insisted that
the virgin video feed ``was not about making money'' and he called
Warshavsky's charges false and defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vega insisted the online site was legitimate and
estimated that in just a matter of days, it had attracted hundreds
of millions of ``visits.''
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics said the couple _ whose faces were obscured by
black bars _ looked more like buffed, mature models than wide-eyed
18-year-olds about to share their most intimate moment on the World
Wide Web.

SEAGATE FIRES ITS CEO, CO-FOUNDER, ALAN SHUGART  
 BY DAVID EINSTEIN  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Struggling disk-drive maker Seagate Technology unceremoniously
fired Alan Shugart, ending the reign of one of Silicon Valley's
most outspoken and longest-lasting chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually blunt press release yesterday, the Scotts Valley
company said its board of directors ``requested Mr. Shugart's
retirement from the company,'' saying that the time had come to
make a change in leadership. The board consists of six nonemployee
directors plus Shugart.
</P>
<P>
   Shugart, 67, who has been Seagate's CEO since co-founding the
company in 1979, will be replaced by Stephen Luczo, Seagate's
president and chief operating officer. Luczo, a former investment
banker at Bear Stearns who joined Seagate in 1993, has been groomed
as Shugart's successor.
</P>
<P>
   The board offered no explanation for sacking Shugart, although
board member Larry Perlman offered a brief eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Al's total dedication and contribution to all aspects of
Seagate's success, it is difficult to adequately and appropriately
articulate our appreciation for his efforts,'' Perlman said in the
press release.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remove Shugart comes as Seagate and the rest of
the disk-drive industry grapple with a downturn blamed on slowing
computer sales and an oversupply of disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate, the largest independent maker of disk drives, just
ended its worst fiscal year ever, losing $530 million. Its revenues
of $6.8 billion were the lowest in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in its most recent quarter Seagate posted a profit of $22
million, suggesting that a management restructuring last September
may be starting to pay off. At that time, Luczo was elevated to
president and put in charge of all disk-drive and component
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate's stock, which hit a two-year low of $19.56 last month,
had climbed back to more than $26 in the past week. It closed up 6
cents yesterday at $24.19.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts were stunned by the abrupt ouster of Shugart,
who is considered to be the father of the disk drive. So was
Shugart himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked. I thought I was doing a good job,'' he said
yesterday during a telephone interview from his office at Seagate
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Shugart said an emissary from Seagate's board delivered the bad
news to him Saturday at his other office in Carmel. Shugart asked
to confront the board members, who repeated their decision in a
conference call with him on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked them why they were firing me, I couldn't get them
to tell me anything other than it's time for a change, and we want
you to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have loved me to resign, but I wouldn't,'' Shugart
said. He said he is in the process of cleaning out his office, but
that he won't leave until he and the board come to terms on a
severance package. Unlike most CEOs, Shugart had no written
employment agreement with the company he has run for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Shugart earned $750,000 in salary. Bonuses and other
compensation brought his pay to $1,937,484.
</P>
<P>
   Shugart was also ousted as chairman, but Luczo was not awarded
that title although he was named to the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any adequate reason as to why the board found it
necessary to remove Al,'' said Jim Porter, who runs the DiskTrend
market research firm in Mountain View. ``He wasn't interfering with
Luczo's mission to get new products out earlier and more
efficiently. In fact, he was enhancing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive recruiter Tony Scott also was taken back by the way in
which Shugart was blindsided. ``The bluntness of the language in
the press release is surprising because of the signal it sends to
the outside world and to employees,'' said Scott, who is executive
vice president of A.T. Kearney in Redwood Shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who have been at Seagate for a long
time because of Al Shugart, and in a lot of ways he's seen as the
embodiment of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Shugart is a main fixture in the history of the personal
computer. He developed the first disk drive for IBM in 1956. In
1969 he moved to Memorex, and in 1972 started his own disk-drive
maker, Shugart Associates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 Shugart left that company, having burned through his
venture capital without introducing a product. He did some
consulting, tended bar for awhile and had a fishing boat off of
Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 he teamed with another Silicon Valley pioneer, Finis
Connor, to form Shugart Technology, which later changed its name to
Seagate Technology. Seagate became the first company to introduce a
51/2-inch hard-disk drive, which changed the face of personal
computing by letting users for the first time store data on their
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Seagate went on to become a leader in developing faster, smaller
disk drives that held more and more information. Today's
high-capacity drives can store 16 gigabytes _ thousands of times
more than the first hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Luczo expressed confidence in Seagate's ability to weather the
current storm, and analysts believe he'll make a strong CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luczo and his team are excellent, and they'll get the results
they need at Seagate,'' said DiskTrends' Porter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only criticism is the way they treated Al,'' he said.
``They should have given him a dinner and a 21-gun salute.''

QUARTERLY EARNINGS AT TI FALL 83 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARK P. COUCH  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Instruments said Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings
fell 83 percent because of worldwide weakness in semiconductor
demand and the continuing price decline of memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based TI, which makes chips for mobile phones, modems and
other electronic devices, said its quarterly net income fell to $43
million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $249 million, or 56
cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sales slumped, too.
</P>
<P>
   TI said its second-quarter revenues were 15 percent lower than a
year ago, dropping to $2.2 billion from $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hit to TI came in the memory-chip business. TI said
it lost $222 million, or 36 cents a share, in that division this
quarter, compared with $20 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago.
Average prices for dynamic random access memory chips were down 30
percent from the first quarter and 70 percent from the same period
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The losses didn't panic company executives or investors because
TI announced in June that it is selling the memory chip division to
Micron Technology of Boise, Idaho, in a deal valued at about $830
million.
</P>
<P>
   TI will get 28.9 million shares of Micron stock in exchange for
its memory division. To break even, Micron shares must be valued at
about $31 a share, said William Aylesworth, TI's chief financial
officer. TI will have to take a charge against future earnings if
the Micron stock trades at anything less than that per-share price.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sale, which TI executives hope to complete by the end
of the year, has been greeted warmly by stock-market investors, and
Tuesday's announcement of poor second-quarter results didn't dent
the recent $10 run-up in TI's price per share.
</P>
<P>
   TI shares rose $2 to close at $60.94. Micron shares dropped 38
cents to close at $27.88.
</P>
<P>
   Weaker demand in the entire semiconductor market caused TI's
orders to drop to $1.9 billion for the three months ending June 30
from $2.7 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Such temporary declines are part of doing business in the
up-and-down semiconductor business, Aylesworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the semiconductor market has grown at an average
of 15 to 18 percent a year, but it almost never grows at 15 percent
in any one year,'' Aylesworth said. ``It's far more volatile than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   TI embarked on a cost-cutting program during the second quarter
to cope with weaker demand. The company said in June that it would
eliminate 3,500 jobs. The company charged $233 million against its
quarterly earnings to cover severance packages and other
restructuring costs.
</P>
<P>
   TI is speeding up the process because it expects the crimp in
semiconductor sales to continue during the third quarter. The
restructuring is supposed to save the company $270 million in
expenses by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   TI also said that it earned $83 million during the quarter from
the sale of its stake in a memory-chip joint venture to former
partner Acer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   TI is betting that faster-growing, higher-profit specialty chips
will be its future earnings salvation.
</P>
<P>
   TI is the world leader in making digital signal processors,
chips that translate sound and motion into the language of
computers. Those chips are used in many electronic products.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, digital signal processor revenues were 25
percent higher than last year and contributed more than 50 percent
of the company's quarterly semiconductor earnings of $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Aylesworth said TI estimates that there are 30,000 independent
programmers working on applications of digital signal processors
and that 70 percent of them are using TI's chips and software.
</P>
<P>
   Those programmers are studying ways to use the chips to make
collision-avoidance systems in motor vehicles, faster modems for
connecting to the Internet, better hearing aids, even ``Dick
Tracy''-style interactive watches.
</P>
<P>
   Stripping away TI's troubled memory business and special
charges, TI reported quarterly operating income of $142 million, or
35 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that even in difficult market conditions, when
you strip away the charges and memory business, it validates our
strategy,'' Aylesworth said.

SENATE PASSES ACCESS LIMITS FOR CHILDREN ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Tuesday approved two proposals for
controlling children's access to pornography on the Internet,
endorsing without debate one measure that would make it illegal for
commercial Web sites to distribute adult material to minors and
another that would require software filters on computers in
libraries and schools that receive federal Internet subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The measures, which had been introduced as separate bills, were
added by voice votes to the $33 billion appropriations bill for the
Commerce, Justice and State departments. Civil liberties groups
vowed to fight the measures, saying they infringed on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The filtering proposal, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
who is chairman of the Commerce Committee, would require schools
and libraries to install filtering technology on computers used by
students if they receive financing for discounted Internet hookups
from the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children should not be allowed to enter school or a public
library and gain access to material that their parents would never
allow them to see,'' McCain said, ``and that most in society
believe is inappropriate for those who are not yet adults.''
</P>
<P>
   The other amendment, sponsored by Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., would
make it a crime for commercial Web site operators to distribute
material harmful to minors. Last year the Supreme Court struck down
the Communications Decency Act, which would have made it a felony
to send ``indecent'' material to children under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Violators would be subject to fines of up to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups said they would fight the proposals in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free speech on the Internet was ambushed today,'' said Barry
Steinhardt, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, said he thought both bills raised significant
constitutional questions. But because they are intended to protect
children, he said, they will ``be hard for members to vote
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups say they have opposed filtering mandates
because many filters block access to more than just inappropriate
sites, preventing computer users from getting information on
subjects like breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain bill, while well-intentioned,'' Steinhardt said,
``is based on the mistaken premise that you can create filtering
software that will work with enough precision to block out material
on the Internet based on community notions of inappropriateness or
indecency.''
</P>
<P>
   When the bills were before the Commerce Committee, the privacy
information center, the American Civil Liberties Union and the
Center for Democracy and Technology argued that the Coats bill's
standard of regulating material ``harmful to minors'' would
unconstitutionally restrict free speech on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt said the bill would apply to any commercial
distribution of information on the Internet, including books sold
on sites like amazon.com, or even information on free speech
displayed on other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The House has yet to act on its version of the spending bill,
which an appropriations committee approved last week. Senate and
House versions would have to be reconciled before final action.
</P>
<P>
   A provision similar to McCain's filtering proposal has been
added to the Houses appropriations bill for education, labor and
health and human services.

FOR THE POLICE, DRAGNET BECOMES THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN TEDESCO   
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As Dragnet meets the Internet, police work in
cities across the country is taking a high-tech step beyond ``just
the facts, ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, the St. Paul Police Department posts names and
pictures of people charged with prostitution, along with the men
accused of picking them up.
</P>
<P>
   In the college town of Pullman, Wash., the police posted
people's pictures on the Internet after a student riot near
Washington State University.
</P>
<P>
   From on-line wanted posters to Internet maps of neighborhood
crime spots, police forces are tapping new ways to reach the public
using the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, police departments have been very closed with
their information,'' said Clara Zainie, who maintains the San
Antonio Police Department's Web page. ``One of the tenets of
community policing is to try to share with the public as much
information as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 400 Internet Web sites for municipal police
departments in the United States, and 26 sites for state police
agencies. Although the sites in some communities offer little more
than a list of phone numbers and, maybe, a picture of a squad car,
other sites are more arresting.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio police Web page provides neighborhood crime
maps, a database of impounded vehicles, a real-time listing of
traffic accidents in the city, crime trends and more. The
information can help a commuter avoid traffic snarls or show
resident Web surfers how many burglaries have hit their
neighborhoods in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The crime maps have received up to 100 hits a day, Zainie said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood groups find the maps useful to spot trouble areas _
or to dispel the perception that an area is crime ridden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people think there's a lot more crime in their
neighborhood than there actually is,'' Zainie said. ``When one
person gets burglarized in two weeks, it's unfortunate,'' she said.
``But, not belittling that, it's hardly a crime wave. People
understand that when they actually see it on a map.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Paul Web site's gallery of people charged with
prostitution has drawn hundreds of comments from 20 countries, most
in favor of the page, said Sylvia Burgos, the police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people call us and ask if they're going to be on it.
We've had lawyers call and question the legality of it. It's all
legal,'' Burgos said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the launching of the prostitution page in October, the
site recorded about 8,000 hits. Since October, it has received more
than 100,000 hits, Burgos said.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, it was too early to say if the page has helped
curb prostitution in the city. The St. Paul Police Department
recently added to its Web site pictures, names and information
about sex offenders living in the community.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio police have no plans in place to post similar
information on the Web. They do plan to add more crime data, crime
analysis and an area where users can print forms, such as
applications for burglar alarms, to save a trip to the police
station.
</P>
<P>
   The police in Montgomery County, Md., a suburb of Washington,
maintain a Web site with crime databases and crime-prevention
information.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville police Internet site includes crime-prevention
questionnaires with titles such as ``Are you going to be raped,
robbed, stabbed, shot or beaten?''
</P>
<P>
   Based on responses, the site computes a score. The higher the
score, the higher the risk of being a likely victim of a crime.
Those determined to be high risk are told: ``You are in a dangerous
category and better change your habits lest you be tomorrow's
headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The police aren't the only ones distributing law enforcement
information on the Internet. Some organizations use the Web to
police the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Complaint Center in Tallahassee, Fla., makes
available video recordings of apparent police misconduct from
different cities. The American Civil Liberties Union has a site
focused on police reform. Visitors can print a pocket card with
guidelines on how to handle encounters with the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Speed Trap Registry reports rumored speed traps from across
the country.

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From Diversion magazine. c.1996 Abby Tannenbaum 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 &UR; By JENNIFER CRICHTON &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REUNION ETIQUETTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.
</P>
<P>
   7. Parents shall not use intimate details of their kids' lives
as conversational fodder. Boasts of children's accomplishments are
acceptable, but parents shall be discreet in their phrasing and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Thou shalt not reveal devastating family secrets about
thyself or others unless thou hast arranged therapeutic support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   9. Thou shalt not publicly criticize the manners or behavior of
any child not thine own.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thou shalt flatter thy kinfolk _ falsely or not. All nieces
tap dance divinely, all babies are beautiful and all aunts look as
wonderful as ever.

 &UR; From Consumers Digest magazine &LR;  &QC;

<P>
   Summer pleasures can easily turn into summer pain for the

and bites. (slugged: BC-PERILS-OF-SUMMER-(SUMMER)-NYTSF, priority

 &UR; By PETER F. STEVENS &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played
side by side with sons of the affluent. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, Shahin would like to provide summer
vacationers with sage advice on how to pack. But the truth is,
Shahin confesses, he doesn't have any tips. In fact, he doesn't
pack his bags. His wife does. This arrangement, he believes, is
quite common: Women pack the suitcases, men take pride in
methodically fitting them in the car trunk. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   While family reunions offer a unique opportunity to reconnect
with one's kin, they also can bring to the fore all the simmering
tensions in a family. Do you invite the black sheep? Should you
finally unveil the big family secret? Crichton addresses these
issues, and offers a hilarious bonus in collaboration with Miss

<P>
   Family reunions often spark curiosity about one's ancestors.
With a bit of detective work, using oral interviews, government
records, genealogical associations, libraries and the Internet, the
family tree can be pieced together. Tannenbaum provides an

   In her youth, Licata would join the legions on the beach seeking

 c.1998 New York Times Special Features  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Journalism is far from the perfect, objective science we might
like it to be. We easily forget that the facts and allegations of
the stories on our TV screens and in our newspapers are gathered by
people _ journalists, who as human beings, are fallible and
fragile.
</P>
<P>
   When journalists fail to tell the entire truth or to find it and
instead resort to dishonest and illegal tactics _ as in an uncommon
number of cases recently in the United States _ they get
reprimanded, they get fired, and bring embarrassment to the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   But good journalism can, at times, be more dangerous than bad
journalism. While lying about a source might cause an American
writer to lose the job, reporting the truth might cause a Latin
American journalist to lose his life.
</P>
<P>
   Eight already have in 1998 alone: two in Brazil, three in
Colombia, one in Mexico and two others in Peru _ a husband and
wife, who together produced a radio program, ``The People's
Voice,'' which advocated peasant's rights. The two were murdered
when 12 armed men entered their home. After the couple was buried,
relatives reported, a police officer visited them and suggested it
would be wise not to pursue an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Leal de Oliveira, the publisher and editor of a weekly in
Bahai, Brazil, was killed _ shot 14 times by men who followed him
in a white van as he drove home from work one day. He had exposed
the truth about corruption of local authorities. Likewise, Nelson
Carvajal, a radio reporter who had produced segments on poor
public-health services and alleged government corruption, was
killed _ shot 10 times outside the elementary school where he also
taught in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, the reward for good reporting, and for telling
the truth, is to get murdered by those who want to bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism remains an extremely dangerous and difficult
profession, both for those who write the news and those we write
about. When journalists are reckless with facts and methods _ when
we break the rules of our unspoken code of ethics, not to mention
the country's written laws _ it is unfair to the people we are
writing about and extremely harmful to the credibility of our
profession.
</P>
<P>
   We can get so blinded by the excitement of breaking a story, or
of having a scoop, that we can ignore the truth or tailor it to fit
our needs. In the United States, where freedom of the press is
hailed as a founding virtue, isn't it inexplicable to mock that
gift? As journalists, anywhere in the world, we owe it to our
readers to give them the story based on the facts we have, not on
the ones we wish we had.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CNN had to retract a story about the U.S. military
using poison gas against American defectors in Laos in 1970. Two
producers were fired; meanwhile, Peter Arnett, the correspondent
who gave us the minute-by-minute account of the Persian Gulf War,
and who was hailed as the last reporter to leave Baghdad, is now
facing scrutiny for not having verified the allegations he
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's claim that he was merely ``the face'' delivering a
story on the air has brought protests from other correspondents
within the profession who don't want their reputations as serious
journalists to be tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the way vital information is obtained? If the
truth is uncovered by devious means, do we applaud or pillory the
journalist? To what extent is this even more sensitive, given the
global nature of current reportage?
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Enquirer ran a front-page apology, and has agreed
to pay more than $10 million to Chiquita Brands International,
after running a series of critical articles about the company's
business practices. Among the charges was the use of bribery in
Colombia and the spraying of dangerous pesticides in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Mike Gallagher, is accused of obtaining his
information by stealing more than 2,000 voice-mail recordings from
Chiquita. If Gallagher's allegations about Chiquita's business
practices are true, is it acceptable that he ``stole'' the voice
mail? Are breaking the law and lying in order to get information
going to be acceptable reporting tactics? Journalists are not
exempt from the law, experts say, and Gallagher, described by his
editors as a ``star,'' was nonetheless fired.
</P>
<P>
   Two other important U.S. publications had to fire rising stars.
The weekly political magazine, The New Republic, had to let go of
Stephen Glass, a 27-year-old staff writer, for fabricating
information in 27 of his 41 stories. The Boston Globe fired
Patricia Smith, a columnist whose work was so well-regarded that,
last year, she was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever reasons Arnett, Gallagher, Glass or Smith have for
submitting questionable work, it breeched the most important tenet
of journalism _ it didn't tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Glass got caught after he wrote a story, making up the name of
the company, complete with a full name, employees, profit chart and
a convention. When a high-tech reporter read about ``Jukt
Micronics,'' he wondered why he, who covered high-tech business for
an on-line magazine, had never heard of this firm _ it only exists
in Glass' story.
</P>
<P>
   For her column, Smith made up characters _ a woman dying of
cancer, a worker erecting barricades at the Boston Marathon and a
mother buying shoes for her young daughter. When her imaginary
sources spoke, they were so quotable, their words weaved so
perfectly into her stories, that the editors became suspicious.
Smith gave in to a temptation that as journalists we all know _
born of frustration at not having that perfect quote.
</P>
<P>
   What about Glass? Is he too lazy to do any real reporting or too
ambitious, interested only in promoting his byline and moving on to

reporter and he will now write a best-selling thriller about Jukt
Micronics that will be bought by Hollywood for millions of dollars.

   Journalism is far from the perfect, objective science we might
like it to be. We easily forget that the facts and allegations of
the stories on our TV screens and in our newspapers are gathered by
people _ journalists, who as human beings, are fallible and
fragile.
</P>
<P>
   When journalists fail to tell the entire truth or to find it and
instead resort to dishonest and illegal tactics _ as in an uncommon
number of cases recently in the United States _ they get
reprimanded, they get fired, and bring embarrassment to the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   But good journalism can, at times, be more dangerous than bad
journalism. While lying about a source might cause an American
writer to lose the job, reporting the truth might cause a Latin
American journalist to lose his life.
</P>
<P>
   Eight already have in 1998 alone: two in Brazil, three in
Colombia, one in Mexico and two others in Peru _ a husband and
wife, who together produced a radio program, ``The People's
Voice,'' which advocated peasant's rights. The two were murdered
when 12 armed men entered their home. After the couple was buried,
relatives reported, a police officer visited them and suggested it
would be wise not to pursue an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Leal de Oliveira, the publisher and editor of a weekly in
Bahai, Brazil, was killed _ shot 14 times by men who followed him
in a white van as he drove home from work one day. He had exposed
the truth about corruption of local authorities. Likewise, Nelson
Carvajal, a radio reporter who had produced segments on poor
public-health services and alleged government corruption, was
killed _ shot 10 times outside the elementary school where he also
taught in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, the reward for good reporting, and for telling
the truth, is to get murdered by those who want to bury it.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism remains an extremely dangerous and difficult
profession, both for those who write the news and those we write
about. When journalists are reckless with facts and methods _ when
we break the rules of our unspoken code of ethics, not to mention
the country's written laws _ it is unfair to the people we are
writing about and extremely harmful to the credibility of our
profession.
</P>
<P>
   We can get so blinded by the excitement of breaking a story, or
of having a scoop, that we can ignore the truth or tailor it to fit
our needs. In the United States, where freedom of the press is
hailed as a founding virtue, isn't it inexplicable to mock that
gift? As journalists, anywhere in the world, we owe it to our
readers to give them the story based on the facts we have, not on
the ones we wish we had.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CNN had to retract a story about the U.S. military
using poison gas against American defectors in Laos in 1970. Two
producers were fired; meanwhile, Peter Arnett, the correspondent
who gave us the minute-by-minute account of the Persian Gulf War,
and who was hailed as the last reporter to leave Baghdad, is now
facing scrutiny for not having verified the allegations he
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's claim that he was merely ``the face'' delivering a
story on the air has brought protests from other correspondents
within the profession who don't want their reputations as serious
journalists to be tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the way vital information is obtained? If the
truth is uncovered by devious means, do we applaud or pillory the
journalist? To what extent is this even more sensitive, given the
global nature of current reportage?
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Enquirer ran a front-page apology, and has agreed
to pay more than $10 million to Chiquita Brands International,
after running a series of critical articles about the company's
business practices. Among the charges was the use of bribery in
Colombia and the spraying of dangerous pesticides in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Mike Gallagher, is accused of obtaining his
information by stealing more than 2,000 voice-mail recordings from
Chiquita. If Gallagher's allegations about Chiquita's business
practices are true, is it acceptable that he ``stole'' the voice
mail? Are breaking the law and lying in order to get information
going to be acceptable reporting tactics? Journalists are not
exempt from the law, experts say, and Gallagher, described by his
editors as a ``star,'' was nonetheless fired.
</P>
<P>
   Two other important U.S. publications had to fire rising stars.
The weekly political magazine, The New Republic, had to let go of
Stephen Glass, a 27-year-old staff writer, for fabricating
information in 27 of his 41 stories. The Boston Globe fired
Patricia Smith, a columnist whose work was so well-regarded that,
last year, she was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever reasons Arnett, Gallagher, Glass or Smith have for
submitting questionable work, it breeched the most important tenet
of journalism _ it didn't tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Glass got caught after he wrote a story, making up the name of
the company, complete with a full name, employees, profit chart and
a convention. When a high-tech reporter read about ``Jukt
Micronics,'' he wondered why he, who covered high-tech business for
an on-line magazine, had never heard of this firm _ it only exists
in Glass' story.
</P>
<P>
   For her column, Smith made up characters _ a woman dying of
cancer, a worker erecting barricades at the Boston Marathon and a
mother buying shoes for her young daughter. When her imaginary
sources spoke, they were so quotable, their words weaved so
perfectly into her stories, that the editors became suspicious.
Smith gave in to a temptation that as journalists we all know _
born of frustration at not having that perfect quote.
</P>
<P>
   What about Glass? Is he too lazy to do any real reporting or too
ambitious, interested only in promoting his byline and moving on to
higher-paying jobs? The New Republic is not known for high
remuneration. Or maybe he is a fiction writer in the trappings of a
reporter and he will now write a best-selling thriller about Jukt
Micronics that will be bought by Hollywood for millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This becomes particularly poignant when we have, in other parts
of the world, journalists laying their lives on the line to tell
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The trials and tribulations of the four U.S. reporters who
manipulated the truth are a reminder that, as journalists, we have
difficult choices to make _ and that, at times, as human beings, we
make mistakes. The faces of the eight slain journalists are
reminders of the dangers and the bravery of telling it.

PATENTLY, THE U.S. HAS A LEAD _ BUT CAN IT BE PROTECTED?

   High wages are the birthright of Americans. But in a world
economy, says Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School,
high wages have to be earned. Increasingly, he argues, they have to
be earned through innovation _ by offering new things that can be
sold at top prices.
</P>
<P>
   America can never beat China and Indonesia in hand-stitching
sneakers. We have to focus on the high-profit items _ new drugs,
the latest software and the design and marketing of sneakers. To
maximize those things, argued Porter in a recent speech to chief
executives, we need to know why some countries succeed in creating
many new things, and others don't.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of innovation, Porter chose patents filed in more
than one country. The countries with the highest rates of
international patenting _ Japan, Switzerland, the United States and
Germany _ have high exports and high wages.
</P>
<P>
   In work for the corporate-funded Council on Competitiveness in
Washington, D.C., Porter tracked down the factors in international
patenting. He found that high-patent societies tend to be open and
competitive. They protect intellectual property rights. They have
money to spend, and they spend a lot on higher education and the
employment of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Who employs those scientists is a question that matters.
Scientists employed in the private and not-for-profit sectors
produce more patents than those employed by government. ``I'm sorry
about that for some of you here,'' Porter said at a recent
conference, ``but that's what the model showed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another finding is that the number of scientific articles _ a
measure of basic science _ ``is not actually significant'' in
explaining the rates of patenting.
</P>
<P>
   This is a shock. Americans expect basic research to pay off in
dollars and cents. Yet British biochemist Terence Kealey argued in
his 1996 book, ``The Economic Laws of Scientific Research,'' that
Britain leads Europe in scientific papers per capita. If basic
science is what counts, Britain should also lead Europe in patents.
Actually, it is far behind, at less than one-fifth the rate of the
Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Porter's findings is that of all the measures of
capital markets _ how well societies set aside money for new
ventures _ ``none of them are significant'' in explaining why some
societies have more patents.
</P>
<P>
   This is another odd result. How could venture money not be
important in generating patents? Perhaps, Porter suggests, other
countries have different ways of funding new ventures and we're not
measuring them.
</P>
<P>
   What we can measure, and what clearly does count, are spending
in research and development, jobs in research and development, and
spending on high school and college education. And on these
measures, Porter sees reason to worry. The American economy has
been so successful in the 1990s that we have begun to slack off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fundamentals have stagnated, except in the life
sciences,'' Porter says. ``The only place where we see graduate
degrees rising rapidly is in the life sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, new competitors are gaining ground _ and not
the low-wage countries. In international patents, says Porter,
``India, China and Malaysia are not in the game.'' But Taiwan is,
as are South Korea, Singapore and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Taiwan and South Korea each accounted for more
information-technology patents than Britain, says John Yochelson,
president of the Council on Competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. advantage may be draining away. For decades, our
universities have have trained scientists and engineers from around
the world, many of whom have stayed here to work for us. Foreign
students have been a ``great strategic asset to the United
States,'' Yochelson said. But as their home countries develop, more
students from such places as Taiwan and South Korea are returning
home to work.
</P>
<P>
   A final change is that federal funding for science is in a
steady decline. Whether this is bad depends on what the private
sector does in place of it. Federal funding has not been an
unalloyed benefit; much has been for defense, and despite the
military origins of the Internet, defense research has not been an
economic investment. The Swiss and Japanese have done almost none
of it and live fat and happy lives. They kept their research
civilian and private, as ours was before 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we'll follow their way is an open question. But we are
moving away from the pattern of the past 60 years, when science was
driven by the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a new strategy,'' Porter said in his speech to the
chief executives. ``We need to figure out what that is _ and we
need to get it implemented.''

SHAYS FEELS GOP   HEAT OVER FINANCING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A late-night whiff of cigar smoke wafted into the
House chamber as Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut
endured the wrath of his Republican leaders for defying their
back-room strategy to block a new campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Angry voices echoed in the nearly empty chamber as Shays fought
one Republican amendment after another aimed at scuttling an
overhaul plan he is sponsoring with Representative Martin T.
Meehan, a Lowell Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In a midsummer drama that is lurching toward a final scene,
Shays has emerged as a pariah among many Republicans who see his
push for new campaign-finance laws as an unwarranted attack on
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's authority and their incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, yielding to pressure from Shays and his allies in
April, abandoned their opposition to a full debate on how money
mixes with politics in federal elections. They pledged to complete
debate on the issue before the summer recess begins Aug. 7, and the
debate has been scheduled in bits and pieces over seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the development rankles many GOP members, who blame Shays
for turning the spotlight on campaign funding while they scurry to
raise millions of dollars for their reelection races.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continued long after dark Monday, some Republican
lawmakers directed sneers and jeers at Shays. And the possibility
lingered that Gingrich will punish the former Peace Corps volunteer
for his renegade challenge, even as it gains momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy wants to play the game by his rules or take his ball
and go home,'' said Representative Scott McInnis, a Colorado
Republican, moments after clashing with Shays on the House floor
over a campaign-finance amendment. ``That tends to irritate a lot
of his colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays, 52, a moderate who has represented a wealthy district in
southwestern Connecticut for 11 years, has called the current
campaign-finance system a recipe for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill, which already has been subject to 21
Republican amendments, with 34 to go, would ban the unlimited,
largely unregulated contributions known as ``soft money'' that
increasingly have influenced federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the measure's many other provisions is a
requirement that groups running so-called ``issue advocacy''
campaigns aimed at influencing elections disclose how much the
campaigns cost and who contributed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the high-stakes struggle, Shays repeatedly has broken party
decorum in challenging the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich raised procedural obstacles to his overhaul plan,
Shays called them ``dumb'' and ``deceitful.'' He openly questioned
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, on
the House floor in April about the leadership's integrity on the
campaign-finance issue.
</P>
<P>
   And his criticism prompted Representative Tom DeLay of Texas,
the majority whip, to issue an apology last week for appearing to
suggest that people with foreign-sounding names were prone to
breaking campaign-finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Shays's staff did not comply with several requests in recent
days to arrange an interview with him about his standing with House
Republicans. Sources said Shays wants to avoid unnecessary
controversy as his long quest for a vote on the Shays-Meehan bill
appears to be nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
   However, Shays also faces the possibility of sanctions by
Republican leaders for future acts that are seen as undermining the
GOP majority.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said Shays' recent defiance of party leaders
prompted them to circulate a petition calling on Gingrich to punish
GOP members who break ranks with the majority on major procedural
issues. Gingrich was among the first lawmakers to sign the
petition.
</P>
<P>
   For Shays, the punishment could mean losing his chairmanship of
a subcomittee on human resources and his ranking as the
third-most-senior Republican on the powerful House Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the potential cost of his standing up to the GOP leaders,
Shays's allies described his effort on the campaign-finance front
in heroic terms.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers in both parties said Shays had distinguished
himself as admirably as Representative Greg Ganske, an Iowa
Republican, who defied GOP leaders last week by appearing with
President Clinton at a Capitol Hill event promoting broader rights
for patients in managed-care health programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Chris is taking a lot of heat,'' said Representative
Patrick J. Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat who favors rewriting
the campaign-finance laws. ``But members of both parties respect
his integrity on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Shays who spent months enlisting enough Republican allies
to form a majority coalition with the Democratic minority and force
GOP leaders to permit a full debate on the Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been very much a discomfort for a lot of people in our
party,'' said Representative Zach Wamp, a Tennesee Republican who
joined Shays and a dozen other GOP members in signing a petition in
April that spurred the leadership to act.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shays, Wamp has been the target of a blistering backlash,
including radio ad campaigns in their districts funded by the
National Right to Life Committee, a vigorous opponent of
Shays-Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wamp said he and Shays have faced some of the most stinging
criticism from their Republican colleagues. ``There's no question
we have felt their wrath,'' he said. ``The cutting comments, the
constant looks, we get them all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign-finance debate, Shays has chastised
Republican colleagues who have vowed to vote against his bill yet
continue to offer amendments to the measure that he denounces as
``poison pills.''
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed as ``foolish'' a proposal by Representative Anne M.
Northup, a Kentucky Republican, to ban political parties and
candidates from paying cash to workers who help get voters to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, support for the Shays-Meehan bill appears to continue to
grow. In a key victory Monday, Shays-Meehan supporters defeated an
amendment, 248-150, that they said was aimed at breaking apart
their majority coalition. The measure would have required labor
unions to disclose their spending on all political activities, not
just elections.
</P>
<P>
   As the vote ended, Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a New York
Republican who favors Shays-Meehan, said he knew what Shays was
experiencing because he has encountered similar wrath from GOP
colleagues as a leading proponent of strict environmental
regulations. But he said he expects that Shays will survive the
storm.

   TOKYO _ Well before the sun rises every weekday, a few hundred
day laborers crowd outside a social-welfare center in a
hardscrabble district of northeast Tokyo. Some try to crawl under a
metal shutter so that they can be first at the job placement
window, and when the gate rattles open at 6:30, there is a ragged,
desperate scramble to the front of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Only four jobs were given out on a recent morning, about average
these days as construction projects falter and contractors go bust
during Japan's worst recession in 23 years. Hundreds who didn't get
work face another day without pay, so many remain till 9 to get
vouchers for a flophouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here an hour early and pushed my way to the front and
got a job. I was one of the lucky ones. I feel sorry for people
around me _ a lot of these people can't eat,'' said Minoru Sato,
48, a driver. ``I can only get jobs 10 or 15 days a month now.
Something strange is happening this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town in a glittering office tower, dozens of men laid off
from white-collar jobs are learning to fold linens, bus tables, and
make beds, hoping a hotel and restaurant training course gives them
a new start. In a high-rent district nearby, once-overflowing
boutiques attract fewer passersby, while the government employment
office draws a steady stream of visitors in business suits,
visitors with downcast eyes and dwindling savings.
</P>
<P>
   A nation that long has prided itself on nearly full employment,
Japan is suffering its worst rates of joblessness and bankruptcy
since World War II. In contrast to other Asian nations, rocked by
huge debt and devalued currency, Japan's economy is not in a
meltdown; it has been stagnant for most of the decade. It's hard to
see many obvious signs of decline in this bustling, expensive city.
But at companies where tough layoff decisions are being made and at
job centers where fewer opportunities are available, the human
impact of the recession is painfully evident.
</P>
<P>
   The economic crisis is still more psychological than real for
many Japanese. But that could change if a new prime minister, to be
chosen Friday, fails to restructure an economy that is regulated,
protected, and bogged down with bad loans and inefficient
companies. Any overhaul, however, will mean more job losses and
business failures in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Fear and discontent over the economy fed a revolt of urban
voters last week that forced Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to
resign and spurred the three Liberal Democratic Party politicians
vying for his job to promise tax cuts and government spending to
reverse the recession.
</P>
<P>
   But many Japanese are likely to hoard a tax break rather than
spend it, because they worry where their next yen is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, everyone was so certain that our future would be
bright. Now we're not so sure,'' said Tsuyoshi Sudo, 25, a systems
engineer. Although he doesn't know anyone who was laid off, he is
still worried. ``Even if things aren't so bad now, we feel Japan
doesn't have the means to make things better.''
</P>
<P>
   Yurika Kurakata, 22, a recent college graduate, says the
recession is hitting low-income people hardest, while those who are
better off can live off their savings for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might not be traveling as much, we might cut out some
luxuries, but our lives are not that different than before,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that doesn't make the slump easier to accept. ``Japanese
have pride in their economy and country, because we were previously
leading the world, and we don't want to admit we're in a
recession,'' Kurakata said. ``The government is trying hard to
avoid a panic like what triggered the Great Depression ... but I'm
scared. If a crisis did happen, it would be so hard to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, even with a growth rate near zero for several years, the
standard of living has remained fairly constant,, said Teizo Taya,
managing director of the Daiwa Institute of Research. There is
nothing to compare to the hunger or panic that has savaged
countries such as Indonesia, but there are subtle signs of despair
and downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's notoriously pricey bars and shops still see traffic, but
many proprietors admit sales are down as customers linger over
fewer drinks or buy one article of status clothing instead of
three. Taxi drivers are suffering as people stay home more. And
although prices have fallen, people aren't buying. This creates a
vicious cycle, since lower consumption leads to company losses and
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sei Kojima, a salesman for a new line of Toyota luxury cars
called Progres, said his showroom is meeting its goals, but admits
a few customers canceled orders when their bonuses were eliminated.
``For me, things are still OK, but ... anybody could get fired at
any time these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors circulate of laid-off bankers with hefty car loans and
mortgages whose wives are now working as escorts. Gambling on horse
races, bicycle and boat contests, and lottery tickets is up. Newly
homeless men in business suits have been found sleeping on park
benches. Students interviewed say their parents have sent them to
less-expensive universities.
</P>
<P>
   Those hit hardest, of course, are the record 4.1 percent _ or
2.9 million people _ unemployed, and the victims of the 10,173
bankruptcies in the first half of this year, a nearly 30 percent
jump from the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
   A corresponding jobless rate in the United States would be
considered good news. But in a country that pays companies to keep
excess workers on the payroll, and where a job so defines one's
identity, it is cause for national shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can't be talking about pride at a time like this, but
I don't want to lower my standards,'' said a weary-looking Katsuji
Suetake, 50, who was laid off last month from his management job at
a women's apparel company, and was searching job boards a few days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   He soon may be too desperate to be choosy. ``I'm having
difficulty in all aspects of my life,'' Suetake said. ``I can't go
on any longer without a job. I'm borrowing from relatives and I
need to pay it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Osamu Mori, 43, former head of accounting for an electronics
manufacturer, also feels adrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the same job my whole life. I don't even know how to
look for a job,'' he said. ``I've been looking since March, but
there are too many applicants for each job.... I was laid off with
quite a few people, so I'm worried about them as well. And I'm
worried about supporting my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the government's Hello Work jobs center say they
get 10 to 20 applicants for every posting now, as opposed to five
in the past. In May, there were 2.5 million people seeking work in
state-run employment offices nationwide _ up 14 percent from last
year _ but only 1.25 million jobs were available.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the street, I don't notice or feel like there's a
recesssion,'' said Fujio Aoyanagi, employment counseling director
at the Hello Work branch in Shibuya District. ``But in this office,
I meet people all day who've been laid off.... The hardest hit are
white-collar,'' age 45 and up. ``The saddest are people over 55,
who are 30 percent of applicants but eligible for only 5 percent of
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the United States, employers can openly restrict
postings by age here. Unemployment insurance pays three months at
60 percent salary for people who have worked at least six months,
and is limited to 300 days for those who have worked a lifetime,
according to Aoyanagi.
</P>
<P>
   At one training center in the Iidabashi business district,
scores of men in their 50s are trying to reclaim their lives. Their
companies forced them to retire without pensions, and these people
have given up on getting a job in their field.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiake Kume, 58, used to run a department for a machine
manufacturer. Many small firms, such as the company where he used
to work, have taken the brunt of the downturn and been forced to
downsize, accounting for 70 percent of layoffs. Today, Kume wears a
white shirt with a bow tie and name tag, and is training to be a
waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Kume is sure he will master the skills, and he expects new jobs
will be created by the government's promised deregulation of the
service and finance sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my fear,'' he confided, ``is that young people will take
those jobs. Whether they are available to us is another question.''

   Mrs. Wu had entered the emergency room at New York Downtown
Hospital gasping for air. The elderly woman had been shopping with
her daughter when suddenly her legs lost power and her lungs grew
tight. Wu's electrotrocardiogram _ the tracing of electrical
activity in the heart _ looked erratic. Instead of a smooth tracing
bringing forth 80 beautifully spaced spikes a minute, it was
spitting out a rapid-fire and asynchronous 140 spikes, or
heartbeats, a minute. Her ailment: atrial fibrillation. Tony Dajer,

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Since it was developed a decade ago, laparoscopic surgery _ in
which instruments are inserted through small incisions _ has been
used by surgeons whenever possible. Patients are less traumatized,
require shorter hospital stays and heal faster than with
conventional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the benefits, laparoscopy is a challenging
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surgeons find it hard,'' says Shankar Sastry, an electrical
engineer at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It's like
operating with chopsticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, laparoscopic instruments are mainly limited to scissors,
staplers (to close incisions or attach blood vessels) and graspers
(to manipulate tissue).
</P>
<P>
   The instruments enter the body through a long tube. A video
image from a tiny camera called an endoscope poked through another
incision guides the surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   For a relatively simple procedure like gallbladder removal, the
tools work well enough. But surgeons can't use the instruments to
perform complicated tasks like suturing and knot tying. Because of
these limitations, Sastry says, most operations can't be performed
endoscopically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to do something like a colectomy
laparoscopically because there is less trauma to the patient. These
people are already pretty sick, and if you then press them to
undergo a traumatic operation, they could die. But it's not a good
idea to staple the ends of the colon together, and that is the
reason minimally invasive surgery is not done,'' Sastry says. ``And
of course the real prize is to be able to do cardiac surgery this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sastry and his Berkeley colleagues have developed laparoscopic
tools _ including miniature robotic hands with the dexterity to tie
knots _ that bring surgeons closer to that prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason you have to cut a person open is to get the
surgeon's hands in there,'' he says. ``They like to get their hands
around the organs, to palpate them. It's what they are used to. But
if you can get little instruments in there that let the surgeons
feel as if they are working with their hands in a normal procedure,
you don't have to have a big incision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley system consists of a pencil-size joystick (one each
for the surgeon's right and left hands), a computer, and right-hand
and left-hand end effectors _ the robotic instruments that snake
into the body to perform the actual surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In early models these resembled three-fingered hands. Now each
hydraulically powered end effector consists of a single digit,
three to four inches long and less than half an inch wide. It has
four joints that rotate, swivel and swing back and forth and a
grasper at the end. The result: A finger that functions like an
entire hand.
</P>
<P>
   To operate, a surgeon _ who can be in the same room as the
patient or at a remote location _ uses the joysticks just as he
would normal surgical instruments. A computer program translates
the surgeon's motions into the movements of the end effectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is completely anthropomorphic,'' Sastry says. ``If you move
in, the instrument moves in; if you move to the right, the
instrument moves to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   The system also has force feedback, which relays to doctors the
response of muscles and other tissues to their actions. The
feedback makes the procedure feel more like normal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The research team is also working on tactile sensors that will
transmit the feel of tissue to the surgeon's fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   As this article is being written, surgeons at the University of
California at San Francisco Medical Center are about to test the
system by performing colectomies on pigs. If the trial succeeds,
and the FDA gives its approval, clinical trials on humans could
begin next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall goal,'' Sastry says, ``is pretty lofty: to not cut
a person open unless there is just nothing else to do _ for
instance, if you have to replace a hip, there is no choice but to
get in there and remove the old hip _ but in every instance to make
sutures and cuts that are as small as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to give surgeons the feel of open surgery
with all the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, and that's
where I'd like us to go.''

<P>
   Since it was developed a decade ago, laparoscopic surgery _ in
which instruments are inserted through small incisions _ has been
used by surgeons whenever possible. Patients are less traumatized,
require shorter hospital stays and heal faster than with
conventional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the benefits, laparoscopy is a challenging
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surgeons find it hard,'' says Shankar Sastry, an electrical
engineer at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It's like
operating with chopsticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, laparoscopic instruments are mainly limited to scissors,
staplers (to close incisions or attach blood vessels) and graspers
(to manipulate tissue).
</P>
<P>
   The instruments enter the body through a long tube. A video
image from a tiny camera called an endoscope poked through another
incision guides the surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   For a relatively simple procedure like gallbladder removal, the
tools work well enough. But surgeons can't use the instruments to
perform complicated tasks like suturing and knot tying. Because of
these limitations, Sastry says, most operations can't be performed
endoscopically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to do something like a colectomy
laparoscopically because there is less trauma to the patient. These
people are already pretty sick, and if you then press them to
undergo a traumatic operation, they could die. But it's not a good
idea to staple the ends of the colon together, and that is the
reason minimally invasive surgery is not done,'' Sastry says. ``And
of course the real prize is to be able to do cardiac surgery this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sastry and his Berkeley colleagues have developed laparoscopic
tools _ including miniature robotic hands with the dexterity to tie
knots _ that bring surgeons closer to that prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason you have to cut a person open is to get the
surgeon's hands in there,'' he says. ``They like to get their hands
around the organs, to palpate them. It's what they are used to. But
if you can get little instruments in there that let the surgeons
feel as if they are working with their hands in a normal procedure,
you don't have to have a big incision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley system consists of a pencil-size joystick (one each
for the surgeon's right and left hands), a computer, and right-hand
and left-hand end effectors _ the robotic instruments that snake
into the body to perform the actual surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In early models these resembled three-fingered hands. Now each
hydraulically powered end effector consists of a single digit,
three to four inches long and less than half an inch wide. It has
four joints that rotate, swivel and swing back and forth and a
grasper at the end. The result: A finger that functions like an
entire hand.
</P>
<P>
   To operate, a surgeon _ who can be in the same room as the
patient or at a remote location _ uses the joysticks just as he
would normal surgical instruments. A computer program translates
the surgeon's motions into the movements of the end effectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is completely anthropomorphic,'' Sastry says. ``If you move
in, the instrument moves in; if you move to the right, the
instrument moves to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   The system also has force feedback, which relays to doctors the
response of muscles and other tissues to their actions. The
feedback makes the procedure feel more like normal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The research team is also working on tactile sensors that will
transmit the feel of tissue to the surgeon's fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   As this article is being written, surgeons at the University of
California at San Francisco Medical Center are about to test the
system by performing colectomies on pigs. If the trial succeeds,
and the FDA gives its approval, clinical trials on humans could
begin next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall goal,'' Sastry says, ``is pretty lofty: to not cut
a person open unless there is just nothing else to do _ for
instance, if you have to replace a hip, there is no choice but to
get in there and remove the old hip _ but in every instance to make
sutures and cuts that are as small as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to give surgeons the feel of open surgery
with all the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, and that's
where I'd like us to go.''

   ``Magnesium?'' Winnie asked, keeping her tone as loose as an
unwinding coil of slack line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup. Magnesium,'' I repeated. ``One gram IV.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she was sure I meant it, she produced the vial. ``One gram,
coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wu, our elderly patient, had come in gasping for air. She
had been shopping with her daughter when suddenly her legs lost
power and her lungs grew right.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Mrs. Wu arrived, Winnie had put her on oxygen. Now
she seemed a little better. But she still clutched her daughter's
hand and kept up a steady singsong of Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wu's electrotrocardiogram _ the tracing of electrical
activity in the heart _ looked erratic. Instead of a smooth tracing
bringing forth 80 beautifully spaced spikes a minute, it was
spitting out a rapid-fire and asynchronous 140 spikes, or
heartbeats, a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wu's heart was creating a painting that already had a
title: atrial fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   Our hearts have four chambers to handle the intricate job of
replenishing oxygen-poor blood and pumping it out. While the right
atrium and right ventricle pump oxygen-poor blood from the body out
to the lungs, the left atrium and left ventricle receive
oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pump it to the rest of the
body.
</P>
<P>
   The atria and ventricles must work together to achieve the
split-second timing that allows the chambers of the heart to pump
blood in and out some 60 to 100 times a minute, day in day out.
</P>
<P>
   The atria set the rhythm for the muscular contractions we call
the heartbeat, and the ventricles supply the horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   A heartbeat begins when the natural pacemaker in the right
atrium fires. The electric discharge then ripples through the
atria, which contract to propel blood into the ventricles.
</P>
<P>
   To set off a contraction in the ventricles, the electric signals
then passes through a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular
node _ in the fibrous tissue separating the atria from the
ventricles below.
</P>
<P>
   The signal then streaks down specialized trunk cables called
Purkinje fibers that fan out into the thick ventricular muscle and
bring forth a life-giving contraction.
</P>
<P>
   In Mrs. Wu's case, each atrial cell was blaring at will like an
orchestra in revolt. Millions of clashing electric wavelets reduced
her atrial ripple to chaos.
</P>
<P>
   There are many conditions that can cause atrial fibrillation.
But it can also mysteriously pounce on healthy young people. In
Mrs. Wu's case, her 72 years were probably to blame, though we
would still hunt for the usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   I glanced at the overhead monitor. Mrs. Wu watched me intently.
She raised her tight hand and fluttered it over her chest. ``Yes, I
know,'' I nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Her heartbeats came in a rush of fluorescent green spikes. The
squiggly chaos in between represented her atria shuddering _ 500
times a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the atrioventricular node is a responsible gatekeeper;
it doesn't respond to every erratic atrial discharge, or the
ventricles would quiver into life-ending impotence.
</P>
<P>
   But the atrioventricular node can't always hold down the atrial
cacophony. In some cases, when it fails, the ventricles beat too
fast and fill inefficiently. Blood pressure then drops and blood
starts eddying back into the lungs, cutting off oxygen flow to the
body.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is theoretically simple: Boost the atrioventricular
node's blocking power and slow down the ventricles. Resynchronizing
the atria would be even better, but that's a harder trick.
</P>
<P>
   Atrial fibrillation has been recognized for centuries. And so,
curiously, has the mainstay of treatment, digitalis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1785, William Withering described the foxglove plant's
``power over the motion of the heart.'' He had his patients chew
the foxglove leaf for the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   We modern hotshots now understand that the active principle in
foxglove is digitalis, and we use a digitalis analogue _ digoxin _
in pills and intravenous solution.
</P>
<P>
   The compound works, through a complicated mechanism, by boosting
the atrioventricular node's damping action and thus slowing the
ventricular rate.
</P>
<P>
   There are newer drugs to be sure, but each has its drawback.
Among the most widely used is diltiazem _ a calcium channel
blocker. But that brings us to ions, and magnesium, and ancient
seas.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical impulses _ the life-giving current between nerve and
muscle cells _ arose when our primordial ancestors fashioned cell
membranes that strictly control the flow of different ions in and
out of the cell. (An ion is a molecule or atom that has lost or
gained an electron; the main players in heart tissue are potassium,
sodium and calcium ions.)
</P>
<P>
   Cells in the heart suck potassium ions in and push sodium ions
out. This inside-outside difference is achieved by pumps in the
cell membrane that work like submicroscopic waterwheels, exchanging
sodium ions for potassium ions.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting segregation of ions creates a small electrical
potential within the cell. But electrical impulses cannot travel
from cell to cell without another mechanism: ion channels embedded
in the cell membrane.
</P>
<P>
   When jolted by an electric discharge from a neighboring cell,
certain ion channels in the cell membrane open, allowing sodium
ions to pour in. When the influx of sodium reaches a threshold, it
triggers the release of electrons from the cell _ this is the
electrical impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Ion channels in a neighboring cell sense the electron discharge
and open, allowing sodium ions to rush in. This, in turn, changes
the charge within that cell, causing it to unleash a storm of
electrons to its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Its a domino effect that happens so fast that the electrical
impulse is propagated nearly instantaneously across the cardiac
muscle. The result: The coordinated contraction we call the
heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first cell's pumps drive sodium ions out and suck
potassium ions back in, thus restoring the cell's original state of
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The bandleaders of this intricate sequence are the pacemaker
cells. They and the cells in the atrioventricular node depend not
on sodium but on a third ion, calcium, to slowly leak in through
its channels and trigger a discharge.
</P>
<P>
   This system of channels and pumps makes the most intricate
watchwork look like child's play. But its intricacy is also its
weak point. When the timing mechanism is off, normally obedient
cells start firing on their own, sparking all sorts of mayhem,
which is where magnesium _ call it the damage-control ion _ comes
in.
</P>
<P>
   Magnesium sulfate, the stuff of Epsom salts and an essential
nutrient, has been recognized for more than 40 years as having
antiarrhythmic properties.
</P>
<P>
   When I checked in on Mrs. Wu, I found her with her eyes closed,
but her hand kept fluttering over her chest like an anxious
sparrow.
</P>
<P>
   The faster I slowed Mrs. Wu's rate the better. Digitalis would
work, but it takes three hours for its effects to be felt. While
diltiazem, the calcium channel blocker, works more quickly, it can
drop a patient's blood pressure. And Mrs. Wu's was 100 systolic,
which was a bit borderline.
</P>
<P>
   I watched the magnesium drip into Mrs. Wu's IV. No change. Her
monitor still pattered as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, OK give her the digoxin,'' I sighed to Winnie. She smiled
consolingly.
</P>
<P>
   I left the cardiac room to see other patients. Ten minutes
later, she was tugging at my sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``She converted,'' Winnie announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Wu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Already?'' Puzzled, I said, ``Boy, that digoxin worked fast.''
Though I knew very well that it usually only slows the rate without
making it stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Winnie insisted. ``The magnesium.'' Then she held up a
syringe filled with a clear solution. ``Digoxin. I haven't given it
yet. It was the magnesium.''
</P>
<P>
   We rushed back together. Mrs. Wu's monitor beeped contentedly at
a regular 84 beats a minute. Her daughter smiled at us and placed a
hand over her own heart and said, ``Much better. Not so fast now.''
</P>
<P>
   A resident later asked me how I had treated Mrs. Wu. My response
caused his eyes to open wide in surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Epsom salts,'' I explained, ``magnesium sulfate. I guess now
we're going to have to do a study ...''

syringe filled with a clear solution. ``Digoxin. I haven't given it
yet. It was the magnesium.''
</P>
<P>
   We rushed back together. Mrs. Wu's monitor beeped contentedly at
a regular 84 beats a minute. Her daughter smiled at us and placed a
hand over her own heart and said, ``Much better. Not so fast now.''
</P>
<P>
   A resident later asked me how I had treated Mrs. Wu. My response
caused his eyes to open wide in surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Epsom salts,'' I explained, ``magnesium sulfate. I guess now
we're going to have to do a study ...''

CAR DONATION PROGRAM HELPS PEOPLE IN NEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BURLINGTON, Vt. _ &UR;  &LR; A car is your life's blood if you're one of
the rural poor, living in the country with no buses, no trains, no
trolleys.
</P>
<P>
   An automobile means that everything is made easier: Buying
groceries. Going to the doctor. Doing the laundry. It means you
don't have to ask friends and family for rides.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it means a job.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Pecor, &UR;  &LR; a 29-year-old single mother of two young girls,
had a new job that was going to get her off of welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But then she and her boyfriend split up. And suddenly Pecor was
without a ride to work. She couldn't afford to buy a car, not even
a used one. So she had to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest, I felt like my legs had been cut
off,'' said Pecor, who lives in a trailer in Milton, north of
Burlington, with a girlfriend and one of her daughters. Her other
daughter lives with Pecor's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Then someone told Pecor about the Good News Garage, a
first-of-its-kind program that fixes and sells donated cars to
people in need. The garage was started by a handful of Evangelical
Lutheran churches in the Burlington area two years ago, with
initial funding from Lutheran Social Services of New England.
</P>
<P>
   In May, she drove away from the Good News Garage here in a 1982
silver Chevrolet Citation. She paid $263.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``When I got the car it was like I sprouted wings,'' said
Pecor, who got her job back and went off welfare last month. ``I
was free of having to depend on other people to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pecor and others with little disposable income, no car
equals tough times, particularly in rural states with little public
transit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``In the whole spectrum of welfare reform, transportation
stands out as one of the top issues that states are going to have
to deal with,'' said William Waldman, executive director of the
American Public Human Services Association, a Washington-based
advocacy group for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, service jobs are sprouting in remote places that can
only be reached by car. In Williston, a town outside Burlington
with no public transportation, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, and Circuit
City have opened stores recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have decent jobs, but if you don't have a car you're out
of luck,'' said the Rev. Frederick K. Neu, pastor of Ascension
Lutheran Church in South Burlington, one of the congregations that
helped start the Good News Garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who have cars take them for granted,'' added Neu,
sitting inside the red brick building that houses the garage by the
shores of Lake Champlain. ``But if you don't have one, life is very
different. It affects what kind of job you have, where you live,
where you go to buy groceries, everything. It's the difference
between being able to provide for your family and being out on the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, nearly 300 cars have been donated to the Good News
program. Many, beyond repair, were sent to the junk yard. The
garage prefers cars that are less than 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We don't want anyone's yard ornament,'' &UR;  &LR; said Hal Colston, a
member of Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Jericho, who was hired
to direct the garage.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 donated cars are sitting outside the garage and at
several church parking lots waiting to be repaired. The Good News
Garage, which has a budget of $220,000, does not make any profit on
the cars. It only charges for the cost of repairs, and it is
difficult for the garage to raise money for additional mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the garage has sold 140 cars for an average of $550. But
there are still 350 people on the waiting list. There is an income
limit for applicants pegged to the federal poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   The program's success has drawn attention from 50 communities
nationwide interested in starting something similar. Edith Lohr,
president of Lutheran Social Services of New England, said the
agency hopes to start programs in Sturbridge, Mass., and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Erica Quinby, 20, a single mother who lives in Middlebury, was
all smiles the other day as she screwed a license plate on the 1989
Honda Civic she was buying for $530.
</P>
<P>
   Quinby, who receives money through Aid to Needy Families with
Children, starts a job in September doing outreach to single
parents and young families. She needs a car, but her last one, a
1980 Saab, died last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then she has borrowed her mother's car or ridden the buses
in Middlebury.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``But it's not easy carrying a stroller and carrying groceries
on the bus,'' said Quinby, who applied six months ago to the Good
News Garage. ``And there's no way I could do this job without a
car. The car will bring me financial indpendence and is another
piece to get me going in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Cathie Jones had already experienced the rush of independence
that comes up with a job and car. She had been on welfare for about
15 years before she went back to school for a degree in medical
record-keeping. She got a job last year at two area Brooks
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   But her car stopped running in December. And Jones had to count
on her elderly uncle to drive her back and forth to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt bad because he was doing this for me,'' said
Jones, who lives in Winooski, near Burlington. ``But I had no money
for another car.''
</P>
<P>
   It took two months, but Jones was finally able to buy a 1987
Honda Accord from the Good News Garage in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like a little girl when I got my car,'' she said. ``It
really changed my attitude. It's a matter of pride to be able to do
things for yourself.''

AFTER SUCCESSFUL STINT, POLICY QUITS AS 49ERS PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Carmen Policy, a driving force behind the
success of the San Francisco 49ers in almost eight years as team
president, has resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The move, not totally unexpected, caps Policy's bitter split
with former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo and reportedly moves former
head coach Bill Walsh, a DeBartolo friend and ally, to top spot as
Policy's likely successor.
</P>
<P>
   Policy was reportedly in Ohio to discuss a possible executive
job with the expansion Cleveland Browns, due to join the NFL for
the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   49ers Vice President Dwight Clark announced the resignation
Tuesday night after meeting with head coach Steve Mariucci and
other team officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exactly stunned, and I'm sorry that it came to this,''
Clark said. ``But as far as this team is concerned, we have a great
team assembled and we're going to go play football. That's what we
do now. Play football and keep them focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Team officials would not speculate about a successor.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation culminates a months-long feud between Policy and
DeBartolo. The longtime friends split over questions of DeBartolo's
involvement in legalized gambling and its impact on the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo relinquished control of the team in December after
learning he could be indicted in a gambling corruption probe in
Louisiana. DeBartolo's sister, Denise DeBartolo York, took over,
but her brother has since moved to regain full ownership of the
club.
</P>
<P>
   Policy has said he hasn't spoken a word to Eddie DeBartolo since
heated meeting Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Policy's departure ends a 15-year association with the 49ers,
during which time the team became the first to win five Super
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Policy joined the 49ers front office in 1983 as vice president
and legal counsel. Before that he had served for many years as
DeBartolo's personal attorney.
</P>
<P>
   He took over as president in January 1991, and was given the
task of rebuilding a team that had won back-to-back Super Bowls two
years before. In 1993, he faced the arduous task of negotiating the
league's first-ever salary cap with a team loaded with well-paid
players.
</P>
<P>
   Policy was a pioneer in manipulating the cap _ stretching out
player compensation over several years to keep the team under the
league limit. Decried as trickery by executives at other franchises
at the time, the approach has since been widely copied.
</P>
<P>
   After the team won Super Bowl XXIX in 1994, Policy was named NFL
Executive of the Year by the Sporting News and Pro Football Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Observers credited Policy's success to his creative accounting,
keen recruiting sense, strong work ethic as well as his close
relationship with DeBartolo. Both natives of Youngstown, Ohio, the
two had been friends for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   To many, the two men were inseparable. They looked so much alike
that publications sometimes confused them in photo captions.
</P>
<P>
   They campaigned hard together last year to pass a $100 million
bond to help pay for a new stadium in San Francisco. The future of
the proposed $525 million stadium and commercial center has since
become murky because of questions about the ownership of the team.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the two men began shortly after DeBartolo
received a letter in November from the U.S. attorney in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said DeBartolo could be indicted by a federal grand
jury in Baton Rouge in connection with a $400,000 payment to former
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards to secure a riverboat gambling
license. DeBartolo has not been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   When DeBartolo relinquished control of the team, Policy retained
his position and gained a minority stake in the team. DeBartolo and
his sister were soon squabbling and the future of the stadium
project.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Policy acknowledged that if DeBartolo regained control
of the team, he would likely be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if I don't fit into Eddie's scheme of things,
where he is, where he wants to go,'' Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   The news comes just as the 49ers training camp starts at its new
location in Stockton.

IN CANADA, WILD HORSES MEET A FRAGILE ECOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ For mariners during the great era of
sail and early decades of steam, Sable Island was the treacherous
``graveyard of the Atlantic,'' site of hundreds of shipwrecks that
claimed thousands of lives over the course of four centuries.
</P>
<P>
   For penny-pinching Colonial New Englanders, however, the island
represented free pasture. In the 1700s, Bostonians of various
stripes _ from an exiled Huguenot preacher to a merchant and horse
thief _ started setting horses out to forage on the forbidding
27-mile-long wedge of sand and sea grass perched on the far eastern
edge of the continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred and fifty years later, the hardy descendants of
those horses still range free on the storm-battered sliver.
</P>
<P>
   But as offshore natural gas projects rise all around Sable, and
as stewardship of the island passes from the Canadian government to
a nonprofit trust comprising representatives from public and
private sectors, the future of the legendary herd, which numbers
about 300 horses, has become the focus of a quiet but furious
debate.
</P>
<P>
   A recent joint study by the Canadian and Nova Scotia governments
suggested that the horses might be eating themselves out of a home,
devouring the sea grass that holds the island together at a pace
that might cause serious ecological harm _ and even destroy Sable
Island altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sable is basically just sand glued together by vegetation,''
said Anthony Lock, a federal biologist and primary author of the
Sable Island Conservation Strategy, the name of the study. ``Lose
too much grass and you could lose the island.''
</P>
<P>
   The study cautiously suggested that if further research shows
hungry horses are hastening the erosion of the fragile strand, then
``consideration should be given to the management of the horse
population.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lexicon of wildlife officialdom, ``management'' means
human intervention to control animal populations for the greater
environmental good _ in theory, it could mean killing off small
numbers of horses to reduce consumption of the coarse grass. It has
also been hinted by officials that the population might be reduced
through use of high-tech birth control methods.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of some specialists, the creatures constitute the
last truly wild horse herd in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only modern herd unmanaged by humans,'' said Ian
A. McLaren, a wildlife biologist at Nova Scotia's Dalhousie
University and author of a book on Sable Island. ``These are
beautiful animals, roaming unfettered as the sea wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the release of the study, headlines across Canada
proclaimed the herd might be culled _ an alarmist spin, to be sure,
but one with enough historical precedent to rouse public fears. In
1960, the government declared the Sable Island horses to be
``surplus'' and announced plans to ship them off to mainland
rendering plants for transformation into dog food and glue.
</P>
<P>
   That scheme was finally scrapped as tearful letters from
hundreds of schoolchildren poured into newspapers and government
offices. ``You should let the ponies have peace,'' wrote elementary
school pupil Michelle Miller of Weston, Ontario, in a widely
publicized letter to then-Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. ``P.S.
My dog and many others do not like horse meat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the new study, letters are again flowing to
editorial pages _ mostly in Nova Scotia _ from animal-loving
citizens suspicious that the government may be up to old tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a highly emotional issue,'' said McLaren. ``Many believe
that after hundreds of years, these horses truly belong to the
island. But some scientists have the gut feeling that you shouldn't
allow feral animals in a wild place, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to hardcore ecologists, the unnatural presence of horses
on the island represents a potentially dangerous intrusion on the
natural order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ecologically moral thing to do is be very watchful of
these large herbivores running loose on a small, fragile island,''
said Lock, who is marine issues biologist with the Atlantic branch
of Environment Canada, the federal environmental protection agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one is officially saying that the horses should be
culled or removed, there is no such plan in place,'' stressed Lock.
``The conservation strategy simply states that we have to research
very carefully whether the horses are damaging the integrity of
Sable.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1737 that Rev. Andrew Le Mercier, a Huguenot _ or
French Protestant _ pastor living in Boston, set the first horses
out to graze among the grand dunes of the island.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades later, another Bostonian, Thomas Hancock,
plundered 60 horses from farmsteads of Acadian settlers expelled
from Nova Scotia by British overlords. The merchant and shipowner
plunked the ill-gotten herd down on Sable, and apparently forgot
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The wild herd of today is descended from these colonial horses.
Actually, there is not one island herd but scores of small herds
consisting of several mares and young horses kept in line by senior
stallions, according to the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History.
The horses grow shaggy coats, subsist on sea grass and spring
water, and huddle between sand dunes when 110-mile-per-hour winter
winds lash the island.
</P>
<P>
   It's a brutal climate, so tough that even ship's rats have
failed to survive. There has been a human presence on Sable Island
since 1801, when Nova Scotia opened a lifesaving outpost on the
island to assist shipwreck victims. Today only three full-time
weather station employees, conducting atmospheric tests, and the
occasional wildlife researcher share the island with the horses,
gray seals, and seabirds.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a mile wide, the low-lying, boomerang-shaped island lies
100 miles east of Nova Scotia, smack in the middle of
trans-Atlantic shipping lanes and _ until the advent of radar and
other modern navigational electronics _ nearly invisible to even
the wariest of skippers until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1583, there have been more than 250 recorded shipwrecks on
its shores _ the actual toll probably exceeds 500 vessels _ with a
loss of about 10,000 lives. The last wreck occurred in 1947; the
life-saving station closed in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Sable is Canada's most remote island, and is shrouded by dense
fog for an average 127 days a year. No other place in North America
is more pummeled by ferocious storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world, a primordial world,'' Norman Bell, 85,
who maintained the island's power station with his wife in the
1960s, recalled earlier this year. ``Nothing can stand there for
long. The wind and sand blows everything away that isn't native,
except those tough old ponies.''

SOME FEAR SHIP REPLICA MAY BE MORE SHOW THAN SAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Mass. _ Next month, a full-rigged $5.8-million replica of
the tall ship that once made this city rich, is scheduled to arrive
here. ``Friendship'' comes loaded with sailing options that would
have left captains of yesteryear sea-green with envy but baffled
because this ship has no plans to leave the dock.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service, which owns the 170-foot long vessel,
says the Friendship's primary mission is to be a stationary
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Then why, critics ask, was the vessel equipped with twin
300-horsepower diesel engines, air conditioning, operational
rigging for 38 sails, power steering, and a Coast Guard certificate
to transport 149 passengers over the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this is an extraordinary waste of money,'' said Rafe
Parker, president of Sea Education Association and founder and
former chairman of the National Maritime Alliance, which serves a
wide range of sea-related institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of ethics. This ship was designed at
considerable expense to sail. Not using it to its full capacity is
a waste of a wonderful concept on which sea education is based,''
Parker added.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Kesselman, superintendent of the Salem Maritime National
Historic Site, counters that while the National Park Service is not
in the business of building a navy, it was prudent to construct a
ship that had the option of sailing sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an evolutionary process. For now, Friendship will be a
dockside, interpretive exhibit. She will not sail, at least for a
couple of years,'' Kesselman said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Friendship appears destined to become deluxe
dockside decor at Derby Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   To be moored at the Salem Maritime National Historic Site,
Friendship is a replica East Indiaman merchant ship receiving final
touches at the Scarano Boat Building yard on the Hudson River in
Albany. Constructed with Douglas fir wood, Friendship is due
mid-August in Salem, where rigging and mast assembly will continue
for at least another year under the auspices of Scarano.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is about a year behind schedule, due in part to the
time it takes to relearn the forgotten art of building big wooden
boats. It also arrives with a price tag paid almost entirely by
taxpayers,who probably will also be picking up the ship's $300,000
annual maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship will join an elite, small family of similarly full
rigged American ships including the Constitution from Charlestown,
Mass. and the Rose from Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   With all the sails set, including the stunsails _ small
banner-like sails set outside the entire rig _ Friendship can fly
38 sails, promising a splendid sight and a daunting challenge for
the crew. The question becomes: how do you find a captain and crew
capable of sailing the shipwhen it seldom, if ever, leaves the
dock?
</P>
<P>
   David Wood, former commander of the Coast Guard tallship Eagle,
questions the wisdom of building a sailing ship without a sailing
plan already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Park Service has sailed into a fundamental conflict. You
can't sail and also be a port ornament. There's an old saying:
`Ships and men rot in port,''' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Harris, a strong supporter of the project and the
executive director of the Salem Partnership, a non-profit booster
for economic development in the region, believes such criticisms
are unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the boat actually here and ready to be tested, we
don't know'' how difficult it will be to sail, Harris said. ``I can
say that, in time, we will learn not only how the ship best fits
into the National Park program, but how we will use it and sail it
to promote Salem.''
</P>
<P>
   One scenario she envisions is taking the ship to special events
such as Tall Ships 2000 in Boston, privately raising the $100,000
needed for such a trip from the ship's dockside admission fee,
T-shirt sales, or private on-board parties held during off-peak
tourist hours. One complicating factor is that the ship, with more
than a 13-foot draft, will only be able to sail through Salem
Harbor at certain tides because of shoals, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials estimate some 800,000 visitors come annually
to the Salem Maritime National Historic Site, which offers few
outdoor exhibits harkening back to the ship trading days of the
late 1700s. It was that dearth of nautical artifacts that gave
birth to the original plea for a ship like the Friendship, first
voiced more than a decade ago by the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1994, after much prodding by US Senators John
Kerry and Edward Kennedy, and former US Representative Peter
Torkildsen, the US Congress committed $4.3 million to the project.
The Salem Partnership raised another $1.05 &UR;  &LR; million from state,
county and city sources, and $300,000 from private pockets. Harris
said the remaining $150,000 will be raised when potential donors
have a chance to actually see the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Dewell Smith, executive director of the American Sail
Training Association that takes many sailing cadets to sea each
year, praises Salem for building a ship that meets sea-going
specifications despite the current lack of game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken the long view. You can't go from 0 to 60 in this
business overnight. It's far more prudent to feel out your
community, then set a plan,'' Smith said.

FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS, A DIFFICULT PROPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even now, with the deadline to end bilingual
education for California schoolchildren looming, the adults in
charge of dismantling the programs continue to fight over language.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of bilingual education insist that 60 days is enough
time to rewrite education history. Besides, they add, the law is
the law. But the people who back bilingual education call the
timetable impossible, and argue that the voter referendum known as
Proposition 227 is irresponsible anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The result is confusion in most school districts and open
defiance in others, with two of the largest saying they may refuse
to comply and the largest _ Los Angeles _ agreeing to go halfway at
best. While Proposition 227 allows parents to sue teachers who
refuse to teach in English, state educators concede they may have
no way of knowing which classrooms are emphasizing English and
which are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, schools are going to have extraordinary
flexibility,'' said Sonia Hernandez, deputy superintendent for
curriculum and instruction at the state Department of Education.
``If some teacher refuses to comply and closes their classroom
door, it's going to be almost impossible to know. ... The truth of
the matter is we can't be the Prop 227 police.''
</P>
<P>
   As opponents of bilingual education interpret the law, students
must be reading and writing in English by Aug. 3, or 60 days after
Californians voted overwhelming to put a stop to learning in other
languages. Sherri Annis of English for the English, the group that
pushed the initiative, said its intention is clear: Students must
be immersed in English. She noted that some school districts are
enthusiastic about the change.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of bilingual education say they cannot meet the
deadline, and add that the law's wording is open to interpretation.
As a result, no one expects the issue to be settled by the start of
the upcoming school year despite a federal judge's refusal to block
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making what we believe is a reasonable attempt to
comply, but there's no way we can do it in time,'' said Joe Tafoya,
deputy superintendent of the predominantly Hispanic Santa Ana
Unified School District, where 37,000 of 53,000 students are in
limited-English programs. ``We don't have the books, we don't have
the materials, we don't have a plan from our board yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Santa Ana, where classes are held year-round, many of the
1,011 school districts statewide are only now coming to grips with
Proposition 227. In addition to retraining teachers, preparing new
coursework, and scrambling for schoolbooks, some are also teaching
parents how to use a loophole in the law and insist on bilingual
education for their children.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, educators in Oakland and San Francisco say
they are bound by a federal consent decree to offer bilingual
classes no matter what voters want. The Los Angeles Unified School
District plans to go only partway: Teach most students in English
but help them in their native languages if necessary. Others, such
as Long Beach, plan a gradual phase-in of English immersion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're caught between the feds and the state, so the school
superintendent has not rushed out to do anything'' to prepare, said
Sue Piper, spokeswoman for the Oakland Unified School District,
where about a third of the 53,000 students are in limited-English
programs. ``We do know kids all learn in different ways whether
they're bilingual or not, and we do take exception to a program
which requires only one approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 227, pushed by a Silicon Valley multimillionaire and
opposed 2-1 by Hispanic voters, forbids teaching students in any
language except English _ unless their parents, teachers,
principal, and local school superintendent agree bilingual
education is best for them. Many districts are planning to help
parents apply for those waivers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, eight districts have asked the state Board of Education
to grant them blanket waivers, Hernandez said. But the board
decided it had no authority to override voters, a decision being
appealed in court. While the board has developed a set of
regulations regarding the new law, it remains unclear how
compliance will be monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the state really equipped to run around from classroom to
classroom asking, `Did you speak Spanish before recess or after?'''
asked Jim Schultz, executive director of the San Francisco-based
Democracy Center, which trains community groups to get involved in
politics. ``How do you check how these kids are being taught?''
</P>
<P>
   Before Proposition 227, about 1.4 million public school students
were enrolled in limited-English programs, with a third of them in
formal bilingual classes. Now all will be required to spend the
first 30 days of the school year immersed in English, even if
parents want taught them in Spanish, Mandarin, or any of the myriad
languages represented in California schools.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the only alternative is to ignore the law. That, they
say, will allow time to negotiate a compromise that allows some
form of bilingual teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to students is that there is a time and a place to
resist the law,'' Schultz said. ``This was a law imposed on Latinos
by white voters. ... I realize that's harsh rhetoric, and that's
not to say there isn't plenty of room for reform in bilingual
education, but playing with a child's education isn't the way.''

FATHER'S DAY DREAM COMES TRUE FOR SON OF YANKEES PARIAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Jim Bouton kept trying to convince himself that
the cold war with the New York Yankees would end someday. He is
blessed and cursed with a stubbornly optimistic streak. Besides, he
couldn't bear to consider the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Bouton is the author of ``Ball Four,'' not ``Mein Kampf.'' For
nearly three decades, the Yankees have declined to draw a
distinction. Bouton won 21 games for the Yankees in 1963 and 18 the
next season. ``Ball Four'' went into print in 1970, and the Yankees
went to great pains not to acknowledge Bouton's existence after
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim who?'' Mickey Mantle said in response to a book that dared
mix some of the bad with the good. Nearly a quarter of a century
passed before Mantle spoke to Bouton again. Bouton was easy enough
for the old Yankees guard to avoid, because he never got invited
back for Old-Timers' Day. When his phone didn't ring, he could
always be sure it was Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought eventually they were going to have to invite me,''
Bouton said. ``I was planning on being the oldest living Yankee. So
at some point, at 89 ... I was just thinking that when I finally
show up, I might not even know I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   The wait of the world lifted from Bouton on July 15. The phone
finally rang, and it was the Yankees. They invited him to be at
Yankees Stadium on Saturday for Old-Timers' Day. It took a lot of
convincing before Bouton would allow himself to believe it was
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people call me in the past saying, `This is George
Steinbrenner; you're coming back to the stadium,''' Bouton said.
``Friends of mine. Goofing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouton is 59, and he'll be gratefully aware of his surroundings.
He'll know everything it took to make this possible, and he'll
probably have a good cry.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   Without his father knowing it, Michael Bouton wrote a letter
several weeks ago to The New York Times. Michael wrote the letter
hoping that on Father's Day the newspaper might see fit to print at
least excerpts of what he had to say about his father's exile from
anything having to do with the Yankees. Michael didn't know if it
would do any good, but he didn't know what else to do. He did know
there wasn't much left to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is Father's Day,'' Michael began, ``but the date I have
circled on my calendar is July 25. That is Old-Timers' Day at
Yankee Stadium. Traditionally, it is the day when past Yankee stars
take their annual curtain call. It is the day when my father, Jim
Bouton, No. 56, the Bulldog, is snubbed, and not invited back.
Although I know an invitation to attend Old-Timers' Day is an honor
he can live without, it is what I wish for him this year.''
</P>
<P>
   These have been anguishing times for his family, Michael
explained. Last August, his younger sister Laurie died in an auto
accident. Old-Timers' Day, Michael observed, is a day for families
and fans to share special moments and memories together. If
Old-Timers Day at Yankee Stadium had been on the Bouton calendar
all these years, then maybe there would have been that many more
days with Laurie.
</P>
<P>
   With sadness, Michael wrote of the precious moments
irretrievably lost from Yogi Berra's refusal to come to Yankee
Stadium as long as Steinbrenner owns the team. Michael pleaded with
Steinbrenner for a truce. Couldn't Steinbrenner see it in his heart
to at least tolerate the presence of a 20-game-winner,
turned-author, turned-outcast at an Old-Timers' celebration?
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as an opportunity to get my father some extra hugs
at a time in his life when he could use all the hugs he can get,''
Michael wrote in closing. ``It is something he would never seek for
himself _ he is going to kill me when he reads this _ and maybe the
kind of thing only a son or daughter can do for their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not asking for any favors, just reconsideration. That is
all. Life is short. Time is at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouton lives in North Egremont, Mass., so he heard those words
before he saw them. His other son, David, read the letter to him
over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so moved, I can't tell you,'' Bouton said. ``He was
crying reading it to me, and I was crying listening to it. It was
the most wonderful gift I've ever received.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is the gift that keeps giving. Because with healing comes the
beginning of hope. Parents who have lost children need all the hope
they can get. Laurie was 3 during the ``Ball Four'' season. She
managed to get bitten by a dog, hit in the head by a flying can of
peas (taking nine stitches) and cut her head on a jalousie before
the end of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unsinkable Molly Brown,'' Bouton affectionately called her
then and calls her now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about me going back to Old-Timers Day as much as
it's about feeling the loss of Laurie and about Michael being able
to make this happen by a letter,'' Bouton said. ``I don't know
where my own personal feelings about baseball leave off and my
feelings about Laurie and Michael begin. It's all mixed up in my
mind.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very emotional. I just feel like I'm turned upside
down with such a terrible thing happening in the same frame as such
a wonderful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Bouton died at age 31. When a diary of the 1969 season
triggered an angry rumble through the baseball establishment, Jim
Bouton was 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too long to be punished for something that really wasn't
a bad thing,'' Bouton said. ``I wrote it out of a deep sense of
love. I wanted to share the fun that I'd had in baseball. There
were a few tough truths in the interest of honesty, but it
certainly was a very, very minor part of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   From Bouton, fans learned that Mantle played with hangovers,
Whitey Ford scuffed the baseball and Joe Pepitone had two
hairpieces (one for games).
</P>
<P>
   From Bouton, fans learned that players sometimes popped pep
pills and took advantage of the opportunities offered from
groupies. From Bouton, fans learned the lengths players would go
(climbing hotel roofs, drilling holes in walls, sticking mirrors
under doors) just to get a revealing look at a good-looking woman.
</P>
<P>
   From Bouton, fans learned the depths to which management would
sink to strong-arm players out of money.
</P>
<P>
   From Bouton, fans learned that players were liable to do just
about anything _ including serve teammates with fake paternity
suits _ for a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   From Bouton, fans learned how endearing and enraging and human
players can be. The Roger Maris that Bouton knew was grumpy and
money-conscious. The Elston Howard that Bouton knew had two faces.
Still, Bouton saved his best sentence in ``Ball Four'' for last:
``You spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball and in
the end it turns out that it was the other way all around.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, holding a grudge takes too much energy to do anybody
any good. Shortly after Mantle's son Billy died in 1994, Bouton
sent a letter of condolence. Bouton wasn't home when he received a
return phone call from Mantle, who left a message on the answering
machine. Bouton still treasures that recording, because Mantle
assured him that he wasn't the one standing in the way of an
invitation to Yankee Stadium. Mantle died the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Life is short. Time is at hand. So Michael Bouton decided to sit
down and start writing, before it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 6 when I started being ostracized from Yankee
Stadium,'' Bouton said. ``Michael has lived with being the son of
this pariah, and he has single-handedly turned it around. Talk
about the pen being mightier than the sword.''

`WASTE TRAIN' PUTS AMERICA IN HARM'S WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP M. KLASKY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCSICO _ Being escorted this week through San Francisco
Bay are the first of many scheduled shipments of poison fire from
the infernos of foreign nuclear reactor cores _ a batch of spent
nuclear rods from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   An armada of Coast Guard vessels was ready to encircle the three
waste casks from the Korean peninsula in their voyage to the
Concord Naval Weapons Station.
</P>
<P>
   Plans called for the deadly cargo to be transferred onto rail
cars on a ``Waste Train'' that would roll through Martinez and then
Sacramento on its way to ``temporary'' storage in Idaho. Beyond
that, who knows where the rods will rest for the next 200
millennia?
</P>
<P>
   This is just the first of many shipments of the deadly
byproducts of nuclear energy generation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, as part of this country's ``Atoms for Peace''
program, nuclear technology was sold overseas with the proviso that
we would take back the waste. In exchange for the nuclear
technology and the highly enriched uranium we provided, more than
40 nations in the program agreed not to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some of the participating nations have developed _
or are close to developing _ nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 20 metric tons of nuclear waste from South Korea,
Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, France, Denmark,
Germany, Japan and Britain will be returning to the United States.
Additional shipments will enter the East Coast through Charleston,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has yet to devise its own permanent plan to
isolate nuclear waste from the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for deep geologic storage at Yucca Mountain in
Nevada has been beset with cost overruns into the billions of
dollars. The proposed repository is vulnerable to seismic activity.
And there are other serious concerns that the project may not be
able to achieve its goal of a safe and enduring grave for
high-level wastes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurance by the Energy Department, many dangers are
associated with transporting the waste besides the threat of
sabotage. The casks are to travel by train through the Feather
River Canyon, the most accident-prone rail segment in California.
In a 16-year period, 28 derailments and 72 accidents were reported
along the North Fork of the Feather River.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 report, the Union Pacific was cited by federal rail
overseers as experiencing a fundamental breakdown in its safety and
operating procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Energy Department lied to the public when it
reported that the casks were given full and rigorous tests for
safety. The agency depended instead on computer simulations and
scaled-down models, rather than full-size prototypes in actual
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the casks are the most deadly and long-lasting poisons
humankind has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   These shipments should be a wake-up call for all Americans that
the proliferation of nuclear energy is a game that is just not
worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department should stop these shipments and take steps
to determine, on a country-by-country basis, if these wastes can be
stored in highly engineered, monitored, retrievable storage
facilities in the country of origin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of promoting the nuclear power industry abroad, the U.S.
government should be exporting sustainable energy technologies,
such as wind and solar power, and systematic methods of energy
conservation. The world is becoming too small to do otherwise.

FLOWER POWER IN THE DECADE OF DOWNSIZING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A few weeks back, a guy called me to inquire if I
needed an assistant. Sorry, I told him; I work alone.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, he said. Then he told me how he happened to be looking
for a job. He was 53, had earned a six-figure income for years in
the medical lab business and been downsized out.
</P>
<P>
   He was in OK shape financially, he said, but he wanted to work,
and he simply couldn't get a decent job. Nobody wants to hire a guy
in his 50s, not in an era of rising health insurance costs. He'd
dyed the gray out of his hair and cut a few years off his resume,
but he was getting nowhere in his job search.
</P>
<P>
   My caller was in no way a rarity. The age distributions in the
work force and the general population simply don't jive. Guys in
their 50s, especially their late 50s, are disappearing from the
work force at a fairly startling rate. So, without naming my
caller, I wrote about his situation.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all sorts of response came pouring in. One guy in
California wrote that he was downsized out of an $85,000-a-year
vice presidency and hasn't been able to find a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he said in his letter, ``I've joined the `Working Poor'
at Universal Studios, as they were referred to by the L.A. Business
Journal last week. They pay minimum wage ... Their human resources
person recently related in a chat that their Florida park is run
almost exclusively by downsized executives and college students who
can't find a job either.''
</P>
<P>
   Another California guy wrote, ``I'm a Cold War boomer, grew up
during the nuclear standoff ... I know DOS, Win 3.1, load software,
install PCs and develop business plans and own about 50 copyrights.
Who can use me? Who will hire me?''
</P>
<P>
   But, by far, the most interesting response to that column came
from closer to home, from the comfortable Albany suburb of Clifton
Park. Don Juron wrote this to me:
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked for 40 years in the tough food industry. I started at
the bottom of the ladder and worked my way to the top _ to being
vice president of companies. Then downsizing hit my industry, and I
went from the top, right back down the other side of the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two choices _ be angry and quit or continue to work. I
put my pride aside and continued to work ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I do? Well, I am a delivery driver, and I deliver
flowers ... I get the biggest smile from people when I give them
their flowers for their birthday or for a newborn child. And when I
see that smile and the sparkle in their eyes, I say to myself,
`this is what life is really about _ making people happy and, in
turn, making myself happy ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I happy? Yes _ happier than I have been in 40 years. Am I
bitter? No way. Life goes on, and you forget the past and you say
that each day is going to be a new and better day, and you hold in
your hand every precious strand of happiness ...''
</P>
<P>
   This society would be vastly better off if more people
appreciated the work ethic. But too many people who do appreciate
it define themselves almost solely by their work. And when
capitalism exhibits its randomly cruel side, they let it steal
their very sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Don Juron's letter intrigued me so. Capitalism
smacked him squarely in the teeth, as it has done to so many others
in this hollow, heartless decade.
</P>
<P>
   But he realizes that it also gave him time to smell the flowers.

KNOX'S HEIRS SOW HATRED IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Americans seem genuinely baffled by the intractable hatreds
of Northern Ireland, where the incineration of three little boys
can be hailed by some Protestant extremists as a worthy protest in
the name of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Even Americans of some strain of Irish descent shrug off the
Orange Order's obdurate refusal to stop rubbing the noses of their
Catholic neighbors in 300 years of now-threatened Protestant
ascendancy. Wearing those bowler hats and those orange sashes?
Marching and drumming their way through grimy sidestreets past
tumbledown apartment blocks of seething Catholics? This celebrates
God?
</P>
<P>
   It now seems the turmoil in Portadown is dissipating, largely
because of the despicable arson attack that killed the Quinn
brothers, described ruefully by nationalist leader Seamus Mallon as
``the victims of somebody else's principles.'' Globe reporter Kevin
Cullen recounted Sunday how, when the Rev. William Bingham, an
Orange Order chaplain, learned that the boys had perished, he
called for an end to the massing of Protestant protesters at the
Drumcree site that had become the flashpoint for the Protestant
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Enough is enough, said the heartsick clergyman. To go forward
with a 15-minute march ``would be a very hollow victory because it
would be in the shadow of three coffins of little boys who wouldn't
even know what the Orange Order was about.'' For voicing such noble
sentiments, the minister was roughed up the next day by thugs and
denounced publicly as a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Being a man of God can be dangerous work in a country where
religion is used as a political weapon to defend centuries of
discrimination. The ruffians who attacked Rev. Bingham have a
clergyman more to their liking in the Rev. Ian Paisley, a proven
bigot with decades of hate-spewing on his resume. But seeds of
sectarian strife were sown long before Paisley, and go back to the
Catholic-Protestant split that took many thousands of lives before
the Quinn boys.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Stuart was the Queen of Scotland, whose Catholicism drew
the enmity of her native country's leading Protestant divine when
she returned from France in the year 1561. ``From the moment of her
landing, John Knox made no secret of his merciless antagonism. He
was the great demagogic leader in religious affairs, the organizer,
and master of the Scottish Kirk, the most popular preacher in
Edinburgh. The struggle with him was one of life or death.'' writes
Stefan Zweig in his 1935 history, ``The Queen of Scots.''
</P>
<P>
   Knox was ``domineering and authoritarian ... the zealot'' who
preached ``a kind of superlative Protestantism,'' whose ``Calvinism
was so dictatorial a faith that from the outset it rendered any
kind of mutual understanding impracticable.'' If you think this has
little to do with the people of New England, think again: It was
pilgrims fleeing this atmosphere who landed at Plymouth and laid
out the streets along Boston Common.
</P>
<P>
   Knox's intolerance is chilling, even three centuries removed:
``The austere severity, the hatred of everything that made life
pleasant, the iconoclastic antagonism to the arts, the dislike of
merriment and laughter ... the stubborn treatment of jollity and
beauty as sin ... which banned good spirits and urbane manners and
customs, music, poetry, and dancing, and which cast a still
gloomier mantle over a land already condemned by nature to gloom
and sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months as a galley slave, being brutalized by the
French, taught Knox ``to hate everything that was bright, cheerful,
and Hellenic.'' Alas, Knox had ``his genius for violence ...
perhaps the most finished example of the religious fanatic. He was
of harder metal than Luther, who was not free from occasional
gleams of jovial humor.'' Honest and God-fearing, sure; but ``the
blinkers he wore made him one of those cruel and narrow-minded
persons for whom only their own truth is true, only their own
virtue virtuous, only their own Christianity Christian. To differ
from him was criminal; to refuse compliance with every letter of
his demands was to show oneself to be Satan's spawn. ``A born
killjoy, he railed against the `Devil's brood' of the
happy-go-lucky. This coldhearted fanatic knew no other
gratification than the triumph of his dogmas.'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Knox's spiritual heirs live on, not just in the muddy gutters of
Drumcree, but in the hearts of the Khmer Rouge and the religious
goon-squads that hector women and stone their enemies and declaim
against modernity in the Islamic world. We know their kind.
``Always,'' wrote Zweig, as Hitler's storm gathered over Europe,
``those who regard themselves as God's doughtiest warriors are the
unkindest men in the world. Believing themselves the vehicles of
heavenly messages, they have their ears closed to whatever is
humane.'' They are the kill-or-be-killed crowd. And they win
whenever the give-peace-a-chance crowd allows itself to be
intimidated.

   FERRISBURG, Vt. _ You get a lot for your $290 to $405 per night
at the Basin Harbor Club, including a cottage on Lake Champlain,
gourmet cuisine, and wake-up mimosas on the lodge deck. But you
don't get to bunk in a Trenchtown dorm, eat in The Zoo, or party at
The Coop till the Labatt runs dry.
</P>
<P>
   No, guests at this elegant and subdued seasonal resort, which
covers 350 acres where the Algonquin and Iroquois once roamed,
generally aren't privy to life on the other side. Of the nearly 300
folks employed by Basin Harbor, which was opened in 1886 and is
still operated by the founding Beach family, about one-third live
on the property. They make up a unique summer colony tucked deep
among the maple trees. At work, they make $6 to $14 an hour,
whipping up eggs and mixing up drinks. And after the sun goes down,
many of them are also pretty good at rustling up a little social
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in our own little world here,'' declares Alexandra
Carlson, an 18-year-old waitress.
</P>
<P>
   And if they're a diverse group _ nearly one-fourth come from
outside the United States _ they're also a young one. More than
half of the employees are between the ages of 18 and 25. Although
more students worked at Basin Harbor in the days before colleges
reopened in August, about 40 current staffers are in school.
(However, some of them are a tad uncertain about when or where
they'll return to college.) Small wonder that 23-year-old Chana
Chernev, who works in the reservations department, describes being
here for the summer as ``part sleep-away camp, part college, and
part `Dirty Dancing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, ``Dirty Dancing.'' That would be the popular 1987 movie
about the summer of '63 at a Catskills resort, where much of the
live-in help was not only Hollywood-handsome but could also dance
like ... well, like people dance in movies. Living and working at
Basin Harbor is a tad less romantic than that, what with staff
events such as Bingo Night and the Pictionary Tournament. But what
``Dirty Dancing'' got right is what Carlson proclaims: These folks
spend much of their time in their own universe, one that's
decidedly different from that populated by Basin Harbor's paying
customers.
</P>
<P>
   True, the help is allowed to use most of the resort's diverse
facilities, from its crescent-shaped waterfront to its 18-hole golf
course. Staffers are even occasionally invited to fish or play golf
with guests. But no one would confuse, say, the tuna casserole
ladled out in The Zoo, the funky staff eatery, with the sauteed
filet of mahi mahi that's served in the rainbow-shaped main dining
room overlooking the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would staff housing _ workers pay $40 a week for room and
board _ ever be mistaken for Basin Harbor's 77 charming guest
cottages. The principal men's dormitories, located in a back-street
area of the resort referred to as Trenchtown, along with the main
women's dorm, known as Esquire, are warrens of small share-a-bath
rooms in which such necessities of life as mountain bikes, stereos,
mini-fridges, and TVs must be shoehorned. The ultimate status
symbols, incidentally: VCRs and video-game systems.
</P>
<P>
   (Esquire is named for the magazine. Prior to World War II, the
two-story clapboard building housed young single men who paid $25
per week to stay at Basin Harbor and make themselves available to
the daughters of guests. The one-story dorms of Trenchtown,
meanwhile, are called B, A, and C, which some of their residents
insist stands for blood alcohol content.)
</P>
<P>
   They come to work on the shores of Lake Champlain for an
assortment of reasons. Twenty-two-year-old Tucker Lagasse, who's on
the rec-reation staff, is here to spend his free time windsurfing,
sailing, swimming, and golfing. Bartender Sean Tymecki, 21, is
hoping to pocket $5,000 toward another year at Vermont's Lyndon
State College. Allison Becher, an 18-year-old busgirl from nearby
Vergennes, explains that she ``needed to get away from my house and
my family.'' Ruel McBean, a 27-year-old waiter who is one of 13
Jamaicans on the staff, spends his summers here and works winters
at a hotel in Montego Bay. Meanwhile, there's a sizable group of
young nomads aboard, people such as Dave Usdan, a 22-year-old
bellhop who, come October, will point his 1990 Ford Bronco toward
an as-yet-to-be-determined job in Utah ski country. ``I can fit my
whole life in that car,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there's even someone here like Baby, the 18-year-old
main character in ``Dirty Dancing'' who finds the staff at the
cinematic resort to be considerably cooler than its paying
customers. That's what happened to Lindsay Russotto, now 19, who
came to Basin Harbor with her family as a guest for two years
before signing on as a hostess this summer. Some of the male
workers noticed her during those seasons of 1996 and 1997, and
before long she was being invited to staff parties. ``So I went,''
says the University of Connecticut sophomore. ``Otherwise, it was
go to bed at 10 p.m. And there was no TV. It was totally boring for
someone my age. So I'd come to Trenchtown or Esquire and hang
out.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent warm evening, Russotto changed from her
green-and-white-striped hostess blouse and black skirt into a
fashionable if borrowed black dress. Then she walked a couple of
hundred yards from her cluttered room in Esquire to the main dining
room. She ate there with members of her family who were once again
guests at the hotel, ordering sauteed Green Mountain trout and
grilled shrimp. But she knew which side of the line she was really
on. ``I felt kinda dumb,'' she confesses. ``I mean, the people who
were waiting on me were my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Arsenault, a 25-year-old reservations clerk, describes
living and working at Basin Harbor as ``like a college campus,
except that you go to work instead of to class.'' (Appropriately,
this year's group is planning a yearbook and a prom.) Others talk a
lot about being part of a ``family,'' although having more than 90
brothers and sisters isn't for everyone, which is one reason nearly
one in four Basin Harbor summer employees leaves before his or her
contract is up. Kera Kandel, an 18-year-old assistant tennis
instructor who lives in Monkton, 20 minutes away, &UR;  &LR; would rather go
home to her biological family at night. ``I'm here to work,'' says
Kandel, who will enroll as a freshman at Northern Arizona
University in the fall. ``I'm really not interested in the rest of
it. Besides, I can't stay up that late.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, some of them do indeed like to party. Although veterans
point out that the late-night decibel level in the dorms is lower
this year than last, and that there hasn't been even a single
midnight bonfire at The Pit, out beyond the airstrip, don't tell
that to pastry chef Andy VanBourgondien. At age 38, VanBourgondien
would rather spend his nights sleeping, thanks. ``There are things
you do when you're 18 that you grow out of,'' he says. ``The music
drives me crazy. I've got Security on my telephone speed-dial.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun begins sometime after 10 p.m., after the last dessert
plate has been cleared. Since night life in Vergennes (pop. 2,735),
located seven miles away, pretty much stops and starts with Swany's
Tavern and its pool table, Basin Harbor has its own staff social
circuit. There are the dorms, of course. There's also The Red Mill,
a bar and restaurant that's open to both staff and guests. After it
closes down at 1 a.m. _ by which time most guests have long since
departed _ serious partyers move on to The Coop, a small staff rec
room consisting mainly of a TV, a foosball game, and a mismatched
assortment of old furniture. The adventurous might take a boat over
to the lean-to at Adirondack Cove, across the lake, where they'll
spend the night and maybe even jump 70 feet into the water from
nearby Barn Rock as a morning pick-me-up. ``Some of us aren't old
enough to be drinking, but it's OK because at least we don't have
to drive anywhere,'' Carlson contends.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the altenative. Montreal, the nearest big city, is
about two and half hours away. The small college town of Middlebury
is 20 miles south, while Burlington, a bit larger and a bit more
collegiate, is 30 miles north. Foreign employees, who usually don't
have cars, tend to be the most startled by the same isolation for
which Basin Harbor's guests are pleased to pay handsomely. ``I
didn't realize it would be this far from a town,'' laments Julie
Gilmour, a 19-year-old bellhop from Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are the inevitable summer pairings. As one
staffer puts it: ``It's a long season, people get lonely, they
forget they have a boyfriend or girlfriend at home ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally these relationships even last beyond October. Molly
Shipp, now a 23-year-old captain on the banquet staff, met Brian
Goodyear, now Basin Harbor's systems manager, on her first night as
a resort employee two summers ago. They'll be married in September
on the Lodge lawn, host a buffet dinner in the main dining room,
dance among their guests in a Basin Harbor building called Town
Hall, and finish with a cookout on the waterfront. Whereupon
they'll live here year-round and Shipp will relinquish her
membership in Basin Harbor's summer colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am,'' she says, smiling, ``sentenced to life here.''

BLODGETT PUZZLED BY BENCH ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though Stephen King owns season tickets and busloads of
fans from her home state have made the trek to see her play, little
else from Cindy Blodgett's rookie season in the WNBA can elicit
comparisons to her brilliant collegiate career.
</P>
<P>
   A little over four months ago, Blodgett was wrapping up four
years at the University of Maine by playing in her fourth straight
NCAA Tournament as the Black Bears' all-everything point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after a promising start to her professional career,
Blodgett has become almost an afterthought as the last guard on the
Cleveland Rockers' bench.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps even worse, a bewildered Blodgett has no idea why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough not getting a great deal of playing time right
now,'' said Blodgett. ``I basically approach practice as my game
each day. I feel if I improve each day in practice, then playing
time will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Limited minutes weren't exactly what the 5-foot-9-inch guard was
envisioning when, as the sixth choice overall in the WNBA draft,
she signed with Cleveland last spring after winning two NCAA
Division 1 scoring titles, earning All-American honors, and
becoming arguably the most popular athlete in the state of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Blodgett's impact actually has lessened as the season has
progressed. In the Rockers' first five games, she was the top
reserve guard, averaging 16 minutes and 8.8 points per game and
leading the league for a brief time in 3-point shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But she picked a bad time to go into a shooting slump; right
after she went a combined 1 for 16 from the field in consecutive
games, Boston native Michelle Edwards, a starter last season,
returned from a torn plantar fascia in her right foot (ironically,
the same injury that sidelined Blodgett for part of her senior
season at Maine). Blodgett's minutes began to dwindle, and now
they've become almost nonexistent. Her situation reached its nadir
last Tuesday, when she was a DNP for the first time in a game
against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Theories about Blodgett's situation have ranged from trouble
adjusting to the pros to a need to work on her defensive game to
the difficulty any 22-year-old would encounter in trying to find
her niche on a team filled with veterans. Coach Linda Hill-McDonald
has said that Blodgett has to improve her defense. Blodgett doesn't
agree and told the Portland (Maine) Press-Herald that simply
doesn't know why she keeps sitting, but the No. 6 overall pick in
last spring's draft is trying not to her lack of playing time get
her down.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal goals are just to continue to work hard and help
the team any way possible,'' said Blodgett.
</P>
<P>
   If she gets the chance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
On their guard
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's also been a mixed bag for another rookie guard with New
England roots. Rita Williams was the opening night starter at the
point for the expansion Washington Mystics, but since has settled
into a reserve role.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who ran the show at Connecticut for the last two
season, was a second-round pick. She's second on the team with 2.1
assists per game and is averaging almost 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the transition to the pros has been no problem for a
lower-profile rookie guard. Korie Hlede has been perhaps the WNBA's
most impressive first-year player, starting since Game One for the
Detroit Shock, another expansion team, leading all rookies with a
14.5 points per game average.
</P>
<P>
   Hlede, the nation's second-leading scorer last season, had been
continually touted by her coach at Duquesne, Dan Durkin, as the
nation's best guard collegiate guard. But despite being twice named
Atlantic 10 Player of the Year, Hlede came to the WNBA combine as
an unknown quantity due to limited scouting. Her workouts were so
impressive that Shock coach/general manager Nancy Lieberman-Cline
was delighted that Hlede stayed around long enough so that she
could make Hlede the draft's No. 4 pick.

AT THE POOL, SHE'S COOL

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; DOVER, N.H. _ So maybe it's not technically her own pool in
her backyard. But it is called the Jenny Thompson Pool, and the
local woman who just happens to be a five-time Olympic
gold-medalist is treated with celebrity status here, so it might as
well be hers.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who grew up in Georgetown, Mass., moved to Dover at
the age of 12 when she decided swimming was for her. That's where
the Seacoast Swim Team was, and where coach Mike Parratto was, so
that's where Thompson decided she wanted to be. She had been
commuting to train and compete, but said, ``it was a lot of
driving, so we just moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's her mother Margrid, who does the long commuting from
Dover to her job as a medical technologist at the Lahey Clinic in
Burlington, Mass., every weekday.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 25, was home earlier this month for a typically brief
visit _ this one was squeezed between swim meets in Europe and the
Goodwill Games in New York, where her events begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   But being an off-Olympic year _ between Atlanta '96 and Sydney
2000 _ Thompson said she's taking it a little easier than usual
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer, I'm sort of relaxing mentally,'' she said.
``After the Goodwill Games, we have the nationals which are
qualifying for some stuff next year, but there's no real
international hard-core swim meet.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thompson can afford to take a breather and savor the jewelry
that's stashed somewhere in her mom's home is Dover (``I could
probably find them if I had to. I take them out once in a while,''
she said.) The collection includes five Olympic gold medals, one
Olympic silver, plus five World Championship golds, and 17 golds
and three silvers from four Pan Pacific Games.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more, in terms of notations in the record books:
she's the world record holder in the 100-meter butterfly (short
course) and 50-meter butterfly (short course), and holds the
fastest split in the 100-meter butterfly. She also hold the
American record for the 100-yard freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Parratto, the Seacoast coach, is proud of all his
swimmers, he said it was obvious Thompson was special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we noticed most is that she is very competitive
and had really great speed,'' he said. And she'd rarely miss a 5:30
a.m. workout, even if it meant Parrotta would come pick her up if
she needed a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the Jenny Thompson Pool is here in Dover,
the swimmer has been only an occasional visitor since she headed to
California seven years ago to attend Stanford. She's settled in
Palo Alto, Calif., and is taking pre-med classes at Mills College
in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   She also trains with the varsity team at Stanford, where her
former coach, Richard Quick, also was the women's Olympic coach.
</P>
<P>
   Quick said he could barely contain himself when he heard that
Thompson was considering coming to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a World Champion before she even came to Stanford, so
I was thrilled to death,'' he said. ``I went to visit her twice at
home. Normally I don't do that, but I would have gone three
times.''
</P>
<P>
   He had told people in the admissions and recruiting departments,
in fact, ``that if we could get that one great sprinter, the team
would be pretty hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right.
</P>
<P>
   Once Thompson enrolled, the swim won four NCAA titles, four
Pac-10 championships, and never lost a dual meet over the next four
years. Of course, Quick acknowledged, the team had other Olympians,
like Summer Sanders and Lea Loveless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great team surrounding her, but she was a big, big
part of that, and she was the cornerstone on all the teams,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson might be in her ``taking-it-easy, in between-Olympics''
mode, but she follows a daily routine that includes two to five
hours in the pool, plus a workout in yoga or pilates _ a cross
between yoga and strength training. And she's always fine-tuning
her strokes, whether it's altering the head-position on her
freestyle, or working on the way she strokes the butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who said she was ``swimming underwater when I was six
months old,'' started swimming with the Danvers Dolphins when she
was 8 years old. Actually, she tried out for the team when she was
7 but she didn't make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I took lessons because I really wanted to make the team,''
she said. ``That was one of first times I was knocked down and came
back fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   And there would be more knockdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, she tried out for the Olympic team, but missed by one
spot. In the 1992 Olympics, she missed the gold even though she had
the world record in the butterfly. In the 1994 World Championships
she got ``obliterated'' by the Chinese who were later accused of
using steroids.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, with a knockdown that still hangs over her head,
she didn't make the '96 Olympic team for any individual events,
even though she came home with three gold medals for relay events.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe that disappointment spurs her on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have retired after '96 had I won an invididual,'' she
said. ``But maybe it was blessing in disguise. I still love sport,
and I have several endorsements.'' (Among them are Speedo and The
Zone nutrition products).
</P>
<P>
   And she's not concerned that she'll be 27 when the next Olympics
rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledges that ``in the past, swimming has been known as
a teenager sport, but thinks that's changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we haven't seen many 30-year-olds yet, but I've read
that you don't reach your peak in muscle capacity as a woman until
you're 30.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the pool that now bares her name, Thompson said it was
something the town did after the '96 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little strange, but it's a great honor,'' she said.
``The day I got home from the Olympics they picked me up in a
limousine, and there was a parade and we ended up here for the
pool-naming ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   And Amy Parratto, Mike's wife who was Thompson's swim coach at
Dover High, said it was fitting tribute for the woman who made her
mark swimming in the formerly named Guppey Pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was home July Fourth, the kids were really psyched to
see her and watch her swim,'' Parotta said. ``There aren't too many
Jennys around.''

FOR THE OLD, A NEW MENACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is an election year and health care reform is back with a
vengeance on the public agenda. In the few weeks of business
remaining on Capitol Hill and Beacon Hill this summer, Democrats
and Republicans alike are vowing to whip our health maintenance
organizations into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Congress promises a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights to
protect consumers from profit-driven benefit restrictions. The
Massachusetts Legislature promises to hold insurers accountable for
medical decisions made by accountants.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that was the undoing of Hillary Clinton only five
years ago could be the making of congressional candidates this fall
thanks to the dramatic expansion of HMOs in the American workplace.
Since 1993, the percentage of insured workers covered by managed
care plans has jumped from 53 to 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In their belated zeal to address the past sins of managed health
care, elected officials are ignoring the future market for HMOs.
With the workplace all but conquered, managed care companies are
selling their cost cutting schemes to the frailest population in
the nation: the elderly in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, one of country's largest health insurers has been
regulating the care of Medicare-eligible long-term patients in
nursing homes in 10 states, including Massachusetts. EverCare, a
subsidiary of United HealthCare Corp., is operating in 20 Greater
Boston nursing homes as part of a federal demonstration project
under the auspices of the Health Care Finance Administration.
</P>
<P>
   EverCare estimates that the demonstration could save Medicare $5
million a year in the 10 states and that the plan, if applied to
all nursing home residents in the nation, could cut Medicare costs
by $800 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   However, managed care in nursing homes is not immune from the
problems plaguing HMOs &UR;  &LR; for other populations. And the time to pay
attention to the incursion into nursing homes is now, when the
trend is in its formative stage.
</P>
<P>
   EverCare uses Medicare payments to provide a nurse practitioner,
with physician backup, to manage the plan's nursing home patients.
In theory, by providing individual assessment, specialty care, and
the treatment of acute illnesses on site, EverCare saves money by
avoiding expensive hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   What often happens, in fact, is a reduction in care. A
podiatrist who had visited a Medicare patient once a week might be
authorized to visit once a month if she switches to EverCare. A
speech therapist who had worked with a Medicare patient for an
hour, five days a week, might be restricted to two weeks of
half-hour sessions. The result is dangerous for the most fragile
among us.
</P>
<P>
   EverCare officials say their goal is to enroll 40 percent of
eligible residents at participating nursing homes in order to build
the volume necessary to make a capitated system work. EverCare
President Marcia Smith tells the Tampa Bay Business Journal
(Florida is also a demonstration site) that the company relies on
the nursing homes to market the plan to residents: ``The nursing
home has to be advocating the program, or we can't get through the
front door.'' But, in the same interview, she notes that as much as
90 percent of EverCare's aging patients suffer from some form of
diminished mental capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a population that can make informed choices about health
plans that confuse much younger, healthier consumers?
</P>
<P>
   Some Massachusetts health care providers have their doubts. One
health care worker who has seen the number of EverCare patients
skyrocket at a suburban nursing home sees a disparity in the level
of care she is permitted to provide EverCare patients versus
Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   To even evaluate an EverCare patient, she must secure the
approval of the nurse practitioner, who is often not on site. When
permission is obtained, she says, she has no control over the
duration of therapy, even though she is a specialist in her field.
``I assume it is a cost consideration since no one discusses it
with me,'' says the distraught health care worker, whose complaints
to her superiors about EverCare prompted a note in her personnel
file, citing her trouble ``adjusting to managed care.'' What
worries her most, she says, ``is patients are at risk and no one is
listening.''
</P>
<P>
   So many agencies share oversight of nursing homes in
Massachusetts _ the Department of Public Health, the Department of
Medical Security, the Attorney General's Office, HCFA _ it
sometimes seems no one is in charge. But if we all now agree that
HMOs with a largely healthy client base need more regulation, isn't
monitoring even more critical for HMOs aimed at the elderly?

CARING IN VIETNAM INSPIRES A JOURNEY TO PRIESTHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was only a kid, about 7 or 8, when thoughts of becoming a
Catholic priest first swirled in his head. But Tinh Van Nguyen set
those thoughts aside. He had bigger things to worry about. His
homeland, South Vietnam, was being ripped apart by war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very bad time for all the people,'' said Nguyen, with
a trace of sadness in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of becoming a priest never went away. Instead, the
yearning to serve the Roman Catholic Church grew stronger the older
Nguyen became. Today, people call him Father Tinh. On May 16 at the
Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston's South End, Nguyen, 33, was
ordained a priest in the Archdiocese of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was maybe the happiest day of my life,'' said Nguyen. That
day, he said, is rivaled only by the October day three years ago
when the rest of his family _ father, mother, and seven brothers
and sisters _ moved from Vietnam to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen is part of a vibrant and growing Vietnamese Catholic
community in the Boston area. Mass is offered in Vietnamese in
eight parishes in the archdiocese. While Nguyen's church, Most
Blessed Sacrament in Wakefield, isn't one of them, he says he is
actively involved with Vietnamese in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism is still the primary practice of many Vietnamese, but
Vietnamese Catholics have made their presence felt in many dioceses
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen's passion for the faith was kindled while growing up in
South Vietnam. He was impressed by the Catholic missionaries who
ministered to the war's victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they lived their lives, the way they provided
assistance was a very powerful example of living a holy life,''
said Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Vietnamese who left their homeland, Nguyen tells a
harrowing tale of deprivation and danger. He left Vietnam in July
1980 because his father feared that the government would conscript
him to fight in the war against Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   With about 160 people, Nguyen slipped away from Vietnam on an
overcrowded, 45-foot-long fishing boat. For nearly two weeks they
bobbed along in the ocean enduring storms, pirates who robbed
passengers, and a lack of water.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers finally arrived in Malaysia, where Nguyen lived
for two years in a refugee camp run by the United Nations. There
again he was exposed to Catholic missionaries, nuns, and priests
who cared for him. To Nguyen, they were the epitome of selfless
devotion to others.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the United States in 1982 to live with an aunt in
California and from the moment he arrived he wanted to enter a
seminary and start the journey toward priesthood. But he put aside
his ambition in order to work and send money back to his family in
Vietnam. He also was saving money to try to bring them to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Good fortune befell Nguyen while he was living briefly in New
Orleans among a Vietnamese Catholic community. There he met the
Rev. James E. Gaudreau, pastor of St. Joseph's in Lynn, who was in
New Orleans studying Vietnamese. Nguyen and Gaudreau became friends
and it was Gaudreau who told Nguyen about St. John's Seminary in
Boston's Brighton section.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Nguyen ended up studying for the priesthood. ``I
truly love being a priest,'' said Nguyen. ``I love God and I want
to share that love with the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a society where lives are sometimes frenetic, Nguyen believes
faith can be an important anchor. ``People care very much about the
church and want the church to care about them and to help them in
their lives,'' he said. ``The church has much to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Since priests receive a small salary and he still provides
financial help to his family, Nguyen works weekends at Bingo games
at Mount St. Joseph Academy in Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nguyen realizes that priests in the United States do
not enjoy the same lofty status they once did, he believes the
priesthood can still be a noble calling. ``To serve others can be a
wonderful life for the right person,'' he said. ``I enjoy every
day. But I'm still learning.''

   The four Greek Orthodox priests fired from Hellenic College and
Holy Cross School of Theology have asked for their jobs back in a
letter mailed last week to the national leader of the Greek
Orthodox church.
</P>
<P>
   The four men were fired from the Brookline, Mass. school at the
request of Archbishop Spyridon, the leader of the nation's 2
million Greek Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to Spyridon, the priests asked him to follow
recommendations passed at a recent Greek Orthodox convention
calling for a task force to be appointed to study the firings and
for the priests to be reinstated while the panel conducts its work.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Spyridon said the bishop had not received the
letter because he is away from his office on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As priests and professors we have poured out our hearts and
minds, indeed our very beings, in the education of over 1,000
students ... according to the highest ideals of Orthodoxy and
Hellenism,'' said the letter. It was signed by the Reverends
Alkiviadis C. Calivas, George Papademetriou, Emmanuel Clapsis, and
Theodore G. Stylianopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   Sources at the college have told the Globe that the four men
were fired because they refused to coverup an alleged incident of
sexual misconduct by a former seminarian. Archdiocesan officials
say the firings were an effort to resolve personal conflicts at the
school among administrators and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``An act of love at this critical time will be an event of
redemption, forgiveness and reconciliation ...'' the four priests
wrote in their letter.

MILLENNIAL ERA OFFERS A FUTURE FOR PROGNOSTICATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The future has always been a fascinating and frightening place.
And so there has always been a market for futurists and
astrologers, for charlatans and serious analysts who gazed into
crystal balls and then explained what they'd seen to the dreamers,
the eggheads, and the kooks who were willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that picture is changing radically. On the eve of the
millennium and in the midst of a historic technological onslaught,
we all listen. And the ranks of the seers are suddenly swelling
with university professors and venture-capital consultants,
theoretical physicists and high-tech nerds.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in short, a proliferation of prognosticators.
</P>
<P>
   They receive tens of thousands of dollars per speech from trade
groups that want to hear, for instance, about lightning-fast
computers embedded in clothing to monitor their wearers' vital
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Their well-paid counsel about impending advances, like car
engines that will get tuneups via software from personal computers,
is in high demand by businesses trying to cope with technological
changes that seem to threaten them _ and present new opportunities
_ daily. Their books, with titles like ``What Will Be'' and
``Visions'' and ``Clicking,'' are soaring onto the bestseller
lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, it's becoming quite a phenomenon,'' said
Jeffrey F. Rayport, an associate professor at Harvard Business
School. Rayport counts himself among the professional predicters,
though he prefers the description ``business consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few of those whose work integrally involves forecasting
bill themselves as prophets or visionaries, although they seldom
blush when depicted as such; rather, they are business advisers or
strategists, computer scientists tuned into cutting-edge
developments, or social researchers who understand the evolution of
such phenomena as buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most members of this burgeoning field are quick to
point out that there have always been people like them. That's
principally because anticipating trends and planning for the future
are essential components of successful business strategy and, to a
large extent, of personal fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   The professional prognosticators agree, however, that a
confluence of events has dramatically escalated the types and
amount of guidance that individuals and companies want and need, or
at least believe they do. The result of that heightened demand,
inevitably, has been an increased supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your primary product might be obsolete in two years ...
and people are being told they'll have to get job retraining every
three to five years, everyone begins to feel they have to look into
the future,'' said John J. Canepa, a partner in the Boston office
of the Arthur Andersen consulting firm, which itself has been
restructuring to make forecasting a more integral client service.
</P>
<P>
   When intriguing, incomprehensible, or compelling technological
breakthroughs are in the news almost daily, Canepa added, ``all
this prediction stuff begins to seem realistic to the average
person instead of just the wireheads.''
</P>
<P>
   People's fascination with and appetite for the future has always
been considerable, as clearly evidenced by the allure of Leonardo
da Vinci's drawings of machines-to-come, by the sustained
popularity of science fiction, and by the huge sales of books like
1970's ``Future Shock'' by Alvin Toffler.
</P>
<P>
   But the convergence of two factors _ the advent of a new century
and the ongoing revolution generated by computers _ has captured
imaginations as never before, even as it has fueled job
insecurities and provoked fundamental questions about the role
technology should play in society and individual lives.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, technological innovation has produced far more
radical change, introspection, and even fear within the business
world than is commonly understood.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts alone, the ups and downs of companies like
Wang, Digital, Lechmere, Cullinet Software, and Prime Computer have
dramatized the costs to those who get blindsided by market changes.
</P>
<P>
   Planning used to entail examinations of past sales trends,
extrapolations of previous buying patterns, and then invention of
items that could be incrementally introduced to regulate demand.
Now, overnight in corporate time, companies find themselves
catering to consumers who are more and more fickle _ and selective
_ because new, improved, and previously unheard-of products pop
onto the market at blinding speed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, historically entrenched notions of how workplaces
operate are being outmoded by such concepts as ``outsourcing,''
contract employees, and on-line design, manufacture, and sales. And
even the most basic day-to-day assumptions _ say, that copiers and
other office equipment should be purchased to last for as many
years as possible _ are being trampled by a seemingly ceaseless
stampede of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just two years ago, (consultants) used to walk in and have to
explain why you needed what they were selling,'' Shanda Bahles,
managing general partner of a venture-capital firm in California,
said of the prognosticators who advised companies to massively
restructure for the future. ``Now it's, `We want this. Tell us what
to do and how to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   That attitudinal reversal, in turn, reflects the enormity of the
technological and biological breakthroughs that brought it about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving the era of trying to understand the laws of
nature and entering one in which we manipulate the laws of nature,
and that's a sea change,'' said Michio Kaku, a professor of
theoretical physics at the City University of New York, lecturer,
and author of two hot books on the future, ``Hyperspace'' and
``Visions.'' He said the perceived importance of this shift
explains why there has been a ``quantum leap'' in the caliber,
credibility, and quantity of forecasters like him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an example of what he described as ``deep fear'' of
the future in the business world, Kaku said: ``I've been getting a
rash of calls lately from multinational banking centers who were
burned by the rapid advance of technology into their business. They
want to know how to avoid being caught again.''
</P>
<P>
   One result of this systemic uncertainty is that trade
conferences, both in this country and abroad, have become a booming
trend among professional organizations of every type. The main
topic at these events invariably is how technology will alter the
participants' professions and lives, and the most sought-after
speakers increasingly are economists, consultants, computer
scientists, and anyone else who can authoritatively discuss the
perils and potential of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand grows every year, because every industry now thinks
it needs to change to survive,'' said Daniel Stern, president of
the Leigh Bureau in New Jersey, one of the oldest and largest
speakers bureaus in the nation. Even speakers who have been on the
circuit for decades, he added, are reframing their presentations as
peeks into what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dertouzos, the longtime director of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science, is among
the de facto futurists who are represented by the Leigh Bureau, and
who receive anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 per engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Dertouzos wouldn't disclose his own fee, but said he can't keep
up with the requests from groups ranging from dentists to food
manufacturers to insurance agents. ``They're all curious about one
thing: This is a fast-moving train; how do we get on it?'' said
Dertouzos, whose best-selling book ``What Will Be'' has been
translated into 15 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals' and industries' need to know seems unlikely to
abate for, well, the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Already, according to Harvard Business School professor Richard
L. Nolan, more than 50 percent of all investment is going into
companies involved in some type of information technology. Nolan
just edited his own book, ``Sense and Respond,'' on how the
business world must change.
</P>
<P>
   As computers continue to insinuate themselves into the small and
large parts of everyday life, this progression appears certain to
continue. And that, say the experts, means prognostication will
take on a bigger and bigger role in people's decision-making about
their activities and their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Popcorn, the author of the bestseller ``Clicking'' and a
consultant to businesses on how to foresee and capitalize on
change, put it this way: ``If you don't know what's going to happen
in the future, you can't time-line yourself.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; My friend Mark Lee was in town over the weekend, promoting his
novel of Africa, ``The Lost Tribe.'' With a movie and several plays
to his credit, Mark has been famous off and on, but perhaps never
so famous as when Walter Scott (real name: Lloyd Shearer) mentioned
him in the ``Personality Parade'' gossip column in Parade magazine.
</P>

Mark Lees shared a talent agency, which sent the actor's fat checks
to my Mark while winging the skinny writer's checks off Down Under.
The other Mark Lee has a huge gay following, and my Mark Lee
occasionally receives unsolicited, all-expenses paid weekend
invitations from Northampton bed-and-breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   Mark was a few months late for the Lee Family Association
meeting that took place earlier this year in Boston's Chinatown.
Those Lees are practically all of Chinese extraction, purporting to
descend from the ancient philosopher Lao Tzu, the founder of
Taoism. In an interview with the Globe, Family Association grand
national president Steven Lee noted that descendants of Virginia's
Robert E. Lee were not expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is said to be the most common surname in the world. For
starters, there are 87 million of them in China. In the port city
of Tianjin, not far from Peking, 2,300 people bear the name Li
Zhang. When police in Shanghai went searching for murder suspect Li
Ming, they narrowed the hundreds of candidates to a ``short list''
of 26, reports the Los Angeles Times. The pregnant wife of one of
the suspects tried to commit suicide; her innocent husband returned
home from the police station just in time to save her life and that
of their child.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the curse of homonomeia! What is to be done? Stamp bar codes
on infants at birth? Not a bad idea, if we could implant digital
scanners into every newborn's retina. We certainly can't rely on
parental imagination. Moon Unit, Dweezil, a billion Caitlins,
Dawns, Fawns, and every conceivable variation of Sheryl (except
possibly Sher-El, as the name would appear on Krypton) reveal the
paucity of parents' contributions to the naming problem. The
Chinese now occasionally pay ``name masters'' to dream up
alternatives to the ubiquitous Lee, or the frequently encountered
Weidong (``protect Mao'') and Songze (``praise Mao'').
</P>
<P>
   In today's feverish rush of scandal reporting, confusions are
inevitable. Newsweek, which has led the pack in Monica Lewinsky
reporting, printed what was supposed to be a picture of her mother,
Marcia Lewis. But the attractive brunette proved to be another
Marcia Lewis. Likewise, an intrepid New York Post scribe thought he
had a scoop when he quoted Washington lawyer Robert Fisk
poor-mouthing Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation. But the
hapless hack had reeled in the wrong Fisk. He thought he was
quoting former Whitewater prosecutor Robert Fiske, who works in New
York. The Post wreaked its revenge the next day (``Lying lawyer
admits he duped reporter''), printing Fisk's picture above the
caption: ``Just a nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   You may have noticed that there were briefly two Timothy
McVeighs in the nation's limelight: the Oklahoma City bomber and
the Navy seaman discharged for revealing _ to America Online _ that
he was gay. There's a Tina Brown in New York who's a voodoo
sculptress, and very politely returns the many A-list invitations
that flow her way.
</P>
<P>
   I went to school with a Dave Krieger, whom I don't remember
being quite as funny as former Apple Computer programmer Dave
Krieger of Cupertino, Calif. At his Web site,
(www.fqa.com/dave/index.html) this man writes: ``Stranded far from
Silicon Valley with an irresistible Dave Krieger craving?
Fortunately, most major metropolitan areas are now equipped with
their own Dave Krieger'' _ and then he lists 76 of them.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate homonomaeic Web site is indubitably ``The True
Horror Story; Being Stephen King.'' (www.isisw3.com/sking/) There,
about 20 real-life people describe the agony of being asked, almost
every day of their lives, ``Are you the real Stephen King?''
Luckily, one of them came up with a snappy answer: ``No, I'm his
brother.'' The real Stephen King has yet to log on.

PIKE PLACE SATISFIES THE LINK BETWEEN GROWER AND EATER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Even several blocks away, tantalizing clues lead to
the Pike Place Market. Riotously colored summer flowers _
saffron-hued lilies, blazing red snapdragons, pastel sweet peas
wrapped in paper cones _ bob by. Summer seems to spread through the
crowded downtown streets along with the blobs of color, and it's
impossible not to follow the trail in reverse, augmented by waves
of shoppers eating Bing cherries out of paper bags and carrying
vegetables. To market, to market.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the market buildings, the sense of excitement increases.
Fish literally fly as vendors toss them to one another. Butchers
trim steaks and arrange sausages. In crescendoing voices, farmers
hawk cherries and cucumbers, innumerable kinds of greens, clumps of
shiitakes, and lion's mane mushrooms. Doughnuts, shaped and baked
in bubbling oil, are eaten in seconds by children. Craftspeople
show off jewelry and tie-dyed T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Spilling out of its confines onto the sidewalk, Pike Place
Market is widely acclaimed as the pride of Seattle. From Sol Amon,
whose family has operated the Pure Food Fish Market for three
generations, to the newest immigrant group, the Hmong farmers who
sell at tables the flowers and greens they grow in small plots
around the city, the market has a vibrant history intertwined with
the city and its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s, urban-renewal plans slated the market for
demolition, to be replaced by hotels and retail stores. It was
rescued by a ``Keep the Market'' drive that culminated, in 1971,
with the citizens of Seattle voting to place the market under
public ownership. This is a market that escaped the wrecking ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pike Place is part of being in Seattle,'' says Len Barson, a
resident who has worked on market legal issues in the past. ``It
really gives Seattle an identity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's not-too-distant past, public food markets
anchored every major metropolis, brought the country into the city,
and fed the populace. A few still exist: One is Pike Place, which
opened in 1907, and another is Reading Market in Philadelphia,
established by a railroad to spur its competition with another rail
line. Many more died out long ago. Others, like the Quincy
Market-Faneuil Hall buildings in Boston, established as a public
market, were redeveloped as retail spaces and restaurants, becoming
tourist destinations that lost the connection between rural life
and the city.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the world, public markets are still vital,
from the spectacular Mercat de Sant Josep in the center of
Barcelona, one of the premier markets in Europe, to the slightly
chaotic jumble of buildings and covered sheds that make up the
central market in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Spanish matrons choose
fine hams or compare egg prices while talking to the purveyors, and
Mexicans select chili peppers and a live quail or two for dinner
before picking up a stack of warm tortillas made right in front of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The more we travel, the more we've gotten used to rushing to the
markets in Europe, the Near East, the Far East _ actually almost
anywhere in the world _ as part of our adventures. Yet our food
experience at home has become further and further removed from the
connection between grower and eater.
</P>
<P>
   The rising number of open-air farmers' markets in recent years
shows we're yearning for that link. Janet Christensen, director of
education at the Massachusetts Food and Agriculture Department
remembers that 10 years ago there were eight to 10 seasonal
farmers' markets in the state. Now, she says, there are 100,
operating in city neighborhoods, in small towns, and in the
countryside. ``We have requests for more, but we've run out of
farmers'' to provide produce, Christensen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing back the urban-rural connection is important in the
city,'' says David O'Neil, director of the Public Market
Collaborative of the Project for Public Spaces. Markets make a
delightful oasis in urban life, he says, affording the city dweller
a chance to meet those who produce the food as well as satisfying
all the sensory elements _ the smells and sights and sounds _ that
a modern grocery usually lacks. ``People from the country love it
because it means m-o-n-e-y,'' he adds with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is now peppered with about 5,000 food markets,
from open-air to permanent ones, O'Neil adds, with the biggest
concentration on the West Coast. But he thinks it's important to
view permanent markets as more than a summer fancy. ``It's good
business. A market is as valuable an institution as a stadium or a
convention center,'' O'Neil says, adding that cities should
consider giving the same kind of tax breaks for markets that are
extended to shopping malls and other developments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In August, the newest public market in the East will open in
downtown Portland, Maine. The 37,000-square-foot building, with a
heavy timbered roof and glass walls, was funded by the late
philanthropist Elizabeth Noyce, who had made bequests to arts and
cultural institutions in the city and saw the market project as a
way to enrich the city's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Spitzer, a national authority on public markets who was
hired to do the feasibility study, has stayed on to run the market.
Noyce was interested in connecting the rural economy of Maine to
Portland, Spitzer says, and thought a permanent market was a
natural way to promote the small food producers as well as growers.
Portland was anchored by a market from 1825 to 1882 _ like many a
coastal city _ but since then only a seasonal open-air market has
existed downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion of buying high-quality local products is an
idea that's growing,'' Spitzer says. He envisions attracting about
15,000 to 18,000 people a week to the market in peak seasons. The
market is expected to be self-sustaining, and it's estimated that
it could generate $10 million a year in sales.

FATHER'S DAY DREAM COMES TRUE FOR SON OF YANKEES PARIAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Jim Bouton kept trying to convince himself that
the cold war with the New York Yankees would end someday. He is
blessed and cursed with a stubbornly optimistic streak. Besides, he
couldn't bear to consider the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Bouton is the author of ``Ball Four,'' not ``Mein Kampf.'' For
nearly three decades, the Yankees have declined to draw a
distinction. Bouton won 21 games for the Yankees in 1963 and 18 the
next season. ``Ball Four'' went into print in 1970, and the Yankees
went to great pains not to acknowledge Bouton's existence after
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim who?'' Mickey Mantle said in response to a book that dared
mix some of the bad with the good. Nearly a quarter of a century
passed before Mantle spoke to Bouton again. Bouton was easy enough
for the old Yankees guard to avoid, because he never got invited
back for Old-Timers' Day. When his phone didn't ring, he could
always be sure it was Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought eventually they were going to have to invite me,''
Bouton said. ``I was planning on being the oldest living Yankee. So
at some point, at 89 ... I was just thinking that when I finally
show up, I might not even know I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   The wait of the world lifted from Bouton on July 15. The phone
finally rang, and it was the Yankees. They invited him to be at
Yankees Stadium on Saturday for Old-Timers' Day. It took a lot of
convincing before Bouton would allow himself to believe it was
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people call me in the past saying, `This is George
Steinbrenner; you're coming back to the stadium,''' Bouton said.
``Friends of mine. Goofing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouton is 59, and he'll be gratefully aware of his surroundings.
He'll know everything it took to make this possible, and he'll
probably have a good cry.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   Without his father knowing it, Michael Bouton wrote a letter
several weeks ago to The New York Times. Michael wrote the letter
hoping that on Father's Day the newspaper might see fit to print at
least excerpts of what he had to say about his father's exile from
anything having to do with the Yankees. Michael didn't know if it
would do any good, but he didn't know what else to do. He did know
there wasn't much left to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is Father's Day,'' Michael began, ``but the date I have
circled on my calendar is July 25. That is Old-Timers' Day at
Yankee Stadium. Traditionally, it is the day when past Yankee stars
take their annual curtain call. It is the day when my father, Jim
Bouton, No. 56, the Bulldog, is snubbed, and not invited back.
Although I know an invitation to attend Old-Timers' Day is an honor
he can live without, it is what I wish for him this year.''
</P>
<P>
   These have been anguishing times for his family, Michael
explained. Last August, his younger sister Laurie died in an auto
accident. Old-Timers' Day, Michael observed, is a day for families
and fans to share special moments and memories together. If
Old-Timers Day at Yankee Stadium had been on the Bouton calendar
all these years, then maybe there would have been that many more
days with Laurie.
</P>
<P>
   With sadness, Michael wrote of the precious moments
irretrievably lost from Yogi Berra's refusal to come to Yankee
Stadium as long as Steinbrenner owns the team. Michael pleaded with
Steinbrenner for a truce. Couldn't Steinbrenner see it in his heart
to at least tolerate the presence of a 20-game-winner,
turned-author, turned-outcast at an Old-Timers' celebration?
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as an opportunity to get my father some extra hugs
at a time in his life when he could use all the hugs he can get,''
Michael wrote in closing. ``It is something he would never seek for
himself _ he is going to kill me when he reads this _ and maybe the
kind of thing only a son or daughter can do for their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not asking for any favors, just reconsideration. That is
all. Life is short. Time is at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouton lives in North Egremont, Mass., so he heard those words
before he saw them. His other son, David, read the letter to him
over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so moved, I can't tell you,'' Bouton said. ``He was
crying reading it to me, and I was crying listening to it. It was
the most wonderful gift I've ever received.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is the gift that keeps giving. Because with healing comes the
beginning of hope. Parents who have lost children need all the hope
they can get. Laurie was 3 during the ``Ball Four'' season. She
managed to get bitten by a dog, hit in the head by a flying can of
peas (taking nine stitches) and cut her head on a jalousie before
the end of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unsinkable Molly Brown,'' Bouton affectionately called her
then and calls her now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about me going back to Old-Timers Day as much as
it's about feeling the loss of Laurie and about Michael being able
to make this happen by a letter,'' Bouton said. ``I don't know
where my own personal feelings about baseball leave off and my
feelings about Laurie and Michael begin. It's all mixed up in my
mind.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very emotional. I just feel like I'm turned upside
down with such a terrible thing happening in the same frame as such
a wonderful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Bouton died at age 31. When a diary of the 1969 season
triggered an angry rumble through the baseball establishment, Jim
Bouton was 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too long to be punished for something that really wasn't
a bad thing,'' Bouton said. ``I wrote it out of a deep sense of
love. I wanted to share the fun that I'd had in baseball. There
were a few tough truths in the interest of honesty, but it
certainly was a very, very minor part of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   From Bouton, fans learned that Mantle played with hangovers,
Whitey Ford scuffed the baseball and Joe Pepitone had two
hairpieces (one for games).
</P>
<P>
   From Bouton, fans learned that players sometimes popped pep
pills and took advantage of the opportunities offered from
groupies. From Bouton, fans learned the lengths players would go
(climbing hotel roofs, drilling holes in walls, sticking mirrors
under doors) just to get a revealing look at a good-looking woman.
</P>
<P>
   From Bouton, fans learned the depths to which management would
sink to strong-arm players out of money.
</P>
<P>
   From Bouton, fans learned that players were liable to do just
about anything _ including serve teammates with fake paternity
suits _ for a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   From Bouton, fans learned how endearing and enraging and human
players can be. The Roger Maris that Bouton knew was grumpy and
money-conscious. The Elston Howard that Bouton knew had two faces.
Still, Bouton saved his best sentence in ``Ball Four'' for last:
``You spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball and in
the end it turns out that it was the other way all around.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, holding a grudge takes too much energy to do anybody
any good. Shortly after Mantle's son Billy died in 1994, Bouton
sent a letter of condolence. Bouton wasn't home when he received a
return phone call from Mantle, who left a message on the answering
machine. Bouton still treasures that recording, because Mantle
assured him that he wasn't the one standing in the way of an
invitation to Yankee Stadium. Mantle died the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Life is short. Time is at hand. So Michael Bouton decided to sit
down and start writing, before it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 6 when I started being ostracized from Yankee
Stadium,'' Bouton said. ``Michael has lived with being the son of
this pariah, and he has single-handedly turned it around. Talk
about the pen being mightier than the sword.''

   ``Part of the challenge,'' he says, ``will be working with small
retailers.'' There will be no chains in the public market, so the
needs and concerns of retailers _ whether farmers selling produce
or a seafood company selling smoked trout _ will be much more
individualistic than for a large corporate entity like Starbucks or
Dunkin' Donuts. But, he adds, ``that's not what the market is
about. We're here to support small businesses'' that either grow or
make what they sell.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 30 vendors include Richer Hill Orchards of Turner,
with apples and organic produce; Wolfe's Neck Farm of Freeport,
with natural beef and pork; Big Sky Bread of Portland; and Smiling
Hill Farm of Westbrook, with bottled milk and butter. Open-air
farmers' market vendors will continue to sell in Monument Square
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Portland public market got an enormous jump-start
when Noyce funded the $5 million in capital costs, acknowledges
Spitzer. ``People will recognize that this is Mrs. Noyce's
project.''
</P>
<P>
   The Project for Public Spaces/-Public Market Collaborative
finished a similar feasibility study for the Massachusetts Food and
Agriculture Department in May. The study, funded with a $25,000
grant from the US Department of Agriculture, envisions a permanent
public market in Boston in a 40,000-square-foot facility that would
sell a variety of Massachusetts food and farm products plus
specialty foods. The study found a ``more than adequate demand''
for such a market and estimated sales of $16 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen of the Food and Agriculture Department says the
committee working on the project _ made up of agriculture
department staffers, farmers, and other producers _ is envisioning
a site on or near Northern Avenue. Right now the obstacles seem
high, she says, but ``in five or 10 years it could be something
great'' for the city.
</P>
<P>
   However, without a benefactor, such as in Portland, the study is
just the beginning, says Christensen. The next step will be to show
demand through promotional events at the Seaport Festival Aug. 1-2
and several other events later in August and in October.
</P>
<P>

----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All the great public markets have a story, says O'Neil of the
Public Market Collaborative. Certainly, Seattle's is among the most
colorful.
</P>
<P>
   The early open-air farmers' market in Seattle was formalized
into a public market by the city in 1907, says John Turnbull,
property management director for the Preservation and Development
Authority, which runs the Pike Place Market. Pike Place was the
central location where people came to buy all kinds of food. In
full bloom in the 1920s, the market was ``an early version of a
shopping mall based on food necessities,'' Turnbull says.
</P>
<P>
   The market district _ a loose conglomeration of buildings and
covered sheds _ stretched down First Avenue. Most of the fish
dealers were Sephardic Jews while Italian immigrants and later
Japanese farmers sold vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   As urban shopping habits changed and city congestion increased,
the district declined, with the buildings becoming decrepit and the
area turning into a stopover for sailors on leave. During the
nation's urban-renewal drive in the '60s, the area was slated for
demolition.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, says Turnbull, was blessed with two things. One was
that Seattle's renovations were scheduled after many other cities
had experienced varied results with urban renewal, and its citizens
realized that tearing down history to build anew might not be the
best thing for the city.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he adds, a liberal civic bias toward restoration and a
good set of congressmen _ the late Senators Warren Magnuson and
Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson _ combined to back the citizen activists
who opposed demolishing the market. Seattle voted to keep the
district and ``got good money,'' he says, from federal
urban-renewal funds.
</P>
<P>
   While the buildings were restored, the market stayed open. The
market looks _ and is _ old. There's nothing of that re-created,
faux look of replicas. The Preservation and Development Authority
is a publicly chartered nonprofit that manages subsidized housing
units in the market's historic district, a day-care center, a food
bank, and other human services agencies so that the community's
aims are intertwined with the market's.
</P>
<P>
   But the major thrust of the now self-sustaining market is food,
from fresh fruit and vegetables to small producers of nuts to
restaurants. Those renting the day tables must produce their own
products, whether it is lettuces or jams or clothing. The long-term
tenants pay more rent and often sell their own fruit and vegetables
along with produce that doesn't grow in the area, such as bananas
and limes.
</P>
<P>
   A number of upscale restaurants have located in the area, a draw
for tourists and locals alike. Etta's Seafood, owned by Tom Douglas
and Jackie Cross, is across the street from the end of the open-air
vegetable tables. It's a stylish place in bright colors with dishes
that are as vibrant as the market scene. ``We can really keep up on
what the produce of the moment is,'' says Cross. ``It's inspiring
to be down here. You get so many ideas about ingredients. You pick
up a beautiful box of tatsoi'' _ similar to bok choy, it's grown by
Asian farmers _ ``and think: `Is this going to work? What am I
going to do with this?' It stretches your imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks, however. ``We have been so successful in
keeping the market special,'' Turnbull says, ``that we've become a
tremendous destination.'' That attractiveness to tourists, while
enriching it and the city, threatens the market since locals often
stay away in the busiest times of summer and around Christmas.
Another factor threatening it is competition from smaller open-air
farmers' markets in the city and savvy grocers who have begun to
incorporate market elements into their stores.
</P>
<P>
   However, the future isn't in becoming more commercial or
allowing chain stores into the district. ``The aggressive abundance
that makes markets attractive also makes them messy,'' says
Turnbull. Chain stores, the same products sold the same way in each
location, are anathema to that concept.
</P>
<P>
   As he looks ahead to a Public Market Conference, scheduled Sept.
23-26 in Seattle, Turnbull confidently says the market, with all
its jumble and confusion, needs to be in the city. ``You don't get
that excitement except in a city,'' he says, adding that there's
definitely a desire for it, ``a human need to be in a place where
all this is going on.''

   The celebritization of America has reached such an extreme that
gossip columns are now engorged with items about movie ``stars''
who've made maybe one or two films before devoting themselves full
time to being public bores.
</P>
<P>
   By the counterfeit coin of celebrity &UR;  &LR; today, many of the
glitterati are more famous for who they've just broken up with or
which rehab clinic they've checked into than for anything they've
actually accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Was it ever thus? When did our obsession with celebrities begin?
In American Heritage, Richard Brookhiser traces the phenomenon back
to the Revolutionary era, when the public became enamored of the
Three Georges: George Washington, King George III, and evangelist
George Whitefield. Back then, fame was based on rank or
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But the modern celebrity culture really began to take shape in
the 19th century when the impresarios of fame arrived on the scene.
Shrewd-ies like P.T. Barnum used advances in media technology and
transportation to make household names of performers like Jenny
Lind, the ``Swedish Nightingale,'' along with many who had not a
fraction of her talent.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to Elvis, Marilyn, Diana, and the lesser lights who
make up the constellation of celebrity in an era of 24-hour news
and entertainment. Brookhiser opines that the collapse of
authority, presumably including moral authority, leads us to seek
the spurious ``companionship'' of celebrities: ``If people don't
know what they are doing on earth, they at least want to know the
people they see in the celebrity sky above them.''

   When it comes to welfare reform, education, or innumerable other
issues of public policy, state government has been in the driver's
seat ever since the ``New Federalism'' began redirecting money and
power from the federal government to the states in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally the nation's newspapers, realizing that their
watchdog role is more important than ever, have responded by
beefing up coverage of the nation's state houses, right? Guess
again.
</P>
<P>
   In a comprehensive and troubling report, this month's American
Journalism Review details the systematic cutbacks in capital press
corps from Connecticut to Georgia to Texas to Michigan. (Newspaper
coverage of the Massachusetts State House has held steady, AJR
finds.)
</P>
<P>
   Wrongly convinced that readers are bored by stories about
government and determined to clear out space for more lifestyle
features, many editors have taken the ax to their state house
bureaus and given increasingly short shrift to government stories,
according to authors Charles Layton and Mary Walton.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences for the public of this abdication of
journalistic duty are succinctly summarized by a state
representative in North Carolina who says the prevailing view among
lawmakers in the capital is: ``You can vote any way you want to up
here because the folks back home will never know.''

   David Wells is a flaky guy in a business _ major league baseball
_ that has always attracted its share of flaky guys.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 17 at Yankee Stadium, the gonzo southpaw with the
outlaw swagger did what only 14 other players in baseball history
have done: He threw a perfect game, as in no hits, no walks, 27 up
and 27 down.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, maybe that makes a case for flakiness. In the August
issue of Details, author Michael P. Geffner makes a case for the
beefy southpaw as a raw, volatile, but essentially likable fellow.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that you've got to like somebody who threatens, as
Wells once did, to punch out George Steinbrenner. It's that Wells's
throwback quality is awfully engaging in this era of blow-dried,
smooth-talking millionaire athletes. The tattooed Wells has the
demeanor _ and the vocabulary _ of a truck driver who's seen a
million miles of bad road.
</P>
<P>
   He has. Raised in poverty by his unwed mother, a ``biker chick''
who ran with the Hell's Angels, Wells is the classic case of a guy
who used sports as a way out. In addition to the joy of playing and
the opportunity to escape his home life, he may have also seen the
financial possibilities of baseball early on: The Hell's Angels
used to cheer on the 8-year-old Wells during his Little League
games and pay him $1 for every strikeout.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Curmudgeons are among our most precious natural resources. We
should value these crusty truth-tellers more than we do.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most valuable is Paul Fussell, author of ``Thank God
for the Atom Bomb'' and ``The Great War in Modern Memory.'' Reading
Fussell is like being hit in the face again and again with cold
water: shocking at first, then strangely bracing.
</P>
<P>
   In an epigrammatic interview in the August Psychology Today,
Fussell heaves a few more buckets of his ``joyous pessimism'' our
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``One's going to get older, and it's not going to be much fun,''
he says. ``One should get ready for it early and not be surprised
when it happens; it's a way of joining the human race.'' And this,
on violence: ``There's no solution to it. ... People are
meaninglessly wicked sometimes.'' And this: ``Arriving at
self-respect is the ultimate duty of everybody alive. Otherwise,
you're a drag on the universe, apologizing for yourself or doing
less well than you could.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other curmudgeons such as Gore Vidal, who seem to
regard lesser mortals with Olympian contempt, Fussell has
compassion for those who can't bring themselves to see the truth as
clearly as he does. ``One should be sympathetic with people who
need a false world, because the real one is intolerable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Which could, I suppose, explain the dominance of the celebrity
culture, except that that ``false world'' is more intolerable than
the real one.

BEST, WORST IN MASSACHUSETTS HARD TO FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Investors who have owned the best or worst performers among
Massachusetts stocks in the last 12 months could be asking the same
question.
</P>
<P>
   It usually wasn't underestimated operating prowess or an
unforeseen financial disaster that suprised shareholders. It was
the degree to which the stock market reacted to more muted news,
good or bad, at smaller to medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
   Go no further than Massachusetts to get a good look at the
volatility that can affect stocks that don't quite make it into the
large-capitalization category preferred by big institutional
investors these days.
</P>
<P>
   The usual influences _ thinner trading volumes, concentration of
ownership, and an occasional mania for certain kinds of stocks _
are helping drive many of the dramatic gains and losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``With small companies like Natural Microsystems Corp., the
liquidity is poor to nonexistent so the impact is probably much
overdone,'' said Brian Stack of Massachusetts Financial Services
Inc. in Boston, referring to the fifth biggest loser on our list.
``The most dramatic upside and downside moves have taken place in
small stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the appearance of a strong stock market,
Massachusetts issues as a group were a decidedly mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stocks that make up the Bloomberg Massachusetts index,
181 increased in value over the last year while 167 suffered price
declines. The index itself gained in value by 10.61 percent during
the yearlong period.
</P>
<P>
   Mania is the only way to describe the voracious investor
appetite for Internet-related stocks, and CMG Information Services
Inc. of Andover has been one of greatest beneficiaries of the last
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   CMG shares have risen 1,094.8 percent over the last year, from 7
3/16 on July 21, 1997, to a record 85 7/8 Tuesday, making it by far
the hottest stock in the state.
</P>
<P>
   (Our top performing stocks all have a minimum stock market value
of $250 million. The big losers on our list all started with a
market capitalization of at least that amount).
</P>
<P>
   CMG acts like a public venture capital fund for Internet
businesses. One of its most successful investments was in the
now-public Lycos Inc., a Framingham-based Internet search company.
Lycos the second most popular Massachusetts stock over the last
year, advancing 404.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the state's best-performing stocks are well-established
companies with recent records that rank somewhere between good and
very strong. Shares of Staples Inc., the office supply retailer,
and apparel discounter TJX Cos., have both nearly doubled in the
last yea.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Corp., the data storage company, advanced 121.3 percent and
added more total value for shareholders than any Massachusetts
stock, from the high-flying Internet names to giants like Gillette
Co. EMC's per-share price increase over the last year increased the
company's total stock market value by $13.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But many other local success stocks of the last year are
smaller, with names you may or may not have heard before. Geotel
Communications Inc. and Mapics Inc. are among the state's hottest
stocks, after Internet shares.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of other companies have posted at least as strong
percentage gains, but fell below our minimum stock market value
even after their advances.
</P>
<P>
   The worst performing stocks, a technology-heavy list of
companies, has one consistent theme. All of them have turned in at
least one earnings disappointment, but the dimensions of their
shortfall are all over the map.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the worst-performing stocks suffered large price
declines six months or longer ago, and have failed to regain any
momentum since.
</P>
<P>
   ``An earnings disappointment in technology tends to be viewed
more significantly,'' said Richard Jodka, manager of the State
Street Research Capital fund. ``If you are really missing a cycle
or someone is coming up with a better widget, it's harder to catch
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The one theme besides technology among the worst stocks:
sneakers. Converse Inc. of North Reading shed 69.3 percent of its
value in the last year, making it the third-biggest loser. Reebok
International Ltd. of Stoughton, which did not make the top 10
list, has dropped 46.2 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston Celtics public shareholders have been getting a good
bounce since the team's complicated ownership reorganization took
place July 2. Most investors got a combination of new stock, a debt
security, and $1 in cash for each of their old Celtics shares,
which were trading as low as 16 just before the change.
</P>
<P>
   The new stock, debt, and cash had a combined value of $22.60 per
old share as of Tuesday. It has been slipping from a high of over
$25 reached last week.

XEROX `COMPANY MAN' BRINGS FERVOR TO THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Following a trail of promotions, Xerox Corp.'s senior
executive in New England uprooted a spouse and three daughters from
Minneapolis to accept the top-drawer assignment in Boston. It was
the family's fourth move in six years.
</P>
<P>
   No less is expected of a company man, a now-quaint label for a
vanishing breed of executive who is hired and, after decades of
sacrifice and devotion to work, retired by the same company.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the 1990s and this ``company man'' is Karen Kruck.
</P>
<P>
   At age 38, Kruck is among the youngest Xerox executives to head
an entire regional sales operation. In just 17 months on the job,
Kruck has demonstrated her passion for Xerox's goal of regaining
lost sales in a tough market, a gusto for the community work
expected of senior executives, and a relentless energy for her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Karen Kruck's career path is one of torn loyalties. The tug
and pull of those commitments, unique to her role as a career Xerox
manager, are more complex than her employer may fully appreciate _
or the upbeat Kruck would admit to.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jeff Kruck, a willing supporter of his wife's
career, calls the pace of so many relocations for Stamford,
Conn.-based Xerox ``a little crazy.'' And during her last
pregnancy, Kruck met a pressing deadline during a long day's work
only to rush to the hospital to deliver her baby. That monumental
effort was followed by a maternity leave in which she juggled work
and newborn care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met Superwoman,'' a bubbly Karen Kruck says during
an interview in her neat downtown corner office. ``It certainly
isn't me.''
</P>
<P>
   But she seems to be trying. Take Fourth of July weekend. Kruck
threw on her blue mirror sunglasses and packed Lauren, 11, Lindsay,
9, and Alex, 3 _ her husband stayed home in Boxford with two golden
retrievers and the cat _ into the Chevrolet Suburban. They drove
1,000 miles, first to New Jersey to meet Kruck's best friend and
then to her parents' getaway house on Lake Ariel, outside Scranton,
Pa., to meet two sisters and their seven children.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Kruck family has a name for this breakneck pace: ``Mommy
Time.'' That, Kruck explains, ``means no naps, no down time. It's
go go go.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no different in college. While commuting to Seton Hall
University in South Orange, N.J., from her parents' home in leafy
Chatham Township, she held part-time jobs at a Shop Rite grocery
store and her father's sheet metal fabrication business. &UR;  &LR; Those
jobs helped pay for summer trips to Mexico or Europe. ``She's not
one to sit by,'' says her &UR;  &LR; mother, Mary Helen Emmerich, an
administrator at the private Newark Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Kruck's decision to join Xerox was as lucky as it was smart.
</P>
<P>
   She was recruited by Xerox on campus in early 1982, after
earning a bachelor's in business in 3 1/2 years _ to ``beat the
resume rush,'' as she puts it. Kruck recalls forgoing three other
job offers in her preferred line of work, fashion merchandising, to
take Xerox's higher salary and promise of greater opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Droves of women who joined corporate America in the 1970s or
early 1980s complain of frustration with their slow progess; many
drop out to start their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Kruck chose a Fortune 500 company that was an early promoter of
minorities. In 1968, Xerox founder Joseph C. Wilson instructed his
managers to recruit more black employees, ``a great national
resource.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Xerox was recognized for developing and
elevating women, too. Although women still make up only one-fourth
of Xerox's top executives, Anne Mulcahey last year became the first
woman promoted into the inner circle of executives reporting to
chief executive Paul Allaire. (Allaire's seven top executives also
include one black man, A. Barry Rand.)
</P>
<P>
   But Kruck is in a cohort of 76 top executives who are female &UR;  &LR; _
38 more than in 1995, the year Xerox received the US Labor
Department's first ``Glass Ceiling Award'' for its diverse work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox has not let Kruck down. She has seized opportunities that
have come from the company's successful transition from a copy
machine maker to a ``document company'' selling multicopy printers
with direct links to desktop computers. Kruck is one of 39 heads of
Xerox's regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably been one of the most fortunate people. I haven't
had too many tough times,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kruck also gives her husband credit for her success. ``I
couldn't ask for anybody to be more supportive,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kruck is a star among baby boomer husbands who have pitched
in so their wives can pursue careers. After the couple married in
June 1983, Karen Kruck's job assignments allowed them to stay put
in northern New Jersey for a decade while her workaholic husband
commuted to a Rolls-Royce dealership in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she shined as a sales representative and then branch
manager in northern New Jersey, helping to boost weak sales in the
area, says Michael MacDonald, senior vice president and chief of
staff for US customer operations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, she was rewarded with a job offer in Rochester,
headquarters of Xerox's US operations. At that point, Jeff Kruck
agreed to sell the dealership to his business partner. ``It got to
the point that she had to move for Xerox to keep her career on the
fast track,'' he says. ``It was a mutual decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur has accommodated his wife's career ever since,
though each makes an equal financial contribution to the household.
After moving to Rochester, he started a consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: Minneapolis. During a year in that city, Jeff Kruck
nursed his consulting business, albeit on ``a smaller scale. Karen
Kruck, as manager of sales operations, flew vast distances in
snowstorms to visit Xerox customers in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and
North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no simple task to do these jobs and raise three
children,'' says her former boss, Nancy Naigle, head of Xerox's
sales operation in the upper Midwest region. ``Now we have two
people doing that job,'' Naigle says.
</P>
<P>
   Kruck also won recognition within Xerox for her ability to
motivate staff. She cheerfully tells of being ``out to here
pregnant'' and working until 3 a.m. to help her Minnesota staff
prepare equipment for a rush delivery the next day to Kinko's.
``You're a better role model by example,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   After Minneapolis, she was sent back to New Jersey where she
excelled in a 14-month stint overseeing sales managers. Says Carlos
Pascual, president of US customer operations, ``When the New
England opening happened, we couldn't think of any better person
than Karen.'' He adds, ``She made a big commitment to the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kruck was named vice president and general manager for New
England in March 1997. Jeff Kruck found a new job, opening a
regional office in Boston for Sun Financial Group, a Tampa company
that leases computers.
</P>
<P>
   Kruck's assignment at Xerox New England: Boost sales and recover
market share lost to Ikon Office Solutions, one of the company's
toughest competitors. In the first six months of 1998, sales under
Kruck have grown 7.2 percent, compared with the same period a year
ago, Xerox says. Kruck is aiming for a 10 percent to 15 percent
increase in 1998 sales over 1997 sales of $270 million in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As Xerox's ambassador to Boston's business community and
customers and potential customers, Kruck has, in addition to
management duties, taken on the community projects expected of
high-level executives.
</P>
<P>
   She is active in Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries in Boston.
In May she modeled a chocolate-colored designer suit down a Newbury
Street ``runway'' for the charity. She is also being pursued by the
Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, according to her husband, and
she is a trustee of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a
lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph displayed near her office is telling: A toddler
nestles on Kruck's shoulder, sleepy and enduring a winter dance the
company sponsored for elderly residents of the city's Jamaica Plain
neighborhood; a second daughter stands between her and another
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Kruck unfailingly puts a cheerful face on the unique stresses
that shadow her as a company woman willing to make big sacrifices
for her employer. For one thing, she deals with the challenge of
ensuring continuity in her daughters' &UR;  &LR; curriculums as they change
schools frequently. They made the honor roll and have made friends
in their new neighborhood and are ``open to new places and new
people,'' Karen Kruck says. ``I think they've actually benefited
from moving.'' Jeff Kruck is more frank: ``The girls told us they
didn't like moving,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Karen and Jeff Kruck agree that the entire family likes Boston
and has settled in well. But Karen Kruck's success as the Xerox's
most senior executive based in New England could mean a promotion
and, perhaps, &UR;  &LR; another move. Will she move, yet again, for Xerox?
</P>
<P>
   Kruck dodges a dilemma that is, for now, hypothetical. ``I spent
a lot of time getting here,'' she says. ``I want to spend the time
enjoying the job. That's why I'm here.''

MARKETING MASTER STEPHEN CONE REFASHIONS FIDELITY

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The first signs that change is afoot at Fidelity
Investments come in the sartorial gestures of the mutual fund
giant's new marketing master. Stephen A. Cone's iconoclastic bow
tie (Bolshevik red with white dots) and funky glasses (thick, black
plastic, round rims with tortoise-shell sides) seem more suited to
a hip advertising agency than to the reserved atmosphere of the
world's largest fund company.
</P>
<P>
   In other industries, such details would be less telling. But at
Fidelity, Cone's style reflects a vision that is refashioning how
one of the fund industry's bellwether firms does business.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, Fidelity jump-started modern investing
by attracting in-the-know customers with its legendary Magellan
fund, the nation's biggest mutual fund. Then it focused on
corporations, state pension funds, and other institutional clients,
assuming a lower profile before individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under Cone, Fidelity is returning to its roots. But this
time it is going after individual investors in novel ways. Armed
with an array of innovative marketing ideas, Fidelity is preparing
to let fly some of the first shots of what many say is a
long-overdue marketing revolution in the mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a situation where if you open a certain type of
account with us, you get a very preferable rate for a boat,'' Cone
said, describing plans to woo customers by offering other
companies' products and services with Fidelity's own.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves at traditionally restrained Fidelity make the
Boston-based company, which has 13 percent of the $5.1 trillion US
mutual fund industry and 14.1 million customers, a barometer of a
rapidly changing and increasingly competitive investment
marketplace. Much is at stake: How fund companies court customers
will affect the ways in which legions of Americans plan for
retirements and accumulate wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds are not as ubiquitous as Nike sports shoes. But
they have practically become a mass consumer good in recent years,
with 38 percent of American households owning at least one. Yet the
sophisticated marketing techniques deemed crucial to business
survival have not been embraced by the stuffy fund industry, which
has held itself at arm's length from customers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with financial services firms plying more than 8,000 mutual
funds, even leading fund companies are increasingly anxious over
how to stand out in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything mutual fund companies are learning, it's
from the consumer goods companies, which have created brands and
preferences among customers,'' said John Lister, chairman of Lister
Butler Consulting, a brand and marketing firm in New York. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Exciting customers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who joined Fidelity last February as president of customer
marketing and development, knows that. A creative, outspoken
marketing specialist who was previously at Keycorp, a
Cleveland-based bank, and American Express, the financial services
giant, he rebuked the fund industry for ``not getting it'' in the
way that fashion houses with private trunk showings for elite
clients or airlines with frequent-flier miles have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole retail strategy is now customer-focused as opposed
to product-focused,'' Cone said in a recent interview. ``We want to
excite our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Cone, Fidelity is gearing up to pair Peter S. Lynch _
Magellan's former manager and an icon in the investment world _
with celebrities from Hollywood or the sports arena in witty
television commercials to run from mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to entertain people today,'' said the 48-year-old
Cone. He laughed but nodded somberly as a senior Fidelity executive
joked: ``We've had Michael Jordan in the locker room all these
years; why don't we use him?''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity now researches customer attitudes each quarter, instead
of just once a year. Cone has reorganized the company's retail
group, formerly structured around product lines, along customer
segments tracking age, income, lifestyle, and other indicators. The
firm also plans targeted direct mailings, new print advertisements,
and more extensive one-on-one interaction with customers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Offering enticements
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another move, Fidelity has expanded its offer of travel
vouchers to London, Mexico, and Hawaii to new customers who set up
accounts of at least $10,000 at Fidelity's brokerage. After the
program was opened to existing customers in June, family-owned
Fidelity forked over more than 30,000 vouchers in less than one
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite Ed McMahon and the sweepstakes,'' said Jim
Lowell, who publishes the independent Fidelity Investor newsletter.
``But it's close.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the moves signal that Fidelity is no longer
content to rest on previous successes, when the firm's star
stock-pickers and hot funds made it the uncontested leader of the
industry. The company's goal is to sell individual customers not
just Fidelity funds but a whole array of financial products and
services, including those of other firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be a primary investment provider for each of our
customers,'' Cone said. ``That's not going to work for everybody.
But we view one-stop shopping as our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   That view reflects a growing trend in the financial services
sector, where banks, insurers, brokerages, investment houses, and
fund firms are combining to create giants that will sell everything
from mutual funds to car insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity already offers debit and credit cards, life insurance,
and check writing, in addition to other companies' funds. With 1
million people contacting Fidelity daily by telephone, the
Internet, or in Fidelity investor centers, the privately held firm
sees a big opportunity to carve out new niches. ``Fidelity has a
lot to sell to customers who may have already bought their mutual
funds,'' said Russell J. Kinnell, equity fund editor at fund
tracking firm Morningstar Inc. &QL; 
 &QL; 
New marketing strategy
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cone's marketing strategy stands in stark contrast to the
bewildering array of numbers and obtuse financial-speak still used
by many firms. Only a few have followed Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the
nation's largest discount brokerage, in using a top executive to
tout funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's television campaigns in recent years attracted
criticism for failing to create a strong image. Not just lapsed
creativity distanced customers. When returns at some of its top
funds dried up in recent years, Fidelity began speaking more about
the investment process and less about performance. Critics said
that tactic, combined with a string of defections by top portfolio
managers, did little to cheer investors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as many Fidelity funds are posting dramatically improved
returns, the firm has decided that numbers are not enough to sell
investment products. ``People are more interested in financial
advice,'' Cone said. ``They've heard the performance message until
they no longer want to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's race to craft a new image for itself around the theme
of ``know what you own and why you own it,'' as Cone put it, comes
after more than a decade in which the company was able to sit back
and watch the customers roll in.
</P>
<P>
   Such a luxury no longer exists. Competition abounds in the fund
industry, especially from The Vanguard Group, whose popular index
funds are giving Fidelity a run for its money by attracting the
lion's share of new dollars going into mutual funds. Since 1994,
Fidelity's share of the entire fund market has been flat at around
12 percent. While that is still more than anybody else, Vanguard's
share has grown by one-third to nearly 10 percent, fast closing the
gap with Fidelity, according to Financial Research Corp. in
Boston. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Targeting individuals
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's marketing drive also comes at a time when most growth
in the fund business has been from institutional customers, who
choose fund families for corporate retirement plans on the strength
of their popularity and name-brand appeal among individual
consumers. By contrast, so many individual Americans now own funds
that growth in that area has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   So why go back to the individual customer? Because there is as
much business to be kept as to be won. Geoff Bobroff, a fund
marketing consultant in East Greenwich, R.I., said the fund
business is moving from an asset-accumulation industry to an
asset-retention industry, in which companies must now focus on
retaining existing customers as much as acquiring new ones.
</P>
<P>
   While Fidelity already oversees one in five 401(k)
employee-sponsored retirement plans, it wants to capture the
hundreds of billions of dollars that aging baby boomers are
expected to transfer from retirement plans to other investment
products. And winning more points with rank-and-file investors will
help attract institutional customers. About two-thirds of
Fidelity's $676 billion in assets are held by institutional
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail business is what made Fidelity great in the first
place,'' said Eric M. Kobren, editor of the independent Fidelity
Insight newsletter. ``But now, the retirement business will fuel
the retail business.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as managing money goes, Fidelity plans no changes to its
rigorous stock-picking approach by individual portfolio managers.
Loath to distract fund managers with the mechanics of sales,
Fidelity will not turn its money managers into mini marketing
czars.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do is to get us to be more like the dynamic
college professor and less like the one who uses the same notes
every year,'' Cone explained. ``We're on a mission.''

KATHERINE DIMATTEO PIONEERS A PATH TO ORGANIC STATEHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENFIELD, Mass. _ The Pioneer Valley is filled with sleepy
small towns like this, where energetic small businesses have moved
into abandoned brick warehouses and the movie house is Main
Street's sole entertainment. Like neighboring towns, this one has a
thriving counterculture, partly because of its proximity to five
colleges nearby. So it isn't entirely an accident that the Organic
Trade Association established itself here in 1990, leaving its
former home in Belchertown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go unnoticed,'' says Katherine DiMatteo, Organic
Trade's director of nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Unnoticed? Hardly. At least not last spring, when conventional
and organic farmers nationwide focused on the organization as
DiMatteo and her supporters took on the US Department of
Agriculture, winning a sweet victory.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings over several years, the Department of Agriculture
and the organic farming community had come up with a set of
guidelines on what could be labeled ``organic.'' To the surprise of
many, the proposed regulations included genetically engineered and
irradiated foods, and produce farmed with sewage sludge. The
organic farmers were furious and _ fueled with the passion that
kept them farming organically in the first place _ they corralled
their forces, held forums in several cities, and deluged the
Department of Agriculture with mail (to the tune of 290,000
comments).
</P>
<P>
   When negative public comment reached historic proportions,
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman backed down. ``It was really
wonderful,'' says DiMatteo.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have known? When Organic Trade was established 15
years ago, no one could have predicted the movement would have that
sort of power. But no one also would have guessed that this
one-generation farming phenomenon, fostered by ardent
back-to-the-earth hippies who had lived on communes, would ever
reach mainstream America.
</P>
<P>
   Organic Trade is now 760 members strong. In the last seven
years, the organic industry has been growing 20 percent a year,
capturing 1 percent of a $400 billion market. Considering that, you
would think that organic's $4 billion take doesn't account for
much. But with numbers rising each year, DiMatteo ventures that
``an optimistic estimate of what we could get is 5 to 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments like that make mainstream food manufacturers nervous _
especially since the organic umbrella has broadened to include
beef, poultry, all sorts of canned goods, dry cereals, frozen
prepared meals, baby food, milk, yogurt and other dairy products,
eggs, and now fibers. Organically grown cotton and its byproducts _
cottonseed meal and cottonseed oil _ are the latest additions to
the organic family.
</P>
<P>
   That neighborhood supermarkets are clamoring for organic foods
is as much a testament to the purity associated with organic
agriculture as it is a statement of mistrust and fear from American
consumers. Organic-seeking shoppers are worried about the planet
and what corporate farmers are doing to their land. Agribusinesses,
unlike organic manufacturers, don't boast about the clean ways they
raise food or their concern about the environment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Overseas markets have opened up, too. In Japan, there's a
``rather strong demand'' for organic soybeans to make tofu, says
August Schumacher, undersecretary of agriculture for farm and
foreign agriculture services, and former agriculture commissioner
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations that were shot down essentially allowed
corporate farming to piggyback on the organic. ``The secretary
probably received more comments on that rule than any other rule in
the history of USDA,'' says Schumacher. ``Katherine played a major
role. She was one of the leaders for reconsideration.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't surprising, since DiMatteo sees her identity as
firmly, inextricably linked to the land.
</P>
<P>
   DiMatteo's organization was up against hard-lobbying
agribusiness supporters. Before Organic Trade, she says, ``I had
some experience with Washington but not a lot.'' DiMatteo had
worked for the nonprofit Peace Development Fund and was executive
director of the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, based in
Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business was to band together with groups
sympathetic to Organic Trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Campaign for Sustainable Agriculture, Humane Society of the
United States, Public Voice for Food and Healthy Policy, National
Campaign Against the Misuse of Pesticides, and Center for Science
in the Public Interest helped Organic Trade establish its voice
early on. Greenpeace, Sierra Club, Consumers Union, Mothers and
Others for a Livable Planet, and Union of Concerned Scientists have
since joined Organic Trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined clout has been our success,'' says DiMatteo. ``We
don't affect that many people, so you need to have these partners
and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things DiMatteo, 49, learned inside the Beltway is
that ``D.C. politics is being around long enough to establish
relationships and remember shifts in attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also been around the organic movement long enough to see
its changes.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, DiMatteo worked in food cooperatives in the
retail and distribution end. She grew up in New Jersey, connected
to the land only through her Italian grandfather. He lived on one
lot and on the adjacent lot raised vegetables and fruit, including
tomatoes, figs, and grapes. She went to Trenton State College and
came out hoping to teach ``in the years when there were more
teachers than jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Richard, is an artist and musician. Their two
children are grown, and their daughter tends the family garden.
</P>
<P>
   Begun mainly by farmers and traders, Organic Trade includes
representatives of commerce _ the manufacturers, processors,
handlers, and transporters who bring organic food to supermarkets
and also ship it abroad. The group also consists of those who offer
pest control and supply the industry with equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the organic farmers who came together to establish
Organic Trade don't necessarily consider the organization its
spokesman, says Judith Gillan of the New England Small Farm
Institute in Belchertown, which represents a group of farmers not
involved in international trade, or even in much business outside
their own regions.
</P>
<P>
   DiMatteo has managed to weather these changes, says Gillan.
``Katherine is unique,'' she says, ``in that she has been able to
make this transition, to take this extra complicated path of
evolution without alienating the various sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some surprising elements to this evolution. Some
manufacturers grew so fast that they were undercapitalized. And
when mainstream corporations offered an infusion of cash, they
didn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds of Change in Santa Fe, N.M., is one such company. A
purveyor of organic seeds, it wanted to preserve heirlooms and
offer seeds that had never been sprayed. Now Seeds of Change is
owned by M&AMP;M/Mars, which allows it to operate independently and
offer canned goods and boxes of grain mixes along with the seed
packets.
</P>
<P>
   There are other changes that the pioneers find distressing. Some
successful CEOs of organic companies live in million-dollar houses.
Others _ even some organic farmers _ smoke organic tobacco and
sprinkle organic sugar on their morning cereal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it can be grown, it can be grown organically,'' says
DiMatteo. Organic Trade deals with matters of agriculture and
environment. ``Our mission is to support and sustain organic
agriculture, and organic agriculture is there to support and
sustain a healthy environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not dictating a lifestyle,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ashley of Dancing Bear Farm in Leyden, near Greenfield, has
been loosely associated with Organic Trade for many years. His wife
used to write the association's newsletter. Several years ago he
became a dues-paying member.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley cultivates six or seven of his 24 acres and brings a
variety of produce into the farmers' markets in Newton and
Brookline. ``I feel lucky to be in those markets, because they're
known to be two of the best in the state.'' He wholesales to some
restaurants, and if he has too much of a particular vegetable, he
offers it to one of the local markets.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups claiming to offer services to small farmers
actually don't, Ashley says. ``The larger an organization gets, the
bigger the issues it takes on.'' He says he doesn't blame them.
Ideally, he would like an organization to provide someone to broker
a large crop and save him time. During a day that might include
harvesting produce, packing the truck, driving it into Boston,
selling at market, and driving home again, he could also unload 600
pounds of organic garlic for the best price with the least shipping
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Organic Trade has sent several members to him requesting a
larger scale of produce than he can grow. Though he can't fill the
order, ``it gives me a chance to see if I should change my
operation to growing one large crop.''
</P>
<P>
   What he likes about Organic Trade is the extent to which the
association promotes organic agriculture. ``It has a positive
effect on me,'' he says. ``They deserve a lot of credit for
increasing general awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My small farm doesn't amount to a decimal point of anything,''
he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Katherine DiMatteo and Organic Trade first
headed to Washington to deal with the Department of Agriculture,
they, too, were just a dot on the landscape. And look what they
did.

SHAYS FEELS GOP   HEAT OVER FINANCING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A late-night whiff of cigar smoke wafted into the
House chamber as Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut
endured the wrath of his Republican leaders for defying their
back-room strategy to block a new campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Angry voices echoed in the nearly empty chamber as Shays fought
one Republican amendment after another aimed at scuttling an
overhaul plan he is sponsoring with Representative Martin T.
Meehan, a Lowell Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In a midsummer drama that is lurching toward a final scene,
Shays has emerged as a pariah among many Republicans who see his
push for new campaign-finance laws as an unwarranted attack on
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's authority and their incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, yielding to pressure from Shays and his allies in
April, abandoned their opposition to a full debate on how money
mixes with politics in federal elections. They pledged to complete
debate on the issue before the summer recess begins Aug. 7, and the
debate has been scheduled in bits and pieces over seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the development rankles many GOP members, who blame Shays
for turning the spotlight on campaign funding while they scurry to
raise millions of dollars for their reelection races.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continued long after dark Monday, some Republican
lawmakers directed sneers and jeers at Shays. And the possibility
lingered that Gingrich will punish the former Peace Corps volunteer
for his renegade challenge, even as it gains momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy wants to play the game by his rules or take his ball
and go home,'' said Representative Scott McInnis, a Colorado
Republican, moments after clashing with Shays on the House floor
over a campaign-finance amendment. ``That tends to irritate a lot
of his colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays, 52, a moderate who has represented a wealthy district in
southwestern Connecticut for 11 years, has called the current
campaign-finance system a recipe for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill, which already has been subject to 21
Republican amendments, with 34 to go, would ban the unlimited,
largely unregulated contributions known as ``soft money'' that
increasingly have influenced federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the measure's many other provisions is a
requirement that groups running so-called ``issue advocacy''
campaigns aimed at influencing elections disclose how much the
campaigns cost and who contributed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the high-stakes struggle, Shays repeatedly has broken party
decorum in challenging the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich raised procedural obstacles to his overhaul plan,
Shays called them ``dumb'' and ``deceitful.'' He openly questioned
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, on
the House floor in April about the leadership's integrity on the
campaign-finance issue.
</P>
<P>
   And his criticism prompted Representative Tom DeLay of Texas,
the majority whip, to issue an apology last week for appearing to
suggest that people with foreign-sounding names were prone to
breaking campaign-finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Shays's staff did not comply with several requests in recent
days to arrange an interview with him about his standing with House
Republicans. Sources said Shays wants to avoid unnecessary
controversy as his long quest for a vote on the Shays-Meehan bill
appears to be nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
   However, Shays also faces the possibility of sanctions by
Republican leaders for future acts that are seen as undermining the
GOP majority.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said Shays' recent defiance of party leaders
prompted them to circulate a petition calling on Gingrich to punish
GOP members who break ranks with the majority on major procedural
issues. Gingrich was among the first lawmakers to sign the
petition.
</P>
<P>
   For Shays, the punishment could mean losing his chairmanship of
a subcomittee on human resources and his ranking as the
third-most-senior Republican on the powerful House Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the potential cost of his standing up to the GOP leaders,
Shays's allies described his effort on the campaign-finance front
in heroic terms.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers in both parties said Shays had distinguished
himself as admirably as Representative Greg Ganske, an Iowa
Republican, who defied GOP leaders last week by appearing with
President Clinton at a Capitol Hill event promoting broader rights
for patients in managed-care health programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Chris is taking a lot of heat,'' said Representative
Patrick J. Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat who favors rewriting
the campaign-finance laws. ``But members of both parties respect
his integrity on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Shays who spent months enlisting enough Republican allies
to form a majority coalition with the Democratic minority and force
GOP leaders to permit a full debate on the Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been very much a discomfort for a lot of people in our
party,'' said Representative Zach Wamp, a Tennesee Republican who
joined Shays and a dozen other GOP members in signing a petition in
April that spurred the leadership to act.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shays, Wamp has been the target of a blistering backlash,
including radio ad campaigns in their districts funded by the
National Right to Life Committee, a vigorous opponent of
Shays-Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wamp said he and Shays have faced some of the most stinging
criticism from their Republican colleagues. ``There's no question
we have felt their wrath,'' he said. ``The cutting comments, the
constant looks, we get them all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign-finance debate, Shays has chastised
Republican colleagues who have vowed to vote against his bill yet
continue to offer amendments to the measure that he denounces as
``poison pills.''
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed as ``foolish'' a proposal by Representative Anne M.
Northup, a Kentucky Republican, to ban political parties and
candidates from paying cash to workers who help get voters to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, support for the Shays-Meehan bill appears to continue to
grow. In a key victory Monday, Shays-Meehan supporters defeated an
amendment, 248-150, that they said was aimed at breaking apart
their majority coalition. The measure would have required labor
unions to disclose their spending on all political activities, not
just elections.
</P>
<P>
   As the vote ended, Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a New York
Republican who favors Shays-Meehan, said he knew what Shays was
experiencing because he has encountered similar wrath from GOP
colleagues as a leading proponent of strict environmental
regulations. But he said he expects that Shays will survive the
storm.

ANTOINE WALKER NEEDN'T BE A GONER FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems the phone rings every four minutes in Antoine Walker's
Chicago loft. Sometimes he answers; sometimes you have to leave a
message on a machine where about 850 have been left before yours.
So many calls. It's time for one of them to come from Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows that NBA teams risk a heavy fine for talking to
their players during a lockout. Maybe with a couple of winks and
some shredded phone records, Walker and Pitino could get away with
it.
</P>
<P>
   They need to chat. And they need to do it before producers of
the Jerry Springer show start stalking Merrimac Street, looking for
an angle. By now, everybody knows that Walker has issues with his
Celtics boss. Everyone should also know that Pitino isn't too happy
that one of his players, a quarter-century younger than he, told
him off via this newspaper. But there is a lot that the Trade
Antoine lobby hasn't considered, the least of which is that the
only team that willingly gives away its best players is the
pathetic Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   What you have to realize about Walker and Pitino is that they
have known each other for six years. They have cursed each other
before. They'll do it again. Walker knows all Pitino's drills, so
that's why you didn't see him hooked up to IVs, as five of his
teammates were during last season's training camp in Newport, R.I.
Remember, Pitino applauded him for being in the best shape on the
team, and that was after he missed Pitino's summer camp of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It also wouldn't surprise anyone close to the coach if he read
Walker's words last Friday, spewed a few expletives, and then went
about his day. That's because Pitino-Walker is the tumultuous
basketball equivalent of Bill Parcells-Drew Bledsoe, with one
exception: Parcells didn't recruit Bledsoe when he was 16, as
Pitino did with Walker. He didn't have a broad firsthand
perspective of who Bledsoe truly was, as Pitino does with Walker.
These men have a history together. And as serious as their problems
are, they can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, this (itals)is not about the money(unitals)
(although money may be an issue later this summer). It's not about
Walker's attendance at a two-day ``voluntary'' camp. It's not about
Walker saying he's not sure he wants to play for Pitino again,
either. This is really a tale of communication, how it often
becomes mangled when third parties become involved and how people
sometimes have to step back and acknowledge that their method of
communicating isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has been annoyed with Pitino for a while. It probably
started April 8, when the coach entered the Celtic locker room
after a 117-104 loss to the Nets and told Walker _ in front of the
team _ that the player would never be bigger than the coach. Walker
had just scored 43 points, an accomplishment that, at the time,
Pitino said should be ``thrown out the window'' because of Walker's
defense. But that analysis was tame compared to the verbal lashing
Pitino gave Walker earlier. Apparently, the confrontation got so
bad that veteran Pervis Ellison called two of Walker's friends the
next day and asked them to see if Walker was all right. His answer?
He was fine. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   He had been cursed by Pitino before. That didn't bother him.
What he didn't appreciate was the appearance of hypocrisy: The
coach tells his players not to say anything negative in the media,
yet he tells the media he wasn't happy with Walker after he carried
the team on a 43-point night? And what of loyalty? Sure, the two
men went at each other in the locker room. But why couldn't
criticism stay there? When asked to comment on Pitino's
throw-'em-out-the-window remarks that night, all Walker said was,
``Hey, that's nothing to broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was the point. Broadcasting problems. It's not Walker's
style. Think about it: During the Celtics' 15-win season of
1996-97, how many times did you hear Walker go off to the media?
How many times did he do it last season? He was accused of being
M.L. Carr's pet project during his rookie season, but you never
would have known from him that he didn't click with Carr until,
maybe, January or February '97.
</P>
<P>
   He overreacted to Pitino saying he was ``disappointed'' that he
didn't attend his summer camp, but the comment stung him because he
has a 4-year-old daughter, five brothers and sisters, his mother,
and grandmother all in Chicago. He takes care of them all and,
after spending six months in Boston without seeing his daughter,
looks forward to spending summers with her. We have seen accounts
recently in this paper and Sports Illustrated of NBA fathers who
have ignored their children. What about those who actually want to
be there?
</P>
<P>
   True communication for Walker and Pitino became nearly
impossible in late June. Pitino wanted the players to attend the
predraft ``Fandemonium'' at the FleetCenter. But Walker got a call
from the office of community relations director Wayne Levy two days
before the event. Walker already had plans to go to Vancouver with
his friend Nazr Mohammed. A few days later, he and other players
who didn't show received a letter signed by general manager Chris
Wallace. The letter detailed how unprofessional the players were
for not showing up and how Pitino and owner Paul Gaston were
disappointed in their not handling responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino often says Walker is like a son to him. Why send your son
a form letter condemning his lack of professionalism? A phone call
would have been better. That was in late June. By that point,
Walker didn't realize that his coach was still loyal to him, that
every time he went on television and said, ``The Celtics will sign
Antoine Walker,'' he was straddling the line of defiance with
Gaston, who has privately spoken against big-money, long-term
player contracts.
</P>
<P>
   So the eruption came. And Walker became a villain here. Here's
some advice: Don't believe the hype. If you had seen him coach
children for free in 90-degree heat on a summer day in Chicago _
looking very much like a 6-foot-9-inch Pitino _ you would know that
PitinoBall is seared into his basketball psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Now is not the time for Rick Pitino to turn into Jesse Helms
Pitino, a basketball reactionary ready to make a trade just because
there is a rough spot. If he is going to trade Walker, let it be
because there is a deal that will help the team (not an Eric
Williams-like yard sale that netted two second-round draft picks).
You know what? I wouldn't be shocked if Walker were traded next
month. I also wouldn't be stunned to see him at Brandeis in October
on Media Day. If he leaves, his most recent remarks will have
little to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's time for Pitino to pick up the phone first. And if
he wants to save a few pennies among the millions, there are some
long-distance carriers with rates as low as 9 cents per minute.

   BRITAIN-TRAFFIC _ LONDON _ Think traffic is bad in your city.
It's gotten so bad here that the Transportation Minister is pushing
hard for drivers to quit using their cars so much and switch to
mass transit. Sound familiar? Problem is, the sales of new cars has
been going through the roof, so folks don't want to give them up.
Moreover, the the mass transit system has about as many fans as
Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry does in the U.S. Congress.

   US-AFRICA _ WASHINGTON _ Now that it has presidential ``fast
track'' trade authority attached to it, proponents and opponents
alike are struggling with whether to try and save an important
trade bill that was to expand the U.S. relationship with
sub-Saharan Africa. But with just two months left in this Congress,
the long-awaited measure appears to have little, or no chance of
passage this year because Democrats -- including President Clinton
-- have been placed in a poltical bind. (Abulhassan, Cox News

   A-PLUS _ WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., said Wednesday
that the Republican-controlled Congress will not seek to override
President Clinton's veto of a bill to establish tax-free savings
accounts for public and private education. The bill is expected to
figure prominently, however, in the fall election campaigns.
(Foskett, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   MOBILITY _ WASHINGTON _ The South is the only region attracting
Americans who move, a new Census Bureau study shows, and the trend
could have profound social and political effects. For instance, the
data show an influx of highly educated people that could help fuel
the region's economic boom, and a continuing shift from cities to
suburbs, which could lead to a sharp Republicanization of Texas's
congressional delegation. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   AIR-FORCE _ WASHINGTON _ The Senate Armed Services Committee on
Wednesday rejected President Clinton's choice of Daryl Jones as the
first black secretary of the Air Force. The vote followed harsh
criticism of Jones's personal integrity at a confirmation hearing..

   SOCSEC-UNIONS _ WASHINGTON _ At least 146 employees of the
Social Security Administration work fulltime on labor union
activities and another 12,655 do union work at least three-quarters
time, the agency's inspector general reported Wednesday. The cost
of the work is $14.7 million a year in salaries and office space,
the report said. (Lipman, Cox News Service).

   NUN _ Today, Sister Marge Eilerman finds out how long she'll be

being sentenced for tearing down a sign in protest at the School of
the Americas. The Fort Benning, Ga., military academy trains Latin
American soldiers, some of whom have gone on to torture and kill
political enemies in their home countries. Eilerman's family say
they fully support her activism. (Keilman, Dayton Daily News). 16.

   RUDOLPH _ Bomb task force holds a briefing in Andrews, expected
to be more substantive than recent ones, probably on the results of
the examination of the truck Eric Rudolph allegedly stole two weeks
ago. (Scruggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   SWAMP _ A major energy company here just finished doing 3D
seismic operations in Jean Lafitte Swamp, Louisiana's only National
Park. The operations involve many explosions and the running of
airboats through the marshland. The company says it's safe, and
that they ''probably'' won't need to actually drill for oil in the
park. But park officials and even the National Park Service aren't
crazy about the seismic operations. These were the first operations
ever done with the new 3D technology in a national park, but they
won't be the last. The company that did this job already has plans
to blast in a park in Texas and one in Florida. (I will explain how
this is similar and how different from the controversy in
Okefenokee). (Rochell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

carry trusted brand names and command premium shelf space in the

   ``You've come aboard as passengers, but with all the food here,
you'll be leaving as cargo.``
</P>
<P>
   Better weigh those thoughts. Oh, it's still possible to gorge
yourself silly on around-the-clock dining alternatives. And some
ships have yet to abandon the choco-holic buffet.
</P>
<P>
   But following the trend on land, most cruise lines now offer
heart-healthy options _ vegetarian entrees, sugar-free desserts,
even complete low-fat, low-cholesterol and low-sodium meals.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Celebrity's five ships, nightly ``Lean and Light'' full
menus may include this recommendation: a shrimp cocktail, chilled
gin and tomato consomme with straw mushrooms, veal scaloppine with
lemon and frozen lemon yogurt with dark cherries.
</P>
<P>
   Total calories: 782. Total grams of fat: 9.
</P>
<P>
   Other lines offer similar enticements.
</P>
<P>
   From Princess' ``Healthy Choice'' menu: spaghetti in fresh basil
and tomato sauce, roast pork tenderloin with a corn muffin and warm
Mediterranean salad and lime sherbet.
</P>
<P>
   From Royal Caribbean's ``ShipShape'' menu: melon balls with port
wine, tossed romaine lettuce and plum tomatoes with fat-free creamy
roasted garlic dressing, baked lobster with citrus sauce and, for
dessert, a phyllo purse with pears and raspberry coulis.
</P>
<P>
   From Silversea's ``Light and Healthy Cuisine'' selections:
marinated Greek salad; marinated pan-fried scallops served with
capellini pasta, carrots and broccoli; and ice coupe peach Melba
with diet ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   From the ``Light Selections'' aboard Radisson Seven Seas' Song
of Flower: a strawberry cup; a salad with curry vinaigrette;
steamed rock lobster tail enhanced with saffron bouillon, vegetable
pearls and boiled potatoes; and a tropical fruit platter with diet
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Light cooking expert Jeanne Jones has created 20 new
lacto-vegetarian selections for Windstar's four sailing ships.
Among them: pear and gorgonzola pizza, herbed vegetable strudel,
Moroccan sweet potato stew, Cajun pasta and enchiladas with
butternut squash and corn.
</P>
<P>
   Among vegetarian entrees served aboard Royal Caribbean ships: a
five-layer vegetable tart served with red pepper puree, stir-fried
Chinese vegetables with tofu and Caribbean curried vegetables with
black beans.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, the world's largest cruise line, spices lunch and
dinner menus with ``Nautica Spa'' items such as poached sole with
red bean ratatouille, steamed whole red snapper in coconut water
and lemon grass and a low-fat pumpkin pie. Meats, fish and poultry
are roasted or broiled, salads are prepared with diet dressings and
desserts with Sweet 'N Low or NutraSweet.
</P>
<P>
   No mystery surrounds cruise lines' concentration on lighter,
healthier cuisine: It's passenger demand.
</P>
<P>
   Holland America officials cite these figures: In 1985, only 10
percent of that cruise line's passengers ordered fish when provided
the option; today, almost 40 percent choose fish on Caribbean
cruises and 50 percent order fish in Alaska. Another 10 percent
order poultry.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its ``Passport to Fitness'' onboard program, Holland
America offers low-fat, low-calorie cuisine not only in its main
dining rooms but also at buffets. A typical Lido Buffet salad bar
includes 20 to 30 fresh items and a wide selection of light
dressings. Cholesterol-free mayonnaise and other condiments are
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Waves of change are sweeping over other aspects of shipboard
dining, too.
</P>
<P>
   No longer does a cattle-car mentality automatically prevail,
with passengers herded into one humongous room at an appointed
moment and spoon-fed course after course by singing waiters.
</P>
<P>
   Fine dining has arrived at sea. In intimate settings. At
flexible times. With preparations that would make a three-star
Michelin chef proud.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity, at the forefront of this culinary revolution, even
employs a three-star Michelin chef _ Michel Roux, French-trained
proprietor of the Waterside Inn at Bray in Berkshire, England _ to
create its menus and train onboard staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Roux's approach is so exacting that photographs are posted on
galley walls to instruct the kitchen staff not only food
preparation but also on how each item should be placed on the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Among delicacies served during a cruise aboard Celebrity's
Galaxy: tournedos enhanced with a fried eggplant, anchovies and
bell pepper confit; roast duckling complemented by grilled
pineapple and a duck-flavored cinnamon sauce; and broiled tilapia
with red bliss potatoes, snow peas and a tropical salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Windstar passengers who don't opt for Jeanne Jones' light
cuisine dine on creations by much-honored Los Angeles restaurateur
Joachim Splichal, who has provided 180 signature recipes for the
line. Choices may include sauteed crab cakes with brown butter and
capers. Or braised lamb shank with garlic gnocci.
</P>
<P>
   Silversea has partnered with Le Cordon Bleu on special menu
selections. Among entrees during a cruise aboard its elegant Silver
Cloud: marinated crab with leek salad and star anise, stuffed
chicken breast wrapped in zucchini slices and grilled fresh
tournedos of salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Six 1998 sailings aboard the Silver Cloud and Silver Wind in
conjunction with Le Cordon Bleu feature cooking preparations by
master chefs and dishes created by adapting classical French
techniques to native cuisines to reflect the flavors of each region
the ships visit.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal, named the world's best cruise line in recent reader
surveys conducted by Conde Nast Traveler and Travel &AMP; Leisure
magazines, is offering 23 Wine &AMP; Food Festival sailings aboard its
Crystal Symphony and Crystal Harmony. Award-winning chefs from
North America and Europe will participate.
</P>
<P>
   Holland America rotates 50 gourmet dishes created by master chef
Reiner Greubel.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one on any of these lines' ships will go hungry, the
emphasis has clearly shifted from quantity to quality.
</P>
<P>
   And to variety.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal pioneered the increasingly popular concept of offering
passengers an alternative to the main dining room setting when it
installed Italian and Japanese restaurants aboard the Crystal
Harmony upon its debut in 1990. The newer Crystal Symphony also
boasts two theme eateries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most mainstream lines feature specialty restaurants,
bistros or cafes on some or all vessels. Most offer signature menus
and personalized service at no extra charge. Some require
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The new Disney Cruise Line promises to add another dimension
when its much-anticipated Disney Magic debuts July 30. Guests will
rotate each evening among three themed restaurants, described by
the line as offering, in turn, ``exquisite continental cuisine with
a French flair,'' ``the vibrant spices and flavors of the tropics''
and ``inventive cuisine with an international flair.``
</P>
<P>
   Just in case none of that appeals, an adults-only eatery will
feature Northern Italian fare.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Renaissance will soon launch two
684-passenger ships, and each will feature a steakhouse, an Italian
restaurant, a formal eatery with a focus on Continental cuisine and
a casual dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival surveys indicate that 75 percent of its passengers
prefer a casual alternative to the main dining room at breakfast
and lunch. Its new Seaview Bistros also offer specialty salads,
pastas, steaks and desserts in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Princess has introduced casual 24-hour cafes on some of its
fleet. Its new Grand Princess, currently the world's largest ship,
includes the first Southwestern-theme restaurant at sea. And when
Royal Caribbean International's even-bigger 130,000-ton Project
Eagle vessels debut starting next year, they will include 24-hour
sidewalk cafes and old-fashioned hamburger joints.
</P>
<P>
   Children are given special consideration, too. Most
family-oriented lines offer kids' menus at each meal; options
aboard Royal Caribbean ships may include Another One Bites the Dust
Pizza, Slam Dunk 'em Nuggets and Barbecue Sauce and Captain Hook's
Fish Fingers.
</P>
<P>
   And if Mom and Pop want to order from the kids' menu, they won't
be the first.
</P>
<P>
   Some cruise lines have published cookbooks available aboard
vessels:
</P>
<P>
   Among recipes in Princess Cruises Cuisine, a 144-page full-color
collection: paella Valenciana, tuna peppersteak, pork and apple
pie, lime-broiled squab and cinnamon scones.
</P>
<P>
   And from the 168-page full-color Carnival Creations: tequila
lime shrimp, baked mushroom crepes, oak smoked pork loin with
champagne cabbage and mango custard tart.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight buffets? Yes, they still exist on some ships. Primarily
the vessels with full-service health spas. And if you can't resist:
Just settle for the fruit salad with cottage cheese the next
morning at breakfast.

JUDGE RESTRICTS CALIFORNIA SPENDING BECAUSE OF BUDGET IMPASSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ With lawmakers and Gov. Pete Wilson stuck
in a partisan impasse over spending, a judge has barred California
from making payments to schools, prisons, the welfare system and
thousands of workers until either a budget or an interim spending
plan is approved.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien ordered the
state controller Tuesday to immediately cease all payments from the
treasury _ worth $4 billion in the next few weeks _ until the
Legislature and Wilson approved the spending.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said the state Constitution prohibited California from
spending money if no budget was enacted by the start of the fiscal
year, which began July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Without a budget, the judge said, payments can be made only if
the governor recommends and the Legislature adopts emergency
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling stunned the state Capitol, where Wilson and lawmakers
continue to disagree over the $75.8 billion spending plan. Wilson,
a Republican, wants a $3.6 billion tax cut, and Democratic leaders
in the Assembly seek a modest cut and more money for education.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, said
O'Brien's ruling was irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken literally, it means there could be no one to guard
people in state prisons. State parks would close in the middle of
the vacation season. And no one would answer the bell if a forest
fire breaks out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Controller Kathleen Connell, who was sued by the Howard
Jarvis Taxpayers Association to stop the payments, said she would
appeal the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the ruling added ``a sense of urgency to the budget
process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my hope it will provide the Legislature with an added
incentive to reach agreement on a responsible budget package,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the pressure,'' Villaraigosa said. ``We know what's at
stake here. There's not one of us who wants to hurt anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's ruling, O'Brien said that in order to comply with
federal labor laws, 250,000 state workers must be paid minimum wage
for work performed since July 1. But as of Wednesday morning,
O'Brien said, state workers cannot be paid a dime until the 1998-99
budget or emergency legislation is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employees would simply be volunteers,'' O'Brien wrote in
his four-page ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature already has approved interim spending for the
trial court system. And the state's 320,000 retirees are protected,
officials said, despite conflicting interpretations of Tuesday's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pension payments are not made from the state treasury, they
come from a separate fund,'' said CalPERS chief executive officer
James Burton. ``We expect retirement benefits to go out as usual at
the end of the month.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all agree with the judge that we are frustrated
with the budget process,'' Connell said. ``But the problem is, he
is directing his angst against individuals who are innocents and
who are simply bystanders in the budget war.''

&HT;        PRO-CHOICE CONGRESSMEN INTRODUCE ALTERNATIVE LATE-TERM
ABORTION BAN
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 22 -- A group of lawmakers who support abortion
rights introduced legislation Wednesday that they say goes farther
in banning late-term abortions than a ban passed by Congress and
vetoed by the President last year.
</P>
<P>
   The group, two Democrats and two Republicans, would outlaw all
abortions once the fetus can live outside the womb, or viability,
which most states have determined to be six months into a
pregnancy. The only exception would be if continuing with the
pregnancy endangered the mother's life or could seriously hurt her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that healthy women with healthy fetuses should
not have post-viability abortions,'' said Rep. Ellen Tauscher,
D-Walnut Creek, who cosponsored the bill along with Reps. Steny
Hoyer, D-Md., Jim Greenwood, R-Penn., and Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The bill introduction came as the House prepared to vote
Thursday on an override to the veto on the bill to ban so-called
partial-birth abortions. The House, which approved the ban by a
296-132 vote in October, is expected to have more than the
two-thirds majority necessary to overturn the veto. However, the
Senate, which passed the provision, 64-32, is expected to fall shy
of the necessary 67 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion advocates paint a graphic picture of the procedure
as the most gruesome form of abortion: a fetus is drawn down the
birth canal, feet first, and the doctor pierces the skull, aborting
the fetus before birth.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer, who introduced similar legislation during the last
Congress, said the partial-birth abortion bill only bans a single
procedure, while the replacement bill would ban all procedures
after the fetus is viable, except when ``in the medical judgement
of the attending physician, the abortion is necessary to preserve
the life of the woman or to avert serious adverse health
consequences to the woman,'' according to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my belief that (the partial-birth ban's) terms would not
prohibit the performance of a single abortion,'' Hoyer said. ``They
would simply be performed by a different procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Tauscher: ``The Republican leadership's partial-birth
abortion ban fails to fully address abortions performed
post-viability and overreaches by banning abortions
pre-viability.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say the health exemption would ``give abortionists
unfettered freedom'' to perform late-term abortions, said Rep.
Charles Canady, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The health exemption, Canady said, would include mental health
or psychological traumas, which effectively would provide an easy
loop-hole for any doctor who wanted to perform the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you allow that, obviously any abortion is permissible,''
said Canady. ``(The bill) is an unfortunate sham. It would do
nothing... For them to claim that their legislation would make more
meaningful restriction on abortion than the partial-birth abortion
ban is truly laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer said his bill is similar to late-term abortion bans in 41
states, including California. President Clinton, who passed a
similar law as Governor of Arkansas, supports the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bill contains an exception that will adequately protect
the lives and health of the small group of women in tragic
circumstances who need an abortion performed at a late stage of
pregnancy,'' Clinton wrote in a letter to Hoyer last March. ``At
the same time, your bill prohibits any late-term abortions
performed for reasons not related to the health or life of the
mother. This balance is an appropriate one.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to
Life Committee, said the bill also relies on the doctor to
determine whether the fetus is viable -- another provision that
could be used as a loophole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abortionist is given, under this bill, the untrammeled
authority to perform abortions any time he wants to,'' said
Johnson. ``It's as if Congress were to pass a law banning assault
weapons and giving the gun dealers the sole authority to determine
whether the gun is an assault weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tauscher said the whole debate on the partial-birth abortion
ban has been misguided from the beginning. Instead of arguing over
whether procedures should be banned, Congress should be working to
prevent unwanted pregnancies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to move this debate beyond procedure and beyond
rhetoric that is, frankly, false,'' said Tauscher. ``We need to
help the American people move to a place where we can prevent
unwanted pregnancies.''

 &HT;    BLAIR PLAN TO BOOST MASS TRANSIT CAUSES ROAD RAGE AMONG BRITISH
COMMUTERS
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Seeking to cool Britain's growing love affair with the
car, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government wants to entice
commuters onto buses and trains by improving transit service while
making it even more expensive to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which heralded the initiative as a ``new deal''
for commuters, wants to pry Britons from their cars by levying a
tax on workplace parking in congested city centers and charging new
tolls for using the roadways. The income -- estimated to be about
$1.6 billion by 2005 -- would be dedicated to improving bus
service.
</P>
<P>
   To ease morning drive time, the government also wants to
discourage parents from driving their children to school,
suggesting instead that they walk, take a bus or ride their bikes.
Officials hope to double the overall use of bicycles in six years.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Blair's Labour government departs from nearly two
decades of policy under the Conservative governments of Margaret
Thatcher and John Major that shifted bus and rail services to the
free market.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, road traffic has increased more than 25 percent,
with the number of car trips of less than five miles -- a worrisome
indicator for transportation planners -- increasing by about 10
percent. The goal is to persuade one in 10 drivers to forsake their
cars and to get the rest to use more buses, bikes and trains.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction from the masses -- many of them phoning
talk-radio shows Wednesday from their cars locked in dense motorway
traffic -- will sound familiar to American commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a system of buses, subways and commuter trains that
would shame most U.S. cities, the central complaint about shifting
to mass transit is that it doesn't go where people need it. Buses
and trains also conjure images of muggings and worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's crazy,'' said Marie Mills, a car-bound insurance
agent who drives to work alone every day.
</P>
<P>
   Mills is part of the problem the government is striving to
eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   It takes her about 40 minutes to drive from her home near
Gatwick International Airport to her office in suburban Surrey.
``If I took transit, it would take me two hours at least,'' Mills
said, her voiced laced with outrage. ``That's fine for Londoners,
they can just Tube it.'' The Tube is the common name for the London
subway system.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of gasoline already more than $4 a gallon, the
idea of making it more expensive to commute angers Mills. ``I spend
22 pounds (about $36) a week on petrol and another 150 pounds
(about $244) a year to use the car,'' she said. ``I can't afford to
pay more.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that specific parts of the plan will have to be voted on
by the Parliament, Opposition spokeswoman Gillian Shephard attacked
Blair for imposing extra taxes on road users and imposing more
bureaucracy and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Secretary John Prescott
said the measures were good -- if unpleasant -- medicine because
they would lead to cleaner air, less congestion and better mass
transit.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the government's enthusiasm for its proposals
Prescott employed language rarely associated with transportation
policy: ``After 20 years in the wilderness, this is the day
transport policy bursts into the the light of a new dawn,'' he
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   This new dawn should bring few new roads, he argued. ``To keep
up with demand, you would have to build a motorway 150 lanes wide
from London to Leeds,'' he said. That's a distance of about 200
miles.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy minister -- who is chauffeured to work in a Jaguar --
stressed that he is not anti-car. ``The car will remain an
important symbol of a prosperous, inclusive, mobile society,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But without action now, traffic on Britain's already crowded
roads would grow by 30 percent in the next 20 years. Carbon dioxide
emissions would increase 10 percent at a time when Britain is
required under a new international accord on global warming to cut
auto emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No change is frankly not an option,'' declared Prescott, who
also listed measures to improve the rail network, which has fallen
into public disfavor since being privatized.

NEW TEST SHOWS DISPARITIES IN LEARNING FOR NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Results of a new achievement test show startling
disparities between results for students who are fluent in English
and those who are not, providing fuel for critics who say the exam
is unfair to children with limited English proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   While the scores of English-fluent children are hardly stellar,
languishing just below the national average, scores of immigrant
children whose English comprehension is limited are stunningly low.
</P>
<P>
   In reading, 40 percent of all second-graders in the state scored
at or above the national average, compared to 15 percent of those
with limited proficiency in English. By the fifth grade, only 8
percent were at or above the national average in reading.
</P>
<P>
   In math, 43 percent of all 11th-graders met or surpassed the
national average, compared to 19 percent of students with limited
English skills.
</P>
<P>
   State schools chief Delaine Eastin, who was outspoken in her
opposition to giving an English-only test to students who have yet
to learn the language, said she was hardly surprised by the low
scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``California students who cannot read the test are clearly at a
disadvantage with those who can,'' Eastin said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4.1 million students tested this spring, nearly 800,000
were limited in their ability to read or speak English.
</P>
<P>
   These scores are but one part of a detailed report card that
offers the first look at student performance since 1994 and
compares most of California's students to their peers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, parents, teachers and the public will be
able to log onto the Internet to see individual school, district
and county scores, as well as statewide averages by grade and
subject. The results are posted on the Department of Education Web
site: www.cde.ca.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the Statewide Testing and Reporting (STAR) program
were to be published June 30. But a municipal judge issued a
temporary restraining order sought by the Oakland and Berkeley
schools that prohibited the state from releasing the scores of
students with limited English skills.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, San Francisco Superior Court Judge David Garcia
ruled the state could release scores of these students, but that
school districts could not use the scores in evaluating
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The state had previously released average scores of about 3
million English-fluent children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect all our students _ both limited-English-proficient
and all others _ to be academic achievers. This will require
additional blood, sweat and tears by educators, students, parents
and the community,'' Eastin said.
</P>
<P>
   The test was administered in English at the insistence of Gov.
Pete Wilson, who believed it would offer a comparison for future
years. Opponents, however, argued that testing students in a
language they don't understand violates state law, is
discriminatory and unjust.

<P>
   TOOL-CATALOG (Undated) _ Like Garrett Wade, Lee Valley,
Woodcraft and other high-end tool catalog businesses, Bridge City
Tool Works is digging for a bright, hard nugget within the
expanding $14 billion industry for woodworking tools, materials and
supplies. The vein of gold: the new, upscale, fine-woodworking
hobbyist, for whom extraordinary hand tools are like French cooking
knives or English gardening implements.

</P>
<P>
   NEWBURGH-LANDMARK (Newburgh, N.Y.) _ There were no suntanned,
silver-haired corporate angels on hand last week when Hillary
Rodham Clinton visited the Dutch Reformed Church here to talk about
historic preservation. Her backdrop was the derelict Greek Revival
temple by Alexander Jackson Davis, completed in 1835, once a
handsome symbol of the city's material progress and now an
evocative, camera-ready testament to urban decay.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-HOUSE (New Canaan, Conn.) _ The Glass House, that marvel
of the International Style, rests serenely on its grassy slope
here, behind a six-foot-wall of boulders, while controversy _ yet
again _ swirls around it. The tiny house was built almost 50 years
ago, designed by its owner, Philip Johnson; lauded by most critics,
denounced by a few neighbors. Over time, the architect gathered up
acreage and built a spate of accessory buildings, an assemblage
Johnson, 92, has deeded to the National Trust for Historic Places.
Now the Glass House has been swept up by a tempest in a parking
lot.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-SEATS (UNdated) _ Every time I board an airplane,
economy-class ticket in hand, I experience what I think of as the
Goldilocks Syndrome. I work my way down the crowded aisle past the
jumbo Papa Bear seats in first class, the more modest Mama Bear
seats in business class and back to the little bitty Baby Bear
seats in coach. Here the parallel with the fairy tale ends; no one
who flies coach would ever declare that these tightly packed seats
are ``just right.'' By Karrie Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   OLD-TOOLS (Undated) _ There's an indescribable quality that
radiates from old tools. You sense it in the hand-worn patina of
rosewood knobs and grips, the chiaroscuro of glinting brass levers
under darkened steel. But they are mute until you touch them. Then
they won't shut up. Pick up an old tool, and you almost hear the
ticking hours of its long working life. Such tools can be time
machines, portals to a yesteryear farther away than the moon. By
Jeff Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   NY-REALTY-WEB (New York) _ Do you want to know exactly how much
apartments are selling for in the building of your dreams? Want to
read about neighborhoods? The ten best views of Central Park? The
ten best water-tank enclosures? (Yeah, those things up on the
roof.) There's a new website where you don't have to buy anything,
and it's owners pledge not to bug you with unwanted calls and
``cookies,'' those secret little files that advertisers place on
your computer to follow you around. It's called www.nyrealty.com.
</P>
<P>
   SOLOMON-APARTMENT (New York) _ As the movers and shakers build
20,000-square-foot megamansions in the Hamptons and combine
apartments on Park Avenue in Manhattan, the art dealer Holly
Solomon is moving on down. Left behind: a nine-room apartment (plus
maids' rooms and two storage rooms) on Sutton Place. Present home:
a six-room apartment on the Upper East Side that seats six for
dinner. That may seem more than adequate for most people, but Ms.
Solomon used to give buffets for 100. By Elaine Louie.

was Friday, and I should have been tired. I had worked from dawn to
dusk. But no, I was strangely exuberant. Was it the pleasant
fragrance of honeysuckle in the air? Was it my energy bar snack
that afternoon? Or could it be that both of my beloved children
were spending the weekend with friends? Bingo! You get the cookie.

   HOUSTON _ The first thing you notice as you walk into the old
textile mill _ besides the dearth of air conditioning _ is the back
wall of the large, high-ceilinged front room. It's adorned with a
dozen stenciled suitcases, a word on each, composing Gustave
Flaubert's definition of metaphysics: ``One has no idea what it is,
but one laughs at it.'' This is just a small part of what you'll
find at Art Guys World Headquarters, the home, work space and
sometimes gallery of Jack Massing and Michael Galbreth,
better-known as the Art Guys, court jesters of the aesthetic
kingdom. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment

HOUSTON'S GONZO PERFORMANCE ARTISTS TURNS SUITS INTO A STATEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: ALL variant spellings of Art Guys are correct)
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON: and self-promotion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How to tell them apart? As one Web site says, one Art Guy is
shorter than the other; one is taller than the other. The shorter
one is Massing, and he also seems to be the more serious one,
although he's deadpan enough that it's never easy to tell when he's
pulling your leg. The taller one is Galbreth, who seems more
laid-back and breezy, although that's speaking in relative terms.
</P>
<P>
   These are, after all, artists whose projects have included
``Dining at Denny's: Food for Thought,'' during which the Aaart
Guyz spent 24 hours observing life at a 24-hour restaurant; ``Two
Grown Men Can't Pull It Apart,'' in which the Art Guis, inspired by
a newspaper ad, tried to pull apart objects ranging from a 2-by-4
to a freeway overpass; and ``Bucket Feet,'' during which the Artt
Gize walked 10 miles through Houston wearing buckets filled with
water.
</P>
<P>
   One of their best-known projects, ``1,000 Coats of Paint,'' is
being reprised on an Absolut Vodka billboard in Houston. Every day,
a fresh coat is added to the famous Absolut shape, which will
eventually be all but unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   All the oddball projects bring to mind the old joke about the
abstract artist who posted a note beside one of his paintings:
``Sure, you could do it _ but would you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of truth to that,'' Massing says. ``You know, `I
could have done that.' Well, sure you could do it, but would you
have the idea and the desire to do it? The actual inspiration for
it would have never crossed a lot of people's minds, until they see
the finished product.''
</P>
<P>
   Galbreth this time: ``I don't think there's anything, like the
billboard, that's difficult to understand about it. It's just like
a stunt. Jack was talking one day about how it's like the old stunt
where guys would sit on a flagpole for however many days _ it's
like that. It's like vaudevillian or carnivalesque.''
</P>
<P>
   They may be stunts, but the Absolut billboard and the ``Suits''
project have a common goal: blurring the lines between art,
advertising and commerce. It makes sense in a culture where
celebrity paintings grace credit cards, feature-film directors
indulge in TV commercials and artists such as Massing and Galbreth
spend almost as much time selling their creations as they do
creating them.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, many advertisers approached for ``Suits'' rejected the
idea. Massing and Galbreth, with no experience in ad sales, got
on-the-job training through cold calls and proposal letters sent to
various major (and not-so-major) corporations. The AArt GuYs
believe that out of the contacted companies, only about one in 10
leased space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would get a lot of form letters, and we started making
jokes that the proposals we were sending out would get sent to the
No Department,'' Galbreth says. ``We had this idea that big
companies like Coke or Nike had these whole departments that are
just, like, the `No' wing of Nike. Like this whole hallway of
people just typing out stuff, `No, no, no, no.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Galbreth says that the companies that get the idea, really get
it. Which brings up another question: Does Houston get it?
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I don't really know,'' Galbreth says.
``I think what's really helped, as far as the parade and
everything, is the poster that was printed. I think it's a
particularly handsome thing, and it's fun and unusual and wacky.
... As far as the project itself, what people think of the project,
I think the truth of the matter is that most people don't know that
much about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that after the parade, people will know. The 'eart
Guys plan a series of spinoff projects, ranging from exhibits of
the rejection letters to a book, a documentary video and a music
video. Although they haven't decided which band to work with, they
perk up when rejuvenated robot-rock groups such as Devo and
Kraftwerk are mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you look at it, ``Suits'' is the biggest project
the Guys have taken on since they formed their partnership more
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be the Titanic of the art world,''
Galbreth says. ``I like to think about making money off a sinking
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   You can also find out more about the Art Guys on their Web site,
www.theartguys.com; updates on the ``Suits'' project are also
available on the Web at Houston Sidewalk, houston.sidewalk.com.

HOUSTON'S GONZO PERFORMANCE ARTISTS TURNS SUITS INTO A STATEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 Takes)-TEX 
(EDS: ALL variant spellings of Art Guys are correct) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The first thing you notice as you walk into the old
textile mill _ besides the dearth of air conditioning _ is the back
wall of the large, high-ceilinged front room. It's adorned with a
dozen stenciled suitcases, a word on each, composing Gustave
Flaubert's definition of metaphysics: ``One has no idea what it is,
but one laughs at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitting. One might not have any idea what this building is doing
among the early-1900s houses of Houston's historic Heights
district, but one can't help but at least smile at it, and what
follows: In what amounts to the living room is a five-light lamp
made out of plumbing pipe and old garden-sprinkler cans. Next to
the dining-room table stands a 5-foot-tall, bullet-shaped sculpture
made from Corona beer bottles, a fraternity-boy tower taken to its
logical extreme.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a small part of what you'll find at Art Guys World
Headquarters, the home, work space and sometimes gallery of Jack
Massing and Michael Galbreth, better-known as the Art Guys, court
jesters of the aesthetic kingdom. That they work out of the old
mill _ which they share with a 12-year-old shepherd mix named Cleo,
a cat named Phranque and a project assistant named Kelly ``Tigger''
Schexnayder _ is curiously appropriate, considering that their
latest project is called ``Suits: Clothes Make the Man.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the ``gallery'' will be the Art Guys' bodies.
The suits, designed by Todd Oldham, feature more than 50 spaces for
advertising logos. Massing and Galbreth have spent nearly a year
soliciting advertisers to fill the spaces, which cost from $2,000
to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Art Guys debut the suits at a parade at 7 p.m.
Saturday in Houston, the suits will look like the outfield wall of
a minor-league baseball stadium, plastered with logos from Altoids,
Target, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and a host of others. And yes, the
parade will consist solely of Massing and Galbreth, who will wear
the suits at various gallery openings and public appearances
throughout the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the guys weren't premiering the suits on a hot, sticky
July day in downtown Houston, the big question would still be: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're acquiescing to the fact that you can find advertising
anywhere,'' Massing says while awaiting an order of burritos
especiales at a Mexican restaurant near Art Guys World
Headquarters. ``Not necessarily in a `giving up' way, but more in a
celebration of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Galbreth interjects _ like many duos who work together,
the Art Guys aren't always exactly of the same mind (for instance,
Galbreth orders tacos al carbon). ``I still don't consider it a
celebration,'' he says. ``Actually, it's an acknowledgment. ... I
don't see advertising and how it dominates our culture as
necessarily good. I don't necessarily see it as bad, either. But I
do see it as necessarily there.''
</P>
<P>
   Massing's turn: ``When I was a kid, I had a jean jacket that I
put a lot of patches on, and I thought that was really cool, so I
was celebrating the fact that I was collecting these patches,'' he
says. ``So it's kind of interesting comparatively to that; and when
you think of the NASCAR drivers or the bass fisherman, they're just
covered with all that stuff, and it's cool. It's cool to be a bass
fisherman and have all those sort of patches on. So I see it as a
celebration very much.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of interplay is typical of the Art Guise (not only do
they say the spelling is unimportant, Massing says that recent
journalistic attempts at consistency are ``kind of irritating'').
Their mix of creativity and whimsy inspires comparisons with other
offbeat duos such as gonzo magicians Penn &AMP; Teller or ``South
Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, probably with a bit of
the quirky Coen Brothers filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Massing, 39, and Galbreth, 42, began working together as
students at the University of Houston in 1982; they soon discovered
that their collaborative projects overshadowed their individual
works. They sealed their partnership in 1983, when they dipped
their hands in buckets of paint and then shook hands to seal the
deal, naming themselves the Art Guys after a friend who called
himself a ``hungry guy'' when he was hungry and a ``sleepy guy''
when he was sleepy. They support themselves through their works _
for example, a Corona sculpture can sell for as much as $2,400 _
and, as their latest project indicates, aggressive marketing and
self-promotion. MORE &QL;

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY SPENDS MILLIONS ON UNION ACTIVITIES, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Social Security Administration spends millions
of dollars a year to pay employees who spend all or most of their
time on union activities, the agency's inspector general told a
House panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Inspector General James G. Huse Jr., told the Ways and
Means subcommittee on Social Security that the agency needs to keep
better track of union activity. He said almost half the Social
Security field managers in a survey conducted last year did know
know which employees represented a union.
</P>
<P>
   The report came on the first of three days of hearings by the
subcommittee exploring what chairman Jim Bunning, R-Ky., described
as an abuse of taxpayer money: allowing union activities to be paid
for by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report identified 145 Social Security
employees as working full-time on union activities and another
1,655 employees who worked up to 75 percent of their time on union
activities. They cost $13.4 million in salaries and $1.3 million in
office space and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A 1978 law allows federal employee union representatives to use
official time for activities such as representing members involved
in grievance disputes with supervisors. About 52,000 Social
Security employees are covered by unions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have targeted the 20-year-old law for
change and Bunning's three days of hearings are designed to
highlight their objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is outrageous and it's wrong for people on the
public payroll to work for someone else,'' Bunning said. ``People
who are paid by the taxpayers should work for the taxpayers.
Instead, what we have here is a bunch of 'no shows,' 'go slows,'
and 'who the hell knows.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But under questioning from Democratic members, Huse said there
was nothing in his report to support Bunning's statement. Huse said
the report merely looked at the Social Security Administration's
procedures for accounting for union time _ which he said could be
improved _ rather than the question of whether employees should
conduct union activities during their official time.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic members argued that having union members in the work
force engaged full time on union activities is a common practice
among large businesses and most city and state governments because
it helps reduce the instances of grievance cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we talking about something that really is not there ...
and this is much ado about not too much?'' said Rep. Barbara
Kennelly, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby L. Harnage Sr., president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, which represents most of the Social Security
workers, issued a written statement accusing Bunning _ a candidate
for the U.S. Senate in Kentucky _ of trying to use the hearings
``as little more than a platform to lift his low public opinion
ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Harnage noted that time spent by union representatives on union
activities is not take out of the Social Security Trust Fund.
Instead, that money comes out of general federal revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The union has been invited to participate on Friday, the third
day of the hearings.

DEAD MEN HAWKING: CATALOGS ARE TIED TO LATE GREATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just weeks after Tommy Hilfiger's portfolio of primary-colored
towels and preppie print sheets crossed the desk, so did a catalog
for the Claude Monet Collection of artificial flowers. As if that
wasn't weird enough, it was followed by a catalog of Louis XV
furniture reproductions, ``Patines Anciennes,'' written in French
with English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy, Claude and Louis; who's next? Evita and Marie Antoinette?
Pablo and Cristobal (that would be Picasso and Balenciaga to you).
</P>
<P>
   With homeware collections racking up the big bucks, it should
probably come as no surprise that old, old artists and style-makers
are being resurrected. And perhaps they should be. With no designer
present, decorating themes seem to run to cartoon cows; with Monet,
even in absentia, the finished products are sumptuous arrangements
of synthetic irises or water lilies. Fake flowers may not be to
Monet's taste, but we'll never know. Dead designers don't cop an
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Louis XV might not recognize the chair upholstered in happy
yellow fabric with blue bows, but the silhouette has his Roman
numerals all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's collection is just as easy to recognize. It shrieks East
Coast with a country club accent. The Hilfiger homewares of
bedding, bath and accessories have names: Greenwich, Club Classics
and Varsity. They all look as if they were hand-stitched by the
Seven Sisters for graduation presents.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's style appeals to the pre-collegiate generation today.
Next month or next year, that may not be the case. All the Louises
_ XIV, XV and XVI _ have staying power; they've been hot for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be surprised to find more and more collections based on
the styles of the deceased. The dead do not become passe as quickly
as the living.
</P>
<P>
   THE SMALL PRINT: The Claude Monet Collection catalog is
available from Masterpiece Gardens, 90 Novner Drive, Cincinnati,
Ohio 45215, or www.monetgiverny.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patines Anciennes'' is available for $5 through South Side
Imports, 3553 N. Dixie Highway, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33334, (954)
567-0337.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger homewares are available at department stores
nationwide.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple was certainly ``thinking different'' when it created the
iMac. The new personal computer, which goes on sale on Aug. 15, has
already won popular acclaim for its creative design and its
refreshing departure from the computer industry standard of boring
beige boxes.
</P>
<P>
   By rushing the iMac to market, Apple succeeded in getting on the
radar screens of buyers before the next school year starts. There
is a pent-up demand among owners of older Macintoshes for an
affordable upgrade, and Apple is expected to sell all the iMacs it
can make in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   But the iMac (pronounced eye-Mac _ the ``i'' stands for
Internet) also departs from computer industry standards in other
ways, and customers will have to decide whether different means
better. Based on observations of the iMac at the recent Macworld
computer trade show and discussions with Apple executives, a few
things are clear.
</P>
<P>
   First, the obvious: It looks different.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac combines the computer and the monitor in one unit that
brings to mind a beach ball, making it, in effect, an updated
version of the original one-piece Macintosh. That makes the iMac
ideal for those who want to conserve desk space. The drawback of
such a design is that people are locked into using the iMac's
15-inch screen, measured diagonally (with a 13.8-inch viewable
area), when the trend in the industry is to move to larger screens
and flat panel displays that are even better at conserving space.
But the iMac screen is one of the best 15-inch displays available.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is housed in a translucent, two-tone plastic case that
is aqua and white. Apple's industrial designers describe the colors
as Bondi Blue and Ice. The iMac's chief industrial designer, a New
Zealander, said the diaphanous blue-green color reminded him of the
water off Bondi Beach near Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse, the keyboard and even the power cable are
translucent, too. The mouse is round, like a hockey puck.
</P>
<P>
   Sources who say they have seen prototypes of other Apple
computers report that the company may be thinking of adding
translucence to desktop machines later this year. Although some
reports say the new desktop systems will be smoky black, others
describe the color as a translucent midnight blue, the same color
Apple used in its new translucent Studio Display monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a statement that Apple is being bold and daring, and it
is consistent with the Apple tradition,'' said Dave Tremblay, a
senior analyst for Computer Intelligence, a market research company
in San Diego, and a former Apple executive. ``But so is not
including a floppy disk and giving people a choice of only one
monitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because the plastic is see-through does not mean it is
fragile. For the iMac case, Apple used a polycarbonate composite
that is also used to make bulletproof glass. ``It's the toughest
computer we've ever built,'' said Tom Bogar, the iMac product
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Apple executives discouraged speculation about alternate color
schemes for the iMac, saying that for manufacturing reasons, it was
unlikely to go beyond Bondi Blue and Ice in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac also acts different from most computers. Like all
current Macintoshes, it uses the Mac OS 8.1 operating system
software, which is incompatible with more than 90 percent of all
other computers. The Mac OS still sets the standard for ease of use
and innovation, and it is arguably a superior choice for the
consumer and education audience that Apple hopes to impress with
the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Apple is confident that the iMac will stop these people from
switching to the Windows operating system, but others are less
certain that the iMac will be sufficient to win users back from
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger question is whether the iMac can actually translate
into getting new computer users,'' said Tim Bajarin, president of
Creative Strategies International, a consulting company in San
Jose, Calif. ``Our gut feeling is that it doesn't have a lot of
support from the brand-new user.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``You still have the problem that there is not enough Mac
software,'' Bajarin said. ``As great as I think the iMac is, this
software issue is going to plague Apple for an eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Apple persuaded some national and regional
computer stores, like CompUSA, to address the problem by setting up
special Macintosh software and hardware centers within the stores.
But the larger problem is that many software developers have
abandoned the Mac for the bigger and more lucrative Windows market.
</P>
<P>
   Apple said recently that software developers had announced plans
for more than 170 new software titles for the Macintosh since the
iMac was introduced in May. But Apple did not respond to repeated
requests for a list of the new programs, and many may be upgrades
of older Mac programs or Windows programs rewritten for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac works different in other ways, too.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Apple's interim chief executive, Steve Jobs, has consistently
displayed an unconventional attitude toward data storage. It was
Jobs who decided that the original Macintosh computer did not need
a hard disk drive. (One was added later.) After he was ousted by
Apple, he created a stylish computer called the ext cube, which
made its debut with an oddball optical-storage drive. While the
Next computer definitely scored style points, it eventually
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jobs is back, and the storage quirks continue. The iMac has
a modest hard disk drive (four gigabytes, half the capacity of many
new computers), but it lacks a built-in floppy disk drive or other
removable media, like disks, for backing up files. A few customers
may be able to work effectively without some way to transport data
physically, either by backing up files to a network server or to
the Internet, but most of the consumers Apple is trying to appeal
to live in a world where floppy disks are important.
</P>
<P>
   Apple contends that the 1.44-megabyte, 3.5-inch disk drive is a
thing of the past and that putting one in the iMac would have made
it last year's machine instead of next year's.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Apple left a hole called a Universal Serial Bus port
that allows a customer to attach storage devices to the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   There are, or will be by the end of the year, several disk
candidates for the USB ports, including a conventional floppy disk
drive; a high-capacity cartridge drive, like a Zip or Sparq; a
high-capacity Superdisk drive that stores 120 megabytes on a
cartridge but that also works with today's 1.44-megabyte disks, or
even a rewritable CD-RW drive.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the industry have doubts about the decision not to
include a floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those silly little floppy drives still perform a useful
function,'' said James Porter, president of Disk/Trend, a market
research company in Mountain View, Calif. ``People still use floppy
disks to move files around between home and office, between members
of a work group and to make copies of documents and projects.
</P>
<P>
   Ray A. Meifert, director of the Superdisk business at the
Imation Corp. of Oakdale, Minn., said his company sold between 600
million and 700 million 1.44-megabyte disks last year, out of a
total worldwide production of more than 4 billion disks.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, Jobs decreed that the iMac should have no
conventional printer port. The parallel and Apple Talk ports that
act as the connection points for most Macintosh printers today are
also gone, replaced by a USB connector.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that there are not many USB-specific printers
around, especially for the Macintosh. There will be soon, but for
now, anyone who wants to print documents, artwork or photographs
must send them to a printer over a network or pay $70 or so for an
adapter to connect an existing parallel-style printer to the iMac's
USB port.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, whose Deskjet ink-jet printers are the most
popular brand on the market, says that Macintosh USB adapters will
be available only for the Deskjet 670 and 690 series, so customers
who own other models are out of luck for now. A company spokesman
said a new line of USB-direct printers would be released ``in
time.'' Many printer makers are expected to introduce USB printers
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   This is a double whammy because there is no way to take a disk
from the iMac and use it to print on someone else's machine.
</P>
<P>
   At a suggested price of $1,299, the iMac is Apple's first
attempt in years to compete in the hotly competitive market for
consumer computers. Because of the floppy disk and printer issues,
however, a more realistic price for the iMac is actually closer to
$1,500, more expensive than some comparable Windows machines, but
then, one can also argue that the Mac deserves to cost more because
it is more technically elegant and easier to use than a Windows
machine. It's a consumer's choice.

   It's hard for Michael Redd to say just when doing one thing at a
time became so deeply dissatisfying. His ratings with customers
have certainly soared since he started responding to their e-mail
as soon as it chimes in, no matter if he is on the phone or eating
lunch or poring over a spreadsheet on some other screen.
</P>
<P>
   But his fondness for multitasking is not limited to the
workplace. Redd, 30, a manager at McDonald's corporate office in
Oak Ridge, Ill., is happiest when his attention is most divided,
like on a recent weekend afternoon when he watched a movie on
television while talking to his sister and writing on his laptop.
During commercial breaks, he flipped through his CD jukebox with a
remote control, searching for a song whose name he had forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to be able to do many things at once all the time,''
Redd said. ``This may sound strange, but it makes me feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it doesn't sound so strange. Multitasking _ the word
describes how a microprocessor keeps lots of computer programs
running at the same time _ has lately become a way of life for many
Americans. Inundated with more information than ever before and _
perhaps perversely _ prone to equate productivity with pleasure,
many people are quietly adapting the rhythms of their own behavior
to match that of their machines.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the number of tasks to which people are
simultaneously applying themselves is multiplying like some mutant
breed of postmodern rabbit. The shift is driven by the seductive
suggestion implicit in the latest high-tech tools that they can be
used not only for the pedestrian purposes of communication and
information retrieval but also to swindle time.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Redd, thrill to the challenge of prying more minutes
out of a day. Others decry the increasing fragmentation of mind and
soul that the technology seems to demand. But as the trill of
cellular phones and beepers and signals for arriving e-mail have
grown more persistent, they have also become harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be as focused,'' said Adam Gwosdof, 31. When Gwosdof
uses pay phones, he finds a bank of them where he can monopolize
two lines at once _ one to listen to his messages and one to call
the people who have left them. ``You feel like you're always trying
to conceal the amount of tasks you're juggling,'' he said. ``It
does create a real anxiety, and it's hard sometimes to even put
your finger on what it is. It's knowing I can't ever be done or
shut things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwosdof runs a database design business in Manhattan and often
finds himself being paged by one client while meeting with another
and using the Internet to check on a third. He prefers to work on
five projects at once so he can plug gaps of time that might
otherwise be wasted. He insists that he can scan Internet
newsgroups ``subconsciously'' while he talks to friends on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   But Gwosdof has recently been rethinking the way his life is
structured. He attended a seminar on time management, although he
arrived late and left early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just jump back and forth hundreds of times without it
taking a toll on the psyche,'' he said, returning a reporter's page
by using, he said, just one pay phone.
</P>
<P>
   Inherently elastic and often covert, the true extent of human
multitasking is difficult to measure, but anecdotal evidence
abounds. ``You know what, I have to go out, but I can do this from
my car,'' said Toby Crabel, 43, preparing to respond to a
reporter's inquiry on the subject. ``I'll call you back in three
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabel credits technology with allowing him to run a hedge fund
out of his house in the middle of some cornfields northwest of
Milwaukee. He has programmed his network of computers so that when
he is reading to his daughter Kira, 8, he can be prompted by a
digitized female voice that it is time to buy Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says the average office user of Windows 95 has more
than three programs running at a time. At home, more than 10
million American households now have a television and a personal
computer in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not new, but it is accelerating,'' said John Robinson,
director of a project at the University of Maryland devoted to
gauging Americans' use of time. ``You can't expand time, so what
you try to do is deepen time by doing more things in the same
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Less clear is multitasking's effects on the people who do it and
those around them.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the argument that erupts at least once a day between
David Kohn and his fiancee, Natasha Lesser, who confer by phone
from their respective Manhattan offices on such issues as what to
have for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the clicking sound that sets me off,'' said Kohn, 31.
``Then she starts pausing between words.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lesser, 29, an editor at Fodor's Travel Publications, said
she has tried to restrain herself since it bothers him so much, but
the fact is she has a lot of work to do. ``Some of the things I
have to do don't require me to think, so I feel, why can't I talk
and do them at the same time? Otherwise I'd be here till 10 at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it entirely clear whether Kohn, who sits in front of a
bank of 16 televisions and a computer with a high-speed connection
to the Internet for his job as a producer for the CBS Web site, is
always as unwaveringly riveted to his conversations with Ms. Lesser
as he makes out.
</P>
<P>
   The couple are still planning to get married in October. But
both agree it is an ongoing problem. ``We have discussed it,'' Kohn
said. ``At length.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Americans are renowned for being obsessed with time,
and multitasking was a time-honored human behavior well before
Alt-Tab could zip you between, say, writing a newspaper article and
reading up on a New York Police Department sex scandal in nary a
microsecond.
</P>
<P>
   Women have long known about multitasking, as in the old song
about bringing home the bacon, frying it up in a pan and never,
ever letting you forget you're a man. Some men have demonstrated a
capacity to walk and chew gum at the same time. Others have not.
</P>
<P>
   What is different now, modern multitaskers observe, is how
closely human conduct is tied to our technological tools,
particularly to the PC. The tasks we find ourselves attending to,
however briefly, are often determined by what pops up on our
screen.
</P>
<P>
   On either a PC or Macintosh, windows of one sort or another beg
for us to open them. And since our computer manages to keep them
all humming at the same time, why shouldn't we?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, computers do not actually do more than one thing
at once. The genesis of computer multitasking was in the early
1960s, when John McCarthy, who was then a computer scientist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, suggested that instead of
one person at a time feeding data from punch cards into a
mainframe, 50 people could use the mainframe simultaneously. Every
time a different user entered a command, the machine would stop
what it was doing, store it, perform the new task _ for perhaps a
millisecond _ and so on.

CREATIVE COOKING REQUIRES SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of those hot summer nights, the kind when the
crickets chirp mournfully, as if they have no place to go. The moon
was full, and the sky was filled with galaxies of glitter. It was
Friday, and I should have been tired. I had worked from dawn to
dusk. But no, I was strangely exuberant. Was it the pleasant
fragrance of honeysuckle in the air? Was it my energy bar snack
that afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   Or could it be that both of my beloved children were spending
the weekend with friends? Bingo! You get the cookie.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I felt so great about this minivacation that I decided
to cook! Yes, no one was more surprised than me by this impulse.
``Moi'' cook on a Friday with no one home but my husband? Someone
call a doctor; this might be serious. But yes, I did it. I prepared
a delicious, nutritious meal and served it by candlelight on
Grandma's china. We even had a rose-colored drink in the
long-stemmed, crystal glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, we didn't have any fellow diners because the other two
glasses in the set are broken, and even his glass had a chip on the
rim. My husband was thrilled when he arrived home from work and
smelled food. I had planned on having some soft music playing, but
after we sat down to eat, I was too tired to walk over to the
radio. I just hummed while we ate.
</P>
<P>
   Honey Bunny stared at his meal with a puzzled expression, and I
could tell he was trying to find a diplomatic way to ask me, ``What
on earth have you done here?''
</P>
<P>
   See, I started the meal by heating up the leftover pork chops
while I took a shower. When I went to the refrigerator, there
wasn't much in there, so I had to make do with what I had. Going to
the grocery store was simply out of the question. That could wait
until Sunday, when the kids came home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this yogurt?'' he asked. ``What are these hard lumps?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked so ugly when I put it in that glass bowl, I put some
grapes on top of it to add a little color, but unfortunately the
grapes sank to the bottom. That's why I turned off the lights and
lit the candles. I guess you noticed anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see. Well, that's OK. It tastes uh, it's, it's very unique,
Honey.''
</P>
<P>
   I realized that I had overheated the pork chops when he went and
got his hacksaw from the garage. I thought the sweet and sour sauce
would make them moist. Guess I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The bagel was a hit though.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and patted my hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a bagel with cream cheese, yogurt, and pork
chops for dinner before. This is so, uh, uh, creative. Do we have
any more of that beverage? Just get me a big mug full, will ya?
This wine glass is chipped. I think my lip is bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   So I'm not Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   We were out of bread, and the pantry was bare. It was leftover
pork chops, yogurt and bagels or Vienna sausages, instant Cream of
Wheat and freezer-burned waffles. Decisions, decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, my husband hung up the telephone abruptly as I
walked into the bedroom. Was it my imagination, or did I hear him
say, ``Son, please come home tomorrow; I hate cream of wheat?''
</P>

 UNDATED: so on.

<P>
   ``The radical idea was that you could work at your own desk
because the machine could tolerate constant interruption,'' said
McCarthy, now a professor emeritus at Stanford University. ``Even
in those days, the machine could handle 100 instructions in 2.4
milliseconds so it was just a question of doing the arithmetic.''
</P>
<P>
   When mainframes shrank into PCs in the early 1980s, multitasking
was temporarily forsaken. Until fairly recently, the most widely
used computer operating systems did not allow more than one program
to run at a time. But today PCs work on the same principle as the
time-sharing schemes for the mainframe, albeit with only one user
issuing many commands.
</P>
<P>
   So while your computer seems to be downloading e-mail,
spell-checking and playing solitaire with you at the same time, it
is in fact doing each of them serially. It is, however, doing them
really, really fast.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively slow computer with a 100-megahertz processor can
execute a million instructions between each pair of keystrokes by a
very fast typist. And while a context switch _ the computer term
for saving one program in its current state while tending to
another _ requires a significant chunk of processing power,
computers seem better able to weather the psychological toll of
constant interruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``They switch faster than we do,'' said Earl Hunt, a professor
of psychology and computer science at the University of Washington.
``It's hard to get around the forebrain bottleneck.'' It seems that
although people can do some highly practiced tasks simultaneously,
like juggling and riding a unicycle, in general they can pay
attention to only one thing at a time without overtaxing short-term
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our brains function the same way the Cro-Magnon brains did so
technology isn't going to change that,'' Hunt said. ``You can do
several tasks at once, but not all of them get done as well. That
is why I feel that car phones are a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all jobs need to be done as well as others. One
of the joys of multitasking, and perhaps one of its perils, is that
it allows the blending of work and leisure in a way that was not
possible before. Many multitaskers describe a sense of well-being
that comes from the variety of tasks they are performing and the
control they feel they exercise over which one comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Ullman, author of ``Close to the Machine,'' about her life
as a programmer, said she had tried to stop herself from sliding
into the back-and-forth of multitasking on her computer at the
expense of the softer-focus shifting of levels of attention more
natural for humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever watched someone who is a mother talk on the
phone, feed the dog, bounce the baby, it's just astounding to see
someone manage more or less well to do all those things,'' Ms.
Ullman said. ``But on a computer, multitasking is really binary.
The task is either in the foreground or it's not. And now we are
beginning to emulate the coarse-grain multitasking of computers
that is a poor imitation of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that multitasking depends on a certain prowess at
filtering huge amounts of information without actually absorbing
all of it, there is reason to believe that a generation that is
growing up watching ``Celebrity Death Match'' on MTV while
instant-messaging one another on America Online may be better at it
than their elders. Observing the awesome multitasking skills of the
younger traders at Banker's Trust, Mark Prensky, a vice president
there, has advocated a new management approach for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are really good at processing information from lots
of different sources and you don't give it to them, you stifle
them,'' said Prensky, an avid multitasker himself. ``I think it's a
real sea change. We should understand it first and then use it to
our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jai Mani, 11, in Manhattan, it's all a bit simpler. The urge
to multitask is like ``a craving for food.''
</P>
<P>
   When he gets home from rollerblading camp, he wants to do three
things. ``Instead of listening to music for 30 minutes, watching TV
for 30 minutes and checking your e-mail for 30 minutes, you can do
them all at the same time,'' said Jai, who has been known to watch
television and keep an eye on his computer game in the high-gloss
reflection of the piano while having a lesson. ``It's just easier
that way.''

THE CLINTON-NIXON PARALLEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 26)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Unanimous?'' asked a confused and concerned
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unanimous,'' replied Alexander Haig. ``There is no air in it
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None at all,'' queried Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tight as a drum,'' said Haig.
</P>
<P>
   The event that sparked that brief colloquy between the president
and the general who served as his chief of staff on July 24, 1974,
in San Clemente, Calif., was the Supreme Court's unanimous ruling
saying Nixon had to forfeit tapes of private White House
conversations to Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day Nixon telephoned Washington to inform White House
Special Counsel Fred Buzhardt that ``there might be a problem with
the June 23d tape,'' which had been recorded in his office six days
after the break-in at the Democratic National Committee
headquarters in the Watergate complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate scandal that had haunted Nixon for two years was
closing in on him swiftly and ominously _ and he knew it. The
coverup had lost its cover.
</P>
<P>
   Once the June 23 tape was made public, it would inform Jaworski,
Federal Judge John Sirica, Congress and the world that the
president had sought to use the CIA to block the FBI's
investigation of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   When that happened, numerous Republicans in the House and Senate
who had stood by the president realized his guilt and withdrew
their loyalty to the him.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Supreme Court ruling, the House Judiciary
Committee approved its first article of impeachment, accusing Nixon
of obstruction of justice in trying to cover up Watergate. On Aug.
9, 16 days after the court's ruling, Nixon resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater had informed the president that
there were ample Republican and Democratic votes in the Senate to
convict him.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of history is resurrected at this time because another
presidential career may be as endangered as Nixon's was 24 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   We have no concrete evidence that Bill Clinton is guilty of any
crime, and it seems ludicrous to many Americans that so much time
and money would be spent trying to determine whether he lied when
he testified under oath that he did not have sex with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But it is inevitable that a parallel will be drawn between the
Supreme Court's momentous ruling against Nixon and Chief Justice
William Rehnquist's decision July 17 to permit testimony of Secret
Service agents before Kenneth Starr's grand jury investigating the
current president.
</P>
<P>
   After conferring with some of his colleagues, Rehnquist declared
that the Supreme Court would not overrule a federal appeals court's
decree that there is no legal basis for the exclusion in a criminal
case of the testimony of Secret Service agents, despite their
intimate relationship with the president and their need for close
proximity to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bit of irony in the chief justice's decision. When
the court ruled on the Nixon tapes, Rehnquist, then an associate
justice, disqualified himself because he had served as an assistant
attorney general in the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   Because of him the court's ruling in 1974 was 8 to 0 rather than
9 to 0.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clinton has conducted himself with far more restraint
than Nixon, who made several impulsive and misguided moves in an
effort to cover his tracks and those of his political associates.
</P>
<P>
   When Jaworski's predecessor as Watergate special prosecutor,
Archibald Cox, refused to yield on his demand for the tapes, Nixon
ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire him. Outraged by
Nixon's action, Richardson refused and submitted his own
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus also refused to fire
Cox. He in turn was fired by Nixon. Finally, Solicitor General
Robert Bork, the No. 3 man in the Justice Department, decreed an
end to Cox's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The date was Oct. 20, 1973 and that sequence of events was the
infamous ``Saturday Night Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, nothing quite that explosive has happened in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   We can debate endlessly the wisdom of the action taken by the
appeals court and Rehnquist. Having covered the White House during
several presidencies and having known and respected numerous Secret
Service agents, I cannot help putting great stock in their
contention that in being forced to testify, they could break faith
with the president and rupture a relationship that is vital to
protection of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we know from the Watergate experience that a president in
trouble will grasp at any life preserver to keep himself afloat. If
a Secret Service agent witnesses a criminal act, he or she has a
responsibility to report it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law covering this matter. But as Utah's Orrin Hatch,
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has suggested, Congress
should consider next year establishing guidelines for the testimony
of Secret Service agents. Those rules should protect the
confidentiality necessary between the president and his bodyguards
while also making clear that those agents have a responsibility to
divulge pertinent information regarding criminal acts.

Tool Works is digging for a bright, hard nugget within the
expanding $14 billion industry for woodworking tools, materials and
supplies. The vein of gold: the new, upscale, fine-woodworking
hobbyist, for whom extraordinary hand tools are like French cooking
knives or English gardening implements.

   NEWBURGH-LANDMARK (Newburgh, N.Y.) _ There were no suntanned,
silver-haired corporate angels on hand last week when Hillary
Rodham Clinton visited the Dutch Reformed Church here to talk about
historic preservation. Her backdrop was the derelict Greek Revival
temple by Alexander Jackson Davis, completed in 1835, once a
handsome symbol of the city's material progress and now an
evocative, camera-ready testament to urban decay.

<P>
   GLASS-HOUSE (New Canaan, Conn.) _ The Glass House, that marvel
of the International Style, rests serenely on its grassy slope
here, behind a six-foot-wall of boulders, while controversy _ yet
again _ swirls around it. The tiny house was built almost 50 years
ago, designed by its owner, Philip Johnson; lauded by most critics,
denounced by a few neighbors. Over time, the architect gathered up
acreage and built a spate of accessory buildings, an assemblage
Johnson, 92, has deeded to the National Trust for Historic Places.
Now the Glass House has been swept up by a tempest in a parking
lot.

   AIRLINE-SEATS (UNdated) _ Every time I board an airplane,
economy-class ticket in hand, I experience what I think of as the
Goldilocks Syndrome. I work my way down the crowded aisle past the

seats in business class and back to the little bitty Baby Bear
seats in coach. Here the parallel with the fairy tale ends; no one
who flies coach would ever declare that these tightly packed seats
are ``just right.'' By Karrie Jacobs.

<P>
   OLD-TOOLS (Undated) _ There's an indescribable quality that
radiates from old tools. You sense it in the hand-worn patina of
rosewood knobs and grips, the chiaroscuro of glinting brass levers
under darkened steel. But they are mute until you touch them. Then
they won't shut up. Pick up an old tool, and you almost hear the
ticking hours of its long working life. Such tools can be time
machines, portals to a yesteryear farther away than the moon. By
Jeff Taylor.

roof.) There's a new website where you don't have to buy anything,
and it's owners pledge not to bug you with unwanted calls and
``cookies,'' those secret little files that advertisers place on

   SOLOMON-APARTMENT (New York) _ As the movers and shakers build
20,000-square-foot megamansions in the Hamptons and combine
apartments on Park Avenue in Manhattan, the art dealer Holly
Solomon is moving on down. Left behind: a nine-room apartment (plus
maids' rooms and two storage rooms) on Sutton Place. Present home:

ID NUMBER PART OF HEALTH PLAN THAT WE DON'T NEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been nearly five years since President Clinton delivered
that much-anticipated speech unveiling his ambitious plan for
overhauling the U.S. health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   The speech is long forgotten. The plan is long gone, although
its architects are constantly rummaging through the debris in the
hope of rescuing scraps from the trash heap of history.
</P>
<P>
   One such scrap is the lifetime health-care ID number, a proposal
that became a mandate when Clinton signed the 1996 Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act. This law requires that every
American be assigned an ``identifier'' that would facilitate
electronic collection and storage of medical information.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill was passed, everybody was talking about how it
would help folks keep their health insurance when they lose a job
or change employers. Hardly anyone mentioned the obscure provision
about health-care identifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's time to implement such a system, however, it's
suddenly a matter of widespread controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The debate stems from the possibility that a government-mandated
system of health-care record-keeping could set up the citizenry for
a massive invasion of privacy. If medical records are
electronically filed and made easily retrievable with a simple ID
number, just about anyone will be able to access those records.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates insist that the system poses no threat to privacy and
would drastically improve Americans' ability to receive timely and
appropriate medical treatment. Some even argue that an electronic
identifier could reduce violations of patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argue that a health-care ID number could subject
patients to rampant intrusions into their personal lives by opening
up their medical histories to inspection by everyone from mass
marketers to law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   There were things to like about Clinton's original health-care
plan _ universal access to health insurance, for one _ and there
was plenty to dislike. In the end, the proposal that was cooked up
by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was defeated because it would
have given the government too much control over America's
health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, when President Clinton spoke to the nation Sept. 22,
1993, the ID-number aspect of the proposal was looked upon by most
Americans as a minor detail. I remember mentioning to a friend
after the speech that I was troubled by the ID proposal _ and I
remember the friend looking at me as if I might be afflicted with
some paranoid delusion about the government's interest in my
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   How could any rational person be worried that the FBI would want
to know what medications his doctor had prescribed for some illness
or other?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, my paranoia did not and does not run that deep. There
was just something about the way that Clinton showed off the
prototype for a national ``health-security card,'' something about
the way he boasted that every American would be required to carry
the card from cradle to grave to receive medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The president was obviously proud of the card and the undeniable
access to health care that it would have guaranteed _ not to
mention the universal filing system that it represented _ and yet
there was something sinister about it. There was a ``Big Brother''
aspect to the idea of national health-care registration that was
extremely unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clinton health-care proposal was shouted down, one of
the elements I was absolutely certain that the country would be
better off without was the universal health-security card.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears that we're about to get stuck with that part of
the plan without enjoying many of the aspects of the proposal that
would have been beneficial to most Americans. Lucky us.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it's not too late. If you are troubled by the notion
of an electronic filing system that would make the most intimate
details of your medical history available to anyone who can latch
onto your ID number, why not contact your representatives in
Congress and demand repeal of that provision of the 1996 Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act?
</P>
<P>
   They passed it. They can unpass it.

NET SALES FILL A GAP LEFT BY SOFTWARE STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One argument against buying books on line: Shopping for books is
a pleasant experience. There are lots on the shelves. You can flip
them open and browse. If you go to a small independent bookseller,
you will find articulate salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   If you go to a megastore, you will find comfy seats and
cappuccino and young urban singles trolling for mates. It's not a
bad way to kill an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said for video games. Shopping for them falls
somewhere between tax returns and a Quake death match on the stress
continuum. Selection is extremely limited and blockbuster-heavy,
particularly with regard to computer games.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not looking for Lara Croft, Warcraft, hunting and
fishing titles, or the latest offering from Id software, you're
generally out of luck. You can't open the boxes, and there aren't
many games on display. When the holidays roll around, the video
game section of Toys ``R'' Us turns into a hallucinatory nightmare
for parents _ a disorienting maelstrom of sound and light where
everything is back-ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Video games, it would seem, are begging for online commerce. And
on the Internet, no consumer itch goes unscratched for long.
</P>
<P>
   Witness Gameserve.com, a site with more than 10,000 console, PC
and Mac titles, a full line of game hardware and more than 1,000
joysticks, action pads, steering wheels and other play-enhancing
accessories at up to 20 percent off their suggested retail prices
(money saved by not maintaining brick-and-mortar stores is
ostensibly passed on to the customer).
</P>
<P>
   A search engine pulls up product descriptions for curious
browsers and wary parents. There are strategy guides, a game
maker's directory, a chat room and a forthcoming filtering feature
to recommend games based on what you already like.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you decide to buy goes into a virtual shopping basket
to be taken to an online checkout counter, charged to your credit
card and shipped within 48 hours. (For customers drooling in
anticipation, Gameserve e-mails a package-tracking number so you
can follow your order's every turn _ or answer the question, ``Mom,
when will it get here?'') An affiliate program pays Web mavens a
commission for selling games off their own sites.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Amazon.com of video games. And in fact,
Gameserve.com's parent company, Speedserve, began as an online
bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first storefront, Bookserve.com, came out around the same
time Amazon did,'' said Michael Mason, 28, Speedserve's chief
executive. ``We tracked really great with those guys for a while.
And then we made some mistakes. Our technology was sort of homespun
technology, and we couldn't scale quick enough. So as more
customers came into our store, we weren't able to serve them.''
</P>
<P>
   Having stubbed its big toe on infrastructure, Speedserve
underwent a complete back-office overhaul in 1997, replacing its
own technology with IBM E-commerce software. But by the time
Bookserve.com was ready to race, Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com
had already crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't room to compete as an electronic book retailer. So
Speedserve reinvented itself as an Internet movie merchant,
Videoserve.com, and opened the world's largest online video game
store, Gameserve.com. After two months, 8,000 visitors a day were
hitting the site.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether digital entertainment and bound
books will follow the same trajectories on line. In a marketplace
where Amazon.com has yet to turn a profit, Gameserve.com may have
the last laugh. Unlike the publishing business, the computer game
industry is growing prodigiously: according to the Interactive
Digital Software Association, video games and computer games were a
$5.1 billion business in 1997, up 38 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of American homes have computers, and one out of
10 packaged software purchases is a game. Sony just announced the
sale of its ten-millionth Playstation in North America. Every year
a new crop of video game customers surges up from the schoolyard to
join millions of game fans in their teens, 20s, 30s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, places to buy games are not multiplying as fast
as the number of people who want to buy them. The checkout counter
remains a bottleneck for this industry because book retailing and
software retailing are very different creatures. A bookseller can
order a thousand copies of a book, sell a hundred and return the
rest to the publisher, who eats the cost.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, this return policy defines the book-buying
experience _ acres of space and endless variety _ because
bookstores bear no risk for this embarrassment of riches.
</P>
<P>
   In the video game world, retailers bear all the risk. Inventory
is bought and paid for, and it's extremely difficult to return.
Hence the small selection of sure-fire sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distributors often have copies of old games that they can't do
anything with,'' Mason said. ``Yet they keep them because they've
paid for it. So they have standing inventory. We can take advantage
of that. And that's completely different from the way we have to
operate on the book and video side of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, Gameserve is at a distinct advantage
because the physical world is failing consumers and because
Gameserve carries no inventory whatsoever. Everything is shipped
directly from the distributor to the customer, an expedient
arrangement. Speedserve's major backer is Ingram Entertainment, the
United States' largest distributor of video games and home videos,
which holds a majority interest in the startup.
</P>
<P>
   There is a family legacy as well. Mason's father, who now works
in the insurance industry, was once the president of Ingram Books,
a 900-pound gorilla of distribution in the publishing world.
</P>
<P>
   So what does the old man think of this electronic game-brokering
business? ``He likes it,'' said the second-generation media
salesman. ``He came over and checked out our little fulfillment
center and kind of chuckled and had a good time. He doesn't know
anything about games. But he likes it.''

 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Chiquita Brands International accused a
reporter for The Cincinnati Enquirer of stealing 2,000 messages
from its voice mail in the course of investigating the company for
a series of articles.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not known exactly how the reporter, Michael
Gallagher, got the messages _ whether someone provided them to him
or whether he broke into Chiquita's voice-mail system. Chiquita
officials have accused him of stealing the messages himself.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, the newspaper dismissed Gallagher, who has not
discussed the matter publicly since then. In any case, there seems
to be no doubt that the voice-mail system was tampered with, which
raises a question for anyone who uses voice mail: How secure is it?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, as any telecommunications manager can tell you, is
that voice-mail systems are only as secure as the people who use
them decide they should be.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to security, voice mail is often treated like a
forgotten relative. Corporations are conscientious about educating
employees about computer and e-mail passwords, but less so when it
comes to voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Many older voice-mail systems, like the one used at Chiquita,
were often installed with default passwords. On many systems,
individual users were told that they could set passwords of their
own choosing. But, perhaps out of laziness or forgetfulness,
employees often failed to change their passwords, leaving their
voice-mail vulnerable to intruders.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, since voice mail has become common in the
United States, most systems have been the target of hackers at one
time or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens to everybody,'' said John Guinasso, director of
corporate integrity and risk management at ICG Netcom, an Internet
service provider based in Englewood, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Netcom's voice-mail system was penetrated by a
15-year-old hacker who called himself Nobody. The teen-ager broke
into the system for fun, then listened to some idle chat among
Netcom employees before growing bored. But after the incident,
Guinasso said, the company stepped up its security, requiring
employees to choose passwords of at least six characters each.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita uses a system manufactured by Octel Communications, now
the Octel Messaging Division of Lucent Technologies in Milpitas,
Calif. Robert Olson, Chiquita's general counsel and one of a
half-dozen or so executives there whose voice-mail messages were
stolen, said in an interview that the company had been confident
about the security of the system, which is about eight years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had every reason to believe it was secure,'' he said.
Lucent officials refused to say which security features had been on
the system when it was shipped to Chiquita.
</P>
<P>
   A rash of voice-mail break-ins occurred in the early 1990s when
hackers used voice-mail systems as a bridge to outside lines and
even used unassigned voice-mail boxes as message centers. That
prompted voice-mail manufacturers and telecommunications managers
to strengthen security.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lord, a security consultant with Nortel, a
telecommunications and data-networking company that manufactures
voice-mail systems, said that in the current release of Nortel's
voice-mail products, users were forced to choose individual
passwords the first time they logged on to the system instead of
allowing a default password setting like (pound). Lucent officials
said that more recent versions of its voice-mail systems did that
as well. With 100 million voice-mail boxes installed worldwide,
Lucent is the leading supplier of voice messaging systems.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita has filed a defamation suit against Gallagher in
federal district court, citing in its complaint the voice-mail
messages the company says were stolen by Gallagher. A special
prosecutor in Hamilton County, Ohio, has begun an inquiry, and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the case.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher and ``co-conspirators,'' according to Chiquita's
complaint, are accused of breaking ``into the voice-mail boxes of
Chiquita employees as frequently as 13 times a day.'' Chiquita's
phone records show that in a 10-day period in early May, the
company's voice mail was tampered with more than 50 times, the
company says.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate espionage is generally on the rise, experts say. Ms.
Lord estimates that the theft of confidential corporate information
has increased more than 300 percent in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Cold War ended, a lot of people got put out of
work,'' she said. ``They were spies, and they got into the business
of corporate espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice mail can be an important source of confidential
information. Ms. Lord said that last November, a former field sales
manager for a company in Andover, Mass., had been charged with
breaking into the company's voice-mail system to gain access to the
company's sales leads and confidential marketing information.
</P>
<P>
   But companies seldom make public a breach of their computer or
telecommunications systems, as disclosures of security weaknesses
could tarnish a corporate image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies don't want their stockholders to know something like
that happened to them,'' Ms. Lord said. Chiquita did not discover
that its voice mail had been tampered with until shortly before the
Enquirer's package of articles ran on May 3. The articles were
filled with references to, and quotes from, confidential voice-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Voice mail for the home is also at risk. Increasingly, consumers
are tossing out their answering machines in favor of computerized
messaging services provided by phone companies. Those voice-mail
boxes could also be vulnerable to break-ins by people using a list
of common access codes and other code-breaking devices.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice to keep voice mail secure, and to protect
computer connections and e-mail as well, is to change passwords
regularly and to stay away from passwords that are easily guessed,
like 1234 or 5555. Don't keep passwords in an obvious place after
writing them down.
</P>
<P>
   If you hear a busy signal while trying to retrieve voice-mail
messages, it could indicate that someone else is listening to your
voice mail. In that case, call the telecommunications department.

NICKELODEON SINGS WACKY NEW 'TOONS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What is funny? After spending most of the past two
decades creating animation for MTV, Hanna-Barbera Studios and
Nickelodeon, Fred Seibert thinks he knows.
</P>
<P>
   And over the next few months, he'll try to prove it with a new
series of one-off animated shorts he commissioned from a group of
writer-directors whose work he admires.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there will be 39 separate animated shorts, starring
about 35 different characters, appearing Sunday mornings on
Nickelodeon's ``Oh, Yeah!'' cartoon series that began last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cartoon laboratory for Nickelodeon and for the
animation industry in a lot of ways,'' said Seibert, the show's
executive producer. ``My view of TV and films has always been that
great talent spawns hip shows and hip characters. I start there and
then I say, `What do you got'?''
</P>
<P>
   If the screening copy of the first three shorts is any
indication, what they have is pretty promising.
</P>
<P>
   First up is ``Chalk Zone,'' premised on the idea that everything
ever drawn on a chalkboard goes to another world called the Chalk
Zone after it's erased. A little boy named Henry finds magic chalk
that lets him move between his ``real'' world and the Chalk Zone
while dealing with a real bully and the chalked stick-figure Bully
Nerd.
</P>
<P>
   The next short deals more explicitly with the metaphysical
question of ``What Is Funny?'' Slap T. Pooch riffs on a series of
gags and alternate takes, asking each time, ``Is this funny? I
don't know. I'm asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon set off a debate between my Personal Entertainment
Testing System units about what gags worked for their 6- and
7-year-old senses of humor, something no other entertainment has
ever done.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the short, at least, is engaging, even if my
P.E.T.S.' answers to some of Pooch's questions were ``That's not
funny,'' or ``That's disgusting,'' or ``That's just stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The final short, ``Jelly's Day,'' follows a slightly spoiled
little girl through her day with her Lurch-like cousin Hargus from
Entrancylvania.
</P>
<P>
   It, like the other two pieces, has a wonderful level of energy
and fun, far more in the spirit of classic ``Looney Tunes''
creations than anything else I've seen in a while.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to create a bunch of one-off shorts, rather than a
series focusing on one character is also a bit risky, ignoring 40
years of practice, Seibert acknowledged. But he's again looking to
the classic Looney Tunes for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really how Looney Tunes work,'' Seibert said. ``The
first year Bugs Bunny showed up, 10 years into that series, they
did four (episodes) of him. Then they went from there.''
</P>
<P>
   And although in the short term it might be cheaper to do all the
development and animation work for a single-character series,
Seibert said over the long term, his approach might turn out more
hit series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't swear to it, but I wouldn't be too far off in
saying there are more new characters in this one show than the
entire industry does in a year,'' Seibert said. ``This year, we are
taking 35, 36 shots up to bat, rather than in a traditional series
where there's one shot up to bat. The long-term prospects are
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Seibert said he chose animators whose work he knew and worked
with them to create characters that made him laugh and that he
could connect with. Now, with the series on the air, you can decide
for yourself: What is funny?

ATTUNED TO THE AGE OF MUSIC

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Michelle Cisneros is a shy giggler, Mario Castro
never happier than when he's imitating a boxer, throwing punches at
imaginary opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But when they sit down at the piano, they're all business.
</P>
<P>
   The two 4-year-olds _ the youngest of Max Music Center director
and instructor Lizbeth Ortuste's students ever to play in public _
are first on the bill for the music school's weekend piano recital.
</P>
<P>
   Are they nervous?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' says Mario matter-of-factly, a big grin on his face.
``I like to play _ loud. I want to be a concert pianist.''
</P>
<P>
   A lofty ambition for a lad who's only studied music for four
months. On an adult-size grand piano, he'll play ``Old MacDonald
Had a Farm,'' rendered in rehearsal in Ortuste's living room with
all the force of a jackhammer pounding pavement.
</P>
<P>
   But Mario hits all the right keys. So does Michelle, in her
quiet way. She'll play ``The Skater,'' a dreamy but simple piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to know the personality of each
student,'' said Ortuste, who graduated from Tomas Frias University
in Potosi, Bolivia, with a degree in music arts and teaches about
30 Valley children at her Van Nuys home. Her first love is
classical music, but she says younger children must start playing
music that appeals to them before tackling more esoteric _ and more
difficult _ pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give a child a waltz to play first, and he won't like
it,'' she said. ``He'll be bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Renato Calderon, the school's artistic director, doesn't play
piano himself but is a longtime student of classical music and
likes to explain the nuances of the music to the kids so they can
recognize the sound of a tinkling brook or a thunderstorm or cannon
fire in the pieces they play.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think classical music is boring,'' he said.
``Lots of people call it `church music.' But they don't understand
it. Once you understand it, you love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven students will participate in this year's recital, which
will feature music by Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Strauss,
Senneville, Tchaikovsky, Jarre, Streabbog and Kuhlau.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most kids are swooning over virtual pets, Beanie
Babies and Leonardo De Caprio, Ortuste says learning classical
music can keep youngsters disciplined, respectful and focused both
on their music and their schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``They learn to respect the music and its rules, how it must be
played,'' she said. ``They learn the discipline, that it takes
practice every day to be able to play. People who like classical
music ... live in another world, liking good things.''

AIRLINE FAIRY TALE: COACH IS NO PUMPKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KARRIE JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time I board an airplane, economy-class ticket in hand, I
experience what I think of as the Goldilocks Syndrome. I work my
way down the crowded aisle past the jumbo Papa Bear seats in first
class, the more modest Mama Bear seats in business class and back
to the little bitty Baby Bear seats in coach. Here the parallel
with the fairy tale ends; no one who flies coach would ever declare
that these tightly packed seats were ``just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines, eager to attract and retain passengers who will pay
top dollar, keep making the seats at the front of the plane plusher
and spacing them farther apart. Two years ago, British Airways
trumped the competition by introducing accommodations for its
first-class passengers that are positively womb-like. Configured by
a yacht designer, each seat is a module, isolated from the other
seats, with a built-in coffee table and visitor's chair. At the
touch of a button, the whole unit converts into a 6-foot-6-inch
bed. British Airways also advertises a business-class seat called
the Cradle Seat, perfect for overgrown Baby Bears.
</P>
<P>
   What I realized on my most recent flight is that the Goldilocks
Syndrome has entered the digital age. On a new United Airlines 767,
even my humble coach seat was equipped with its own video screen.
(United is playing catch up here; Virgin Atlantic has long offered
this amenity.) On a panel in my armrest was a sophisticated array
of buttons controlling audio, video, a topographical map that shows
the progress of the flight from several perspectives, and the usual
call button and light switch.
</P>
<P>
   As I disembarked, however, I noticed that Connoisseur Class (as
United calls its business class) seats had even more buttons on the
armrests and that first-class passengers had at their fingertips an
array of controls exceeded only by what the pilot has in the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Business-class buttons, it turns out, perform the same
entertainment functions as those in coach, with the addition of a
``noise-reduction'' button that allows passengers to listen through
their headsets to a ``noise-canceling'' electronic signal. But
business passengers also get a row of buttons that controls each
seat's Back Cycler, a moving air bladder to massage the lumbar
region.
</P>
<P>
   First-class passengers get all of the above plus two rows of
buttons to control their personal VCRs, a bonus button to adjust
the color tint of their monitors, and a default button that returns
the video channel, color, tint and volume to preset positions.
</P>
<P>
   Also mounted on the first-class armrest is a second control
panel with 10 buttons that can be used to adjust the pitch and yaw
of the motorized seat backs and foot rests, features that operate
manually in business class.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is a control console so complex that, according
to Tom Chapman, United's program manager for on-board product
planning, an international assortment of seat testers discovered
``things on them so subtle that they never knew how they worked
until the flight was over.'' United solved this problem with an
instructional video _ not on how to inflate the life vests or use
the emergency exits, but on how to make all the seat gadgets work.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Peltola, the director of marketing at Walter Dorwin
Teague of Redmond, Wash, an industrial-design firm that contributed
to the development of the Connoisseur Class seat, said an effort
had been made to group the various buttons logically, by function,
but that the most important design task was to make sure the
control panel was always in easy reach.
</P>
<P>
   Peltola, who has worked with Boeing on aircraft interiors,
noted, ``We've had situations where people get in full recline and
can't get back up again. You don't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   With faxes, phone calls and e-mail messages coming and going,
and nine channels of video, the new United seats can be viewed as
yet another manifestation of media convergence: the electronic
comfy chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``An airplane seat is one of the most information-intensive
places to be,'' said Peter Dixon, a partner at Lippincott &AMP;
Margulies, the corporate-identity firm that worked on the design of
Continental Airlines' Business First seats in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But the wired seats are also a new manifestation of a time-worn
marketing lesson, one learned by blender manufacturers in the
1960s: the more buttons you put on an appliance, the better it
sells.
</P>
<P>
   What seems significant is not the buttons' ergonomic qualities
or functional attributes, or even the technological advances they
represent. Rather, it's the reassurance they offer the Type A
personalities that cluster in the forward cabins.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, first- and business-class passengers are as much at
the mercy of the air-traffic controllers, the pilots, the jet
stream and the fates as are the less button-endowed travelers in
coach, but Papa Bears and Mama Bears are willing to pay a premium
for the illusion that they are as much in charge at 25,000 feet as
they are on the ground.

A RETURN TO THE FUTURE, 1939 STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Mass.)   (af)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The blue-and-white pins distributed at the 1939 New York World's
Fair read, ``I have seen the future.'' But they were not promoting
the Soviet Experiment; they were extolling streamlined cars and
superhighways, and every visitor to the General Motors Futurama
exhibition got a pin.
</P>
<P>
   The fair may have gone bankrupt in 1940, but its impact on the
American imagination remains. The opening ceremony on April 30,
1939, which featured a speech by President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
ushered in the first day of television broadcasting in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Other new technology at the fair included robotics
(Westinghouse's Elektro and his dog, Sparko), FM radio, fluorescent
lighting and Futurama's present cloverleafs for 1960 (no stop
signs!). At the RCA exhibition, the ``radio living room of
tomorrow'' even had a crude fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   The fair, with all its utopian promise and raw consumerism, has
inspired several recent Web sites, offering history, evocative
photographs, buying opportunities and sound movie clips of speeches
at the fair by Einstein, Roosevelt, La Guardia and others.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ambitious site is one that is part of the
American Studies program at the University of Virginia and was
prepared by John C. Barans, a graduate student
(http://xroads.virginia.edu/1930s/DISPLAY/39wf/frame.htm). It
offers a history of the two-year fair, as well as a hefty dose of
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World of Tomorrow,'' Barans writes, ``was a modern
extension of Enlightenment thinking, the unswerving belief in the
ability and perfectibility of humankind.''
</P>
<P>
   And those visuals! The site includes a film clip of the
dishwashing contest in the Westinghouse building: ``Mrs. Modern''
washes her dishes in a guess what made by Guess Who, while ``Mrs.
Drudge'' does hers by hand and loses the contest in every way,
including the fact that she is not as ``neat and refreshed as when
she started.''
</P>
<P>
   The good old days are jarring when memory does not have a chance
to filter them. The American Tobacco Co. building, designed like a
giant pack of Lucky Strikes, is in the Food Court along with the
Borden Co.'s Rotolactor, a revolving turntable with real cows.
</P>
<P>
   The Middletons, Westinghouse's typical American family, are
white and from Indiana. The site includes a rare photograph of
black visitors; for some reason, they are shown in front of the
Soviet pavilion. There is also a World's Fair commemorative edition
of the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   For all its high modernism and higher rhetoric, the fair also
had its sideshow, nobly disguised as education. Pictures include
Little Miracle Town, a collection of performing midgets, and Billy
Rose's Aquacade, which had Esther Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Frozen Alive Girl and the Dream of Venus building (designed
in part by Salvador Dali), paid equal homage to imagination and
scantily clad women. But photos of the pavilions of Czechoslovakia,
Poland and Lithuania take on a certain poignancy, given the fair's
coinciding with the early days of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Alan B. Howard, director of the American Studies
programs at the University of Virginia, said, ``We're really
interested in why New Yorkers and other people, many of whom never
went to the fair, all remember it.'' Part of the reason, he said,
is what he calls the generational mapping of the 1930s: ``The
period we look to for most of our learning about ourselves is our
grandparents' generation.'' The fair, he said, was ``a place where
America's future was being invented.''
</P>
<P>
   A more personal Web site for the 1939 fair, a cornucopia of
recollections, contemporary articles and current collectors'
guides, is at wysiwyg://135/http://websyte.com/alan/nywf.htm.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go to this fair was to have your life changed forever,''
wrote the site's creator, C. Alan Anderson, 67, a professor of
philosophy and religion at Curry College in Milton, Mass. He was
about 8 when his family visited from Connecticut. He remembers the
fireworks, a gas mask display and his first glimpse of television.
``That was a very big event in my young life and I've been
interested in it ever since,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's site shares recollections by others. ``Half of my
home is decorated in World's Fair,'' one wrote. Another offers
original souvenirs, including a 1939 World's Fair drink coaster for
$38 and a World's Fair Peanut bookmark for $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``More often,'' Anderson said, ``I get letters from young people
who say they wish they could have been there.''

TASTE THE NEW SALSA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Hot and getting hotter.
</P>
<P>
   No we're not talking about the heat wave but a new generation of
Latin-rock bands blending sizzling salsa, Afro-Cuban rhythms, rap
and funk that has record labels in hot pursuit and crowds burning
up the dance floors.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.'s Ozomatli, Virginia's Bio Ritmo and East L.A.'s Yeska have
been packing clubs across the country for more than a year as a
young audience tired of alternative rock discovers sizzling
horn-driven dance rhythms that hail back to '50s Afro-Cuban great
Machito.
</P>
<P>
   Ozomatli's self-titled debut for the Almo Sounds/Interscope
label, containing deep strains of salsa, samba and reggae, has been
a local best seller for weeks. Nationally, the disc reached No. 25
on Billboard's Heatseekers chart for new and developing artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't thinking on a national level the first time we
played for an audience, but during the first 10 gigs we started
getting this really good response, and we knew it would work,''
said Wil-Dog, Ozomatli's bassist. ``Everybody just got up and
danced.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member Latin-tinged ska band Yeska, whose debut album,
``Skafrocubanjazz'' (Aztlan), was recently released, has origins in
the East Los Angeles music scene and draws huge crowds to such
prestigious venues as the House of Blues, the Universal
Amphitheatre, the Viper Room and the Conga Room.
</P>
<P>
   Bio Ritmo, also an octet, formed in Richmond, Va., after Havana
native Rene Herrera defected from Cuba and moved there three years
ago. The band's debut, ``Rumba Baby Rumba!'' (Triloka/Mercury),
conjures up images of a sweaty Saturday night at New York's
Palladium, circa 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Yeska _ the word is Chicano slang for marijuana _ started as a
casual ensemble that came together for a Rosemead high school
talent show. Rooted in Afro-Cuban jazz and Jamaican ska, the band
regularly crosses the sounds of Tito Puente with War in a
locked-down, relentless reggae-fied groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a resurgence of this music in general,'' said Yeska
saxophonist David Urquidi, 22. ``Cuban bands are releasing records
in the States, and it's growing especially big in L.A. People are
starting to catch on to world music and Latin sounds. They're
looking for something different than guitar-rock. People like to
see horns and percussion and feel those Latin rhythms.''
</P>
<P>
   At the well-appointed Wilshire Boulevard salsa club the Conga
Room, dancers get down to the hot-hot-hot rhythms each Thursday in
a dance contest that runs through the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach-based dance instructor Luis Vazquez, a regular
visitor to the club, says interest in various forms of Latin dance
has exploded in the past several years while folks come from all
over the world to learn the elegant yet sensual steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been teaching salsa dance for almost six years, and in
the last few years people have gotten crazy about it,'' Vazquez,
26, said. ``I started with a few students, and now I have more than
300 students a week. People come all the way from Japan and Germany
to take lessons in salsa dance.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the music itself sometimes comes from unlikely
places. Take, for example, the origins of traditional salsa combo
Bio Ritmo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took one look at Richmond and said I'll never be a musician
again,'' said Herrera, recalling the day he arrived in Virginia
after defecting from Cuba. ``I had played in an orchestra at home,
I was an arranger. That's all I knew. But I found this band and
made a couple of changes and began using my arrangements, and that
made it sound better.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Bio Ritmo's songs are sung in Spanish, all use
traditional arrangements courtesy of trombonist/band leader
Herrera, and most tunes employ a battery of percussion and horn
solos. The band's next show is Aug. 4 at the Palace in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Terms like alternative-salsa, street salsa, Latin sounds and
punk-salsa have been thrown around to describe this increasingly
popular new scene, but the bands involved resist typecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very broad-based group, we're more than just a ska
band or a Latin-rock band,'' Yeska's Urquidi said. ``We feel we can
play to very different people with different material each night.
We don't want to be cornered in one particular zone.''
</P>
<P>
   For hot multiethnic club band Ozomatli, it all started with a
sit-in. These days, though, nobody's sitting down.
</P>
<P>
   Ozomatli, which last year opened for Santana in Anaheim for
11,000 people, formed in 1995 out of a protest at the former
downtown site of the Emergency Response Unit (ERU), now the Peace
and Justice Center.
</P>
<P>
   Band founder Wil-Dog (William Abers), who grew up in the
Pico-Union district near downtown, was part of a monthlong strike
that occurred as a result of a conflict between the
youth-jobs-oriented Los Angeles Conservation Corps (LACC) and the
ERU.
</P>
<P>
   Wil-Dog, then working for the LACC, staged a sit-in to protest
poor working conditions and the firing of a supervisor who
encouraged his crew to employ creative tactics to educate
inner-city students.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the strike, we were given access to this new community
center dedicated to youth and art,'' Wil-Dog, 25, said. ``We had to
raise money for the building, so I called all these musicians I
knew. Ozomatli got together during the first five gigs. It was a
jam thing where everyone's musical past came out. We never set out
to play this style. It's just what everybody knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozomatli _ the Indian name for the Aztec god of dance _ appears
Sept. 3 in a free show at the Santa Monica Pier.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling, politically inclined group sings in Spanish but
raps in English. ``Como Ves,'' the opening track on Ozomatli's
album, is a warning to kids that family history isn't necessarily
taught in school.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tune ``Coming War'' is a reminder that, contrary
to Gil Scott-Heron's famous phrase, the revolution actually will be
televised.
</P>
<P>
   But the ethnic sound didn't come naturally to all the bands on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Bio Ritmo percussionist Jim Thomson, for example, educated
himself in Latin and Afro-Cuban music by traveling to Washington,
D.C., whenever Latin-jazz acts came to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do a lot of my own legwork,'' Thomson said. ``There
wasn't a big Latin community in Richmond. When we got Rene in the
band, he helped bring it to another level. This music sounds really
difficult when you haven't grown up with it. Environmental factors
have a lot to do with the feel. But this is an incredible time for
music from all over the world and from other cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   As acceptance grows for Bio Ritmo, Yeska and Ozomatli, at least
one musician expresses little surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest music around,'' Herrera says, the Cuban
suddenly sounding Jewish. ``What's not to like?''

ACTOR PETER HORTON FINDS HELL IS NOT A MAXIMUM SECURITY PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Peter Horton, best known from his days on
``thirtysomething,'' returns to the series format this fall in
``Brimstone'' on Fox. Horton plays a good cop who had one really
bad moment in his life: He murdered the guy who raped his wife
because the justice system failed him. He then was killed in the
line of duty and went to hell.
</P>
<P>
   End of story, right?
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Seems hell isn't a maximum-security place. At least not for 113
condemned souls who have managed to escape to the land of the
living and are ready to loose evil on the unsuspecting. The devil
recruits Horton's character, Ezekiel Stone, to round them up. He
was a pretty good cop, after all. To send them back to
nether-netherland, Stone must poke out their eyes _ the windows to
the soul _ by any means necessary, which led one squeamish TV
critic to ask if any of the baddies will be female.
</P>
<P>
   Horton replied: ``Hell is co-ed, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The nominees for the 50th Emmy Awards will be announced
Thursday, but this much is already known: The telecast of the Sept.
13 ceremony on NBC will be as lengthy as some of the network's
miniseries, and nobody is hosting this year. Or, more accurately,
everybody is hosting.
</P>
<P>
   At four hours (7 to 11 p.m.), the prime-time Emmy Awards show
probably will set a record for bathroom breaks per celebrity.
Oddly, though, it will parcel out fewer awards than in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will telecast 27 awards,'' executive producer Don Mischer
said this week. ``There were 28 last year, one of which was the
President's Award. The feeling at the television academy was there
was some redundancy in that award, because every time it had been
given the winner also won an Emmy in some other category. So we've
taken the President's Award out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer awards, more air time. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Mischer says it won't mean longer acceptance speeches; winners
are still limited to 30 seconds. He said the extra time will permit
a five- or six-minute segment on the academy's craft awards, which
will be handed out two weeks before the glamour ones, plus plenty
of time for 50th anniversary folderol.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it doesn't mean longer categories, such as this one
from 1954: Best Continuing Performance in a Series by a Comedian,
Singer, Host, Dancer, Emcee, Announcer, Narrator, Panelist or Any
Person Who Essentially Plays Himself (or Herself).
</P>
<P>
   As for the no-host approach, Mischer said: ``We want it to feel
like the entire television industry has come together for this
night. ... There is less predictability, more surprise and more
energy when you don't have a host.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Crude is one word that comes to mind after watching the pilot
episode of ``Costello,'' a new working-class comedy on Fox this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   But comedian Sue Costello, co-creator and star of the
autobiographical series, isn't apologetic. In her charmingly
jarring South Boston accent, she said, ``It is rough to the rest of
the world, but ... it's so true to my life. ... It's like when I
came to Hollywood somebody interviewed me and said, `Sue, how do
you like Hollywood?' And without knowing any better I said to them,
`It's just like growing up in the streets, except you can't call
anybody a whore.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Diane English, the principal force behind the 10-season run of
``Murphy Brown'' on CBS, admits that such success opens doors. This
fall, she takes her track record to Fox with the comedy ``Living in
Captivity,'' a social satire about life in the suburbs, focusing on
two white couples and their new African-American neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But English has no illusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get one, maybe two shots'' to win an audience, she said
Wednesday. ``If you don't deliver, it doesn't matter who you are.''

ON-LINE STOCK TRADING CAN BE HAZARDOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ On-line trading can be hazardous to your
wallet. That was the cautionary conclusion of John L. Steffens,
vice chairman of the board of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., who addressed a
gathering of Internet industry executives and entrepreneurs here
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens told people at the annual Spotlight conference that the
ease and convenience of Internet-based trading seduce people into
buying and selling stocks more often than they should. So-called
E-traders, he said, tend to trade three to four times more often
than people who buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage
firms. And they pay a price for that haste and frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens cited a study by economists at the University of
California at Davis, which looked at the trading habits of 60,000
households from 1991 to 1996. According to the study, the most
active traders had a rate of return of 10 percent per year,
compared with a 15 percent return for those who traded least often.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are killing themselves by trading too much _ there's no
question,'' said Terry Odean, an assistant professor of finance at
the university and one of the study's authors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steffens, 25 percent to 30 percent of retail stock
trades are done electronically, and the median age of an online
trader is about 36.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens, 57, is of the old school of stock market investing,
which is guided by a principle of long-term stock holdings. When
held for years, not months or weeks, stocks gain value, he said,
and serious investors recognize that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, are you interested in fun and games or
investing? The two are very different,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens added that online trading had also caused increased
volatility in the stock markets because of the ease with which it
is done. And he agreed with an audience member that online trading
could become the ``Las Vegas of the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   A half dozen or so firms offer no-frills electronic trading. But
while Merrill Lynch uses the Net to give clients instant access to
research and other information, it does not now offer online stock
trading, though it plans to offer online brokerage services to
certain customers next year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Steffens chose the wrong audience for such a
pronouncement. Most of the 200 or so people in the audience were in
their 30s and early 40s, and their livelihood depends on promoting
the benefits of the Internet. Some two-thirds of those in
attendance said they traded stocks on line. Steffens, it turned
out, was the only person in the room over age 55.
</P>
<P>
   When polled before Steffens' presentation, most members of the
audience said they considered the Internet as more of an
opportunity than a threat. Thirty minutes later, however, after a
round of tough questions from the audience and from Michael
Schrage, the conference's executive producer, many people changed
their minds.
</P>
<P>
   When Schrage posed the same question a second time, most people
in the audience decided that the online world was a threat to the
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   David Braunschvig, a managing director at Lazard Freres &AMP; Co.
and who attended the conference, said of the swing in opinion:
``It's not that they were more bearish on Merrill, but they
realized the complexity of the whole landscape. It was the first
time they started thinking of the relative merits of, and
challenges for, an established brand coming into the online
arena.''

<P>
   ABCs: Ginger is an herbaceous tropical (tender) perennial. Its
aromatic, knotty, tuberous rhizome is used in cooking. Probably
native to India and southern China. Foliage reaches 24 to 48 inches
high.
</P>
<P>
   Growing conditions: Plant from rhizome in spring. Pot from a
walnut-size piece with an eye (as on a potato). Provide fertile,
moist, well-drained soil in partial shade. To harvest, pull plant
from pot eight to 12 months after planting and remove leaves. Cut
off what you need and replant the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Food pairings: Beverages, fruit, meat, poultry, fish, preserves,
pickles, vegetables. Used in Asian, Caribbean and North African
cuisines.

   GOAT CHEESE SALAD WITH GINGER AND MACADAMIA NUTS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 as a salad course
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces soft goat cheese, chilled
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces roasted macadamia nuts
</P>
<P>
   6 cups lettuce greens, preferably baby leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Dressing:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 clove garlic, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped cilantro sprigs
</P>
<P>
   7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Japanese rice vinegar, unseasoned
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Carefully cut the goat cheese into four thin slices. If nuts are
salted, rinse briefly and pat dry. Place nuts in a food processor
and chop coarsely, then transfer to a plate. Coat each cheese slice
with the nuts and refrigerate. If using large lettuce, tear into
bite-size pieces. Refrigerate lettuce. Set aside olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Combine dressing ingredients and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, stir dressing; toss greens with half the salad
dressing. Arrange on four plates.
</P>
<P>
   Place a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the
1 tablespoon olive oil. Heat oil, then gently add goat-cheese
slices. Saute on both sides until cheese is just heated through and
nuts are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Gently transfer to center
of greens. Stir remaining dressing and spoon over goat cheese and
greens. Serve at once.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wake up, you apartment junkies!
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to know exactly how much apartments are selling for
in the building of your dreams? Want to read about a neighborhood?
The ten best views of Central Park? The ten best water tank
enclosures? (Yeah, those things up on the roof.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a new web site where you don't have to buy anything, and
it's owners pledge not to bug you with unwanted calls and
``cookies,'' those secret little files that advertisers place on
your computer to follow you around.
</P>
<P>
   It's called www.nyrealty.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can look up a specific co-op or condominium building _ 500
of them, right now _ and find a brief, often witty description of
its pros and cons, and even the last sales there.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood commentaries and the building reviews were
written by Carter B. Horsley, a former real estate reporter at The
New York Times, who was also the architectural critic at the New
York Post until 1991. On the Web, Horsley describes midtown west
(West 32nd to West 59th) in 13 pages, starting:
</P>
<P>
   ``The East Side may be slightly more elegant and neater than the
West Side but when it comes to energy at the heart of the city's
cauldron, west midtown wins easily. This is where New Yorkers and
non-New Yorkers collide. This is where dreams are fashioned and
legends made. This is the turf. This is where Ratso Rizzo in
``Midnight Cowboy'' bangs on a cab and yells, ``Hey, I'm walking
here!''
</P>
<P>
   The web site, which opened last week, is free, but the company,
NY Realty.Com, is obviously hoping that cybernauts will also check
out the part of the web site where they can actually sign up to see
apartments for sale or rent. Just click on Buying, go to Hot Deals,
pick an address, then a specific apartment and scrutinize its pros
and cons. Interested? Make an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Levy, the company's president, said that even if
customers chose to fill out a form, giving their name and e-mail
address, they would be called only to confirm the appointment
they've requested.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, he added, they want to sign up for another service: they
can be automatically e-mailed when other apartments that match
their specifications become available. But again, Levy assured the
faint of heart: no unwanted sales calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Zagat's for real estate,'' he bragged. ``We'll
have ratings, reviews, photos, maps, financial data that's never
before published.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the top ten views of Central Park (960 Fifth Ave. and
the Beresford, 211 Central Park West (81st Street), head the list)
and the top 10 water tank enclosures (Trump Parc, 100 Central Park
South, and the San Remo, 145 Central Park West (74th Street), are
two), Horsley also selected the top 10 non-rectilinear buildings
(including the Corinthian at 645 First Ave. (East 38th Street), a
tower he says is ``the closest New York comes to the great Lake
Point Tower in Chicago.'')
</P>
<P>
   There are more to come: the top 10 buildings for pets. The top
ten entrance marquees. The top 10 rooftop pools. And, lest you
worry that they were going to be forgotten, the top 10 gargoyles.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kitchen cabinets subjected to a lot of wear and tear will
eventually start to look shabby. Replacing those old cabinets with
new ones can be expensive. Fortunately there is another, less
expensive option: the cabinets can be refaced.
</P>
<P>
   Refacing entails bonding new material, either plastic laminate
or wood veneer, over the old cabinet faces with contact cement.
Refacing with plastic laminate is best left to a professional. Wood
veneer is a little easier to work with because it can be trimmed
with a utility knife and a smooth file.
</P>
<P>
   One type of veneer, called ''peel-and-stick,'' is available with
an adhesive backing. It is easy to use; simply peel off the
protective paper and press the veneer in place. Contact cement is
unnecessary. With this material, an experienced do-it-yourselfer
can give shabby cabinets a new look.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to veneer your cabinets. With the first
method, all surfaces, including the end panels, exposed frame
surfaces, cabinets doors and drawer fronts, are recovered with
veneer. The second method requires veneering only the end panels
and exposed frame surfaces; the cabinets doors and drawer fronts
are replaced with new solid wood pieces. The second method is more
expensive but is less work and it may be the best option if the
existing cabinets doors and drawer fronts are ornate or have
recessed molding.
</P>
<P>
   Begin by carefully measuring all the cabinet surfaces. Look in
the Yellow Pages under ''Kitchen Cabinets.'' Call the dealers
listed to find where you can purchase unfinished doors and drawer
fronts. (Do not buy finished pieces; it will be difficult to stain
them to match the other facings.) Most dealers will offer a variety
of styles, usually in either oak or maple.
</P>
<P>
   Next calculate the surface area of all the cabinet frame
surfaces and add about 20 percent more to that figure. Then
purchase enough veneer to cover that area. The veneer is to be the
same wood as the doors and fronts.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier if you stain and finish all the pieces before you
mount them. Some pieces, like the solid doors and drawer fronts,
look lighter if they do not absorb as much stain as the veneer. In
this case, you can apply a second coat of stain. After the stain
dries, apply a light coat of polyurethane.
</P>
<P>
   Remove all the cabinet doors, drawers and all hardware. If the
drawers have detachable fronts, take them off. Some drawers have
one-piece fronts that are glued to the drawer sides and are not
removable. Here you will have to saw off the edges of each front so
it is flush with the sides of the drawer, then move the drawer
slides forward. In effect, you are creating a false drawer front.
Mount the new front to this face by driving screws from inside the
drawer. Make sure the screws are not too long or they will
penetrate the new piece.
</P>
<P>
   Good surface preparation is the key to bonding the veneer firmly
to the cabinet face. Examine the surfaces closely. Remove any nails
or staples, then fill all holes, cracks and dents with wood filler.
Sand all surfaces with 100 grit paper. The sanding will remove any
bumps and also create a ''tooth'' for the adhesive to grip. After
sanding, remove the dust with a tack cloth or a rag damped with
denatured alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   With a utility knife and metal straight edge, cut the veneer to
fit the cabinet frame. Cutting the veneer along the grain is
relatively easy, but the veneer may crack or splinter when you try
to cut across the grain. To prevent this, make several light passes
across the veneer rather than one heavy cut.
</P>
<P>
   The cut pieces should be slightly oversize; you can trim off the
excess after each piece is bonded in place. Check the fit of each
piece before bonding it in place. If the fit is good, remove the
paper, press the veneer against the cabinet face. Use a wallpaper
seam roller to flatten the veneer and force out air pockets. Trim
off any overlap with the utility knife and a fine file-tooth file.
With a cotton swab, apply stain and finish to these trimmed edges.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, mount the new cabinet doors in place. Be sure that they
line up with each other.

<P>
   Tens of millions of people have been forced from their homes
during the past decade by armed conflict, internal strife and
systematic violations of human rights, all the while remaining
within the borders of their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   No continent has been spared.
</P>
<P>
   Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million. These masses in flight _ who, unlike refugees, have
not crossed a border _ constitute the newest global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement always has severe humanitarian
implications. These displaced persons are at the greatest risk of
starvation, have the highest rates of preventable disease and are
the most vulnerable to human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement is a symptom of state dysfunction that
poses a threat to political and economic stability at the national
and international levels. Both the communities left behind and the
towns and villages in which the displaced find refuge are often
ravaged.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, so many people flee that whole societies are
uprooted. Violence and instability can spread through entire
regions, forcing neighboring states to bear the brunt of massive
refugee flows. Even countries continents away may have to contend
with a wave of desperate refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less acute than
the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World War II. Then,
humanitarian needs coupled with practical political and economic
interests brought about a system of international protection and
assistance for those displaced outside their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the position of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was
created and a U.N. refugee convention adopted. Today, UNHCR has a
staff of 5,000, an annual budget of more than $1 billion, and 13.2
million refugees in its care.
</P>
<P>
   But those forced from their homes who remain under their
government's jurisdiction are not covered by any international
arrangements. Although their numbers now exceed those of refugees,
no international institution is specifically charged with their
protection or assistance. The absurdity is that if these people had
crossed a border, they would fall under U.N. protection.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement became a subject of international concern
in the late 1980s. When the numbers were first compiled in 1982,
1.2 million people were estimated to be displaced in 11 countries.
Four years later the total had grown to 14 million. Since the early
1990s, the numbers have fluctuated between 20 million and 25
million in 35 to 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The major reason for this dramatic increase was the rise in
internal conflicts as the Cold War came to a close. The proxy wars
the superpowers fought in the 1980s displaced millions of people
who came into full view only as Cold War tensions eased in Angola,
Mozambique, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Cambodia and El Salvador. The
arms the United States and the Soviet Union had supplied to regimes
or opposition movements furnished the weaponry for the ethnic and
clan warfare that broke out once the superpowers departed.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia and Somalia, two countries that plunged into civil war,
were among the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance in
sub-Saharan Africa during the 1980s. In Europe and Central Asia,
the collapse of the Soviet Union lifted the lid on nationalist
aspirations and ethnic rivalries that displaced millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, vast disparities in wealth, land ownership and power
have been at the root of conflict. In Rwanda and Burundi, high
population density and limited fertile land exacerbated tensions
between Hutus and Tutsis. In Colombia, conflict over land has
forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, struggles between governments and minorities
have produced mass displacement. In Sudan, which has the world's
largest internally displaced population, the efforts of successive
northern governments to impose Islam on the black African south
have made 4 million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, which has the second-largest displaced population,
government repression against the Kurdish minority has sent 2
million people fleeing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have seen greater willingness on the part of the
international community to intervene in these situations, even
without the consent of the government concerned. A major motivation
has been the desire to forestall international flows of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of refugees has grown, Western governments as well
as those in Africa and elsewhere have become less welcoming to
those in flight. Their focus has shifted to keeping people in their
homelands. The U.N. Security Council justified the international
community's precedent-setting intervention on behalf of the Kurds
in Iraq in 1991 on the grounds that massive flows of refugees
threatened international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent Security Council resolutions on Somalia, Bosnia and
Rwanda have also authorized the use of force to facilitate the
delivery of relief and, in the latter two cases, to protect
internally displaced populations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the principles of sovereignty, territorial
integrity and noninterference in the internal affairs of states
present formidable obstacles to intervention by international
organizations. While some governments, such as Sri Lanka, invite
international assistance, others deliberately bar humanitarian aid,
seeing it as strengthening their opponents and undermining their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, for example, has obstructed humanitarian aid, while
Turkey has blocked all international assistance to its displaced
citizens. Some countries have deliberately starved the displaced
while invoking their sovereignty to keep the international
community at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the representative of the U.N. secretary-general on
internally displaced persons outlined guiding principles for the
rights of the displaced and the duties and obligations of states
and insurgent groups. These principles include a right not to be
arbitrarily displaced, access to humanitarian assistance and
protection while in flight and guarantees of reparations upon
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   While the principles lack legal force, they set standards that
should put both governments and insurgent groups on notice and give
international and nongovernmental organizations (NGOS) a basis for
legitimate action. The United Nations' acknowledgment of these
principles and call for their observance would be an important step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the international community has focused on providing
food, shelter and medical supplies. Yet displaced persons have
regularly pointed out that security is as great a priority as food.
Providing relief to uprooted people while ignoring the fact they
are being beaten or raped has led some to call the victims the
``well-fed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian assistance and development agencies of all stripes
will have to become more responsible for protecting the people they
assist. Many have silently witnessed abuses because of exaggerated
fears that confronting a host government will result in expulsion
of their personnel and termination of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The effort would be strengthened if governments and insurgent
groups were made aware that they were dealing with a united front
bound by common human rights and humanitarian standards.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, military interventions have been more
successful in preventing starvation than in physically defending
people at risk. This failure underscores the need for strategies to
prevent genocide and other crimes against humanity that lead to
displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts that are allowed to fester can produce mass
displacement and leave political and economic scars that damage the
economic well-being and political security of neighboring states,
regions and the international system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The world community cannot let this newest challenge go
unchecked.

between Hutus and Tutsis. In Colombia, conflict over land has
forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, struggles between governments and minorities
have produced mass displacement. In Sudan, which has the world's
largest internally displaced population, the efforts of successive
northern governments to impose Islam on the black African south
have made 4 million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, which has the second-largest displaced population,
government repression against the Kurdish minority has sent 2
million people fleeing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have seen greater willingness on the part of the
international community to intervene in these situations, even
without the consent of the government concerned. A major motivation
has been the desire to forestall international flows of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of refugees has grown, Western governments as well
as those in Africa and elsewhere have become less welcoming to
those in flight. Their focus has shifted to keeping people in their
homelands. The U.N. Security Council justified the international
community's precedent-setting intervention on behalf of the Kurds
in Iraq in 1991 on the grounds that massive flows of refugees
threatened international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent Security Council resolutions on Somalia, Bosnia and
Rwanda have also authorized the use of force to facilitate the
delivery of relief and, in the latter two cases, to protect
internally displaced populations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the principles of sovereignty, territorial
integrity and noninterference in the internal affairs of states
present formidable obstacles to intervention by international
organizations. While some governments, such as Sri Lanka, invite
international assistance, others deliberately bar humanitarian aid,
seeing it as strengthening their opponents and undermining their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, for example, has obstructed humanitarian aid, while
Turkey has blocked all international assistance to its displaced
citizens. Some countries have deliberately starved the displaced
while invoking their sovereignty to keep the international
community at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the representative of the U.N. secretary-general on
internally displaced persons outlined guiding principles for the
rights of the displaced and the duties and obligations of states
and insurgent groups. These principles include a right not to be
arbitrarily displaced, access to humanitarian assistance and
protection while in flight and guarantees of reparations upon
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   While the principles lack legal force, they set standards that
should put both governments and insurgent groups on notice and give
international and nongovernmental organizations (NGOS) a basis for
legitimate action. The United Nations' acknowledgment of these
principles and call for their observance would be an important step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the international community has focused on providing
food, shelter and medical supplies. Yet displaced persons have
regularly pointed out that security is as great a priority as food.
Providing relief to uprooted people while ignoring the fact they
are being beaten or raped has led some to call the victims the
``well-fed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian assistance and development agencies of all stripes
will have to become more responsible for protecting the people they
assist. Many have silently witnessed abuses because of exaggerated
fears that confronting a host government will result in expulsion
of their personnel and termination of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The effort would be strengthened if governments and insurgent
groups were made aware that they were dealing with a united front
bound by common human rights and humanitarian standards.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, military interventions have been more
successful in preventing starvation than in physically defending
people at risk. This failure underscores the need for strategies to
prevent genocide and other crimes against humanity that lead to
displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts that are allowed to fester can produce mass
displacement and leave political and economic scars that damage the
economic well-being and political security of neighboring states,
regions and the international system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The world community cannot let this newest challenge go
unchecked.

   NEW YORK _ The shares of Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc. began
trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock had previously been traded on the Nasdaq
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst-Argyle is growing rapidly, and we believe the NYSE's
auction-based market will enhance the efficiency of trading in our
stock,'' noted Bob Marbut, chairman and co-chief executive officer
of Hearst-Argyle Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also believe that the NYSE will offer our shareholders
increased liquidity and reduced volatility, which is keeping with
our commitment to improve long-term shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc, owns and/or manages 15
network-affiliated TV stations that reach approximately 11 percent
of U.S. TV households and comprise the fourth largest non-network
owned television station group in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the company announced that it would acquire the nine
television stations and five radio stations of Pulitzer Publishing,
resulting in a 24 station TV group reaching 16.5 percent of U.S. TV
households.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval,
is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.

WELL-READ _ JUST NOT FROM THAT LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seventeen out of 100? This is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   When the list of the 20th century's greatest novels in English
came out Monday, cries of dissent quickly followed.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough women writers, some critics carped (only eight books
by women made the list). Too many Americans and Brits, others cried
(aside from James Joyce, who has three books on it, the list
included no other works by English-speaking writers from outside
the U.S. and Britain).
</P>
<P>
   Others found the list arrogant, including the person who posted
this missive on the ``New York Times'' book forum the day the list
was released:
</P>
<P>
   ``I just glanced. What a joke . . . what a bleeping joke. . . .
I've never wanted to be as profane on these forums as I want to be
now. I couldn't read past the first 10. . . . These people are . .
. well, I won't say idiots. . . . Oh, bleep. Intellectual snobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Worthy complaints, all. Well, maybe not that last one. But none
is the one that I first found with the list, and I'll bet many
people shared the same sentiment:
</P>
<P>
   It makes me feel stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Which is another way of saying I haven't read nearly enough of
the books on the list.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think I'm a good reader. I've never done more than
look at the cover of a bodice ripper. I've never once allowed
myself to read a John Grisham potboiler. Yet all of a sudden, I
feel like I ought to look for books in airports instead of
libraries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXCUSES, EXCUSES
</P>
<P>
   I allowed myself a few justifications. This kind of list doesn't
mean anything, anyway (a list released Tuesday by publishing
students at Radcliffe College was far different). The list is
nothing more than a marketing tool for Random House's Modern
Library, whose editorial board compiled it (Random House is going
to place promotional material in bookstores offering novels from
the list). It gives short shrift to modern writers, whose books I
am more likely to read.
</P>
<P>
   Some or all of which may be true. But it does nothing to change
the fact that I have read only 17 of the top 100. (I've cracked six
or seven others but never finished them.)
</P>
<P>
   The trouble starts at the top. I've never finished ``Ulysses,''
by James Joyce, the No. 1 pick. I own it. I've started it. I know
what it's about. I've just never gotten all the way through it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm batting a weak .300 for the top 10: I've read only ``The
Great Gatsby,'' by F. Scott Fitzgerald, ``The Sound and the
Fury,''by William Faulkner, and ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' by John
Steinbeck.
</P>
<P>
   More embarrassingly, I've never even HEARD of some of the books,
such as ``A Dance to the Music of Time,'' by Anthony Powell, or ``A
House for Ms. Biswas,'' by V.S. Naipaul. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `MASH' FINALE
</P>
<P>
   Whenever i went over the list with other people, comparing our
shortcomings, I felt mostly shame, interrupted by the occasional
burst of pride. When we would finally get to a book I'd read, I
automatically said something along the lines of, ``Man, that was a
good one,'' even if I hadn't much liked it.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of an old ``Peanuts'' cartoon, in which Lucy Van
Pelt walks around the neighborhood reading a book, telling everyone
who will listen how great it is. In fact, she says, it's the best
book she's ever read. Finally, Violet asks, ``What other books have
you read?''
</P>
<P>
   She lowers the book from her face, and answers, ``This is the
only one.''
</P>
<P>
   One friend had read nine of the top 10, ``but I only understood
three of them.'' A story about the list quoted the writer Cynthia
Ozick; she claims to have read 90.
</P>
<P>
   The path is clear: I must resolve to read more of these books.
I've got to finish the ones I've started. I have to spend more time
improving my mind by reading and less time on such empty pursuits
as watching television and wasting time on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And I will. The minute this ``MASH'' rerun is over.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the movers and shakers build 20,000-square-foot
megamansions in the Hamptons and combine apartments on Park Avenue
in Manhattan, art dealer Holly Solomon is moving on down. Left
behind: a nine-room apartment (plus maids' rooms and two storage
rooms) on Sutton Place. Present home: a six-room apartment on the
Upper East Side that seats six for dinner. That may seem more than
adequate for most people, but Ms. Solomon used to give buffets for
100.
</P>
<P>
   Her life has changed. In 1990, she was divorced from her
husband, Horace Solomon, an art collector. In 1993, she moved the
Holly Solomon Gallery from uptown back to Soho, where she first
started selling art in 1969. Each night, after going to openings or
dinners with friends, she returned alone to her nine-plus rooms,
went straight to her bed, turned on the television and stayed
there.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, faced with the choice of moving or buying the
rent-controlled apartment, where she had lived for more than 30
years and raised her two sons, she reluctantly packed up and bought
a new place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to be dumb,'' she said. ``Basically I was living in one
room, and I was holding on to an idea of something that no longer
existed: the husband, the children, the family.''
</P>
<P>
   A new apartment cannot make a life perfect. But it can help. Ms.
Solomon, 64, asked two of her artists _ Kim MacConnel, a leader in
the pattern-and-decoration movement, and his wife, Jean Lowe, an
installation artist _ to help her create a small salon, ``in the
18th-century idea of a meeting place that was informal,'' MacConnel
recalled. It would be ``a fantasy of extreme elegance, with several
places in the apartment where you could sit and converse,'' he
said. ``She didn't really want a living room, or a dining room.''
Entertaining would be intimate, although she insisted on a
television in nearly every room.
</P>
<P>
   In three days, digging through decorative-art history from
Limoges china to south-of-the-border paintings on velvet, MacConnel
and Ms. Lowe transformed a bleak white box into a style best
described as American baroque. (Or as he said, ``ersatz chateau.'')
</P>
<P>
   They dipped the bedroom and guest room in pink and white, the
living room in dusky French blue, the dining room in pink _ acidy
colors that Ms. Lowe plucked from an 18th-century palette and toned
down. ``This is what artists do,'' said Izhar Patkin, a painter
whom Ms. Solomon represents. ``They don't buy into reality. They
try to transform it, as a novelist would.''
</P>
<P>
   On a gloomy day, the palette is a merry background for a
rotating collection of art _ some cheery (Ms. Lowe), some
provocative (Nam June Paik), some sad (William Wegman's ``Museum of
Beer,'' a landscape with silhouettes of Native Americans). Art and
decoration merge. ``They're symbiotic,'' MacConnel said. ``Certain
kinds of decoration go in and out of favor, just as art goes in and
out of favor.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Solomon's apartment, however, nothing GOES with anything
else. MacConnel and Ms. Lowe painted fine antiqued gold and silver
edging on the wall panels, like a wispy memory of 18th-century trim
or frames for late 20th-century art. ``Why can't 18th-century
decoration support contemporary modern work?'' MacConnel asked.
</P>
<P>
   In the pale golden foyer hangs Robert Barry's ``Untitled,'' a
1988 pale gray painting with the words ``Another'' and ``Possible''
emerging as if from a mist, a mantra for Ms. Solomon's new life.
</P>
<P>
   When she moved here, she knew she was abandoning a life as the
art world's Perle Mesta. ``I had 300 on a big night,'' she said
ruefully. ``I'd have poetry readings. I'd show films. I had a
formal salon.''
</P>
<P>
   She had a vast collection of 18th-century china, Art Deco
plates, artists' ceramics and thousands of books. She sold all the
china, and gave all of her books except those on art to the New
York Public Library. She donated 55 pairs of shoes to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. ``It was horrible, a real wrench,'' she
said. But, she added, the hardest thing was to give away the books.
</P>
<P>
   For the new apartment, ``she wanted something feminine, a place
for a tete-a-tete,'' Ms. Lowe recalled. The place is designed to
accommodate small dinners with friends, usually no more than two or
four at a time. When alone, she curls up on one of the beds, turns
on the television and nibbles. ``I don't want to eat at my table
alone,'' she said. (She still throws big parties and openings, but
at the gallery or in restaurants.)
</P>
<P>
   Whimsy abounds. Color and pattern play against type everywhere,
happily colliding. In the living room, the riot begins at ground
level: MacConnel's wild carpet collage, made of dozens of hooked
rugs from flea markets. On the walls are a lot of Hollys _
portraits of Ms. Solomon _ including a famous Warhol that dominates
the room and a portrait by Christo, wrapped in plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to the Warhol, a silk-screen from 1966, Ms.
Solomon reflected: ``It's very hard to age gracefully. No matter
how many times you have your face done, you're still going to age.
You are not young anymore, and who you are shows on your face.''
</P>
<P>
   The room is not devoted to vanity but to her catholic taste. She
has collected and shown artists as diverse as Picasso and Joseph
Kosuth. She embraces painting, sculpture, glass, film, ceramics,
textiles and video. Venetian glass glitters throughout. ``In 1975,
when I went to my first Biennale, it was fashionable to hate
Venetian glass,'' she said. No matter. She has Venetian glass
chandeliers and glass clowns and birds.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny color enlivens a once-dark hallway but doesn't betray the
somber subject: Warhol's 1964 silk-screen of a smiling Jackie
Kennedy in her Dallas pillbox hat hangs near the bedroom door. The
artists striped the bedroom walls in pink and white, allowing the
original dark green to peek through with a deliberate casualness.
The rug is another MacConnel collage: hooked rugs and toilet-seat
covers, like big polka dots.
</P>
<P>
   The guest room, with its plush daybed, makes a fine reading
retreat (though its splashy MacConnel quilt, made of his own
painted cotton and swatches of found Mexican paintings on velvet,
is hardly retiring).
</P>
<P>
   Here, Ms. Solomon feels she is staking a claim to a new
apartment and a new life. ``I'm beginning to know the doorman, and
I can take the bus to Zabar's,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she would like to remarry. ``It's rather sad when you have
nice things happen, you don't have someone to share them,'' she
said. ``I want to share the nice things.''

EAT YOUR VEGETABLES _ AND ENJOY THEM

   Potatoes and broccoli. Broccoli and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like the usual vegetable offering in your house,
there's a new book that can help. James Peterson's ``Vegetables''
(Morrow, $35) is the perfect assistant for the produce phobic.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson is always encyclopedic in his work (his ``Fish &AMP;
Shellfish'' won a cookbook award a few years back), and his newest
is no exception. Not only does he define Belgian endive, he
explains why it is white and how to separate and core it. Then he
prepares it in dishes like an orange, endive and walnut salad and
an endive and bacon gratin.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the vegetables aren't available without a major field
trip (cardoons, fava beans and fiddlehead ferns), but the book is
so exhaustively complete that it hardly matters. The recipes, for
the most part, are straight-ahead creations with precise
instructions and few exotic ingredients. All in all, a solid book
for the cook who is bored with the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   PROVENCAL ZUCCHINI GRATIN WITH TOMATOES AND FRESH MARJORAM
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 as side dish
</P>
<P>
   2 medium zucchini (1 pound), ends cut off
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly chopped fresh marjoram, or 1/2 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 medium tomatoes (1 1/2 pounds), peeled
</P>
<P>
   20 fresh basil leaves (finely chopped at the last minute;
optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese or hard goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Slice zucchini on an angle into 1//8-inch-thick ovals with a
vegetable slicer or by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Crush garlic to a smooth paste with the side of a chef's knife;
combine with the marjoram and 2 tablespoons olive oil in small bowl
and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Cut tomatoes in half from top to bottom and cut each half into 4
wedges. Push out seeds with your thumb and forefinger.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Rub bottom of medium baking dish or oval gratin dish with rest
of olive oil. If you are using chopped basil, smear it over the
bottom of the dish. Arrange zucchini in single layer, overlapping
halfway up each slice. Arrange tomato wedges, again in a single
layer over the zucchini. Brush or spoon over chopped marjoram-olive
oil mixture and season lightly with salt (remember the cheese is
salty). Top with grated cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 1 hour or until there's no liquid left from the
tomatoes and rims of zucchini have browned slightly. Grind some
fresh pepper over it and serve immediately.

   FUNGHI TRIFOLATI
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 as main course
</P>
<P>
   2 large shallots, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves, or 1/2 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds regular cultivated or cremini mushrooms, sliced
paper-thin with vegetable slicer
</P>
<P>
   1 small handful dried porcini mushrooms, quickly rinsed and
soaked in 1/4 cup warm water until soft, about 30 minutes, excess
water squeezed out, chopped coarsely, soaking water reserved
(optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/4 to 3/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds fresh or 1 pound dried pasta, such as fettuccine,
linguine or pappardelle (1/2- to 1-inch-wide noodles)
</P>
<P>
   Stir shallots, garlic and thyme in olive oil in wide saute pan
over medium-low heat and saute for 10 minutes _ their aroma should
fill the kitchen _ and then toss in sliced mushrooms. Turn heat up
to high and stew mushrooms until they release their liquid and all
the liquid in the pan evaporates, about 15 minutes. Stir in chopped
porcini mushrooms and carefully pour in their soaking liquid,
leaving any grit behind. Cook for a few minutes more to evaporate
the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   While mushrooms are cooking, bring about 4 quarts of water to a
rapid boil in a large pot.
</P>
<P>
   Stir butter, parsley and cream into the mushrooms and simmer
gently for about 3 minutes, or until sauce thickens slightly.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Toss pasta into boiling water. Check that the pasta is done by
fishing out a piece with a spoon and biting into it. Fresh pasta
takes a minute or two; dried pasta takes 5-10 minutes. Drain pasta,
return to empty pot, pour mushroom sauce over it and toss quickly.
Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately on wide
hot plates or in pasta bowls.

 &HT;    CENSUS REPORT SHOWS AMERICANS MOVING SOUTH
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chronicling a migration that foreshadows political
and economic change, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday that
well-educated and affluent Americans are swelling the continuing
population flow into the South.
</P>
<P>
   The South was the only region to record a net gain from internal
migration between March 1996 and March 1997 while the Northeast,
Midwest and West all had net losses, the Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   During that year, about 42 million Americans _ 16 percent of the
populace _ moved, but two-thirds of them stayed within the same
county. About 6.4 million moved to a different state, and about 3.2
million people moved between regions.
</P>
<P>
   The South _ composed of 16 states, including Georgia, Florida,
Texas and North Carolina _ showed a net gain of 391,000 people
moving in from other regions.
</P>
<P>
   The impact goes beyond raw numbers, though, to the type of folks
moving into Dixie. The influx, made up 90 percent of whites, is
making the region better-educated and more affluent _ and likely
will continue turning it more Republican.
</P>
<P>
   These ``upwardly mobile'' newcomers ``have generally helped the
Republican Party'' as they mostly settled into the suburbs, said
Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University in
Atlanta and an expert on Southern politics.
</P>
<P>
   The migration means the region is likely to pick up additional
seats in the House of Representatives after the reapportionment of
2000, said Black. For instance, Georgia is projected to add one or
two seats _ probably in the Atlanta suburbs or fast-growing
northern counties, he said. Both areas increasingly vote
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is likely to show the greatest Republican gains as
districts are redrawn _ mainly because the GOP is currently
under-represented in the apportionment, said Black. At the start of
this decade, Democrats drew the lines to pack as many Republicans
into as few districts as possible, he said, giving the GOP some
extremely safe seats but minimizing their overall power.
</P>
<P>
   With a Republican governor and greater GOP legislative strength,
Black predicted, the Texas congressional districts will be redrawn
to more accurately reflect the party's strength in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The migratory patterns may also boost the Southern economy by
raising the region's educational level. For instance, the region
showed a net gain of about 30,000 people with graduate or
professional degrees during the measured year, and a net gain of
29,000 with bachelor's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In this high-tech era, a ``brain gain'' or a ``brain drain'' has
a profound economic effect on a region, said Louis Tornatzky,
director of the Southern Technology Council, a division of the
Southern Growth Policies Board in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a period of years, a state can either accrue human
resources or lose them,'' Tornatzky explained. ``Smart people are
the key to our new economy,'' based on information-age industries.
</P>
<P>
   State policies can affect this migration of highly sought minds,
he said, citing the Georgia's Hope Scholarship program begun by
Gov. Zell Miller. By providing tuition for good students in state
colleges, Tornatsky said, Georgia is trying to keep the state's
talented youth from straying. ``If kids stay in the state after
high school to go to college,'' they're more likely to remain as
adult residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Migration patterns have also given the South a financial boost.
The median income for the newcomers was $17,400, while the median
income for the people who left the region was $15,117, the Census
Bureau reported. In contrast, the median income for people moving
into the Northeast was $16,965 _ nearly $2,000 less than the
$18,533 median income for the people moving out of the region.
</P>
<P>
   The South showed a net gain of people of all ages except over
75, where the number of immigrants and out-migrants was the same.
About half the net gain _ 183,000 people _ came in newcomers
between the ages of 30 and 64. Belying the reputation as a
retirement haven, there was a net gain of only 13,000 people aged
65 and older. That compares to a net gain of 110,000 people younger
than 25.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the highest moving rates were found among young
adults, as nearly 32 percent of people aged 20 to 29 years old
relocated during the year. Moving rates declined as age increased,
with moves by only 4.7 percent of the people aged 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a nationwide shift toward the suburbs, with
central cities losing 3 million people to migration and suburbs
gaining 2.8 million. However, 92 percent of the 1.3 million people
who moved to the United States from abroad settled in metropolitan
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Whites had lower overall moving rates (15.3 percent) than either
African-Americans or Hispanic Americans, both of whom had moving
rates of about 20 percent.

GETTING A LOCK ON JAIL-HOUSE CHILI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our search for a jail-house recipe turned up several interesting
stories.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable _ and probably most reliable _ tale was written
by Frank X. Tolbert in his classic ``A Bowl of Red.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the arrival of the 1890s, chili con carne had become a
standard entree in most jails in the Southwest. Jail-house cooks
learned the same lesson as did the pioneer chili makers, that chili
peppers could work wonders with inferior grades of beef.''
</P>
<P>
   A Mrs. Clarence A. Mass of Dallas sent Tolbert a recipe for
jail-house chili, which he published in his newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I heard from Smoot Schmid, a former Dallas County
sheriff: `That's just my jail chili. In the old days, the jailbirds
rated my chili the best served behind bars.'''
</P>
<P>
   Readers were quick to respond to our request for jail-house
chili recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The first recipe was sent in by Joan Hallford of North Richland
Hills, Texas. She clipped this recipe from the October 1990 issue
of [ix]Chile Pepper[nm] magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe definitely shows that it is at least 50 years old.
For one thing, suet is rarely found at meat counters these days. (I
asked the butcher at my local Winn-Dixie; he had some in the back.
He ground it, packaged it and gave it to me (at no cost), but I
could see he was wondering why someone would want a half-pound of
beef fat.
</P>
<P>
   In testing the recipe, I opted to use the stove instead of the
smoker. I cooked the meat and spices for one hour, added the water
and cooked for another hour. I would also suggest making a paste of
flour and some of the chili drippings and stirring it into the
chili to thicken it.
</P>
<P>
   A word of warning. Because of the suet, there is a
not-so-healthful layer of orange liquid on the top of the chili. If
you refrigerate the chili overnight, that liquid congeals and can
be scraped off.
</P>
<P>
   The sight was a touch off-putting to me, but my husband, the
Texan, took one taste and said, ``This is what chili tasted like
when I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS COUNTY JAIL CHILI
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound beef suet, ground
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds coarsely ground beef
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons ground dried sweet chile pods (ancho, for
example)
</P>
<P>
   3 cups water
</P>
<P>
   Fry suet in a heavy kettle. Add meat, garlic and seasonings.
Cook for four hours, placing pot in a medium-hot portion of your
smoker, stirring occasionally. Add water and continue cooking for
another hour, or until chili has thickened to desired consistency.

grams carbohydrates, 35 grams protein, 135 milligrams cholesterol,
1,307 milligrams sodium, 75 percent of calories from fat.
</P>
<P>
   And more chili: Evelyn Kellum of Irving, Texas, says she clipped
this recipe from The Dallas Morning News in the 1950s. This one is
a little updated _ substituting olive oil for the suet. Again,
we're talking some heavyweight chili.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS JAIL-HOUSE CHILI
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds coarsely ground beef
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, diced
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon white pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 cups water
</P>
<P>
   Heat olive oil. Add meat, garlic and seasonings, cover. Cook
slowly for 4 hours, stirring occasionally. Add water; continue
cooking until slightly thickened, about 1 hour. Serve plain or
mixed with equal portions of cooked dried pink or red beans. A
little flour and water blended together may be added to make the
chili a little thicker.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional analysis per serving: 498 calories, 39 grams fat, 4
grams carbohydrates, 33 grams protein, 115 milligrams cholesterol,
733 milligrams sodium, 71 percent of calories from fat.
</P>
<P>
   And one more: Billie Wood of Fort Worth, sends yet another
version, which she clipped from a magazine about 20 years ago. The
magazine writes, ``Legend has it that the Texas prison system made
such good chili, freed inmates often wrote for the recipe.'' And,
no, I need no letters from readers regarding the beans. Thank you
for your consideration.
</P>

<P>
   NEW CANAAN, Conn. _ The Glass House, that one-room marvel of the
International Style, rests serenely on its grassy slope here,
behind a six-foot wall of boulders, while controversy _ yet again _
swirls around it.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny house was built on Ponus Ridge Road almost 50 years
ago, designed by its owner, Philip Johnson, lauded by most critics
and denounced by a few neighbors. Over time, the architect gathered
up acreage and built a spate of accessory buildings, an assemblage
Johnson, 92, has deeded to the National Trust for Historic
Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Glass House has been swept up by a tempest in a parking
lot. There is no place to park, an increasing problem for many of
the country's historic sites. And with this particular parking
problem, the trust walked into something it could have never
predicted: a kind of a bi-state Freudian feud.
</P>
<P>
   The house, where Johnson still lives, will be open to tours this
fall, by invitation only. But first the trust must find somewhere
for the visitors to park. The trust, the architect and the Town of
New Canaan agree that there's no place for tourist parking on the
Glass House property, and the town won't allow it along winding
Ponus Ridge Road, home to a string of million-dollar estates.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the trust withdrew a plan for a parking lot in the
heart of New Canaan, near the train station; Daniel Foley, the
town's planner, says the trust ``ran into a buzz saw with the
neighbors.'' But in neighboring Pound Ridge, N.Y., only four miles
away, the trust found a site that seemed ideal: a burned-out beauty
shop on three acres on a commercial street with 15 empty
storefronts. It planned to build the parking lot first, followed by
a peaked-roof stone visitors' center that will be built after
Johnson's death, with a bequest from the architect.The trust was
not prepared for the fury that greeted its proposalr at a public
hearing on June 25 and continued to ripple throughout the town this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you tell that illustrious architect to design a
visitor's center for his  &UR; own &LR;  property _ and not inflict the buses
and the traffic and the pollution on the people of Pound Ridge,''
said Helen Mayrbaurl, who has lived on the road near the proposed
parking lot since 1962. ``They should put it in their own state.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the sticking points was the trust plan to build the
39-spot parking lot first, reserving the construction of the
visitor's Center until after Johnson's death. Residents worred that
the Trust might never build the center and they'd be stuck with the
parking lot _ or that New Canaanities would change their minds and
want it back.
</P>
<P>
   To the Pound Ridgers it was a classic case of the bigger town _
New Canaan, with triple the people, 30 percent more median income
and double the shops _ dumping on the smaller town, Pound Ridge,
with its 5,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The feelings of anger were occasionally tinged with a kind of
envyMary Lee, a photographer, said she thought it was a case of New
Canaan's looking down on the neighboring New Yorkers. Others said
New Canaan was ``dumping'' the ``bus depot'' on Pound Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Canaan has all the posh shops, plus they've got the Gap,
the CVS, the nice jewelry stores,'' said Tina Rohrer, who lives
near the Pound Ridge site and vehemently opposes the proposed
visitor's center and parking lot. While some of the town's business
owners argue that the proposed National Trust visitor's center
would help the local shops, Ms. Rohrer pointed out that the site
was on the edge of Pound Ridge's shopping area, and not connected
by a sidewalk. She argued that visitors would drive to New Canaan _
where they had more variety _ to shop.
</P>
<P>
   The trust disagrees. ``Why would they do that?'' said Susanne
Pandich, who is directing the trust's opening of of the Glass House
museum. ``They start in Pound Ridge. They come back to Pound Ridge.
They won't even  &UR; see &LR;  the center of New Canaan.'' In response to
the community uproar, Ms. Pandich said the visitor's center would
stay open from November to March, when the Glass House is closed to
the public. During that time, she said, the trust would put on
exhibitions and lectures, which would draw people from surrounding
towns.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most vociferous opponents of the parking lot concede
that Pound Ridge could use some business.
</P>
<P>
   Pound Ridge's Pharmacy moved out about a year ago, and the
windows are still stickered with advertising signs for sale items.
There are several clearly vacant shopfronts on the main street, and
Sheldon Satin, speaking for the town's business association, said
that out of 90 business locations, tk percent were empty. (Compared
with almost no vacancies out of the 176 locations in New Canaan,
according to officials there.) New Canaan also has the tony
antiques and flower shops, but Pound Ridge residents proudly point
to two draws: a popular hardware store named Chubby's, and
DiNardo's pizza restaurant, universally cited as the town's
best-known business.
</P>
<P>
   Letters protesting the plan are piling up on the Pound Ridge
supervisor's desk. And the public hearing last month, attended by
about 50 townspeople, Pound Ridge's attorney made his position
clear: there would be no parking lot without a visitor's center.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was not aware of the controversy in Pound Ridge
until a reporter told him about it. He vowed to attend a
continuation of the public hearing called by the town of Pound
Ridge, to be held tonight at 8 p.m. at the Town House on
Westchester Avenue. Stephen Tilly, the Dobbs Ferry architect who is
designing the visitor's center in collaboration with Johnson, said
he did not plan to attend. ``The last one was painful enough,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Trust?
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they are reconsidering their options and will
attend the hearing tonight before making any decision. ``We want to
go where we are welcome,'' said Frank E. Sanchis 3d, the trust's
vice president for historic sites, adding he had been surprised by
the furor in Pound Ridge. ``We don't want to come in as a lighting
rod for dissent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, several cracks in the town's attitude appeared. Clay
Fowler, the chairman of the Pound Ridge Planning Board, hinted in
an interview that _ in this first phase, where only a handful of
tour buses a year are allowed _ maybe something could be worked
out, ``like a special permit'' to allow parking at the Pound Ridge
site.
</P>
<P>
   And Joy G. Simpkins, the town supervisor, said that if the trust
did agree to build the visitor's center at the same as the parking
lot, ``that would put a different face on it _ that might be very
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchis said this week that the trust would not build a
visitor's center that ``would sit empty for maybe 15 years;
buildings seem to deteriorate,'' he said. He said that the cost to
maintain the visitor's center would be part of the overall bequest
to the trust by Johnson. Neither he nor Tilly would say how much
the visitor's center would cost, but one person involved in its
planning said it might be about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing is worked out with the Pound Ridge officials, Sanchis
said they might let the ``two or three or four'' tour buses a year
planned for the Glass House _ until Johnson's death _ park at
Lyndhurst, the Alexander Jackson Davis house in Tarrytown, N.Y.,
about 30 minutes from the Glass House. (There is enough land there,
he explained, to hide the buses and parking lot from the house.)
</P>

   Parking at historic houses is increasingly being debated,
according to preservationists and bureaucrats, and they say there's
no easy solution. At the Frank Lloyd Wright House and Studio in Oak
Park, Ill., where 73,553 sightseers traipsed through last year,
parking is on the streets. ``We work very closely with the local
community in terms of keeping the residents happy,'' said William
A. Dupont, the trust's architect. At Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate
in Tarrytown, and at Monticello, in Charlottesville, Va., visitors
are driven up to the houses in minivans like the ones proposed for
the Glass House.
</P>
<P>
   At the Glass House, admission admission will be limited to three
or four tours a year _ ``200 or 300 people'' _ invited by Johnson
or by the trust, and approved by the architect. This fall, for
example, the trust is opening the house to a group of its
``upper-end donors'' and last year, there was a tour arranged with
the Museum of Modern Art. When the museum formally opens, the trust
has capped the daily tourist quota at eight mini-vans carrying 18
passengers over the 210 days a year the house will be open. When
visitors arrive, they will be escorted through the property by
National Trust tour guides, and may listen to an audiotape.
</P>
<P>
   The audiotape will be narrated by _ guess who? _ Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already recorded it,'' said Sanchis.

<P>
   A wild-child woman born in the land of northern lights and
volcanoes, Bjork Gudmundsdottir has made a career of playing pop
paradox _ no surprise for someone whose family has gone from mud
house to MTV in two generations.
</P>
<P>
   Bjork released her first record _ an album of Icelandic folk
songs _ at the age of 11. Since then, her impish looks and outsize
voice have belied the growing maturity of her music. A classically
trained flautist and pianist, she put the primal scream in The
Sugarcubes' pop-punk a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gone solo in 1992, she has collaborated with such sound
sculptors as Graham Massey, Tricky, Goldie, Mark Bell and Howie B
to imbue techno with a mysticism suited to her fire-and-ice
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   With 1997's austere Homogenic, Bjork creates a personal history
of her twisted Icelandic roots: ``Thought I could organize
freedom,'' she sings, ``how Scandinavian of me!''
</P>
<P>
   Here the queen of eclectronica talks about her love of
information, her fear of technology and her sound of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   COLIN BERRY: How wired are Icelanders?
</P>
<P>
   BJORK: Very. Iceland has always been mad for information. We
wrote the sagas _ what, a thousand years ago? _ documenting
Scandinavian history. We were quick to take to the idea of home
computers because they were all about making access to information
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best Internet companies in the world are in Iceland,
even though we have only 260,000 people. The capital, Reykjavlk,
where I'm living now, is very modern, but at the same time
surrounded by mountains and oceans. We're still connected to nature
_ my family still hunts for half our food, but using a mobile phone
and a laptop to coordinate with other hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are Scandinavians so quick to embrace new technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: It speaks to something inside us. I've got a theory that
people who live in northern climates _ Canadians, Siberians,
Scandinavians, even the North Japanese _ have something in common.
We can talk forever. We love documentation. We can analyze and
analyze and analyze. We've developed sort of a delicious
schizophrenia _ chilly on the outside, but deeply passionate in our
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You could be describing your own work. Anyone else making
your kind of music?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bands coming from Finland and Canada right now represent a
new generation of electronic musicians. They've grown up with
computers being part of their life, not the scary aliens some
grownups make them out to be. They are very precise, and possess a
strong sense of beauty. Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, people on the
Rephlex label _ their passion is carefully hidden under layers and
layers of information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One reviewer claimed you ``treat machines like a woman's best
friend''; you've said guitars have no soul. Are you a technophile?
</P>
<P>
   A: I take technology personally. Machines are just tools, and in
that way a synthesizer or a sequencer is no colder than a guitar or
a flute. People tend to treat newly invented things as enemies, as
a threat to their security. But it's a question of how you use
them: A song will be warm if you put warmth in it. I have to say,
though, that they have become good friends of mine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The machines?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. We've invented so many noises you can't even count them.
We can make rhythms from the sound of an ant running down a twig.
I'm not obsessed with technology, not at all. I love working with
freedom, but I also love to work with limitations. Something like a
violin has only so many notes; it's only made of wood. The person
who can create soul with that has won out on restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You make the same claim on your song ``Alarm Call'': ``The
less room you give me, the more space I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, a new noise can be as rich and unpredictable as 10
instruments in a symphony orchestra. So in the last 50 years,
electronic music has moved forward as new textures are introduced.
Contemporary classical composers writing for stringed instruments
are becoming more and more minimal, trying to find new feelings
rather than new scales or notes. We're dealing with the same
musical structures, but we have so many different textures now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does this collision of electronic and acoustic instruments
confuse the music, or create a new kind of fusion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let me put it this way: A harp will be a harp and a
synthesizer will be a synthesizer. Nothing will ever replace them.
But there will still always be something gorgeous about the
chemistry of a violin or a voice. We're going to reach some sort of
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Indeed, Homogenic seems on the one hand chilly and
restrained, yet at the same time simmering, ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have always been into extremes. I live by the ocean, with
massive mountains and swirling blizzards. But I also love my
telephone and fax machine. A part of me is very conservative _ I'm
walking the same streets and hanging out with the same friends I
had since childhood. But I'm also very curious. I jump off cliffs.
In school I hung out with boys with thick glasses who owned insect
collections. I've always been a bit of a trainspotter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see today's young musicians using technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just like punk rock was a few years ago, except
15-year-olds who want to start a band today buy a synthesizer and a
sequencer instead of a guitar and drums. Orchestras used to need 50
people in order to fill a whole room with sound. Then the rock band
could do it. Now, you just need one person. It's cheaper. It's
easier. You've got more control.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Post's ``The Modern Things,'' you sing: ``All the modern
things have always existed, they've just been waiting to come out
and multiply and take over.'' Is this the end, or the beginning?
</P>
<P>
   A: People who make new music and express themselves get the most
personal freedom for their imagination. I'm obsessed with that _
even romantic about it. Music is like electricity: It's always been
there, now we're learning more and more how to understand it.

 ART LOVERS COOL TO LURES OF CD-ROMs  
 (af)  
 By LEE ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever happened to art CD-ROMs, those virtual, interactive
museums that were supposed to take the great works of art off
pedestals and gallery walls and place them on our computer screens?
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, after the release of pioneering efforts like
the 1993 Microsoft Art Gallery, drawn from the collection of
London's National Gallery, and the 1995 Passion for Art, featuring
the Barnes Collection, that curators and museum directors worried
that gallery attendance would plummet as art lovers clicked through
images of their favorite Cezannes and Rembrandts at home.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last 18 months, the museum-on-a-disk market has
collapsed, plagued by low sales and high costs. The best-selling
art CD-ROM last year, for example, volume one of Zane Interactive
Publishing's educational software, Power CD History Through Art,
sold only about 8,500 copies in retail chains, according to figures
compiled by PC Data, a Reston, Va., research company.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast Passion for Art sold about 12,300 copies in just the
first four months after its 1995 release, and Riven, the sequel to
the popular computer game Myst, introduced last October, sold about
915,400 copies in its first three months, PC Data said.
</P>
<P>
   Muscled aside by such flashy games and also by mundane
personal-productivity software, art CD-ROMs have experienced a
major shake-out among producers. Companies like the Corbis Corp.
(the producer of Passion), Grolier Interactive (Picasso: The Man,
His Works, the Legend), Macmillan Digital (150 Years of America's
Smithsonian) and Voyager (The Beat Experience) have got out of the
business, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art CDs are very difficult to sell,'' said Robb Lazarus,
director of electronic publishing for the Digital Arts and Sciences
company. ``They're a niche product and distributors are just not
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus' company, based in Alameda, Calif., abandoned art after
producing disks for, among others, the Frick Collection, the
Brooklyn Museum, the State Russian Museum and the Harvard
University Art Museums.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Steve Davis, co-president of Corbis, which abruptly
pulled the plug on its Ansel Adams disk last year, observed that
``the CD-ROM market has not been very robust, with the exception of
kill-'em-up games.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is hardly surprising that this fall's debut of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art CD-ROM: Masterworks From the Collection
_ delayed for two years _ is eagerly anticipated by those who still
believe in the potential of art on disk. Not only does the new disk
represent an important cultural event but it may also be the last
chance to breathe life into a dying genre.
</P>
<P>
   If any new art CD-ROM could be said to enjoy a reasonable shot
at commercial success, it would be the Met's, given its electronic
presentation of 257 works from all areas of the museum's collection
and its association with one of the most burnished brand names in
the art world.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by the Met's in-house educational staff, this new
general-audience electronic catalog was modeled on the museum's
popular coffee-table compendium, ``Masterpieces of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art,'' according to Kent Lydecker, the disk's executive
producer and the Met's associate director for education.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of committing the Met's masterpieces to disk was about
$500,000, he said. The Met is also preparing an educational guide
to the disk for classrooms and some of the material from the CD-ROM
will appear on the museum's Web site (www.metmuseum.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of these electronic tools as extensions of the
museum's capabilities,'' Lydecker said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the forecast for art CD-ROMs depends on the Met's
prospects, the outlook remains iffy. An advance look at the disk
revealed a staid electronic catalog that has settled for the
technologically tame when it could have been as vibrant and
arresting as the museum's collections.
</P>
<P>
   The approach to art history on the Met disk is serious to a
fault, and makes scant use of the audio and visual
bells-and-whistles that make multimedia enticing. What's more, it
does not fully exploit the unique ability of CDs to store huge
amounts of information that can be sorted and linked in complex
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Even the disk's best feature _ an appealing, insightful tour by
museum director Philippe de Montebello _ is almost bereft of
multimedia embellishment. A more inventive disk might have
highlighted, magnified or outlined areas on the canvas that best
exemplify what de Montebello describes. When the director says,
``We can feel the wind, hear the flags flapping, smell the sea
air'' while viewing Monet's ``Garden at Sainte-Adresse,'' some
producers might have heard their cue for appropriate sound effects.

 UNDATED: sound effects.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teresa Russo, an educator at the museum and one of the disk's
producers, said the museum resisted ``making an art work do
something that it doesn't do in a museum, such as orchestrating or
animating it.'' The use of multimedia was also curtailed by cost
and by the technological limits of the museum's staff. ``We're not
Microsoft,'' Ms. Russo said. ``We bring our expertise in the
subject area, not technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of technological expertise has hurt other art CD-ROMs,
according to Elizabeth Broun, director of the National Museum of
American Art in Washington. Disappointing sales, she said, reflect
their disappointing performance on home computers. ``Many were put
together fast and dirty to republish the material from a book in a
new format,'' she said. ``People were trying to do multimedia on
the cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   The NMAAs own 1996 CD-ROM exemplifies the opposite approach.
National Museum of America Art, Smithsonian Institution ranks as
probably the most intelligently engaging and technologically savvy
cybergallery installed on anyone's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The disk presents in-depth explorations of more than 760
objects, full texts of six museum catalogs, nearly two hours of
video, audio and slide shows, detailed written entries from a
variety of distinguished scholars, critics and historical sources,
not to mention the considerable charm of Ms. Broun, who conducts an
hour-long multimedia tour of the museum, focusing on 14 of her
personal favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The disk allows easy access to all of the audio and video treats
through a Media Center menu on the Galleries screen. ``If you want
to just lick the ice cream, you don't have to stumble on it
accidentally after you eat your spinach,'' Ms. Broun quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Met's upcoming title, which presents anonymously
written, relatively brief entries for most objects, NMAA's text
draws upon published commentary from a wide variety of experts _
sometimes several different authorities for a single object.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of offering a standard run-through of the history and
subject matter of Edward Hopper's ``Cape Cod Morning,'' critic
Brian O'Doherty, excerpted from Art in America magazine, finds the
work's essence in Hopper's ``power of concentration (that) makes
the absence an event'' and in his ``great power to hold one through
the sheer curiosity felt before such laconic indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``laconic indifference'' also describes NMAA's
commercial reception, which was hampered by inadequate funds for
marketing and distribution. Ms. Broun acknowledged that the NMAA
CD-ROM, whose $600,000 cost nearly tripled initial projections, has
not recouped its costs in the year and a half since it was
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, there are still those who insist that the
art CD-ROM can survive, even flourish. Some 42 of Voyager's titles
were recently acquired by the three-year-old New York-based Learn
Technologies Interactive, whose president, Luyen Chou, still
believes that art disks can succeed through improved cost-control
and a more aggressive sales strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death of the art CD-ROM is greatly exaggerated,'' said
Nina Tovich, senior producer and creative director of NMAA's disk,
who recently left the museum to form Lucid Design, her own
Washington-based multimedia development company.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that producers look to the techniques of game
designers to revive the form. Successful titles must present ``a
point of view, a perspective,'' she said. ``People don't want to be
just dumped into a bunch of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be able to shape the material themselves, or have
it shaped by someone who knows what he's doing,'' she continued.
``They also want a well-designed, beautiful environment. There is
something to be learned from interactive games, which provide
immersive environments that get your undivided attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Met itself recently surrendered to the gaming craze,
although not quite in the way Ms. Tovich suggested. The museum
recently allowed a commercial software publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster
Interactive, to include 17 objects from the Met's famed Egyptian
collection as plot elements in the recently released three-disk
Nile: An Ancient Egyptian Quest. (Players must collect the objects
to rescue the pharaohs.) The museum received a fee for the images
and will also get a percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to the Met, which prepared a teacher's guide for
the game, the Nile game includes a section with brief descriptions
of the 17 objects, for gamers who thirst for art-historical
knowledge. Maybe the future consumers for art on CD-ROMs aren't the
gallery-hoppers but the kids with joysticks.

   Van Fleet's Roses
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I was growing up in western Maryland, my grandmother had
a rosebush that she called a Van Fleet rose. I thought she was
kidding because my last name is VanFleet. Can you tell me anything
about it?
</P>
<P>
   A. You should always pay attention to grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Your grandmother's rose may have been Dr. W. Van Fleet, named
for Dr. Walter Van Fleet in 1910 by Peter Henderson, whose nursery
introduced it. Van Fleet (1857-1922) was one of the world's most
important hybridizers of climbing roses, breeding classics like
American Pillar and Silver Moon. He worked for the United States
Agriculture Department, in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Van Fleet wanted to name it Daybreak, but Henderson insisted
that the delicate shell-pink rose honor the man who really invented
``dooryard roses,'' vigorous climbing roses that are tough and
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Or your grandmother's rose might have been Sarah Van Fleet, a
medium pink hybrid rugosa rose named for Van Fleet's wife and
introduced after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Both Van Fleet namesakes are still popular, but neither is as
well known as New Dawn, a sport of Dr. W. Van Fleet, introduced in
1930. A sport is a mutation that causes a single branch of a plant
to look or behave differently from the rest. Discovered years after
Van Fleet's death, New Dawn has all the wonderful properties of Dr.
W. Van Fleet, but it also repeat-blooms. New Dawn was granted the
first U.S. plant patent, so even if you don't use a space in your
name, you may want to check the family tree in your old Bible and
bask in a little horticultural glory.
</P>
<P>
   Variable Beets
</P>
<P>
   Q. My organically grown beets far surpass fresh beets at the
supermarket. The problem is that a limited number mature in the
accepted globe shape, with about 10 to 20 percent of the root above
ground. The remainder grow almost totally above ground and are
cylindrically shaped.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can blame it on the grower or on the seed company, but
either way it isn't your fault (or the beet's).
</P>
<P>
   It is probable that your beet is an open-pollinated variety, one
that is pollinated randomly, rather than a hybrid, where the choice
of parents is controlled by the grower. With open pollination, some
genetic diversity always shows up. If the field of globe-shaped
beets is within 3,000 feet of a field of cylindrical ones,
cross-fertilization can occur. As with humans, some offspring will
resemble Mom, others will look like Dad.
</P>
<P>
   The other possibility is rare, but a packaging mix-up can happen
as seed companies turn millions of seeds from thousands of
vegetable and flower varieties into small packages. When you think
of the number of seeds involved every year, how small they are and
how similar many of them appear, the odds are against perfection.
</P>
<P>
   You may prefer the look of globe-shaped pickled beets in a glass
jar, but I'll bet the cylindrical ones are tasty, too, and easier
to cut into uniform slices.
</P>
<P>
   Slime Mold
</P>
<P>
   Q. Recently, my husband and I put a fine layer of mulch on our
flower bed. A few hours later a yellowish mold started to appear.
It almost looks as though it has a meringue consistency. I shoveled
it off, but the next day it started again in another spot in the
bed. What could it be?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's slime mold. It's one of the most perfectly named
uninvited garden visitors, and each yellow or orange mass is a
single cell, slowly flowing across a wet area, engulfing bacteria
and other microbes. If you had let it alone, you could have watched
it glide along, moving as far as two feet in 12 hours. Clearly you
had better things to do that day, and your approach, scooping it up
with a shovel, was the best you could do.
</P>
<P>
   The slime came in with the mulch, and it loves hot, humid
weather. It will disappear when the mulch dries out or when the
mold has eaten all that is available in it. In the meantime, slime
mold does not harm the plants on which it grows, and it poses no
threat to people, except perhaps for causing a faint level of
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn-Mowing Dangers
</P>
<P>
   Q. I understand that if the lawn-mower blades are not sharp,
they will tear the grass top and make it vulnerable to disease,
because the open edges are rough and fungus can enter. Is this
true?
</P>
<P>
   A. Mowing a lawn is not exactly like giving a haircut. Cutting
living tissue is stressful under the best conditions, but using a
dull blade adds insult to injury, especially on a rotary mower,
which cuts by brute force, whacking instead of scissoring neatly
like a reel mower.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't just the direct ability of disease organisms
to enter the wound, although that plays a part. Even with a sharp
blade, the loss of leaf surface means reduced photosynthesis and
reduced ability to take up water. These stresses make the plant
weaker and less able to fight off diseases, and slow down root
growth. When the cut is ragged and torn, the increased surface area
open to the air means 10 to 15 percent additional water loss
through evaporation and a longer time to heal. Diseases find it
easier to enter a host with weakened defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to make it even harder on your grass? Mow when the
grass is still wet. Not only are fungal populations higher when it
is damp or humid, but the water on the grass also impedes the
lawn-mower blade, leading to a poorer quality cut. Again, rotary
mowers are bigger offenders than reel mowers under these
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting grass right also means cutting it the right height.
While grass may prefer never to be cut, and we may prefer that
golf-course-greens look, the best compromise for a healthy,
good-looking lawn is to cut it two and a half to three inches high
year-round.

THIS WEEK: THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Church of Scientology
</P>
<P>
   Membership: More than 8 million people in more than 80
countries.
</P>
<P>
   History: The Church of Scientology was founded in Los Angeles in
1954 by L. Ron Hubbard, who was then known as an
adventure/science-fiction writer. In 1950, Hubbard made a
presentation to psychiatrists and educators about Dianetics, which
focuses on clearing the mind of disturbing or painful hidden
memories. The American Psychological Association immediately
discouraged the use of Dianetics therapy. But interest in Dianetics
continued to expand, especially after Hubbard's book, ``Dianetics:
The Modern Science of Mental Health,'' was published in 1954. That
year, it developed into a religion _ Scientology _ and the original
Los Angeles church became the Church of Scientology of California.
</P>
<P>
   Beliefs: Scientology is based on Dianetics theory.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard says the mind has two parts: the analytical mind, the
part we are consciously aware of, and the reactive mind, which only
records ``engrams'' of things that happen while we are unconscious
_ especially in times of great pain.
</P>
<P>
   Ridding oneself of these engrams, with the help of an auditor,
is the goal of Dianetics.
</P>
<P>
   Scientology deals with people as spiritual beings, striving for
increased awareness and a higher level of existence.
</P>
<P>
   A person improves his or her levels of awareness _ according to
a scale Hubbard developed _ and eventually is brought to the point
at which he or she has higher intelligence and can solve problems
independently. The state of Clear is reached when a person has
advanced to the highest level of awareness as a spiritual being.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy: Scientology has been controversial since it
started. The church encountered hostility in the 1960s from the
American, Australian and British governments and fought legal
battles to stop government action against it throughout the 1970s.
Recently, Scientologists have come under intense scrutiny in
Germany.

 &HT;    SCIENTISTS PINPOINT JOVIAN MOON AS MOST LIKELY SITE FOR NEARBY
LIFE
 &HT;    Originally budgeted as SPACE-BUGS.
 &HT;    For release Saturday, July 25
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the accumulation of bits and pieces of fact,
scientists are beginning to think that a small planet-like body
just millions of miles from Earth may harbor conditions that could
support life.
</P>
<P>
   On Europa, a moon that races through dim sunlight in an orbit
that takes it around Jupiter every three and a half days, there
appears to be enough heat and water to support forms of life
already found in some of the Earth's more inhospitable places.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows whether Europa has the third ingredient: the
organic material necessary for life as it is understood on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is becoming more than a matter of scientific
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) hopes to launch a spacecraft to orbit the
Jovian moon, chiefly to find out if any part of the huge ocean that
surrounds it is liquid or whether Europa is a just hunk of rock and
metal, covered by a thick shell of ice.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft might carry a small landing vehicle, said Carl
Pilcher, NASA scientific director for Solar System exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The central reason for the agency's interest in Europa, he said,
is the feeling that this, above all other extraterrestrial places
in the solar system, could be the home of some kind of living
organism.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that there are no plans ``for decades to come'' to
attempt to retrieve material from Europa's icy surface and return
it to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued by a National Academy of Sciences committee this
month said that if such a mission ever is launched, NASA must to
take care that stuff brought back to Earth does not contaminate the
planet with extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Importantly, the task group found that there is significant
potential for a living entity to be present in samples returned
from Europa or Ganymede,'' another moon of Jupiter, the committee
stated.
</P>
<P>
   It added that the biological potential on Europa _ which it
called ``one of the most interesting objects in the solar system''
_ appears to be greater than on Ganymede.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, scientists at NASA have been intrigued
by new evidence suggesting that a vast body of salty, liquid water
lies beneath Europa's frozen crust, a sort of ``buried'' ocean that
may be as much as 60 miles deep.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence comes from Galileo, a satellite launched in 1989 to
peer down on Jupiter and its larger moons.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has
rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by
Europa.
</P>
<P>
   Based on studies of its gravitational field, scientists are
pretty much convinced that Europa is composed of a metallic center,
possibly iron, which is surrounded by a shell of rock. The rock
shell is surround in turn by a layer of water.
</P>
<P>
   The question they need answered is whether the water is all
frozen or consists of a liquid ocean on which floats a layer of ice
that may be several miles thick.
</P>
<P>
   From Europa's surface, Jupiter would appear as a huge, dark body
in a mostly black sky, said Gerald Schubert a planetary physicist
at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an
interdisciplinary scientist on the Galileo mission.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly smaller than the Earth's moon, Europa is wrenched by
the tidal forces of Jupiter's overpowering gravity, Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it orbits Jupiter, it contracts, expands, twists and
contorts,'' Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a hell of a lot of heat in the interior as a
result of this tidal effect,'' he said in an interview. ``There
could be a tremendous amount of volcanic activity because of this
internal heat. Whether there actually is or not, we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of heat could explain why the surface of Europa is
covered by fractures and ridges. The criss-crossed lines look much
like the broken ice that covers the Arctic Ocean and coastal areas
of Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   The cracks also could be caused by Europa's flexing tides.
However, some of the cracks show signs that something from
underneath has oozed out and has been deposited on the surface,
Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the gravitational studies, Galileo has measured
magnetic fields surrounding Jupiter and its moons. This has
produced still more intriguing information about Europa.
</P>
<P>
   The magnetic field of Jupiter varies as Europa orbits through
it, he explained. The effect is not unlike conditions inside an
electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   When a material that can conduct electricity passes through a
varying magnetic field, an electric current is generated in the
moving material. That current then generates its own magnetic
field.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding Europa are magnetic patterns that are typical of
fields generated by electric currents, Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   The currents could be generated as Europa moves though Jupiter's
magnetic field. But the key question is what could be conducting
those currents. The metallic core of the body is too far from
Galileo to produce magnetic fields the satellite could detect,
Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   And the rocky shell would not conduct electricity well enough to
carry the current.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears these magnetic fields could only be explained by
electric currents in a salty liquid ocean near the surface,''
Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilcher said the space mission planned for 2003 would carry a
laser altimeter, capable of very precise measurements of the
satellite's distance from the surface of Europa.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jupiter moon is covered with solid ice, then tidal
variations on the surface might be no more than a few meters, but
if there is a large body liquid water sloshing around beneath that
ice, then the tides would be much greater.
</P>
<P>
   The orbiter also would carry infrared imaging equipment to
examine surface features and a sounding radar capable of examining
the subsurface several kilometers deep, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no specific plans for a lander, such a device
might be added as a technology-testing prototype.
</P>
<P>
   If that is done, instruments to test the surface for the
presence of organic chemicals might be added, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But sending a lander to the surface of Europa and retrieving a
sample of the ice or perhaps of the ancient ooze laying along the
sides of the moon's criss-crossed fractures is something that
hasn't even been seriously considered, Pilcher said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: the same gravitational stresses that knead Europa
like a big ice-covered doughball would create almost unthinkable
obstacles to launching the vehicle when it has finished collecting
its samples.

   ``Unleashed: The Wit and Wisdom of Calvin the Dog''
</P>
<P>
   Translated by Chris Glaser
</P>
<P>
   Westminster John Knox Press, $12
</P>
<P>
   If you thought theology was going to the ... no, I won't say it.
It's too easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole truth of life is more than any one dog can chew,''
says Calvin, the Georgia canine author of ``Unleashed.'' What
follows is a collection of musings on everything from church
services (''The best part ... is when they walk around and pet each
other, passing the treat of God'') to parasites (''I have often
wondered why a good God would allow or ordain the existence of
fleas'').
</P>
<P>
   Calvin's thoughts are rather whimsical, as are translator Chris
Glaser's notes on the linguistic oddities of Canine. On the other
hand, orthodoxy and orthodogsy are not always the same thing,
particularly when the source of the ... er ... dogma has a peculiar
predilection for Zen and thinks that ``God is in the tree as much
as in any human creature.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should leave theology to humans. It may be too ruff
for dogs.

Daniel Amos and Paul Johnson.

<P>
   The album is the brainchild of veteran producer Terry Scott
Taylor, who grew up in sunny Southern California listening to surf
music that celebrated perfect waves, fast cars and beautiful,
suntanned girls. But Taylor also heard a subtle celebration of
God's creation.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing subtle about the lyrics here, most of them
penned by Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Wave Perfect,'' written by Taylor and performed by
Smalltown Poets. ``Don't have to look too far/The point of our
devotion/Praise God/Wave perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The music makes this one of the coolest albums of the year. The
lyrics make it more than that.
</P>
<P>
   As they might have said in the '60s, it's righteous, man.

   Watson and Crick have nothing on Smit and Kinkhorst when it
comes to unraveling the mysteries of life.
</P>
<P>
   Smit and Kinkhorst?
</P>
<P>
   Matthijs Sypkens Smit and Thijs Kinkhorst are two men from
Utrecht, Holland, whose Love Calculator on the World Wide Web
(www.lovecalculator.com) brings a bizarre _ some might say
completely perverse _ mathematical rigor to matters of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Simply type in two names, and after a brief calculation, up pops
a percentage, indicating a couple's chances for romantic success.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you doubt the reliability of the Love Calculator, consider
the evidence: Bruce Willis and Demi Moore: 45 percent. Woody Allen
and Mia Farrow: 38 percent. Allen and Soon-Yi Previn? 79 percent.
Romeo and Juliet: 98 percent (Remember: The Love Calculator
measures compatibility. Fate does not compute.) Are Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman really that happy together? According to Dr. Love _
they scored 99 percent _ they are.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's not infallible. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton
scored a predictable 18 percent. But Liz Taylor and Richard Burton:
82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Smit and Kinkhorst, who together are Dr. Love on their Web site,
offer somber words with each calculation, like this: ``Dr. Love
thinks that a relationship between Tristan and Isolde has a
reasonable chance of working out, but on the other hand, it might
not. Your relationship may suffer good and bad times. If things
might not be working out as you would like them to, do not hesitate
to talk about it with the person involved. Spend time together,
talk with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, then, Smit and Kinkhorst rely on years of accumulated
wisdom. Or do they? Now 18 years old, the two computer science
students were both 16 when they first put the Love Calculator on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, wisdom plays no role in Dr. Love's prognoses. It's all
arithmetic. The calculator uses an algorithm familiar to
elementary-school children and math teachers around the world. It
starts by looking for the number of times the letters L, O, V, E
and S occur in the two names; then, through a series of addition
sequences, it produces the percentage. For example: Bill Clinton
and Hillary Rodham. L: 5, O: 2, V: 0, E: 0, S: 0.
</P>
<P>
   Write those numbers down and you get 52000. Then add up the
individual numbers _ 5(plus)2, 2(plus)0, 0(plus)0, 0(plus)0 _ and
you get 7200. Keep doing the same addition of individual numbers
for each sum.
</P>
<P>
   If you add the numerals in 7200 in the same way, you get 920
(7(plus)2, 2(plus)0, 0(plus)0). Do the addition on 920 (9(plus)2,
2(plus)0) and the result is 112. Once again with 112 (1(plus)1,
2(plus)1), and you get down to two numerals, which gives you the
chance of a successful relationship: 23 percent. The system makes
perfect sense, to a third-grader.
</P>
<P>
   Smit said the Web site had received about 2.5 million hits since
it first went up. He and Kinkhorst have received e-mail from around
the world, thanking them for the service they have done for romance
in the late 20th century. Wrote a grateful calculatee from Brazil:
``I have put my name and my first wife's and I have gotten 0
percent; the incredible thing is: we got divorced 15 years ago! On
the other hand I got 97 percent with my second wife, and we have
been together for 12 years!''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote another: ``On the eve of our fourth date (the day before
Valentine's Day), a friend called me to tell me that she had
entered my name and my date's in the love calculator _ we got 97
percent. Strangely enough, we fell madly in love and are now
engaged to be married. Are we your first Love Calculator wedding?''
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled visitors, Smit said, also send e-mail. ``When people
get a low score and react to it, they most often use offensive
language or say it's all a big fake,'' he said.

`WHAT WOULD JESUS DO?' CAN BE A DANGEROUS QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;

Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative CONNIE
WHITE in Kansas City at (800) 444-0267 or (816) 822-8448, or fax

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    WWJD is showing up everywhere -- on wristbands, T-shirts and
jewelry -- and on every teenager I meet. Short for ``What Would
Jesus Do?'', WWJD is the latest popular religion fad to engulf
conservative Protestant churches.
 &HT;    The current craze started with a youth group at Calvary Reformed
Church in Holland, Mich. The teenagers dedicated themselves to ask
the question ``What would Jesus do?'' when faced with a moral
decision.
 &HT;    To advertise this commitment, they created bracelets displaying
the letters WWJD. The community embraced the idea and it quickly
spread nationally. To date, more than 14 million bracelets have
been sold.
 &HT;    However popular with trendy Christian teens, the idea is not
new. The youth group was influenced by the 1896 pietist classic,
``In His Steps,'' written by Charles Sheldon. A Congregationalist
minister, Sheldon wrote the book as a series of sermon-stories for
his flock. However, the novel became an all-time religious
bestseller with perhaps as many as 30 million copies in print
worldwide.
 &HT;    The story is simple. On a Sunday morning, ``Into the midst of
perfect accord and concord between preacher and audience, there
came a remarkable interruption.'' A tramp wandered into comfortable
First Church and began to preach.
 &HT;    ``What do you Christians mean by following the steps of Jesus?''
After rehearsing a litany of social ills and repeating the hymn
sung by the congregation he states, ``It seems to me there's an
awful lot of trouble in the world that somehow wouldn't exist if
people who sing such songs went and lived them out. I suppose I
don't understand. What would Jesus do?''
 &HT;    The good church people, moved by the tramp's plea, pledge to
live their lives for a year asking themselves, ``What would Jesus
do?'' And, of course, their lives, town, and indeed, the nation are
transformed.
 &HT;    As literature, ``In His Steps'' is neither memorable -- steeped
in late Victorian romanticism -- nor a likely draw for teenage
tastes. But WWJD enthusiasts do not care. They find the question --
What Would Jesus Do? -- compelling.
 &HT;    WWJD is a better question than those religious conservatives
have asked in recent years -- such as ``Do you support the
Christian Coalition?'' ``Are you for family values?'' and ``Do you
believe homosexuality is a sin?''
 &HT;    An improvement on the right-wing politics afflicting evangelical
churches, WWJD nevertheless raises some concerns.
 &HT;    Critics accuse the WWJD movement of being a smokescreen for the
religious right's political agenda -- an argument I find
unconvincing. Idealistic and sincere, WWJD teens seem unlikely
pawns in a giant right-wing conspiracy.
 &HT;    Rather, their questions are too narrow and individualistic. For
example, the WWJD CD challenges teens to respond as Jesus would
regarding the death of a father, sexual temptation, rejection by
classmates, and ``little things in life ... like a bandmate who
spends too long in the shower.''
 &HT;    Cruising the WWJD website, http://www.wwjd.com, seekers can find
nary a word about politics. WWJD is private piety and reveals a
certain evangelical ennui regarding public policy. These folks do
not want social revolution; they are just trying to cope with small
problems.
 &HT;    That's the problem. Finally, after years of asking bad
questions, evangelicals are now asking a good question. But they
are not asking it in the correct arena. This question should be
asked of American political life.
 &HT;    Charles Sheldon was not so shy. In his book, those who ask
``What Would Jesus Do?'' embrace numerous progressive causes. The
story climaxes when Trade Unionists and Christian Socialists, led
by an Episcopal bishop, organize the ``common people'' into a
socialist cooperative for Jesus (Really. Read the book).
 &HT;    Sheldon was a theological liberal, a Christian Socialist, an
early feminist, a pacifist and ecumenical minister who condemned
racism and anti-Semitism. What would Jesus do? Jesus would vote
Socialist. Jesus would defend the poor, women, blacks, Jews and
oppressed people. Jesus would oppose the military-industrial
complex. Jesus would stand up for gays and lesbians. Jesus would
not buy products made in sweat shops. Jesus would condemn tobacco
companies.
 &HT;    Moreover, Jesus would not market WWJD junk on the web. Jesus
would not join the Christian Coalition. Jesus would not be caught
dead at a Promise Keepers rally.
 &HT;    WWJD is a dangerous question. Odd that evangelicals are asking
it. Seems as if mainline Protestants and Catholics should be. After
all, their churches are already trying to answer it. And, Jesus
promised, his way would be hard and unpopular. It's that other way
-- the broad, trendy and commercially successful one -- that leads
to destruction.
 &HT;    WWJD: Jesus would not ask a question for which he really did not
want the answer.

ANNAN URGES RENEWAL OF PEACE TALKS IN MEXICO'S CHIAPAS STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The United Nations cannot intervene to help
resolve conflicts in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated calls for such intervention by many human
rights organizations here and abroad, the world body has no role to
play, unless specifically asked by the Mexican government, Annan
told reporters after meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations does not get involved in the internal
affairs of a country without a request from its government, and
there has been no request,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Without referring to the Zapatista insurgent group by name, he
urged the rebel leaders to meet with Zedillo's government to forge
a durable peace in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any situation like this, I would urge the other side to
work with sustained and consistent effort with the government to
find a solution,'' the secretary-general said. ``I would also urge
that we all do what we can to encourage process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas led a brief but bloody rebellion in January 1994,
demanding rights and greater democracy for impoverished Indians in
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   While government and Zapatista negotiators reached a tentative
peace agreement two years ago, the accord was never implemented and
tensions have erupted into periodic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The state police and Mexican soldiers have clashed with
Zapatista civilian supporters in raids on several municipalities
since January. In June, the police and soldiers engaged armed
Zapatista militiamen in an encounter that killed 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   In December, 45 Zapatista sympathizers were massacred at a
church by paramilitary forces with ties to the state government.
</P>
<P>
   And in another blow to peace, Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz
last month abandoned efforts to get government negotiators together
with Zapatista rebels, saying that the Zedillo government's peace
efforts were a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Annan urged all parties to pursue peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chiapas is a complex issue; it is important not to lose
heart,'' he said. ``Four years seems like a long time, but we must
find ways to work through the complexities to a peaceful
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan arrived here Tuesday on a three-day visit, the last leg of
a Latin American tour that also included Argentina, Brazil,
Guatemala and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   He said Latin American nations have made ``tremendous strides''
economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continent has made a lot of progress. Today, almost every
government is democratically elected, and most have gone through
economic reforms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can improve with further development so that the poor and
needy also participate in the advances.''

`PASSION' DRIVEN BY LOVE OF A LEOPARD
</HEADLINE>
 IN THE DESERT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a little disconcerting to step from the unrelenting Texas
heat into a movie set in an unrelenting desert. But you'll find
yourself transported by ``Passion in the Desert,'' the latest
Honore de Balzac story to be translated to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Director Lavinia Currier's adaptation of Balzac's novella ``Une
Passion dans la Desert'' has so much unforgettable imagery that her
gift suggests an instinct for filmmaking that's precerebral, like
that of George Miller or Jane Campion. Currier creates a singular
visual context for Balzac's material, which sounds difficult on the
face of it. The huge dollops of romanticism and absurdity on the
page can translate into mere silliness on the screen. But Currier
gives in to the lushness of Balzac and adds an element of
dreaminess to ``Passion.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a story about man's vanity _ as is much of Balzac _ and his
equally vain attempts to impose order on the wilderness. (The story
is also said to have grown from Balzac's insinuation that a famous
Parisian lion tamer's animal training technique came from a unique
relationship with his cat.) In ``Passion,'' Augustin (Ben Daniels),
a proud Napoleonic officer, is determined to prove that Egypt can
be tamed. In his rigidly logical mind, the desert can be handled.
</P>
<P>
   But after a vicious battle with a warrior clan and a sandstorm,
Augustin and Jean-Michel (Michel Piccoli), an artist who is
documenting the regiment's progress, are stranded. One of the most
oddly poignant moments in recent films comes when the formal
Augustin, clad in his heavy wool uniform, marches through the
desert with an umbrella over his head. Jean-Michel, his lips
stained from the paints he drank to keep from dehydrating, shambles
next to Augustin.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, only Augustin is left. After fleeing Bedouins (he
snatches the veil off a Bedouin woman's face in a scene that
Currier gives the force of rape), Augustin hides out in a cave
where he encounters a leopard. ``Passion'' then becomes both dreamy
and naturalistic, as Augustin falls deeply into the world of the
cat he names Simoom. Akela, the cat who plays Simoom, is runty and
stubborn-looking, a little less regal than the leopards who
regularly snack on slower prey on the Discovery Channel. (Not the
``delightful coquette'' Blazac wrote about.) But she is
distinctive, and willingly submits to Augustin's languorous licking
of her coat.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is entrancing because of Akela's appeal and Daniels'
recklessness. We actually do see a relationship develop between man
and leopard, because he is clearly in the same shot with her much
of the time; this isn't ``Bringing Up Baby.'' We see the foppish
superiority beaten out of Daniels. But even though he surrenders
the movie to the leopard _ in any shot, our eyes go immediately to
her _ he is a generous actor. (On the other hand, it's gotta be
hard to upstage a jungle cat.) Yes, the movie does get a little
foolish. But it shows a bravery and a lust for visual clarity
that's impressive. One thing's for sure; there aren't many other
movies around in which an 18th-century military man falls in love
with a leopard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passion in the Desert'' is rated PG-13 for brief nudity,
violence and suggestions of unusual sexuality.

IN THE LABS, WEARABLE COMPUTERS ARE BECOMING A REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wearable computers have long been a staple of science fiction.
But the wearable computers that were the darlings of magazine
covers in the early '90s _ bulky, underpowered strap-ons with
cyborg styling _ have practically been pariahs in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   That may change, many analysts and academics say, with the
emergence of a new class of wearable computers that are faster,
lighter and smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Xybernaut, IBM and Micro Optical are paving the
way for computers that will literally go straight to people's
heads, displaying all their data on head-mounted monitors, some so
tiny that they could double as ordinary eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Xybernaut Mobile Assistant 4, presented last month
at the PC Expo in New York. Weighing less than two pounds, the MA4,
as its engineers like to call it, is designed to be worn on a
person's belt (along with a four-to-six-hour battery pack). The
Mobile Assistant packs a 266-megahertz processor and a 4-gigabyte
hard drive, says its maker, the Xybernaut Corp. in Fairfax, Va. It
also responds to voice commands and links to a 10-ounce, full-color
head-mounted display.
</P>
<P>
   The Mobile Assistant is a fully functional computer that uses
voice commands, requires neither a desktop nor lap and doesn't need
hands (a wrist-mounted minikeyboard is optional) to operate, said
Carol Covin, the director of marketing for Xybernaut. Her son,
David Covin Jr., a Web programmer, wore a Mobile Assistant on a
1,300-mile, five-month trek along the Appalachian Trail last year.
Using the computer, he communicated with the rest of the wired
world through E-mail and kept an on-line journal, giving a glimpse
of what wearable computers can do.
</P>
<P>
   The applications are almost endless for wearable computers, Ms.
Covin said, especially for people who need easy access in the field
to vast amounts of text, schematics and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about a trouble-shooter roaming the factory floor,'' she
said. ``They used to have to go back to a central site. Now they
access information wherever they are, calling up technical manuals
with this technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Stern, a spokesman for the Chicago Transit Authority, said
Xybernaut's wearable computers were being studied for use by the
authority's inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have literally gone into the deep end with
wearables: The Australian Institute of Marine Science sells a Wet
PC, a wearable computer that can be used underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Work at the Micro Optical Corp. in Boston has attracted the
attention of the military (the United States Army Soldier Systems
Command was a major financial contributor to the development of the
special eye-glasses), as well as industry.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers there have developed functional mock-ups of
eyeglasses that can electronically display computer data through
one or both of the eyeglass lenses. The image is actually a virtual
display, said Paul M. Zavracky, president and chief executive of
the company; it appears to be about 20 inches in front of the
wearer and to be about a quarter the size of a standard computer
screen. The glasses can be used with wearable as well as more
conventional computers, Zavracky said. The hardware that turns the
glasses into monitors does so without adding ``significant'' weight
to them, he said. When the glasses are turned off, they revert to
being simple eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Bitten by the bug to wear a computer, Ted Selker, a technologist
and IBM Fellow, recently created a flexible, two-pound version of
an IBM Think Pad 760 notebook computer. The prototype can be worn
on the belt and fits into the small of a person's back, conforming
to body shape.
</P>
<P>
   Selker was able to shrink much of a notebook computer, making it
a wearable one, by removing its battery, floppy drive and disk. He
created a stand-alone battery that can also be worn on a belt. He
replaced the hard drive with a much smaller PCMCIA hard disk. Its
monitor is mounted on the head, and a small keyboard hangs from a
belt.
</P>
<P>
   Wearable computers are not likely to hit the consumer market any
time soon and may take awhile to be adopted in industrial settings.
But industrial uses are expected to take off once more systems
become available and more managers realize the range of what they
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wearable computers will remain a curiosity for the next three
years,'' said a research note issued in March by the Gartner Group,
a technology information and consulting company based in Stamford,
Conn. ``By 2006 it will have grown to become a mainstream technique
for maintenance, inspection, warehousing and other mobile
industrial applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rhinelander, an analyst for Forrester Research in Boston,
many people were already wearing computers every day without giving
them much thought. People are wearing on their belts and in their
pockets millions of Palm Pilots and similar devices, cellular
phones, pagers and compact disk players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Packing a Palm Pilot on your hip is no big deal,'' he said.
``But when you start blending the computer into your person, making
it an extension of your attire, people start to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people resist the idea, Rhinelander said, because it feels
like ``an encroachment of technology.'' Plus, he said, many people
still have a fair degree of suspicion and fear about computers.
``If you are wearing a computer, people want to know if it is
recording their information, if it is being used against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Picard, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Media Laboratory, said a great deal of research was
being done on making wearable computers more comfortable, making
them conform to human needs rather than forcing humans to conform
to computers' needs. Merely making these computers smaller is not
necessarily the solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep making computers smaller, to the point where you can
almost inhale them,'' she said with a chuckle. ``But that is not
solving some of the hard problems that we have right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Much work remains on ``getting the data in and out in a form
that is understandable for people and effortless for people,''
Picard added. For example, she said, ``someone might be happy to
wear a funny hat'' _ a computer monitor _ ``on their heads when
they play with their children, but not when they are meeting with a
potential customer. People might want different kinds of wearable
computers that are more appropriate for various uses.''

   At MIT, where annual symposiums on the technology have been held
for years, Picard said work was being done on wearable computers
that would run continuously, performing a broad range of day-to-day
functions. Imagine, she said, a wearable computer that runs a video
camera that is always on and focused on whatever the person wearing
it looks at. Such a device could make never-miss-a-shot home movies
or record a professor's lecture for a student who had the bad luck
to doze off in the lecture hall.
</P>
<P>
   And remember Zavracky's eyeglass monitors?
</P>
<P>
   He said he could easily envision his Micro Optical eyeglasses
linked to new mobile computers that would permit business travelers
to work away on crowded airplanes in serene security.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where it's going,'' Zavracky said.

GRAMMAR AID FOR THOSE WHO/WHOM NEED IT

Hofstra University

<P>
   In the mythical Golden Days, everyone had Miss Thistlebottom for
eighth-grade English. (She was almost always Miss. Only in rare
incarnations could she be spoken to as Miss T., though she was
always spoken about that way.)
</P>
<P>
   She was an imposing woman with hair in a steel-gray bun and a
formidable grasp of the minutiae of English grammar. Through force
of will, and occasionally, according to legend, through force of
ruler across knuckles, she was able to impart understanding of
gerunds and infinitives to students by the cowering roomful.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, as we all know, Miss T. retired some time ago, and
American education just ain't the same without her. The debates
about whether tough-love grammar can ever work again in a
postliterate world alternate between hysterical and mind-numbing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, four million Americans a year turn 18 and are loosed
upon the world, misplacing their modifiers, garbling their syntax
and dangling their participles. What to do? Can't computers help?
</P>
<P>
   Grammar software for kids is available in a great variety of
flavors and prices, but in an effort to make it appealing enough
for grade-school students, designers have filled the great majority
of the programs with cartoon rabbits and too-cute jingles. All of
that is guaranteed to be off-putting to people who see better
grammar as a step toward career success, immigrants who want to be
more fluent in their adopted language and anyone over 10.
</P>
<P>
   The software packages reviewed here are designed to teach
grammar, not correct the grammar you have already written. Major
word-processing programs like Microsoft Word and Corel's
Wordperfect now include grammar checkers, which are almost never
used but chew up acres of hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   But be warned: they are no more reliable than spell checkers,
which have probably contributed almost as much as television to the
national inability to spell.
</P>
<P>
   Given how much poor grammar is afoot on the national landscape,
and given how good computers are at managing the sort of drill that
mastering good grammar requires, one would think that grammar
software would be an extremely crowded field. Not so. Bookstore
owners and college teachers shake their heads when asked about
grammar software.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most established programs, Queue's Mastering English
Grammar, is as ugly and uninviting as any grade-school primer, but
Jonathan Kantrowitz, the program's developer and Queue's chief
executive, said it would be a waste of money to try to recast it in
an attractive package. Many have tried, he said, but most have
failed. Besides, he said, English teachers like it frumpy.
</P>
<P>
   But with the growing interest in distance education as a cheaper
alternative to four years of living among the ivy, several new
grammar programs have emerged in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   These products all do a fairly good job with grammar basics.
None, even those that cost hundreds and even thousands of dollars,
can touch a really good grammar book for depth, but their format
may appeal to many. And people seeking grammar help are likely to
appreciate the effort to use the power of computers to make the
subject more palatable. Among its true believers, grammar excites a
level of passion bewildering to the civilian population. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALL WRITE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (McGraw-Hill; $27.50; Windows 3.0 and later and NT.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALL WRITE is designed to work in two ways, as a grammar workbook
and as a grammar handbook or reference book.
</P>
<P>
   The student selects a chapter _ verb tenses, say, or pronouns _
then selects an objective or lesson from within that chapter, like
perfect and progressive tenses or pronoun case. The program then
asks questions and grades the answers with traffic lights showing
green for correct and red for incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   For actual instruction, the user goes to the help files, which
explain the concept in two levels of detail called Tell Me and Show
Me.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the practice session, the student is given a test.
If the student scores 70 percent or better on the post-test, a
little green box lights up next to that lesson on the contents
page. If the student scores less than 70, the box turns red.
</P>
<P>
   If the student quits that lesson in the middle, it turns yellow.
The program can also be used on a network for a class; in that
case, the instructor can raise or lower the passing bar.
</P>
<P>
   Given its versatility, this is a top choice for either home or
school use. At the price, it is very good value.
</P>
<P>
   But the program is very much a work in progress. For example, it
promises animation to teach concepts, but fewer than 20 animations
are included, and those are primitive and hardly worth the
trouble. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MULTIMEDIA HIGH SCHOOL GRAMMAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pro One; $14.95; Windows 3.0 and later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This software covers the basics _ parts of speech, agreement,
tense _ but without the polish and visual slickness of much pricier
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Each lesson begins with a short video clip of 15 to 20 seconds
in which one of the program's developers, Stan Satz, an English
instructor at Craven Community College in New Bern, N.C., lists the
topics to be covered. The lessons come in a set of multiple-choice
questions. When the correct answer is selected, a little box opens
up bearing a cartoon thumbs up, a smiley-face sun or some other
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   The audio ranges from an enthusiastic ``good'' to a bar of the
``Hallelujah'' chorus. Wrong answers get a sound effect like the
sound of breaking glass. Such things age quickly, but the sound can
be turned off.
</P>
<P>
   The program has some typos and other minor glitches, none really
serious, but enough to be jarring.
</P>
<P>
   And the use of video clips and audio is hardly Industrial Light
and Magic quality. At the end of each chapter, the program offers a
video clip. But the clip is of Professor Satz discussing an error
in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   A student encounters three kinds of explanations for each
problem. An ``example'' button opens two or three more examples of
the objective being presented, like subject-verb agreement, say, or
participles. The ``worked'' button explains the correct answer,
often also explaining why each of the other choices is not correct.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Generally, that is very useful. The ``details'' button is a
context-sensitive reference book of sorts. Clicking on it opens the
appropriate point in the reference to explain the grammar rule.
</P>
<P>
   The program does keep score, but since wrong answers are
instantly flagged and the user can try over and over again without
penalty, there is no need ever to record an incorrect answer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

   DEVELOPING WRITING SKILLS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Queue; $150 for a single user, $750 for a network license;

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For anyone expecting bells and whistles _ or even recent
programming _ these two CDs from Queue will be major
disappointments. Despite fairly recent copyright dates (1995 for
Mastering English Grammar and 1992 for Developing Writing Skills),
the programs date from the early to mid-80s and show their age
badly.
</P>
<P>
   Developing Writing Skills is broadly focused on all aspects of
writing _ doing research, outlining and other elements _ and is
aimed at students in junior high school. Mastering English Grammar
is more narrowly focused and somewhat more advanced.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental problem with this software is that it might as
well be a spiral-bound workbook. At least then it wouldn't need an
expensive machine to run on, you could shove it into a backpack,
and it would be cheap enough that it wouldn't break your heart if
you left it on the train.
</P>
<P>
   The software uses plain black-on-white text _ and remember, this
is for Macintosh, which is known for fancy graphics. Each screen
makes a statement like, ``Pronouns have to agree with their
antecedents,'' say, or, ``Use a semicolon between two phrases of
equal weight,'' and then asks a question with a multiple-choice or
fill-in-the-blank answer.
</P>
<P>
   About the only other thing that this software does that a
workbook would not is keep score of the right and wrong answers. It
also runs a rudimentary clock to track how long a student spent on
the lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kantrowitz, Queue's founder and the chief developer for
both these programs, said in a telephone interview that the bland,
no-frills look was on purpose. The product is designed for
classrooms, not home use, he said, which means that teachers, not
parents, do the buying. And teachers, he said, especially English
teachers, ``want to see stuff that looks like textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   English teachers ``are probably the most computerphobic of all
curriculum areas,'' he said. Besides, he added, grammar is simply
``not a subject that has mass appeal.'' &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the high end of grammar software are a number of programs
designed for classroom use. These come with teacher modules, which
allow an instructor to assign lessons to individual students or
groups of students and to track student progress in all kinds of
ways.
</P>
<P>
   However, these programs can also profitably be used as
stand-alone programs. Part of their premium price is wasted, but
these expensive programs also tend to be the best designed.
</P>
<P>
   Skillsbank 4 is chock full of bells and whistles. This is
juggernaut software from a major player in education. Of the
programs discussed here, this one takes most advantage of the world
of computers, circa 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When a student logs on, a few bars of jaunty music play and a
well-modulated voice explains what to do. (You can turn off the
audio.) This is a well thought-out package, taking full advantage
of current-generation multimedia computers. It is clearly not a
game, but it is designed to be enjoyable as well as informative.
</P>
<P>
   A nice feature is a category of lesson called ``thinking,''
which invites a student to analyze, rather than simply repeat,
material previously covered. Not surprisingly, given the strong
audio and visual dimensions of this program, one of these exercises
in inductive reasoning is built around the premise of being one of
two writers for a television show.
</P>
<P>
   At this high end, there are a number of other major players,
whose products should probably be examined before committing
several thousand dollars, even if it is the school board's money.
These include the Computer Curriculum Corp., Jostens Learning Corp.
and A(plus) Learning System.
</P>
<P>
   Tutorsystems, a much smaller company, has a Basic Skills package
of both English and math and a more advanced Career English Series
for adult learners. It is designed for networked classroom use but
can be used alone.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most programs, this one is truly tutorial in that it
tells you things and then asks questions, rather than asking
questions and then explaining the answers. It also goes into more
advanced grammar principles than any of the other programs. A nice
feature is a link on every screen to the American Heritage Talking
Dictionary, which is bundled with the program.

   ``Elvis, Hank, and Me''
</P>
<P>
   By Horace Logan with Bill Sloan
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press, $23.95
</P>
<P>
   THE AUTHOR: Shreveport, La., was a small city of about 100,000
in the years after World War II. Certainly not the sort of place
one would expect to be a breeding ground for country and rock music
legends.
</P>
<P>
   But it did have a huge, 50,000-watt clear-channel radio station,
and a pioneering program director named Horace ``Hoss'' Logan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Logan created the ``Louisiana Hayride'' as an
alternative to the sometimes-staid ``Grand Ole Opry,'' and
``Hayride'' became a radio springboard for entertainers who didn't
fit the Nashville mold.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST THINGS FIRST: Before reading a line of copy, turn to Page
263 for the list of artists who appeared on the ``Louisiana
Hayride.'' Elvis Presley is listed alphabetically between Webb
Pierce and Felton Pruett. Gene Autry is two names down from Betty
Amos and the Lump Boys. George Jones, one entry above Oakie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Grand Ole Opry'' of the day didn't allow any drums, wind
instruments, electrified fiddles (dadgum that Bob Wills) or
anything else unorthodox, Logan recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But the freewheeling ``Hayride'' didn't have those restrictions.
So Elvis, Hank Sr. and Johnny Cash got a chance to happen, as did
Jim Reeves, Slim Whitman, Kitty Wells, Hank Thompson, George Jones
and Johnny Horton.
</P>
<P>
   THE DIRT: The book offers some pretty salacious details,
including a bit of speculation on the 20-year-old Elvis' sexual
appetite and Faron Young's abrupt pickup line. Hank Williams' sorry
decline is graphic enough to explain his bladder habits during the
last two months of his life.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Easy, fun and gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a personal ad. It's copy for a tool catalog.
Specifically, solid brass and rosewood knobs, for home woodworking
projects, on sale in the latest catalog from Bridge City Tool Works
of Portland, Ore. Elsewhere, their scratch awl balances like ``a
conductor's baton.'' The joint maker's hammer is
``flame-hardened,'' with a ``long, willowy neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Garrett Wade, Lee Valley, Woodcraft and other high-end tool
catalog businesses, Bridge City Tool Works is digging for a bright,
hard nugget within the expanding $14 billion industry for
woodworking tools, materials and supplies. The vein of gold: the
new, upscale, fine-woodworking hobbyist, for whom extraordinary
hand tools are like French cooking knives or English gardening
implements.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines like Fine Woodworking and American Woodworker inform
him. (It is still a ``he,'' by about 84 percent.) Schools like the
Anderson Ranch in Aspen, Colo., and the Center for Furniture
Craftsmanship in Rockport, Maine, instruct him. The Internet nails
him at home, with a flood of sites like the Electronic Neanderthal
that let prospective ark-builders buy, sell and bond as if at a
medieval guild.
</P>
<P>
   Iron John has become Wood Chuck, and he (average age 45) is the
affluent advance guard of what could easily be one of the leading
retirement life-style activities for the baby-boom generation,
right up there with cooking and gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not poised to be life style,'' said Peter Korn, the
director of the Center for Furniture Craftsmanship. ``It IS.'' The
center's current enrollment of 250 _ average age, early 40s _
represents a 500 percent increase over 1993. Korn is considering a
cooking school next door.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture-making and cabinetry hand tools are the Grail for
fine-woodworking hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of Lie-Nielsen hand planes, Japanese miter
squares and Calvo brass-headed mallets. Priced in the hundreds of
dollars, two or three times the price of their cost-conscious
cousins from Sears or Stanley, they are actually more precious _
made of rarer woods and metals, like mahogany and bronze, not
hickory and cast-iron. They get the job done like a bare fist, but
they are as sensitive as you are.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking make-your-own-rifle racks. Think Mission
mantelpieces (Fine Woodworking, August issue) and Mackintosh chairs
(American Woodworking, August issue).
</P>
<P>
   For this, blame Norm Abram, co-host of ``This Old House'' and
host of ``New Yankee Workshop,'' whose renovation and woodworking
television shows reach 14.5 million people a week, for the
explosion of interest in hobbyist woodworking at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to do the show for four years, and we're in our
11th year,'' Abram said. ``Interest in woodworking is absolutely
growing. It's moving into an upscale, white-collar group. People in
their 40s to 60s, who are looking for an adventurous hobby. It's
like therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some would question the expense of the new crusade, for
some baby boomers, it is also pure nostalgia. Paradise _ high
school shop classes of the 1940s and '50s _ regained. Harry Urban,
the publisher of Custom Woodworking Business, said, ``Middle-age
boomers who think back to their grandfather who made a chair, go
out and spend $100,000 on woodworking equipment to get past their
frustration point of sitting in front of a computer all day, by
making something with their hands to show to their family.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of its subscribers, according to Timothy
Schreiner, the editor of Fine Woodworking, showed their household
income was $100,000, ``which is very high, if you think of it as a
blue collar interest,'' Schreiner said. ``We keep running into
orthopedists.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodworking hobbyists in the United States _ up 7 percent from
1995 _ spent more than $315 million on hand tools last year,
compared with $180 million three years ago, according to an
unreleased 1998 survey commissioned by American Woodworker
magazine. While this is still a fraction of the spending for power
tools, which was more than $1.5 billion, it is exquisite hand tools
and fine woodworking that have seized the imagination of the
high-end hobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Woodcraft, a fine-woodworkers' catalog, has enough confidence in
the future to push into national retail stores, with 33 open and 10
to come. ``We see similarities to gardening,'' said Mark Wirthlin,
the marketing director. ``A lot of people are enjoying the hobby at
Lowe's or Home Depot, but they don't make the radar of exclusive
catalogs and don't know the cool stuff that's available.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hobbyists are converts from power tools. ``About three
years ago, the pendulum began swinging back with a vengeance, to
hand tools,'' said Gary Chinn, the president of Garrett Wade, the
first of the ``boutique'' woodworking catalog businesses, and the
most widely recognized. The company, which mails 600,000 catalogs a
year, discontinued sales of power tools in 1996. ``It's a cultural
thing as much as anything else,'' Chinn said. ``People became
unhappy with the fact that there was nothing of them in what they
produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, blame Norm Abram. ``Everybody was watching Norm do his
power-tool paint-by-number woodworking in his clean workshop, but
you never saw any sawdust,'' said Patrick Leach, a fine-woodworker
who markets reproductions of antique hand tools on the Internet, at
www.supertool.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys were left with an empty feeling _ that there's
got to be more to it than an on and off switch,'' said Leach, who
is renovating his Cape-style house and Federal period house, both
in Massachusetts, with hand tools.
</P>
<P>
   David Sloan, the editor and publisher of American Woodworker,
described the split as one between ``product people'' ``If there's
an electric outlet near, that's the path'' _ and ``process
people,'' who ``take pleasure in the scenic byways, and hand tools
explore that. They give you a tactile result _ a feel, a smell, a
rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hand tool woodworkers are fond of comparing themselves to fly
fishermen _ another patient elite, who insist there is art in their
craft. Hand tools are landing woodworkers the same sense of finely
calibrated accomplishment _ justifying, they claim, the same
obsession with the expensive esoterics of the equipment, what
Patrick Leach calls the ```gizmosity' factor, as gizmos,'' he said,
``which gives them their sex appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Abram, who has a carpentry background, argued that appeal of
woodworking was in the skill. ``It's the hands of the craftsman and
not the rosewood handle that makes woodworking fine.'' He added:
``Some would look at `New Yankee Workshop' and say it's not fine
woodworking. It is. There is a difference in quality in power
tools, too. There are people who buy expensive hand tools as an
investment, and I think, what a waste. They won't be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Abram, coincidentally, tried fly fishing last year. ``It was
very calming,'' he said. ``But if I don't catch fish, I don't
worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Useful, humble tools are the last things one would expect
high-end airs and attitude about, but experienced hobbyists claim
that they are generally of higher quality than the selections of
commercial tools found at mass-market home improvement centers,
though add-ons like exotic wood or precious-metal detailing raise
the price like a roof beam.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Reed, the president of the San Diego Fine Woodworkers
Association and a part-time woodworking teacher at Palomar College
in San Marcos, Calif., says they also do their job with some
finesse. ``Everybody lusts to have an engraved Bridge City
tri-square,'' she said. ``I have one _ it's accurate. The tools you
pick up at your local mall are not accurate. Squares are often not
square and levels aren't level.''
</P>
<P>
   High-end woodworking companies also succeed in selling their
fine hand tools to covetous beginners because of the bells and
whistles. ``They are proficiency by association for beginners,''
Peter Korn said, skeptically citing the belief, witnessed among his
own students, that the better the tool, the better the work.
</P>
<P>
   Behind many of the newer, high-end hand tools are small
entrepreneurs, dedicated to manufacturing them and marketing them
to fine-furniture and cabinet makers _ while global tool businesses
like the Stanley Works, with woodworking hand tool sales of $754
million in 1997, have slowly swung their cannons toward contractors
and renovators.
</P>
<P>
   With $1.25 million in sales last year, a 30 percent growth over
1996, Lie-Nielsen Tool Works, in Warren, Maine, has a reputation
polished both by woodworkers and collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Lie-Nielsen, 44, its founder, has a narrow, angular nose
that looks planed by a wood plane. The son of a wooden boat
builder, he is an English major, a woodworker and a hand tool
enthusiast. He could be one of his own customers.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-year stint at Garrett Wade in New York,
Lie-Nielsen returned to Maine in 1981 to try his own hand at tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a market, but it was unclear how healthy it was,''
he said. ``Specialized hand tools were looked on as being
overpriced and fancy and too good to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Lie-Nielsen started making planes in an unheated woodshed on the
200-year-old Maine property where he was subsistence-farming. He
taught himself how to make a wood plane by hand, from forging the
iron for the casing, on up. His mother, Margaret, was his
bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with 25 workers in a 10,000-square-foot former ice house
on Route 1, he is manufacturing a line of roughly 16 distinct
models of wood planes, based largely on discontinued Stanley
designs.

   ``Stanley used to have a hundred different planes, many of them
with very specific uses,'' Lie-Nielsen said. ``They're super tools.
They should never have fallen out of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Jones, the president of the hand tool product group at
the Stanley Works, defended the company's position in leaving parts
of its illustrious past behind, to serve new, larger markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've addressed ourselves to the professional who uses tools
everyday, in his work,'' Jones said. ``The specialized hand planes
that were used in carpentry _ these products are no longer used as
mainline tools, by professional carpenters.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine-woodworkers revived them, buying them as second-hand tools.
When collectors discovered their attraction, as esthetic rarities,
they swept the second-hand market clean, making the tools scarce
again. Enter companies like Lie-Nielsen's.
</P>
<P>
   At his factory, Lie-Nielsen spends much of his day putting his
fingers together in the air to show a measurement to an employee, a
reminder that he has made his tools himself, by hand, from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Lie-Nielsen re-engineers designs, rather than reproducing them,
drawing on his familiarity with older planes to make improvements.
His most popular tool is a $95 bronze block plane, of which he has
sold 20,000 in 14 years. By comparison, the Stanley Works produces
approximately 15,000 block planes a week. Made of cast iron, they
retail for $39.99. Is an elegant tool overkill?
</P>
<P>
   Professional fine-woodworkers would argue that a tool's elegance
lies not only in its utility, but also in the woodworker's intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these tools are patently ridiculous because they're
just the wrong thing for the job _ the Faberge egg as tool,'' said
John Reed Fox, a Massachusetts cabinet maker. But he is prepared to
co-exist with the new high-end hobbyist attention, if it revives
interest in his craft.
</P>
<P>
   Fox uses Japanese hand tools that he buys from a gallery in
Berkeley, Calif. For Fox, it is more philosopher's stone than
Grail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craft isn't really part of the culture anymore,'' he said.
``It's similar to a potter at the wheel. Using handmade objects to
make handmade objects. We're protectors of the ceremony.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when I began collecting old tools for my
personal use as a working carpenter, the first thing I did was
scrape off the factory decals, not knowing that this was criminal
vandalism against the tools' historical value. For my sins, I
degraded a collection probably worth a low six figures today to a
very nice carpentry outfit worth a few hundred dollars. Let's not
even talk about my speckless Bedrock plane, bought for $10 at a
garage sale and later sold for $20. On the Web, a similar one, in
good condition, is now for sale for $1,200. Let's change the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   There's an indescribable quality that radiates from old tools.
You sense it in the hand-worn patina of rosewood knobs and grips,
the chiaroscuro of glinting brass levers under darkened steel. But
they are mute until you touch them. Then they won't shut up. Pick
up an old tool, and you almost hear the ticking hours of its long
working life. Such tools can be time machines, portals to a
yesteryear farther away than the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who collect hand tools are comparatively sane,
really. At the very least, our sanity is hanging by a stronger
thread than most, for our lifeline is belayed off in the hallowed
past, twirled around the rock of craft. William Hermanek of
Smithtown, N.Y., has amassed 1,800 antiques, most of them Stanleys.
</P>
<P>
   But collecting is a science with a language all its own. And if
you don't know which part of a plane is the galoot or how to tweak
the normites of a chisel, you probably have no business investing
heavily. Try teddy bears instead.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, the only criterion for membership in the pantheon
of collectors is a heart that beats faster in the presence of
rosewood and brass, and goes into tachycardia upon hearing certain
code words and phrases: crispy (very clean), bonerific (fine
condition) and Stanley No. 1 plane. It doesn't hurt that the value
of old tools is creeping _ reliably, dependably, inevitably _
upward.
</P>
<P>
   Set the Wayback Machine to 1965. You could find carloads of
woodworking tools in junk stores for a couple of dollars: Blaisdell
marking gauges, worth $600 now; Stanley Everlasting chisels, $100
to $150 each today. You would have paid 50 cents for a small brass
plumb bob that would now bring $150 to $450. Back then, my father
traded a factory box of 12 Stanley six-foot yellow zigzag rules
(easily $75 each today) for an old handsaw, an ugly thing with a
panther's head carved into the handle. It was in mint condition
until he gave it to his young sons. We wore it out building a
treehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone?'' asked Patrick Leach, his day apparently ruined.
Leach is a self-described former computer geek who cast off the
shackles of his day job in 1996 to wallow in old tools full time _
and whose Web site -(www.supertool.com) merits a long look.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, a Panther saw in that condition would be worth
name-your-price.'' Leach said. He said $5,000 would not be far off
the mark; one such saw, in merely good condition, sold a year ago
for $1,100.
</P>
<P>
   My vast collection began quite by accident with my first plane.
It disappeared in the chaos of my garage. I bought a replacement at
a junk store for $5. Then my first plane showed up, so I had a
Stanley No. 1 in the original box. It would be worth no more than a
fortune today, if I still had it.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley No. 1 was produced from the end of the Civil War to
the middle of World War II, and even 10 years ago, you could nab
one for under $100. Today, they fetch well upward of $1,000 in fine
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' under the generally accepted grading system
established by Fine Tool Journal, means almost fresh from the box,
nearly unused. The top tool grade is ``new,'' meaning that no one
has ever stared hard at the piece and the original box smells like
robot deodorant. With superlative luck, $2,000 might get you a
Stanley No. 1 like that. But probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be collectors should visit the grandaddy of annual tool
auctions in Harrisburg, Pa., the weekend before Halloween. (At this
event in 1996, a prototype M.B. Tidey double-bevel wood plane went
for a record $27,500.) Clarence Blanchard, the publisher of Fine
Tool Journal, offers a few bidding tips: ``Look for the rarest tool
in the best condition you can afford. Buy the reference books and
study them.'' Amen.
</P>
<P>
   The novice seeking bargains should seek out oddball tools in
perfect condition, or Stanley No. 55 combination planes, which
still go for $300 to $400. The No. 55 is an up-and-coming
collectible prized for its unquestionable beauty and Byzantine
complexity _ never its utility. Decorators have discovered how
perfectly it enhances a bookshelf, the one task it does best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality and condition are the most important criteria,'' said
Peter Habicht, whose shop in southern Massachusetts, Falcon-Wood
(www.oldtools.com), caters to the discriminating tool user and
collector. ``Then rarity. Then price.'' I view the old-tool market
as one of the most volatile in the neurotic world of collectibles.
Habicht disagrees. Although prices are rising 5 percent a year
conservatively, he maintains that apart from blips and fads, the
market is fairly stable. He is probably right, but I hate being
contradicted.
</P>
<P>
   So I tell him: In 1975, at some Gomorrah of a garage sale, I had
a chance to buy an ivory carpenter's rule, a two-foot four-fold
inlaid with silver filigree, for $5. And I passed, instead buying a
Jefferson Airplane eight-track tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Habicht whispers. ``What . . . condition?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never used. Factory-fresh, a virgin, with paper instructions
written in German.'' It would have been too unkind to mention the
original box made of spalted tulipwood, or the outsize numbers that
marked it as a supremely rare ``blind man's'' rule. Neither of us
can bring himself to speculate aloud on what it would be worth
today: very, very conservatively, $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   We collectors welcome new blood, but we also counsel caution.
And we beg you not to duplicate the mistakes of 20 years ago, when
it was fashionable to remove the precious black japanning on planes
with a sandblaster and paint them beige. It's acceptable to remove
surface rust with a little steel wool, revealing microscopically
small patent dates and manufacturer information. You can use
penetrating oil to free seized parts, and it's forgivable to reglue
tight cracks in wood, if done expertly. Prohibitions include wire
wheels, naval jelly, chemical strippers and polishing.
</P>
<P>
   Heirloom tools can still be unearthed at garage sales and farm
auctions, but don't rush in like a fool, thinking to auction your
finds tomorrow at Sotheby's. Study the guides: the best and most
current is ``Collecting Antique Tools'' by Herbert P. Kean and Emil
S. Pollak (Astragal Press, 1990; $29.95). And you might visit one
of these Web sites: www2.finetoolj.com/ftj/bas and
www.wowpages.com/ftj.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, you will save yourself much heartache if
you send all your German ivory folding rules, Woodrough &AMP; McParlin
Panther saws and Stanley No. 1 planes, preferably in their original
boxes, to me. I will pay the postage and find a home for them.

   ``Computer, On'' and ``Computer, Off'' may work on the Starship
Enterprise but the rest of us still have to go through the motions
of turning on our computers. Now, a new product may turn logging
onto your computer and protecting your data a hands-free operation.
</P>
<P>
   Air ID is a system coming on the market from the Illinois-based
company, RF IDeas Inc. The system combines an ID badge/radio
transmitter for the user and a receiver that plugs into a computer
serial port.
</P>
<P>
   When you stand or sit near a properly configured PC while
wearing the Air ID card, you will be automatically logged onto that
computer. Walk away, and the Air ID card, once the transmission is
broken, will trigger a protective screensaver, blocking access to
the computer as well as concealing anything on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The ID badge will work when the holder is within 10 to 20 feet
of the protected computer and can allow access to more than one
computer.
</P>
<P>
   For the fashion conscious, those who don't like too many things
dangling from their pocket protectors, the badge can be used as a
normal ID card, with a user's picture, name, department and other
information prominently displayed. For the slightly paranoid, it
can be left blank so that if lost, the person recovering it will
not know what it protected.
</P>
<P>
   Decrypting Encryption
</P>
<P>
   Psst _ want to break some code and make a cool $5 million? All
you have to do is decrypt a document of unknown length, encoded
with a 4096-bit key, and tell us how you did it. By July 31. And -
oh, yeah _ then you have to do it again to win the money.
</P>
<P>
   This was the challenge posted by Jaws Technology, a Canadian
company trying to make a mark for itself in the field of
encryption. Several other encrypted files have been decrypted
recently, including one last week by a two-person team working with
a privacy-rights organization and a specialized computer built for
$250,000. That file used Standard DES, the standard code
recommended for businesses by the U.S. government, and a 56-bit
key, a piece of code that determines how the encryption algorithm
works. The winner of that contest tried 17,902,806,669,197,312
keys, or about 25 percent of all the possible combinations that
could be generated by the original 56-bit code.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaws file was encrypted by a new program using a 4096-bit
key. There are, needless to say, quite a few more combinations with
a 4096-bit encryption key.
</P>
<P>
   Jaws CEO Robert Kubbernus said that there were problems with
existing encryption programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current standards aren't good enough,'' Kubbernus said, ``so
we took it right off the charts to make sure ours was.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Jaws is Canadian, the company hopes to attract
international buyers eager to avoid the current Clinton
administration encryption brouhaha.
</P>
<P>
   About that $5 million? Kubbernus does not expect to have to pay
out. The contest has been running for about two months and ends in
another week. If the first message is decrypted, it has to be
verified with an outside auditor. Then, a second message has to be
decrypted within 60 days. If that's done, the person has to tell
Jaws how it was done. Only then will the money appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone can break this, we want to know how it was done,''
Kubbernus said. ``We also want to offer them a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Set-Top Translator
</P>
<P>
   English-language television programs may have just gained a
stronger foothold among Spanish-speaking viewers, thanks to a new
translation device.
</P>
<P>
   TCC Communications of Canada has developed a set-top box that
instantly converts English closed captioning into Spanish. The box,
aimed at people in the U.S. who only speak Spanish, is far from
perfect but more than good enough, according to John Grayson, the
CEO of TCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is accurate at best about 70 percent of the time,'' said
Grayson. ``But it is better than looking at 80 channels with
nothing on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Popowich and Paul McFetridge, researchers at Simon Fraser
University in Canada, are working to raise that accuracy rate.
</P>
<P>
   Popowich said that unilingual Spanish speakers do not notice the
difference between a translation that is 85 percent accurate and
one that is 100 percent accurate. He said the translation is
enhanced by the TV program, which provides a story line and images
to provide context and help with the understanding. Popowich and
McFetridge now have a lab version working at 80 per cent accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bilingual speakers would be annoyed with the quality of the
translation,'' Popowich said, ``but this gives me the gist of
what's going on while getting something out of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's source material is provided by government
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``FCC and its Canadian equivalent mandated that everything be
close captioned. That is a rich source for text material,'' Grayson
said. ``We take the analog signal, digitize it, feed it into the
translator and out comes the translation. The user has the choice
of displaying it in English or Spanish, and changing the speed and
size of the display,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial version of the translator is being prepared, and
will be marketed to television stations in Central and South
America, which currently imports about 200 hours of English
language TV programs a day, Grayson said. A Portuguese version,
targeted for the Brazilian market, is in the works, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Schooling
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy Internet has established an online learning center,
offering training classes for popular applications from Microsoft,
Adobe and Lotus, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy said the classes can reduce the time and costs
associated with training by using the Internet as a delivery
mechanism and using animation and real-time audio technology. The
company has developed a synchronized multimedia file format to deal
with the choppiness and poor quality found in most internet
multimedia files. Users will need to download and install a program
to read the files.
</P>
<P>
   Training is available on about 40 programs with more to be
added, a Prodigy spokesman said. The learning center courses are
available only to Prodigy members and range in cost from $9.95 for
one-week access to one tutorial up to about $200 for a year's
access to the entire catalog.

   The Linux operating system, a stepchild in the world of computer
operating systems, is getting a second look. Computer Associates,
Informix and other corporate software suppliers have recently
announced that some of their applications would be rewritten
specifically for the Linux system.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is a Unix-based operating system available for free
through any number of Linux Web sites. Device drivers, utilities
and all the other add-ons necessary to make it work are written by
the people who need them and also made available for free, an
approach to support that has left many a harried information
systems manager leery. (After all, there is no one to complain to
if the system does not work.) But some changes in the marketplace
are bringing more mainstream corporate suppliers into the Linux
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is starting to be some movement toward commercially
supported versions of Linux,'' Don LeClair, a vice president at
Long Island, N.Y.-based Computer Associates said. ``Caldera and Red
Hat'' _ two of the companies attempting to turn Linux into a
commercial product _ ``are putting out supported versions, and
Linux looks like a more viable platform than it did a year or two
ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates is preparing a version of its Ingress
relational database specifically for Linux. Relational databases
are popular corporate products that manage data in a simple format
and then analyze that data. Linux has strong roots in the
educational and software development environments, markets where
Ingress has been popular. That popularity and a number of user
requests prompted CA to make a Linux version.
</P>
<P>
   Relational database makers Informix and Oracle also are reported
to be developing Linux versions. The combination of commercial
support and commercial applications should help improve the image
of Linux in the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   On Call
</P>
<P>
   For those people who can't bear to miss their messages, Motorola
has developed the Pocketalk, a cross between a pager and an
answering machine. The Pocketalk, which was introduced last year
and will be available in the New York area next week, works like a
pager except that it will receive and store voice messages. The
product retails for about $80 and then there are the usual
activation and monthly service charges.

WHAT'S THE (AT) IN E-MAIL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The words (AT) and (equal) throughout item should be replaced
by the symbol)  
 (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is the name of the (AT) symbol used in e-mail addresses?
</P>
<P>
   A. The (AT) symbol, found on the Shift of the 2 key on QWERTY
keyboards, is usually defined as just the ``at'' sign by
dictionaries, technical manuals and typographic stylebooks. In its
former (and still occasional) life as a commerce symbol, it also
stands for ``each'' in calculating the cost per unit, as in ``5
muffins (AT) $1.50 (equal) $7.50.''
</P>
<P>
   A single (AT) sign is a mandatory part of every Internet e-mail
address. It was used in the first e-mail message ever sent, which
was in 1972. The engineer who was sent the mail, Ray Tomlinson, was
trying to figure out how to make his computer differentiate between
the name of the intended recipient and that person's computer
address. So he needed a punctuation mark or symbol that did not
occur in a name. Looking at his keyboard, he noticed the (AT), and
an Internet standard was born.
</P>
<P>
   But not all computer networks have always used the (AT) sign in
e-mail addresses. Some computers on Bitnet, the international
network founded in 1981, required the user to spell out the word
``at'' in an address.
</P>
<P>
   Other symbols that have appeared in e-mail addresses throughout
computer-network history include the exclamation point and the
percent sign, but these specialized forms of mail-addressing have
generally given way to the present (AT). &QL;

   ELEMENTARY SCIENCE
</P>
<P>
   Ever get busted in chemistry class for reading a comic book
instead of your textbook? It's too late now, but had the Web been
around, you might have gotten off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   You could have informed the teacher that you were involved with
the Periodic Table of Comic Books project
(www.uky.edu/\Pholler/periodic/periodic.html).
</P>
<P>
   The project was created in 1994 by Jack Selegue and F. James
Holler, University of Kentucky chemistry professors with an
affinity for comic books.
</P>
<P>
   Their site's main page features the all-too-familiar elements
table, but instead of a mind-numbing lesson, you get a comic-book
image or story that features the element.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the symbol for iron (Fe) and up pops the cover of
Marvel's Iron Man. Click on Krypton (Kr) and _ yep _ you get the
element that makes Superman want to hurl.
</P>
<P>
   Selegue points out that many comic-book writers used science as
a basis for character ideas and plot developments drawn from
physics. Examples: X-Men are chemically altered mutants, and the
Fantastic Four were overexposed to cosmic rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``On close inspection, the attitudes of comic-book writers and
artists toward their readers, traditionally children, become
apparent,'' Selegue said.
</P>
<P>
   Geez, where was Selegue when we needed him?
</P>
<P>
   MAKING AN IMPACT
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of fun with science, NASA's Earth and
space-science site (observe.ivv.nasa.gov) is featuring impact
craters and tsunamis to coincide with this summer's disaster
movies, ``Armageddon'' and ``Deep Impact.'' In a recent news
release, NASA is promoting two online articles about the possible
aftereffects of a celestial collision.
</P>
<P>
   FIND A COUPLE THAT CLICKS

<P>
   Help Bruce Willis and Demi Moore find new spouses at Hollywood
Online's Bruce &AMP; Demi Matchmaker poll (www.hollywood.com). For
Willis, the choices are Elizabeth Berkley, Cher and Phyllis Diller

WINDOWS 98? JUST ONE LITTLE THING ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only reason I considered installing Windows 98 was because
my friend Kip Crosby promised that the upgrade would cure the
crashes that plagued my computer. I figured he should know,
considering that he had recently co-written ``The Windows 98
Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How I wish we lived in a world where people like you weren't
afraid the computer would blow up every time you did something to
it,'' Crosby lectured me. ``Your problem is that Windows 95 and
Internet Explorer 4.0 are having severe disagreements. But if you
upgrade, the browser will know the operating system is the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   That possibility intrigued me. How often in life does such a
simple solution to a software problem present itself? It sounded so
much easier than sitting on the phone for hours with a tech support
person, trying this, trying that, groping in the dark for a light
switch to illuminate some arcane code flaw. Besides, if Windows 98
didn't solve my crashing problem, I figured it was on Crosby's
head, not mine.
</P>
<P>
   So I was a little surprised when he answered the phone a few
days later with a weary ``Oh, it's you. Are you calling to say that
Windows 98 has done you dirty?'' His tone of resignation made me
wonder just how many cranks, er, home computer users like me he
spoke to in a given day.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I was calling about a problem that surfaced after I
installed Windows 98 (how did he guess?). Whenever I clicked on an
icon on my taskbar to open my e-mail program, Eudora Pro 3.0, a
mysterious message would appear on screen to announce, ``Could not
rename file from c:/windows/temp/descmap.tmp to
c:/eudora/descmap.pce.''
</P>
<P>
   Descmap? The message might as well have been written in Mayan
for all the sense it made to me. Still, it was a minor annoyance
because it did not prevent me from running Eudora. I clicked on OK,
and the message disappeared _ until the next time I clicked on the
taskbar after booting the computer. (Another weird twist: The error
message appeared only the first time I opened Eudora after booting
the computer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm, this sounds like a Eudora problem, not a 98 problem,''
Crosby said. ``The thing about Eudora is that it originally was a
Mac program. It went from there to being Windows shareware, as
well, and from there to Windows shrink-wrap. But Eudora for Windows
has never worked really well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This never happened when I was running Windows 95,'' I said. I
think a transcript of the conversation would show that I did not
sound accusatory. I was only trying to gather the facts in a
neutral way. ``So it must be something Windows 98 did.''
</P>
<P>
   I heard him sigh. ``I run Eudora myself, but it is not the
best-behaved program that ever lived. Just do me a favor. Call
Qualcomm, which owns Eudora, and ask if they've seen this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I followed his advice _ I always do _ but I also put
in a call to Microsoft at the same time. That was not because I
doubted my friend's assessment. But I subscribe to the philosophy
that in a marketplace of free ideas, the truth will assert itself.
I wanted as many points of view as possible.
</P>
<P>
   I first reached Michael Brooks, who does tech support for
Eudora. He explained that ``descmap'' was a file that Eudora uses
to keep track of mailboxes. ``For some reason, Eudora is not able
to read to the temp file, which it wants to do,'' Brooks said.
``Something weird is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   After we tried a few experiments (I use the term ``we'' rather
loosely), ``we'' realized that the error message disappeared if I
opened Eudora from any other shortcut _ ``we'' created a few in
places other than the taskbar to test the theory _ or from the file
itself. I deleted the offensive shortcut, replaced it with a
sterile new one and rebooted, and the bug disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably just that one shortcut that got corrupted,''
Brooks said. ``But how?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' he said. ``I've reinstalled Windows, and all my
shortcuts got messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   But why would Windows 98 mess up shortcuts? I asked Hugh Taylor
of Microsoft, whom I spoke to next.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't,'' Taylor said. ``The upgrade shouldn't cause
corruption, not in and of itself. Some other factor might have
complicated the upgrade, for instance a third-party application,
such as any utility that essentially tries to track or replace the
functionality of the desk to ... ''
</P>
<P>
   I lost the thread of the conversation at that point because the
error message was back on my machine. I had been fiddling with
Eudora while Taylor and I talked, and there it was again.
</P>
<P>
   As a test, I deleted the new shortcut. Then I created another
and rebooted the computer, and the problem vanished again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still don't know for sure what caused it,'' Taylor
said. ``With every major revision of the operating system, some of
the interfaces that applications need to use to draw on Windows
services change. Sometimes the interfaces can become out of date.
That could be the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said ``we'' could check some other things to get to the
root of it. But by now, I had been on the phone for more than two
hours with two different tech support people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you always have to get to the bottom of what caused it?'' I
asked. ``Or is it enough just to make it go away?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're happy, I'm happy,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, I'm happy. After nearly a week, the error message hasn't
re-emerged. (Another plus: Since I upgraded to Windows 98, my
computer has not crashed once while running Internet Explorer 4.0.)
Maybe the Eudora bug was in the process of curing itself, like the
fountain in the pond in my garden that cured itself after refusing
for two weeks to spray water. Or like the knocking in the engine of
my Honda Civic that cured itself after the weather warmed up. Maybe
software was becoming as intelligent as Iron Age machinery.

`BOMBAY ICE': TALE OF MURDER WITH PLOT TO MATCH INDIA'S RICH
TAPESTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere in the colorful tapestry of Leslie Forbes' murder
thriller, ``Bombay Ice,'' lies the thread of a story that very
nearly makes sense. Her first-person narrator, Rosalind Bengal, is
a part-Scottish, part-Indian London resident who reports for the
BBC.
</P>
<P>
   When she receives a hysterical postcard from her semi-estranged
half-sister, Miranda, who is married to an Indian film director,
Prosper Sharma, rumored to have killed his first wife, Rosalind
flies to Bombay, using as her cover an assignment to investigate
corruption in the Indian film industry. ``Think of the exotic
corpses,'' she has told her producer. ``Machetes, cobra bites,
ritual murder.'' She writes, ``The ritual murder clinched it, and
my remaining costs were covered by a BBC commission for six radio
programs about the history of tropical storms.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly has Rosalind settled into her room at the Hotel Ritzy
when she turns on the television and learns of a corpse that has
washed up on Chowpatty Beach in Bombay just three hours earlier.
The dead man is a hijra _ which, as she shortly learns, means
either a eunuch or a transvestite _ and is the fourth one to die on
Chowpatty in the last eight weeks. Also, he is said to have been
connected to the Bombay film world.
</P>
<P>
   Since Miranda mentioned a eunuch in her recent postcard,
Rosalind immediately heads off for Chowpatty to see if she can
learn something more about the victim. There she meets three
policemen who tell her to mind her own business. Her suspicions
aroused, she starts digging into the background of the hijra.
Quickly she finds herself on the trail of a scandal that not only
leads back to Miranda's film director husband but also branches
into the leading power circles of Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Now it may seem a little troubling that Rosalind would thrust
herself into this case so deeply without having first even spoken
with Miranda. But then Rosalind is a recklessly aggressive
individual whose behavior keeps forcing you to ask yourself, Would
this bother me so much if it were Sam Spade or some other
hard-boiled male detective? And to answer uncomfortably, Probably
not.
</P>
<P>
   She also verges on the poetic in her eloquence. So before you
question the plausibility of Rosalind's actions, you find yourself
caught in her wide-ranging net of references. You wonder, for
instance, about the mystery of her mother's death by drowning and
what it had to do with the mother's habit of inflicting cuts on
herself or her knowledge of poisons or her craft as a gilder, which
is someone who layers with gold and, in its archaic meaning,
someone who smears with blood.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder about Rosalind's repeated discussions of storms and
chaos theory and why she herself is upsetting someone's attempts to
impose order. And why is she named Rosalind, a woman disguised as a
man in ``As You Like It,'' when Miranda and Prosper evoke the names
of characters in ``The Tempest,'' a play that Prosper has been
making a film of for most of his career and that obsesses at least
one other character in the novel?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shipwrecked on an island and the island was Bombay,''
the story begins; ``the monsoon threat held the whole city
hostage.'' What transformation are the stranded passengers
undergoing?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you are caught up by the portrait of Bombay, in all its
shocking variety of poverty and wealth, drawn by Ms. Forbes, a
Canadian writer now living in London, whose previous books have
been about travel and food. ``The city as a conveyor belt to
chaos,'' Rosalind muses. Yet out of its chaos Ms. Forbes has
created a vivid sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   Does the whole thing make sense, despite the complexity of the
plot? It's difficult to tell in a single reading. But every
intricate detail seems to serve its particular purpose: the
swimming pool shaped like India before partition, where Rosalind
swims from Nepal to Madhya Pradesh; the double-bladed scalpel on a
swivel neck normally used for the delicate cutting of parallel
circles in gold leaf; the frequent references to Hitchcock's
``Strangers on a Train''; the notes on the ways that various
species of cobras strike; the many Hindu gods alluded to in the
text; even the title ``Bombay Ice,'' which refers to both
``premeditated murder'' (to ``ice'' meaning to chill or kill) and
the tendency of ice in Bombay to cause illness because it is made
from bacteria-ridden local water.
</P>
<P>
   In one of her typical asides, Rosalind cites the great Indian
film director Satyajit Ray on how cinema as a medium is closer to
Western music than to Indian, because in India the tradition of
inflexible time does not exist. Whereas ``cinema is a composition
bound by time,'' Indian music is improvised, its duration depending
on the musician's mood, the temperature, the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   By these definitions, Ms. Forbes in ``Bombay Ice'' might be said
to have produced something like musical cinema. While its plot is
inflexibly time-bound, its references stretch almost infinitely,
embracing chaos theory, Ovid's ``Metamorphoses'' and the art of
hollow casting, or cire perdue, invented by the ancient Greeks to
reduce the weight of their monumental statues.
</P>
<P>
   At its weaker points you feel that Ms. Forbes is temporizing,
perhaps to distract from a story that is almost too complicated to
be plausible. Yet at its best the book's expansiveness conveys a
sense of India so rich that it ceases to seem a mere country or
nationality and comes to stand for humanity in both its corruption
and self-transcendence.

   Showers and some very strong thunderstorms will erupt across
portions of the central Appalachians and Northeast on Thursday as a
slow-moving cold front intercepts a very humid air mass presiding
over the region. Showers and thunderstorms will begin over interior
sections Thursday morning and then press eastward to the coast
during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, less humid air will spread into the Great Lakes on
breezes from the northwest. The day will begin mainly sunny over
the region, though currents of air moistening on ascent will induce
puffy cumulus clouds to form by afternoon. A couple of these clouds
could develop into spotty showers southeast of Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, clouds will mix with intervals of sunshine over the
Southeast, including Florida. Scattered thunderstorms will ignite
in the sultry air, especially during the afternoon when heating
from the sun makes the atmosphere most unstable. Thunderstorms will
be most concentrated near the Gulf Coast, where a disturbance
spirals inland from the offshore waters.
</P>
<P>
   Air gliding up the sloping terrain will fuel showers and
thunderstorms in sections of the Front Range and central Plains. A
few of these storms will turn severe, accompanied by hail and
isolated tornadoes as a jet stream disturbance passes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to mostly sunny and hot conditions will cover much of the
West on Thursday. Burgeoning cumulus clouds will yield to spotty
afternoon thunderstorms over interior sections, particularly in the
mountainous terrain. Patchy morning clouds will again shroud the
Pacific coastline.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HOT NIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the low temperature at the Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport was 81 degrees. It marked the 17th time this
month that the minimum at Dallas was 80 degrees or higher, setting
a new July record for the city. Weather records at Dallas date back
to 1899. Though the media has focused on the number of 100-degree
days in Dallas this month, hot nights have been more impressive.
Average highs in Dallas are in the upper 90s so many of the daily
highs have been approximately 3 to 6 degrees above average.
Nighttime minimums, however, have been 6 to 8 degrees above
average. &QL;

 &HT;    Anderson in lean, mean fighting trim for Bengals camp
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The first thing you notice about Willie Anderson is
that there isn't as much of him to notice.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Bengals man-mountain offensive tackle will report
to training camp at about 345 pounds, only a couple of Whoppers _
whoops, make that a couple of salads and a bowl of rice _ over his
assigned playing weight of 340.
</P>
<P>
   The camp that begins July 23 at Georgetown College will be the
first ``normal'' training period in Anderson's three-year career.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie first-round draft pick out of Auburn, he missed
three weeks of work because of a contract holdout, then knee and
ankle injuries helped delay his first regular season start until
the seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he reported at 360 pounds and needed almost half a
season to play himself into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want to be in that position again,'' Anderson said
Tuesday after a precamp workout at Spinney Field. ``I realize now
how the offseason can just fly by, how you have to manage your time
and when you have to start working out.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who now lives in Atlanta, hired a personal trainer to
help him overhaul his body and change his eating habits. ``We did
some kind of workout almost every day. I learned that I have to
keep my body active all the time. If I don't do something to keep
my metabolism going, everything I eat just stays there.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has only one personal goal for 1998. ``My thing is to
be recognized as the best right tackle in football. I really don't
care all that much about going to the Pro Bowl. There are a lot of
outside things involved in that and the best linemen don't always
get to go. All I care about is hearing my peers and the coaches
around the league say I'm the best right tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   He already has the vote of Bengals line coach Paul Alexander.
``In my opinion, Willie is the best right tackle in the NFL right
now. He has tremendous natural ability and worked very hard to
improve his first two seasons. I can't think of anybody I'd rather
have at the position.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is counting on Corey Dillon, last year's rookie running
sensation, to help with his candidancy. ``When Corey starts putting
together those 1,500-yard seasons, it will be good for me because
the majority of his plays are going to be run on Big Willie's
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Packing up: The Bengals will complete their three-day stay at
Spinney today. All players are scheduled to report to Georgetown by
4 p.m. Thursday. The first workout is at 11 a.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis released: Guard Joel Davis has been released. Signed as a
free agent in 1996, the Army grad spent the next two seasons on
military reserve. He became expendable after the signing of
third-round draft pick Mike Goff.
</P>
<P>
   QB shuffle: Ex-Bengals David Klingler and Chad May are trying to
hook on with new teams as third-string quarterbacks. Klingler, a
bust since the Bengals took him in the first round of the '92
draft, is with Green Bay after two seasons in Oakland. May, who
played for Minnesota and Arizona, was with Cincinnati for only four
months. He was released after the team signed Neil O'Donnell.

 &HT;    Newton blames himself for poor season
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Now that Nate Newton has shed some
pounds, he no longer has the weight of the offense on his
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   In the everything-looks-different offense the Dallas Cowboys
have installed at training camp, no player has made a greater
transformation than Newton. After losing 80 pounds in six months,
his physique would make Richard Simmons proud.
</P>
<P>
   When Newton was asked why the Cowboys were 6-10 last season, he
pointed a finger at himself. It's rare when a professional athlete
takes responsibility for the team's lack of success, but the
312-pound guard has accepted some heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let everybody down,'' Newton said Tuesday. ``Most of all, I
let myself down. I'm really a selfish person. I don't care about
what the other guys think. I just know that if I do my job, that's
what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, no one on offense played particularly well, with
the possible exception of left tackle Larry Allen. Newton, entering
his 13th season, was injured and out of shape. His disappearing act
in the second half of the season is one reason the team finished
20th in the NFL in offense.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Newton's off-the-field comedy act wasn't so funny.
After the season, team owner Jerry Jones had a private meeting with
Newton to discuss the lineman's future with the club. Some people
in the organization wondered whether Newton was still serious about
football.
</P>
<P>
   Jones challenged Newton to return in '98 with a new attitude and
a new look. There were no ultimatums, but Newton could read the
writing on the wall. At 36, Newton no longer can afford to enter
training camp with the scales tipping near 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   When Coach Chan Gailey was hired in February, he shared similar
thoughts about Newton's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's followed Nate's career realizes this is the best
shape he's ever been in,'' Gailey said. ``Nate's a smart guy, and
he realized he was at a point in his career where conditioning was
a vital thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the lines, Newton was running scared. For the first time
in his 13- year career, he ran the risk of getting cut. His base
salary of $700,000, after all, buys a lot of groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has run off several aging stars in Dallas in recent
months, and Newton did not want to be the next one getting a pink
slip.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, he got serious about conditioning. He spent months
with strength and conditioning coach Joe Juraszek and implemented a
strict training and diet schedule. Instead of fried foods, Newton
has been spotted eating salads and other vegetables at the campus
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   That was only part of the change. Newton shocked many of his
teammates when he arrived at Valley Ranch for 6 a.m. workouts. He
often was the first player to arrive and the last to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Newton said critics were ``justified'' for ripping him and his
offensive teammates last year. Again, he said much of the blame
should be pinned on his inability to stay healthy and compete at a
high level.
</P>
<P>
   Juraszek said Newton weighed 381 pounds when they started
training together in the winter. By May, he dipped below 300 pounds
for the first time in a decade. The Cowboys want Newton at 315 when
the season starts Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nate's pride created the energy and enthusiasm for him to get
back to the top,'' Juraszek said.
</P>
<P>
   The early returns look good. In one-on-one drills against
defensive tackle Leon Lett, Newton has won most of them. After
Tuesday morning's practice, Newton took a few extra laps around the
practice field before heading to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   With Allen and a slimmed-down Newton on the left side of the
line, the Cowboys hope their ground game improves from their
disappointing 1997 output. The player who suffered most last season
was running back Emmitt Smith, who had few blocks to follow. He
scored a career-low four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   As for Newton, he would rather forget the '97 season. He refuses
to watch video of the team's miserable slide at the end of the
year. He doesn't want to see the fat guy who wears jersey No. 61.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't watch any of that nightmare,'' he said. ``That was
like looking at your mother-in-law.''

 &HT;    Cruise industry unaffected by Ecstasy fire
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ All that smoke made the ``fun ship''
Ecstasy look anything but fun _ yet it caused barely a ripple in
Carnival's business.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy will miss just two cruises _ Friday's three-night cruise
to Nassau and Monday's four-night cruise to Mexico _ while it
undergoes repair, Carnival officials say. Passengers on those two
cruises will be given a full refund and 50 percent off another
cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is expected back in service July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature to assess exact damages but we would estimate
that the impact on earnings would be approximately 1 cent per
share,'' said Howard Frank, Carnival Corp.'s vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, travel agents reminded clients that cruising is the
safest form of transportation. Of 45 million North American
passengers in the past decade, not one has died in a shipboard
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get a flat tire and that can ruin your trip,'' said
Nancy Beiser, owner of Ship Shop Cruises in Palm Beach Gardens.
``We had people on the ship, and we haven't heard back from them.
They're probably still playing in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other travel agents said they thought Carnival's
compensation for passengers was good. ``I thought Carnival did a
wonderful job,'' Beiser said. ``One client called and said, `Do I
get a free cruise? Carnival's giving out free cruises.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ship mishaps are so rare that cruise lines make compensation
decisions on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   When Carnival's Celebration had a fire in 1995, passengers
drifted for two days before being rescued by the Ecstasy. They got
a short free cruise in the Bahamas with an open bar.
</P>
<P>
   When a fire aboard the Universe Explorer killed five crewmen
during a cruise to Alaska in 1996, passengers were compensated just
for the cruise days they missed. That fire also started in the
laundry room, as did a 1997 fire aboard Cunard's Vistafjord.
</P>
<P>
   More passengers cruise on Carnival's 12 ``fun ships'' than any
other cruise line, and most cruise lines expect a record year _
thanks in part to the movie Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising's popularity has nearly doubled in the past decade,
from 2.9 million passengers in 1987 to 5.05 million last year,
according to Cruise Lines International. Another 20 new ships are
scheduled to sail by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On all those ships, passengers must strap on life vests and
report for a mandatory safety drill before they can indulge too
heavily at the buffets and bars.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers aboard the Ecstasy had already run through their
drill when the fire broke out Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As cruising has grown, so, too, has its regulation. Cruise ships
operate under the standards of a United Nations organization, the
International Maritime Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long history of safety,'' aboard big luxury liners
such as the Ecstasy, said Diana Orban, spokeswoman for the Cruise
Lines International Association, a trade group. ``One of the reason
incidents like this get so much attention is because they're so
rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnival will evaluate the safety standards on the Ecstasy and
its seven identical sister ships, said Tim Gallagher, Carnival
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire should demonstrate that everything works, the fire
suppression system worked,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   None of this bothers cruiser William Wooldridge of Port St.
Lucie, who turned on the television Monday before supper and
wondered whether his vacation would go up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife, `Honey, they're burning our boat!' ''
Wooldridge, 67, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wooldridges are still planning to shove off Aug. 3 on a
four-day Ecstasy trip to Key West and Cozumel, Mexico. They have no
fear of embarking on the same trip as the 2,575 vacationers they
watched Monday huddling on the bow of a burning ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old Coast Guard man and I have no problem getting
aboard that ship,'' he said. ``I have all the faith in the world in
Carnival.''
</P>

Press contributed to this story.

 &HT;    In the water and in synch
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somehow I always expected Richard Simmons, all perky and kooky
and calesthenic, to be the first to introduce hairy legs to the
elegant sport of synchronized swimming. Clearly, he has no fear of
looking foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Then along comes Bill May, pride of the Santa Clara Aquamaids,
and strange, new competitive juices enter the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Monday July 20, the native of upstate New York won a pair of
silver medals at the Goodwill Games and did so without the
traditional accessories of sequins and hair goop. What's more, he
appeared to be throughly enjoying his interaction with duet partner
Kristine Lum.
</P>
<P>
   By the conclusion of their free program, choreographed to the
steamy strains of Ravel's ``Bolero,'' these crazy mixed-up synchro
kids had a few judges fanning themselves with their scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain passion and intensity that men bring to the
sport and our free routine today was designed specifically to
showcase that male-female relationship,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   Basic chemistry, sort of like Adam and Eve might have been
before they got in over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, however, Eve and Adam is more like it. The 27-member
Palm Beach Coralytes kids synchro program has been girls-only since
its founding in 1985. And at the Sunshine State Games synchro
competition earlier this summer, only three boys showed up from a
talent pool the size of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Bill May, but who else will?
</P>
<P>
   I would give water ballet a whirl myself, of course, except for
this peculiar medical condition. Every minute or so, my lungs
require oxygen. Besides that, Dave George pinched into a pair of
Speedos is an image too horrible to ponder for more than a few
seconds without going blind or insane or both... aaargh, too late!
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, some guys who could pull it off if they
wished, and with a minimum of snickering.
</P>
<P>
   One summer a few years back Matt Taylor, a Jupiter attorney, was
talked into joining the Coralytes Masters level synchronized
swimming team by his wife Lori.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really was no reason not to do it,'' said Taylor, a
triathlete who also swims in the Masters program at North Palm
Beach County Club. ``I don't care what people say or think. If it's
fun and it's a good physical activity that I enjoy, I don't see any
problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that Taylor and Ben Walton, the husband of another
Coralyte Masters level swimmer, began to practice their pirouettes
at the Lake Lytal pool and the Santaluces Aquatic Complex. They
learned quickly that maintaining the proper synchronized swimming
game face _ bright and smiling above the water line, red and
bloated beneath it _ is a supreme challenge. And they learned that
one summer mirroring the artistic arm and leg movements of an
eight-person synchro team was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're getting ready to compete,'' said Taylor, ``and the
adrenalin is flowing, you have a hard time holding your breath.''
</P>
<P>
   For women, it's no big deal. They, after all, deliver babies.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Dowling is a Coralyte synchro swimmer and an assistant
coach for the Masters program. She was in the pool working on her
solo routine for two hours Tuesday and she'll be back out there for
two more today. Evelyn is 70 and in synch with the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do it the way the rule book says,'' Dowling said.
``When Bill May gets his legs up, he's right on the mark. But he
and his partner did more of a dancing thing in the water. With the
female swimmers, like the Russian pair that won the gold medal,
everything is more synchronized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is the one breaking through. I think it's great for a man
to be competing in our sport. I say good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way, baby. All that remains is the perfection
of a macho butt-slap that won't look so suspicious on those
underwater cameras. endit

 &HT;    Joyner changed perception of female athletes
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At many track meets, heptathlons are contested at odd
hours before the main events, when there's just a smattering of
friends, relatives and coaches dotting the stands. Tuesday, July
21, however, Jackie Joyner-Kersee was center stage at the Goodwill
Games as she started two days of competition in the final
heptathlon of a career that has yielded six Olympic medals, three
of them gold.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, who has won every Goodwill Games heptathlon, not
only made U.S. fans care about what had been an obscure mix of
seven events, she was one of the pioneers that changed our
perception of female athletes. With her grace, and with her sweat
and effort, she helped break down stereotypes and give younger
female athletes, such as sprint sensation Marion Jones, a most
worthy role model.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee was named by a grandmother after Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis in 1962, in hopes, she laughed, that she would
become ``the first lady of something.'' It was a tall order on the
mean streets of East St. Louis, where Joyner-Kersee grew up and
where she still returns to help the community.
</P>
<P>
   Her first athletic activity was celebrating the achievements of
male athletes _ a cheerleader. But what she really liked about
cheerleading was the jumping. As a kid she liked soaring off the
family's high front porch. The landings were a little hard, but
there was a sandbox just across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee remembered, ``My sisters and I, we went to a park
and took sand and put it into potato chip bags. We didn't have too
much grass so we wanted to make a soft landing. Bu we did it before
mom came home because we didn't want her to know.''
</P>
<P>
   With her jumping and her pigtails and cut-off jeans, there was
an easy label for Joyner-Kersee _ tomboy, not athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember as a sophomore we had to practice at 6 o'clock in
the evening, after the boys. At that time it was felt we were girls
trying to play basketball,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``We won state
that year in track and all of sudden things started to change.
People started respecting us as athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon her mom didn't have to worry about her going to
practice so late. The girls had the gym after school; the boys
played when the champs were done.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee was talented enough in basketball to play for UCLA
and even gave one of the new women's pro leauges, the American
Basketball League, a fling. But track was her best sport and her
all-around talent had the perfect outlet, the heptathlon.
Joyner-Kersee got the itch to try it in 1975 after seeing a movie
about the last great female athlete to be so versatile, Texas- bred
Babe Didrikson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Joyner-Kersee had what she now describes as her biggest
thrill. ``Being the first woman to score 7,000 points ... that was
the beginning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 she had what should have been her crowning moment,
winning both the heptathlon and long jump in the Seoul Olympics.
Those Games, however, were marred by the suspicions that more track
athletes than Ben Johnson were using steroids. Brazilian Joaquin
Cruz pointed a finger at Joyner-Kersee and her famous
sister-in-law, Florence Griffith-Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My moment of triumph, my moment of joy, was in 1988 and with
the drug issue it was like my performance was swept under the
rug,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``I hope no other person achieves a
great thing and has to deal with innuendo and accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, who is coached by her husband, Bob, won the gold
in the heptathlon in 1992. In 1996, however, she was injured at the
U.S. Olympic Trials, finishing second. That was her last
competitive heptathlon until this week, but she did compete in the
long jump in Atlanta. On her last jump, she moved from sixth place
to third in spite of her sore right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, who suffers from asthma, sometimes has struggled
in the 800 meters, the heptathlon's final event. But she has said,
``If I was going to die, I was going to die crossing that finish
line. I was never going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of competitiveness helped changed the view of women in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key for Billie Jean (King), Martina (Navratilova),
Chris Evert, Florence ... all we ever wanted was to be respected
for what we were trying to do,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``I think
that's what's happening now. Now people are accepting us and saying
that it's OK. It's OK to have girls go out and play soccer. It's OK
if they want to play baseball, it's OK if they want to play
football, that they're not going to be criticized, that they're not
going to be looked upon as being different or that something's
wrong with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee's farewell to track will come this weekend when
she competes in the long jump at a meet in Edwardsville, Ill.,
honoring her. Although she has commercial endorsements and a sports
marketing firm, she finds time to give back to her old community.
She is currently helping to build a youth center.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been able to use her success to bring up other
people,'' Bobby Kersee said. ``She's taken her talent and put it in
other things that will benefit people after she retires. That's the
blessing about her sucess. We're not losing a great athlete from
track and field, we're losing a great person.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the first lady of track.

over the Internet. (Kallenberg, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   COWBOYS-NEWTON _ WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Now that Nate Newton has
shed some pounds, he no longer has the weight of the offense on his
shoulders. In the everything-looks-different offense the Dallas
Cowboys have installed at training camp, no player has made a

   KERSEE _ NEW YORK _ Joyner-Kersee, who has won every Goodwill
Games heptathlon, not only made U.S. fans care about what had been
an obscure mix of seven events, she was one of the pioneers that
changed our perception of female athletes. With her grace, and with
her sweat and effort, she helped break down stereotypes and give
younger female athletes, such as sprint sensation Marion Jones, a
most worthy role model. (Mahler, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   ANDERSON-BENGALS _ CINCINNATI _ The first thing you notice about
Willie Anderson is that there isn't as much of him to notice. The
Cincinnati Bengals man-mountain offensive tackle will report to
training camp at about 345 pounds, only a couple of Whoppers _
whoops, make that a couple of salads and a bowl of rice _ over his
assigned playing weight of 340. The camp that begins July 23 at
Georgetown College will be the first ``normal'' training period in
Anderson's three-year career. (Williams, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

 &HT;    Technology famous for breaking promises
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Technology is famous for breaking its promises.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago ``the next big thing'' was network computers: They
would would cost less than $500 and have no hard drive. Instead,
the network computer would keep all of its information on the
Internet. To retrieve a document or game, you had to be online.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four months later, the idea lies in the technology
graveyard, along with virtual reality glasses and long distance
over the Internet. With computer prices so low (you can buy a great
refurbished computer for about $600) there is no need for the
network computer. This is unfortunate because network computing was
such a good idea. If we kept our data online, maybe we would be
more concerned about the information that was on the Internet. With
network computing, maybe we wouldn't put up with spamming and
kiddie porn sites. With network computing, the Internet would be a
better place.
</P>
<P>
   Nextec www.nextec.net) is a company that still believes in the
idea of network computing and in what the concept can do for the
Web. On June 11, the company _ which is responsible for the 100
million-hit-a-month RotoNews (www.rotonews.com) fantasy sport site
_ posted FreeDrive (www.FreeDrive.com), a site where you can store
any information you might otherwise keep on your computer for free.
Just by signing on, you receive a password-protected 7.5 megabytes
of storage (the equivalent of about five floppy disks) to hold
pictures, files or to back up your hard drive. To date, the site
has accumulated 5,000 users (with no advertising).
</P>
<P>
   ``FreeDrive is your own personal Web hard drive, a virtual drive
that resides on the Internet,'' said Michael Rhodes, president and
CEO of Nextec.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of the FreeDrive goes far beyond being a virtual
hard drive. It is the beginning of network computing, the beginning
of keeping our information online.
</P>
<P>
   FreeDrive makes it possible for multiple people to view your
files, thus encouraging the formation of separate virtual
communities. You can give your password to friends and colleagues,
then they can then log on to your virtual hard drive and view what
you are working on. On the FreeDrive site, this is called
``carpooling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we've only been up for a month, people are still in the
self-education phase and not really using their storage for very
much,'' Rhodes said. ``We have, however, seen the `carpooling'
function use quadruple in the past week (from 5,000 to 20,000
users).''
</P>
<P>
   The interest of the ``carpoolers,'' along with the initial
sign-on of 5,000 users, shows that people are truly interested in
storing their information online and in the original concept of
network computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to build a community of `drivers' that will learn
and grow together,'' Rhodes said. ``A community that will help
change the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this site hasn't been set up for charity. Nextec sees
a definite marketability to its site. ``Multiple Drivers,'' where
other users can alter and add to material on your FreeDrive, costs
an extra $4.95 a month. Extra megabytes of storage also cost money
and the site will have banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its capitalistic leanings, FreeDrive has hit on a great
idea. If we start storing our data, pictures and documents on the
Net, then the Internet becomes more of a home for us. Once it's a
home, we will start treating the Internet as what it was meant to
be: a communication tool for the exchange of ideas and content.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to look at the Internet as more of a tool
than they did before, as an expansion of their own PC,'' Rhodes
said. ``FreeDrive is a practical application that these people will
use and will definitely expand people's belief and confidence in
what the Internet is.'' Send questions, comments, ideas, products,

   It's summertime, and you have the kids at home. By now you've
probably done it all: Schlitterbahn, Sea World, the Austin Museum
of Art and the Capitol. Now, you're all at home, making peanut
butter, banana and ham sandwiches and looking for something to do.
You don't want to turn on the television because you don't want
your child dressing like Ginger Spice or talking like Judge Judy.
Why not buy your kid a couple of Broderbund games and let them
expand their minds while having fun? ``Kid Pix'' and the new,
improved ``Where in the World is Carmen San diego?'' will fulfill
both of those desires. ``Kid Pix'' is a drawing program which will
keep your 3- to 12-year-old occupied for hours. And ``Carmen San
Diego,'' a mystery entertainment game for 9-year-olds and up, has
been improved to include Internet links and teach your child
foreign languages. Available for the Mac and PC for $39.95.

PARTNERSHIPS IN HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWBURGH, N.Y. _ There were no suntanned, silver-haired
corporate angels on hand on July 14, when Hillary Rodham Clinton
visited the Dutch Reformed Church here to talk about historic
preservation. Her backdrop was the derelict Greek revival temple by
Alexander Jackson Davis, completed in 1835, once an uplifting
symbol of the city's material progress and now an evocative,
camera-ready testament to urban decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it mean to save a building?'' Mrs. Clinton mused
before a large crowd assembled in the sweltering heat. ``When a
town like Newburgh is able to revitalize its history, you become a
beacon of economic development and tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   By saving landmarks and living with them daily, ``you begin to
tell yourselves and your children the story of Newburgh,'' she
observed. ``That makes America more real.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before, the president and the first lady shared the dais
at the National Museum of American History with Ralph Lauren,
announcing with much hoopla the designer's $10 million rescue of
the flag that inspired ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' (presumably
this flag is off-limits for Lauren as a style phenomenon).
</P>
<P>
   The dueling images _ Lauren as patriotic savior and a vacant
city church without a patron _ underscored the paradox of Mrs.
Clinton's ``Save America's Treasures'' tour: For every
million-dollar pledge by a Ralph Lauren or GE to rescue a star,
there were humbler places like the Dutch Reformed Church or the
Colonial Theater in Pittsfield, Mass., waiting for deliverance. Who
should pay to preserve them?
</P>
<P>
   The first lady made a pledge herself, donating royalties from a
coming book of letters to the First Pets to the National Park
Foundation. (The nonprofit foundation announced this week that the
Coca-Cola Foundation was donating $1.5 million to pay for hands-on
discovery centers at nine national parks.)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Mrs. Clinton said that government _ federal,
state and local _ should bear a large part of the financial burden
for historical preservation, supplemented by public-private
partnerships. ``Government has the primary obligation,'' she said.
``But there are also many people with resources who might not have
thought about the contribution they could make.''
</P>
<P>
   Although state and local governments made forays into
preservation at least as early as 1816, when Independence Hall in
Philadelphia was purchased and restored, ever since the Mount
Vernon Ladies Association rescued George Washington's mansion and
grounds, preservation in the United States has relied on
contributions and philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable federal exception, the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, created the National Register of Historic
Places, which now has nearly 80,000 entries, and a program of
matching grants for their preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But practically from the beginning, preservationists have had to
be skillful quilters, piecing together funds from public and
private sources. The private role in public monuments was perhaps
most strikingly illustrated by Lee Iacocca's successful campaign to
restore the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, which raised more
than $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   A leader in public preservation has been the National Trust for
Historic Preservation, which has received money from Congress since
1966, but will lose its financing next year. Three years ago, after
Congress threatened to pull the plug, the National Trust negotiated
a three-year $7 million phase-out and has since been building a war
chest to privatize itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable with it,'' said Trust president Richard Moe.
``The funding fight became a preoccupying thing that distracted us
from the issues. We want to be more effective and
entrepreneurial.''
</P>
<P>
   At the national parks, the repair backlog for historic buildings
is more than $1 billion. Three years ago, an experimental program
began that returned park entrance fees to the parks; it will
generate about $400 million in the next several years, said Edward
Norton, vice president for law and public policy for the
preservation trust.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee is considering a bill to
increase funds for rehabilitating historic buildings in the
national parks and to stabilize the deteriorating south side of
Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely making progress,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   But in places like Newburgh, when the tour bus pulls out and the
bunting is folded, financing will probably depend, as it always
has, on the grit of a determined few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preservation is the most underrated catalyst for urban rebirth
nationwide,'' said Roberta Brandes Gratz, author of ``Cities Back
From the Edge: New Life for Downtown'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1998).
``The most desirable neighborhoods from Atlanta to Seattle are
historic districts. But preservation hasn't gained the star status
that big stadium and casino projects have because it happens in
small increments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, for example, a
model of creative financing, has spent three and a half decades
cobbling together reinvestment in formerly low-income, redlined
historic districts, neighborhoods that Jane Jacobs once compared to
``a working man's Georgetown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh foundation, said its president, Arthur Ziegler,
has set up a partnership with 11 local banks to provide
low-interest loans to community-development corporations for low-
and moderate-income housing and small businesses in the historic
district. The foundation also provides architectural assistance.
</P>
<P>
   It set up a $25 million endowment by developing (and then
selling) Station Square, a historic railroad station, now housing a
hotel, restaurants and other businesses. The project, developed
over 20 years, began with seed money from the Allegheny Foundation,
heirs to the Mellon fortune.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a smaller scale, Newburgh is beginning to use the same
financing tools. On Lander Street, a block long plagued by drugs
and abandonment and which Mrs. Clinton visited, New York developer
Arnold Moss is rebuilding 33 vacated 1850s row houses.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the Enterprise Foundation and Rural Opportunities,
a nonprofit organization that manages affordable housing, he is
knitting together private financing (about 80 percent of the $9.5
million needed), state, city and federal funds and federal tax
credits for low-income housing and historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The row houses are being designed as two-family duplexes, which
will rent for $500 to $750 a month. The sight of old buildings
beginning to look new gladdens Margie Peacock, who has lived on the
block for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad place to live,'' she said, sitting on her
porch, where a sign that says SANTA IS ALWAYS WELCOME HERE hangs on
her doorknob. ``I love to see it kept up.''
</P>
<P>
   The monumental Dutch Reformed Church, modeled on an Acropolis
temple and considered one of the finest Greek revival churches in
America, may have a tougher go. Davis, the 19th-century architect,
wrote that the design, with its giant Ionic columns and
30-foot-high entrance door, was meant to be ``indicative of the
refined taste, discrimination and sense of classical beauty of the
inhabitants of Newburgh.'' But the church lost its congregation in
1964 and has been vacant since. ``It is one of the noblest
buildings in the city,'' said J. Winthrop Aldrich, New York's
deputy commissioner for historic preservation. ``But it looks so
derelict today, it's hard to imagine what it was or might be.''
</P>
<P>
   The preservation of religious properties is ``one of the most
difficult issues we face,'' said Peg Breen, president of the New
York Landmarks Conservancy, a nonprofit organization based in
Manhattan, which has provided grants and loans to about 500
religious properties statewide. ``Cities seldom know what to do
with them or how to raise money for them,'' she added. ``Churches
don't just affect the people who go there. They are the truest
sense of landmarks: they mark the land, anchor the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the church, which is owned by the city, is in limbo,
Mayor Audrey Carey said. Volunteers from the Newburgh Center for
the Arts have replaced the roof and tend the grounds. ``We'd like
to see it become an arts center, or something compatible with
community use,'' Mayor Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   While this church awaits salvation, Target Stores recently
bought a six-page insert in Time magazine, proudly hailing its role
in helping restore the Washington Monument. (Target gave $2.5
million.) Some preservationists worry about the possible next step:
corporate ads a la the Olympics, and logos flying from national
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   On this potentially slippery slope, ``it's a question of
maintaining a balance,'' said Tony Wood, a New York City
preservationist and founder of the New York Preservation Archives,
a nonprofit group. ``Our goal is to keep what's been here for 100
years standing,'' he said. ``If you have to choose between
corporate sponsorship and losing history, you'd be a fool not to
take the check.''

   ANDERSON-BENGALS _ CINCINNATI _ The first thing you notice about
Willie Anderson is that there isn't as much of him to notice. The
Cincinnati Bengals man-mountain offensive tackle will report to
training camp at about 345 pounds, only a couple of Whoppers _
whoops, make that a couple of salads and a bowl of rice _ over his
assigned playing weight of 340. The camp that begins July 23 at
Georgetown College will be the first ``normal'' training period in
Anderson's three-year career. (Williams, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Of the world's major religions, which ones have the
most members?
</P>
<P>
   Q: An obituary for Richard McDonald said he was a co-founder of
McDonald's. I always thought Ray Kroc was the founder. Can you
explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kroc was a franchise genius credited with making the
McDonald's empire what it is today, but he wasn't the originator of
the fast-food burger-and-fries concept. Richard McDonald, who died
at 89 Tuesday in Manchester, N.H., and his brother, Maurice, were
the ones who pioneered what would become the giant chain. It also
was Richard McDonald, not Kroc, who dreamed up the company's
symbol, the ``golden arches.''
</P>
<P>
   The McDonald brothers first operated a car-hop shop in 1940 in
San Bernardino, Calif. After World War II ended, as freeways opened
and customers became interested in speedy service, the brothers
came up the idea of a limited-menu place serving inexpensive food
fast. In December 1948, they opened their first hamburger stand in
San Bernardino, and by 1954 they had sold 21 franchises and opened
nine outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Kroc, a food service equipment salesman who owned marketing
rights to milkshake mixers, saw the potential for the brothers'
concept and became their franchise agent. In 1955, Kroc founded
Franchise Realty Corp., and opened his first McDonald's store in
Des Plaines, Ill. In 1960, he changed the name to McDonald's Corp.,
and in 1961bought world franchise rights from the McDonald brothers
for $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the sale, Richard McDonald returned to his native New
Hampshire. Brother Maurice died in 1971. Kroc died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that the government is trying to
track down more than 7,000 people who are owed pensions they earned
from private defined pension plans that have been closed. The
people's names are posted on the Internet. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. is undertaking the
project. Those with computer access can search easily by name,
company and/or state by using the Pension Search Directory on the
PBGC's Internet site: http://search.pbgc.gov
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the term ``honky-tonk'' come from? I've got a bet
riding on this.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several theories, so you and your bet-mate will
have to decide which to accept. The book Picturesque Expressions: A
Thematic Dictionary says the origin lies in the ``tinny, honklike
sounds of ragtime heard in cheap nightclubs and brothels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins traces
the first printed use of the word, describing a ``cheap dance hall
featuring gambling or burlesque,'' to a February 1894 Oklahoma
newspaper. It reported on a honk-a-tonk ``well attended by
ball-heads, bachelors and leading citizens.'' The encyclopedia says
no one is sure how the word originated, adding that the British
attribute it to America, relating it to the slang word ``honky.''
It goes on to say an American authority claims it's from the
English word ``bonk,'' meaning ``to idle about.''
</P>
<P>
   The word honky, by the way, is defined in the Morris Dictionary
of Word and Phrase Origins as a corruption of hunkie or hunky, ``a
slurring term originally applied to white laboring-class men of
Hungarian origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought the first gold strike or discovery of gold in the
United States was at Dahlonega, Ga. However, the Reed Historical
Site in North Carolina says it's the first site. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: A gold nugget the size of a small smoothing iron was found at
the Reed Mine in Cabarrus County, N.C., in 1799. Gold in limited
quantities was discovered in the area, but the word ``strike,''
implying a sizable quantity, wouldn't apply. Dahlonega lays claim
to the first important discovery of gold in the United States in
1828. The federal government established a mint there that operated
from 1838 to 1861, when it closed because of Georgia's break with
the Union.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are my legal rights if I see a pet or child left
unattended in a hot parked car? Realizing that one has only so much
time to locate the driver, what is the best course of action?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your question implies a conclusion that you should ``do
something'' and mentions your ``rights.'' The real question, said
Daryl Robinson of the Georgia Department of Law, is what are your
responsibilities. Assuming you're a stranger acting as a ``Good
Samaritan,'' you have no legal obligation; but the Good Samaritan
law protects you if you act in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Several considerations are involved, Robinson said. For example,
has the child (or pet) been unattended for one minute or one hour?
If it's a child, do you know if he or she is asleep, or suffering
from heat exhaustion? Are you thinking about breaking a car window
or forcing a door, and if so, do you really have enough facts to
take such action?
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, unless a clear emergency is apparent, the
safer response under most circumstances is to notify the nearest
law enforcement officer, Robinson said. That person will deal with
the situation in an official capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In two recent movies, ``Titanic'' and ``Contact,'' when
people are calling on the radio, they say ``CQ'' before stating
their message. What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: CQ originated as a general call preceding the transmission of
radio signals (it stands for Call to Quarters ), and evolved as a
general call to talk to anyone interested. CQD (Come Quick _
Danger) was an international distress signal used before SOS.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that three German men who worked on
the rocket team that put Americans on the moon all died within
three days of each other, all in the Huntsville, Ala., area. What
happened to these men?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to published accounts, all three members of the
dwindling ranks of Wernher von Braun's World War II German rocket
team _ Max Nowak, Heinrich Paetz and Albert Schuler _ died of
natural causes. Although it may seem unusual, perhaps, that all
died within less than a week, they were of a certain age: Nowak,
89; Paetz, 88; and Schuler, 83. As reported by The Associated
Press, the original von Braun team consisted of 127 scientists.
Only about 30 to 40 are still living, said Ernst Stuhlinger, von
Braun's chief assistant, and Konrad Dannenberg, a propulsion
engineer for von Braun, both in Huntsville. Of that group, about a
dozen remain in Huntsville, home of NASA's Marshall Space Flight
Center and the Army's Redstone Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it safe to be in a boat when lightning is occurring?
</P>
<P>
   A: Experts say you should never offer yourself as a potential
target when lightning threatens. The best advice to help save your
life is to get out of the water and off small boats, and not to use
metal objects such as fishing rods.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that cooking meat kills the E. coli bacteria.
Does cooking also affect in any way the growth hormone that might
be present in meat?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since cooking methods and temperatures vary, it's difficult
to say that cooking has a particular effect on hormones in meat,
said Judy Harrison of the University of Georgia department of foods
and nutrition. But you needn't be too concerned about the hormone
issue, she added. For one thing, hormones occur naturally in
animals. And for another, the Agriculture Department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service conducts an extensive monitoring program to
prevent the marketing of animals containing unacceptable levels of
animal drugs, pesticides and other chemicals. Human bodies, by the
way, produce hormones in quantities much greater than ever would be
eaten in beef or any other food, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Aren't telemarketing calls limited to certain hours? I got a
solicitation at 8:25 a.m. recently. I thought such calls weren't
permitted before 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A: With some exceptions, the hours are restricted by federal law
to 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., according to the American Telemarketing
Association in North Hollywood, Calif. The two governing rules used
by telemarketers are the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the
Telemarketing Sales Rule, an ATA representative said. Some states
impose variations, and some states follow business hours, which
vary, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true, as I have heard, that chocolate is poison for
dogs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chocolate could prove fatal to a dog in some cases, said Dr.
Edward Taylor of Alpharetta, past president of the Georgia
Veterinary Medical Association. You might not notice a problem,
other than agitation or nervousness, if healthy dogs eat small
amounts of chocolate. But larger amounts _ several mouthfuls, for
example _ can cause a fast heartbeat or other heart rhythm
abnormalities, similar in effect to caffeine in humans, that could
result in death in a dog, especially if the animal already has
heart problems. The culprit in chocolate is the chemical
theobromine, Taylor said.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that a salvage operation within the past year came
very close to retrieving a large section of the Titanic. Do you
know if the people involved will try it again?
</P>
<P>
   A: Another expedition is planned in August, and you can watch
part of it on television. The expedition you mention ended Aug. 31,
1996, when nylon lines being used to lift a 21-ton portion of the
Titanic's hull snapped while seas were getting rough and expedition
mmbers were close to exhaustion. The hull section was 70 yards
beneath the surface when it broke loose from flotation balloons and
returned to its resting place of 84 years.
</P>
<P>
   RMS Titanic Inc., known as salvor-in-possession, will try again
soon to lift that same hull section. ``We have worked everything
out for the August attempt, and this time we're anticipating
recovery, if all goes well,'' Michelle Rollman of RMS Titanic told
Q&AMP;A. She described the 25-by-30-foot hull section as ``small
relative to the whole Titanic, but very large relative to the other
items from the ship that have been recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 8 p.m. Aug. 16, Discovery Channel will have a
two-hour broadcast live from the wreck site in the North Atlantic.
It will mix live and taped footage of all facets of the ongoing
research.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article showing how much money lobbyists in
Washington spend listed the National Committee to Preserve Social
Security and Medicare at $7.7 million. Where does that organization
get its funding?
</P>
<P>
   A: The committee, which describes itself as a ``grassroots
senior citizens' advocacy and education association,'' is funded
entirely by its members _ the public _ paying annual membership
fees of $10, said spokeswoman Kris Geddings. It has 5.5 million
members. Some of them make additional donations, Geddings said, but
any such extra donations are entirely voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you provide statistical information on the new Hong Kong
airport: size of site, number and length of runways, passenger
capacity, parking spaces and so on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok Airport, which opened July 6,
covers 3,083 acres. The passenger terminal area covers 554,000
square feet. The airport has one 12,471-foot runway now, with a
second runway expected to be operational by late 1998. Passenger
capacity is 35 million a year now, with a potential growth
estimated at 89 million people. It has 3,100 parking spaces, is
served by 46 airlines, and is connected by train to Hong Kong's
Central Station.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport covers
3,750 acres. The passenger terminal, including all concourses,
covers 5.7 million square feet (130 acres). Hartsfield has four
parallel east-west runways: two measuring 9,000 feet long, one
10,000 and one 11,889. In 1996, Hartsfield handled 63,344,730
passengers. It has 26,000 parking spaces; serves 48 airlines (32
passenger, 16 cargo); and is connected to the MARTA rapid rail
system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do any companies still pay O.J. Simpson for endorsements? I
saw him being interviewed and he was wearing a cap with a Nike
logo.
</P>
<P>
   A: Simpson must have been simply wearing a cap he liked. He was
dropped from all his endorsements, his attorneys have reported
several times, after he was charged with murdering his former wife,
Nicole Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How many nuclear devices has the U.S. government exploded
inside the United States for test purposes since such testing
began?
</P>
<P>
   A. A total of 1,030 verified U.S. tests have been conducted
since the first one July 16, 1945. Most of them (more than 900)
have been at the Nevada Test Site (in Nye County, Nev.), with
others at Nellis Air Force Range in Nevada; Amchitka, an Aleutian
Island off the coast of Alaska; Hattiesburg, Miss.; Alamagordo,
Carlsbad and Farmington, N.M.; Grand Valley and Rifle, Colo.;
Fallon, Nev.; in one at an unspecified site in central Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Of those outside the United States, many tests between June 1946
and November 1962 were in the Marshall Islands (known as the
Pacific Proving Grounds), Christmas Island and Johnston Atoll in
the Pacific Ocean, or over the South Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, 1963, the United States and the former Soviet Union
signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which effectively banned
testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, the oceans and space.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 and 1976, the United States and former Soviet Union also
signed the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear
Explosions Treaty, respectively, restricting all nuclear test
explosions to yields no greater than 150 kilotons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I graduated years ago from the high school at Subic Bay Naval
Base in the Philippines. Can you give us an update what has become
of it, and Clark Air Force Base, after they were abandoned by the
United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since the Americans were booted out in 1992, Subic Bay _ now
called Subic Bay Freeport _ has become a surprising success. One of
the reasons: When the U.S. flag was lowered on Subic Nov. 24, 1992,
the Americans left behind $8 billion in infrastructure _ meaning
buildings, power plant and storage tanks. The facilities were
placed under the guard of 8,000 volunteers so there would be no
repeat of what happened at Clark, where looters stripped the base
of everything from light fixtures to toilet bowls. Clark was
abandoned in 1991 after it was buried in volcanic ash by the
eruption of Mount Pinatubo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the administration of the Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority, the Subic port quickly attracted manufacturing and
investment, and today Japanese and Taiwanese industrial parks
manufacture a variety of products, from computer motherboards to
armored personnel carriers. Subic also became the regional hub for
Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   While Clark lags behind, Filipino officials say companies are
beginning to pour money into development.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV documentary on Roy Rogers' life and career mentioned
briefly that his second wife, Dale Evans, had a son from her first
marriage. There was no further mention of him. Do you have any
details?
</P>
<P>
   A: Evans was married at age 15, long before she met Roy Rogers.
Thomas Frederick Fox Jr. was born to that marriage, which ended in
divorce in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a music minister in Sacramento, Calif., has always shunned
the limelight. But in a Washington Post interview in 1984, Dale
Evans said her first-born son was responsible for her religious
conversion in 1948, when he would have been 19 or 20. ``My son,
grown then, asked me to accept Jesus Christ,'' Evans told the
interviewer. ``I went to church with him one night. He wanted me to
accept Christ right then, but I didn't. Now, bear in mind that Roy
was No. 1 in box office. I was embarrassed. I didn't know how it
would affect Roy. I went home and prayed all by myself. And all of
a sudden, the Lord just unrolled my life. And you know what? Six
weeks later, Roy was right there with us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Texas Gov. George W. Bush explained what appears to be
his inconsistent approach in two capital offense cases, that of
Karla Faye Tucker and Henry Lucas?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tucker's wasn't the only case in which Bush didn't use the
power of his office to halt an execution. Since he became governor
Jan. 17, 1995, 67 men and one woman (Tucker) have been put to
death. In an interview in the Dallas Morning News, Bush explained
his reasoning in commuting the sentence of Lucas: ``The first
question I ask in every case is whether there is any doubt about
the individual's guilt or innocence. This is the first case since I
have been the governor when the answer to that question was yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas had been scheduled to die by injection June 30 for raping
and strangling a woman whose body was found in a highway culvert
north of Austin on Oct. 31, 1979. Lucas confessed to that crime in
the early 1960s, when he was building his reputation as the worst
mass murderer in American history by admitting to as many as 600
slayings. But in 1985, after it was proved that he couldn't have
committed many of the murders, he recanted all his confessions.
</P>
<P>
   A strong supporter of the death penalty, Bush said no execution
should be carried out if there's a chance that the defendant is
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People often use the word ``cop.'' What is the origin, and is
it considered derogatory?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several theories about the origin. One is that it
comes from the initials c.o.p., from constable on patrol, dating to
the late 1800s when English police officers were called constables.
Some people believe it's short for copper, referring to the copper
badges worn by police officers, and others that it's from the
copper buttons once worn by British bobbies. Untrue, according to
Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins, because the term cop,
in the sense of ``one who captures or snatches,'' was recorded as
early as 1704, and bobbies didn't come into existence until 1828,
when Sir Robert Peel secured passage of Britain's first modern
Police Act. Probably any police officer would prefer to be called
just that, and it's well known that J. Edgar Hoover long found
``cop'' to be a source of irritation. But in most usages, it isn't
intended to be derogatory.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The news media reports there's a $1 million reward for Eric
Robert Rudolph, wanted in connection with the abortion clinic
bombing in Birmingham, Ala. I saw an FBI poster and it said the
reward was ``up to'' $1 million. Which is correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: The correct wording is ``up to'' $1 million for information
leading directly to the arrest of Rudolph. Typically in such cases
a lesser reward amount is possible for useful information that
doesn't necessarily lead to a suspect's arrest, according to the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If someone is awarded the $1 million FBI reward for turning
in Eric Robert Rudolph, is that money tax-exempt?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It's taxable to the recipient, the IRS says. The person
receiving the reward money also would receive a 1099 Miscellaneous
document from the IRS showing the amount of the reward and,
possibly, any amount already withheld for tax. This would be in any
type of reward with money paid by the federal government, not just
the reward offered in the Rudolph case, said IRS spokesman Eric
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Of the world's major religions, which ones have the most
members?
</P>
<P>
   A: As you may imagine, absolute numbers aren't possible, but
here's some data that may be useful. According to the 1998 Guinness
Book of World Records, in 1994, Christianity was the world's
largest religion with some 1.9 billion adherents (or 33.7 percent
of the world's population). Of these, 1.06 billion were Roman
Catholics. The largest non-Christian religion, again in 1994, was
Islam, with about 1.03 billion followers.
</P>
<P>
   World Book Encyclopedia's somewhat differing statistics are for
1993, with an estimated 1.6 billion followers of Christianity
broken down this way: Roman Catholic, 1.04 billion; Protestant,
382.3 million; and Orthodox, 173.6 million. Non-Christian: Islam,
1.014 billion; Hinduism, 751.4 million; Buddhism, 334 million;
Chinese folk religion (defined as a system of beliefs that includes
Confucianism and Taoism), 141 million; Judaism, 12.9 million; and
Shintoism, 3.33 million.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Of the world's major religions, which ones have the
most members?
</P>
<P>
   Q: An obituary for Richard McDonald said he was a co-founder of
McDonald's. I always thought Ray Kroc was the founder. Can you
explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kroc was a franchise genius credited with making the
McDonald's empire what it is today, but he wasn't the originator of
the fast-food burger-and-fries concept. Richard McDonald, who died
at 89 Tuesday in Manchester, N.H., and his brother, Maurice, were
the ones who pioneered what would become the giant chain. It also
was Richard McDonald, not Kroc, who dreamed up the company's
symbol, the ``golden arches.''
</P>
<P>
   The McDonald brothers first operated a car-hop shop in 1940 in
San Bernardino, Calif. After World War II ended, as freeways opened
and customers became interested in speedy service, the brothers
came up the idea of a limited-menu place serving inexpensive food
fast. In December 1948, they opened their first hamburger stand in
San Bernardino, and by 1954 they had sold 21 franchises and opened
nine outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Kroc, a food service equipment salesman who owned marketing
rights to milkshake mixers, saw the potential for the brothers'
concept and became their franchise agent. In 1955, Kroc founded
Franchise Realty Corp., and opened his first McDonald's store in
Des Plaines, Ill. In 1960, he changed the name to McDonald's Corp.,
and in 1961bought world franchise rights from the McDonald brothers
for $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the sale, Richard McDonald returned to his native New
Hampshire. Brother Maurice died in 1971. Kroc died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that the government is trying to
track down more than 7,000 people who are owed pensions they earned
from private defined pension plans that have been closed. The
people's names are posted on the Internet. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. is undertaking the
project. Those with computer access can search easily by name,
company and/or state by using the Pension Search Directory on the
PBGC's Internet site: http://search.pbgc.gov
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the term ``honky-tonk'' come from? I've got a bet
riding on this.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several theories, so you and your bet-mate will
have to decide which to accept. The book Picturesque Expressions: A
Thematic Dictionary says the origin lies in the ``tinny, honklike
sounds of ragtime heard in cheap nightclubs and brothels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins traces
the first printed use of the word, describing a ``cheap dance hall
featuring gambling or burlesque,'' to a February 1894 Oklahoma
newspaper. It reported on a honk-a-tonk ``well attended by
ball-heads, bachelors and leading citizens.'' The encyclopedia says
no one is sure how the word originated, adding that the British
attribute it to America, relating it to the slang word ``honky.''
It goes on to say an American authority claims it's from the
English word ``bonk,'' meaning ``to idle about.''
</P>
<P>
   The word honky, by the way, is defined in the Morris Dictionary
of Word and Phrase Origins as a corruption of hunkie or hunky, ``a
slurring term originally applied to white laboring-class men of
Hungarian origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought the first gold strike or discovery of gold in the
United States was at Dahlonega, Ga. However, the Reed Historical
Site in North Carolina says it's the first site. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: A gold nugget the size of a small smoothing iron was found at
the Reed Mine in Cabarrus County, N.C., in 1799. Gold in limited
quantities was discovered in the area, but the word ``strike,''
implying a sizable quantity, wouldn't apply. Dahlonega lays claim
to the first important discovery of gold in the United States in
1828. The federal government established a mint there that operated
from 1838 to 1861, when it closed because of Georgia's break with
the Union.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are my legal rights if I see a pet or child left
unattended in a hot parked car? Realizing that one has only so much
time to locate the driver, what is the best course of action?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your question implies a conclusion that you should ``do
something'' and mentions your ``rights.'' The real question, said
Daryl Robinson of the Georgia Department of Law, is what are your
responsibilities. Assuming you're a stranger acting as a ``Good
Samaritan,'' you have no legal obligation; but the Good Samaritan
law protects you if you act in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Several considerations are involved, Robinson said. For example,
has the child (or pet) been unattended for one minute or one hour?
If it's a child, do you know if he or she is asleep, or suffering
from heat exhaustion? Are you thinking about breaking a car window
or forcing a door, and if so, do you really have enough facts to
take such action?
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, unless a clear emergency is apparent, the
safer response under most circumstances is to notify the nearest
law enforcement officer, Robinson said. That person will deal with
the situation in an official capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In two recent movies, ``Titanic'' and ``Contact,'' when
people are calling on the radio, they say ``CQ'' before stating
their message. What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: CQ originated as a general call preceding the transmission of
radio signals (it stands for Call to Quarters ), and evolved as a
general call to talk to anyone interested. CQD (Come Quick _
Danger) was an international distress signal used before SOS.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that three German men who worked on
the rocket team that put Americans on the moon all died within
three days of each other, all in the Huntsville, Ala., area. What
happened to these men?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to published accounts, all three members of the
dwindling ranks of Wernher von Braun's World War II German rocket
team _ Max Nowak, Heinrich Paetz and Albert Schuler _ died of
natural causes. Although it may seem unusual, perhaps, that all
died within less than a week, they were of a certain age: Nowak,
89; Paetz, 88; and Schuler, 83. As reported by The Associated
Press, the original von Braun team consisted of 127 scientists.
Only about 30 to 40 are still living, said Ernst Stuhlinger, von
Braun's chief assistant, and Konrad Dannenberg, a propulsion
engineer for von Braun, both in Huntsville. Of that group, about a
dozen remain in Huntsville, home of NASA's Marshall Space Flight
Center and the Army's Redstone Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it safe to be in a boat when lightning is occurring?
</P>
<P>
   A: Experts say you should never offer yourself as a potential
target when lightning threatens. The best advice to help save your
life is to get out of the water and off small boats, and not to use
metal objects such as fishing rods.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that cooking meat kills the E. coli bacteria.
Does cooking also affect in any way the growth hormone that might
be present in meat?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since cooking methods and temperatures vary, it's difficult
to say that cooking has a particular effect on hormones in meat,
said Judy Harrison of the University of Georgia department of foods
and nutrition. But you needn't be too concerned about the hormone
issue, she added. For one thing, hormones occur naturally in
animals. And for another, the Agriculture Department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service conducts an extensive monitoring program to
prevent the marketing of animals containing unacceptable levels of
animal drugs, pesticides and other chemicals. Human bodies, by the
way, produce hormones in quantities much greater than ever would be
eaten in beef or any other food, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Aren't telemarketing calls limited to certain hours? I got a
solicitation at 8:25 a.m. recently. I thought such calls weren't
permitted before 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A: With some exceptions, the hours are restricted by federal law
to 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., according to the American Telemarketing
Association in North Hollywood, Calif. The two governing rules used
by telemarketers are the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the
Telemarketing Sales Rule, an ATA representative said. Some states
impose variations, and some states follow business hours, which
vary, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true, as I have heard, that chocolate is poison for
dogs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chocolate could prove fatal to a dog in some cases, said Dr.
Edward Taylor of Alpharetta, past president of the Georgia
Veterinary Medical Association. You might not notice a problem,
other than agitation or nervousness, if healthy dogs eat small
amounts of chocolate. But larger amounts _ several mouthfuls, for
example _ can cause a fast heartbeat or other heart rhythm
abnormalities, similar in effect to caffeine in humans, that could
result in death in a dog, especially if the animal already has
heart problems. The culprit in chocolate is the chemical
theobromine, Taylor said.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that a salvage operation within the past year came
very close to retrieving a large section of the Titanic. Do you
know if the people involved will try it again?
</P>
<P>
   A: Another expedition is planned in August, and you can watch
part of it on television. The expedition you mention ended Aug. 31,
1996, when nylon lines being used to lift a 21-ton portion of the
Titanic's hull snapped while seas were getting rough and expedition
members were close to exhaustion. The hull section was 70 yards
beneath the surface when it broke loose from flotation balloons and
returned to its resting place of 84 years.
</P>
<P>
   RMS Titanic Inc., known as salvor-in-possession, will try again
soon to lift that same hull section. ``We have worked everything
out for the August attempt, and this time we're anticipating
recovery, if all goes well,'' Michelle Rollman of RMS Titanic told
Q&AMP;A. She described the 25-by-30-foot hull section as ``small
relative to the whole Titanic, but very large relative to the other
items from the ship that have been recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 8 p.m. Aug. 16, Discovery Channel will have a
two-hour broadcast live from the wreck site in the North Atlantic.
It will mix live and taped footage of all facets of the ongoing
research.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article showing how much money lobbyists in
Washington spend listed the National Committee to Preserve Social
Security and Medicare at $7.7 million. Where does that organization
get its funding?
</P>
<P>
   A: The committee, which describes itself as a ``grassroots
senior citizens' advocacy and education association,'' is funded
entirely by its members _ the public _ paying annual membership
fees of $10, said spokeswoman Kris Geddings. It has 5.5 million
members. Some of them make additional donations, Geddings said, but
any such extra donations are entirely voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you provide statistical information on the new Hong Kong
airport: size of site, number and length of runways, passenger
capacity, parking spaces and so on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok Airport, which opened July 6,
covers 3,083 acres. The passenger terminal area covers 554,000
square feet. The airport has one 12,471-foot runway now, with a
second runway expected to be operational by late 1998. Passenger
capacity is 35 million a year now, with a potential growth
estimated at 89 million people. It has 3,100 parking spaces, is
served by 46 airlines, and is connected by train to Hong Kong's
Central Station.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport covers
3,750 acres. The passenger terminal, including all concourses,
covers 5.7 million square feet (130 acres). Hartsfield has four
parallel east-west runways: two measuring 9,000 feet long, one
10,000 and one 11,889. In 1996, Hartsfield handled 63,344,730
passengers. It has 26,000 parking spaces; serves 48 airlines (32
passenger, 16 cargo); and is connected to the MARTA rapid rail
system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do any companies still pay O.J. Simpson for endorsements? I
saw him being interviewed and he was wearing a cap with a Nike
logo.
</P>
<P>
   A: Simpson must have been simply wearing a cap he liked. He was
dropped from all his endorsements, his attorneys have reported
several times, after he was charged with murdering his former wife,
Nicole Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How many nuclear devices has the U.S. government exploded
inside the United States for test purposes since such testing
began?
</P>
<P>
   A. A total of 1,030 verified U.S. tests have been conducted
since the first one July 16, 1945. Most of them (more than 900)
have been at the Nevada Test Site (in Nye County, Nev.), with
others at Nellis Air Force Range in Nevada; Amchitka, an Aleutian
Island off the coast of Alaska; Hattiesburg, Miss.; Alamagordo,
Carlsbad and Farmington, N.M.; Grand Valley and Rifle, Colo.;
Fallon, Nev.; in one at an unspecified site in central Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Of those outside the United States, many tests between June 1946
and November 1962 were in the Marshall Islands (known as the
Pacific Proving Grounds), Christmas Island and Johnston Atoll in
the Pacific Ocean, or over the South Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, 1963, the United States and the former Soviet Union
signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which effectively banned
testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, the oceans and space.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 and 1976, the United States and former Soviet Union also
signed the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear
Explosions Treaty, respectively, restricting all nuclear test
explosions to yields no greater than 150 kilotons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I graduated years ago from the high school at Subic Bay Naval
Base in the Philippines. Can you give us an update what has become
of it, and Clark Air Force Base, after they were abandoned by the
United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since the Americans were booted out in 1992, Subic Bay _ now
called Subic Bay Freeport _ has become a surprising success. One of
the reasons: When the U.S. flag was lowered on Subic Nov. 24, 1992,
the Americans left behind $8 billion in infrastructure _ meaning
buildings, power plant and storage tanks. The facilities were
placed under the guard of 8,000 volunteers so there would be no
repeat of what happened at Clark, where looters stripped the base
of everything from light fixtures to toilet bowls. Clark was
abandoned in 1991 after it was buried in volcanic ash by the
eruption of Mount Pinatubo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the administration of the Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority, the Subic port quickly attracted manufacturing and
investment, and today Japanese and Taiwanese industrial parks
manufacture a variety of products, from computer motherboards to
armored personnel carriers. Subic also became the regional hub for
Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   While Clark lags behind, Filipino officials say companies are
beginning to pour money into development.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV documentary on Roy Rogers' life and career mentioned
briefly that his second wife, Dale Evans, had a son from her first
marriage. There was no further mention of him. Do you have any
details?
</P>
<P>
   A: Evans was married at age 15, long before she met Roy Rogers.
Thomas Frederick Fox Jr. was born to that marriage, which ended in
divorce in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a music minister in Sacramento, Calif., has always shunned
the limelight. But in a Washington Post interview in 1984, Dale
Evans said her first-born son was responsible for her religious
conversion in 1948, when he would have been 19 or 20. ``My son,
grown then, asked me to accept Jesus Christ,'' Evans told the
interviewer. ``I went to church with him one night. He wanted me to
accept Christ right then, but I didn't. Now, bear in mind that Roy
was No. 1 in box office. I was embarrassed. I didn't know how it
would affect Roy. I went home and prayed all by myself. And all of
a sudden, the Lord just unrolled my life. And you know what? Six
weeks later, Roy was right there with us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Texas Gov. George W. Bush explained what appears to be
his inconsistent approach in two capital offense cases, that of
Karla Faye Tucker and Henry Lucas?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tucker's wasn't the only case in which Bush didn't use the
power of his office to halt an execution. Since he became governor
Jan. 17, 1995, 67 men and one woman (Tucker) have been put to
death. In an interview in the Dallas Morning News, Bush explained
his reasoning in commuting the sentence of Lucas: ``The first
question I ask in every case is whether there is any doubt about
the individual's guilt or innocence. This is the first case since I
have been the governor when the answer to that question was yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas had been scheduled to die by injection June 30 for raping
and strangling a woman whose body was found in a highway culvert
north of Austin on Oct. 31, 1979. Lucas confessed to that crime in
the early 1960s, when he was building his reputation as the worst
mass murderer in American history by admitting to as many as 600
slayings. But in 1985, after it was proved that he couldn't have
committed many of the murders, he recanted all his confessions.
</P>
<P>
   A strong supporter of the death penalty, Bush said no execution
should be carried out if there's a chance that the defendant is
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People often use the word ``cop.'' What is the origin, and is
it considered derogatory?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several theories about the origin. One is that it
comes from the initials c.o.p., from constable on patrol, dating to
the late 1800s when English police officers were called constables.
Some people believe it's short for copper, referring to the copper
badges worn by police officers, and others that it's from the
copper buttons once worn by British bobbies. Untrue, according to
Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins, because the term cop,
in the sense of ``one who captures or snatches,'' was recorded as
early as 1704, and bobbies didn't come into existence until 1828,
when Sir Robert Peel secured passage of Britain's first modern
Police Act. Probably any police officer would prefer to be called
just that, and it's well known that J. Edgar Hoover long found
``cop'' to be a source of irritation. But in most usages, it isn't
intended to be derogatory.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The news media reports there's a $1 million reward for Eric
Robert Rudolph, wanted in connection with the abortion clinic
bombing in Birmingham, Ala. I saw an FBI poster and it said the
reward was ``up to'' $1 million. Which is correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: The correct wording is ``up to'' $1 million for information
leading directly to the arrest of Rudolph. Typically in such cases
a lesser reward amount is possible for useful information that
doesn't necessarily lead to a suspect's arrest, according to the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If someone is awarded the $1 million FBI reward for turning
in Eric Robert Rudolph, is that money tax-exempt?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It's taxable to the recipient, the IRS says. The person
receiving the reward money also would receive a 1099 Miscellaneous
document from the IRS showing the amount of the reward and,
possibly, any amount already withheld for tax. This would be in any
type of reward with money paid by the federal government, not just
the reward offered in the Rudolph case, said IRS spokesman Eric
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Of the world's major religions, which ones have the most
members?
</P>
<P>
   A: As you may imagine, absolute numbers aren't possible, but
here's some data that may be useful. According to the 1998 Guinness
Book of World Records, in 1994, Christianity was the world's
largest religion with some 1.9 billion adherents (or 33.7 percent
of the world's population). Of these, 1.06 billion were Roman
Catholics. The largest non-Christian religion, again in 1994, was
Islam, with about 1.03 billion followers.
</P>
<P>
   World Book Encyclopedia's somewhat differing statistics are for
1993, with an estimated 1.6 billion followers of Christianity
broken down this way: Roman Catholic, 1.04 billion; Protestant,
382.3 million; and Orthodox, 173.6 million. Non-Christian: Islam,
1.014 billion; Hinduism, 751.4 million; Buddhism, 334 million;
Chinese folk religion (defined as a system of beliefs that includes
Confucianism and Taoism), 141 million; Judaism, 12.9 million; and
Shintoism, 3.33 million.

THOMPSON CALLS U.S. SANCTIONS POLICY `A MESS,' ASSAILS CLINTON ON
CHINA, RUSSIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton must abandon his efforts to
expand trade with Russia and China until those countries stop
selling nuclear weapons technology to U.S. enemies, a leading
congressional critic said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who investigated alleged Chinese
contributions to Clinton's re-election campaign, said the
president's zeal for doing business with Russia and China has
resulted in Clinton ``jumping through hoops to avoid imposing
sanctions'' on these countries for selling technology to terrorist
countries, such as Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The senator called U.S. sanctions policy ``a mess,'' noting that
smaller American trading partners, India and Pakistan, were
summarily penalized for testing nuclear weapons while Russia and
China have escaped sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a major problem with Russia and China,'' Thompson
said. ``We've got to change our philosophy and who we're trading
with ... We need to distinguish between those nations that pose a
threat to us and those that don't.``
</P>
<P>
   State Department press officers disagreed with Thompson's
assessment, saying the United States is working closely with Russia
and China to create and implement effective ways to block the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who is considering a presidential run in 2000,
assailed Clinton for focusing on trade and not pressing China more
on its technology sales during the president's trip to the Asian
nation earlier this summer. The senator urged Vice President Al
Gore to raise the issue with Russian officials when he visits their
country this week and said the president and Congress should
withhold financial aid from Russia until its leaders stop selling
nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good stuff money is not going to be sustainable unless
they modify their behavior,'' Thompson said. ``We cannot give them
a blank check.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting U.S. leaders ``don't have much choice,'' Thompson said
national security would be placed at risk if the president and
Congress fail to address Russia and China's selling of nuclear
technology. ``I don't see how we explain that failure to the next
generation,'' the senator added.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, as chair of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
conducted months of congressional hearings that failed to show
whether Clinton illegally received campaign contributions from the
Chinese government during the president's 1996 re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who does not face re-election this year, said he
will ``take a look'' at running for president in 2000 after the
elections this November. &QL;

MONOPOLY OFFERS NEW TOKENS FOR OUR AFFECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The little doohickies are embedded in our national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any American, and most will remember the thimble, the iron,
the wheelbarrow, the battleship, the shoe, the top hat, the cannon,
the rocking horse and the popular fought-over car.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Brothers, which makes Monopoly, is adding a new token to
its game, the first change in 40 years. The toymaker is asking
people to decide whether a 1935 biplane, a piggy bank or a sack of
money will join the ranks of playing pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's another marketing gimmick. But if you look closely,
and if you find a psychologist with a sense of humor, you can learn
something about yourself _ and your playmates _ by examining your
favorite token.
</P>
<P>
   Take the roadster. Choose that and you are a free spirit, a
thrill-seeker, an adventurous type, says Dr. Joe Tecce, professor
of psychology at Boston College, and a heck of a good sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we make a choice ... it is a kind of projective test in
that we choose what fills our needs, fits our personality and makes
us feel good about ourselves,'' Tecce says.
</P>
<P>
   Were you the thimble or the iron? If so, that tells Tecce you
are probably female, practical and have a touch of domesticity.
</P>
<P>
   Psychobabble wasn't part of the first game _ and neither were
tokens. Charles Darrow, who brought the game to Parker Brothers,
suggested that players use household items such as buttons and
pennies. The first tokens, four wooden pawns, came the next year,
in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Monopoly added the tokens we remember in 1937. Because the game
arrived during the Great Depression, the tokens represented things
found in any household, said Monopoly historian Jack McMahon. They
were a rocking horse, a purse, a lantern, a thimble, a shoe and an
iron. Two others _ a top hat and a car _ symbolized ``Rich Uncle
Pennybags,'' the imaginary character whose face still decorates the
box today. The cannon and battleship were swiped from the game
Conflict.
</P>
<P>
   They lasted until World War II, when a metal shortage turned
them into abstract wooden figures like you'd find in Sorry!
</P>
<P>
   Seven other tokens surfaced periodically, but McMahon doesn't
know the history of the bathtub, the candlestick, the streetcar,
the trophy, the roadster with a driver, the anti-aircraft gun or
``Lucy'' the elephant.
</P>
<P>
   The big change came in the early 1950s, when Monopoly booted the
lantern, the purse and the rocking horse, and replaced them with
Uncle Pennybags' dog, a horse with rider and a wheelbarrow.
</P>
<P>
   The doohickies haven't changed since.
</P>
<P>
   United States Monopoly champion Roger Craig uses the iron,
contending that it hides him behind hotels and houses. World
champion Christopher Woo prefers the top hat, for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   Psychology professor Tecce says the top hat tells him you are
elegant and glamorous _ or you want to be. The top hat is also
elitist. ``Maybe your wish fulfillment is at work here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The wheelbarrow? That's the blue collar token. It says you are
proud of your hard work. ``Bill Gates would not choose this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The player who chooses the dog is a kind, gentle, sensitive and
generous soul. The shoe is another matter. It tells Tecce ``you
could not be a more practical, pragmatic person.''
</P>
<P>
   The battleship and cannon tell Tecce you are probably male, and
these icons ``appeal to you because of the empowerment they
represent.'' Pick the horse with rider and you are competitive,
athletic, outdoorsy and outgoing.
</P>
<P>
   The new tokens come with baggage, too.
</P>
<P>
   Vote for the biplane, and it says you are a romantic who throws
conventional wisdom to the wind. Pick the piggy bank, and you are
thrifty and sensitive to aesthetics and animals. The sack of money
means one thing: You are hard-nosed, unsentimental and
business-minded.
</P>
<P>
   You're the guy who always wins.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLANE OR THE PIG?
</P>
<P>
   To vote for the new Monopoly token, call (888) 81-TOKEN, or go
to www.monopoly.com. Voting ends Sept. 30. The biplane is winning
so far.

<P>
   Rich Uncle Pennybags' first name is Milton. He is called
``Chairman of the Board.'' He debuted in 1936 on the Chance and
Community Chest cards. He once won second place in a beauty
contest. His hobbies are collecting pennies, making millions,
building monopolies, avoiding the luxury tax and strolling on
Boardwalk. He lives on Marvin Gardens with his wife, Madge. They
have three nephews, Andy, Randy and Sandy, and a pet dog, Scotty
the terrier.

   Monopoly is published in 26 languages in 80 countries. A Braille
edition arrived in the 1970s.

   The preferred properties of the current U.S. Monopoly champion
are Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky. The current international
champion favors the orange properties _ New York Avenue, Tennessee

&HT;        FOX FINANCES BLOODIED BY GOP PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 22 -- His Republican challengers may not have
been able to upset his re-election bid, but U.S. Rep. Jon Fox,
R-Abington, has emerged as a wounded incumbent badly trailing
Democratic challenger Joseph Hoeffel in the money race.
</P>
<P>
   As of June 30, Hoeffel had three times as much money remaining
in his campaign account as did Fox, who narrowly beat Hoeffel in
1996 by 84 votes. Hoeffel has $393,270 to Fox's $134,500, according
to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not counting the roughly $150,000 Hoeffel raked in at
a fundraiser Monday in Gladwynne, with First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton on hand. Between 400 and 450 people attended the event,
paying either $125 for the right to hang out with Clinton and
Hoeffel in the backyard of a private home or $1,000 for a smaller
gathering inside the home.
</P>
<P>
   It's a much different feeling for Hoeffel to be leading the
money race against Fox, who far outspent the Democratic Montgomery
County commissioner -- $1.66 million to $697,000 -- in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great help to the campaign, compared to two years
ago,'' said Jeff Stein, Hoeffel's campaign manager. ``He's not
going to be able to outspend us two to one from Labor Day on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with this money edge, Hoeffel faces different circumstances
that could make his upset bid more difficult than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the ticket this fall is GOP Gov. Ridge and GOP Sen.
Arlen Specter, both of whom are facing nominal challengers, as
opposed to 1996 when President Clinton pulled in votes for Hoeffel.
And the AFL-CIO, which spent more than $300,000 in anti-Fox ads in
October 1996, is not going to be active this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But with Democrats needing an 11-seat swing to take over the
House, they have been eyeing up Fox ever since that razor-thin
victory. And so did Republicans in Montgomery County, three of whom
challenged Fox in the May primary. He won by a large margin over
his GOP challengers, but they forced Fox to unload his campaign
funds early.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and the first six months of 1998, Fox spent $856,000.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was ``pleased with the fundraising results,'' Fox said
in a statement, ``Coming on the heels of a very expensive primary
election, the Fox for Congress Committee is well on target to raise
the required funds for the upcoming campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, Fox has raised $957,561; Hoeffel has raised just
$538,178.

WOMEN'S GROUP PICKETS CONGRESS TO URGE DEFEAT OF ANTI-GAY BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Organization for Women picketed
Congress Wednesday to urge the defeat of two anti-gay legislative
proposals that the NOW president criticized as political gimmicks
designed to energize conservative Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   The protest rally came as the House prepared to vote on the
proposals that NOW President Patricia Ireland said would
politically damage Republicans by making them look ``very mean and
hateful.''
</P>
<P>
   One proposal sponsored by Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., would
prohibit the city of San Francisco from using federal housing funds
if the city continues to require its private contractors to provide
the same benefits to unmarried domestic partners as they provide
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal by Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., would nullify an
executive order by President Clinton that barred federal agencies
from discriminating against gays.
</P>
<P>
   To expose what she called ``a back-door attempt to slip''
anti-gay legislation though Congress, Ireland joined about 50
picketers marching in scorching heat outside a House office
building Wednesday, shouting slogans such as ``Hey, hey, ho, ho,
homophobia's got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Some picketers carried placards with such slogans as, ``I feel
fine, I don't need to be cured,'' a response to recent newspaper
advertisements sponsored by conservative groups that maintain
religion can change the sexual orientation of gays.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ireland said the Riggs and Hefley proposals
were attempts to mobilize right-wing Christians to vote in the
November elections in a year in which experts predict a lackluster
voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clearly an election-year wedge issue,'' Ireland
said, adding ``To punish cities that are forward-looking like San
Francisco is just outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why NOW was fighting for gay rights, Ireland said the
group is ``working for all women's equality _ it includes lesbian,
bisexual and transgender people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that all oppression is wrong,'' Ireland said. ``As
feminists we do often raise issues that people consider radical.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland added: ``Every woman who steps forward to claim her
rights faces the allegation that she is queer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland said 150 years ago, women who attended the women's
rights convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y., were called ``mannish,
unnatural, and spinsters.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Peter LaBarbera, president of Americans for
Truth, a conservative group that joined with 14 others to pay for
the anti-gay advertisements in major newspapers last week, said NOW
``is out of touch with American women,'' and ``obsessed with
lesbianism.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBarbera said anti-discrimination protections in civil rights
law should not be applied to homosexual behavior ``that, unlike
skin color, can be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration urged Congress to include
sexual orientation under the federal hate crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, the acting assistant attorney general for civil
rights, told the House Judiciary Committee that President Clinton
strongly supports changing the law so that the FBI can assist state
and local governments in investigating hate crimes based on sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the FBI is empowered to step in to help
investigate certain hate crimes based on race, color, religion or
national origin. But Lee said the law is deficient because it does
not cover violent hate crimes stemming from bias based on the
victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also heard testimony from Mark Bangerter of Boise,
Idaho, who said he was attacked in April and lost the sight in his
left eye after an assailant beat him, mistakenly believing he was
gay.
</P>
<P>
   Bangerter, an artist, said he had hugged a male friend goodbye
after meeting over drinks in a Boise bar, when a stranger called
him a ``faggot,'' punched him in the head, then pursued him outside
and continued to beat him, breaking bones around his eye sockets.
</P>
<P>
   Bangerter said the assailant was never caught, the Boise police
have said they have little time to investigate, and the FBI has
said it can not intervene because sexual orientation is not
included in a list of federal hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone hated gay people enough to try to kill me,'' Bangerter
said. ``The irony is that I am not gay. This happened to me because
I hugged a friend. Now I know what can and does happen to people
who are gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Traditional Values Coalition _ which claims to
represent 36,000 churches _ issued a statement calling the
administration's effort to expand the definition of a hate crime as
``nothing less than a premeditated assault on religious Americans
who oppose homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the coalition, said
pending legislation to expand the definition was ``like a bad
B-movie in which all of the enlightened folks from the Northeast
are going to set straight all those `Bible-toting zealots' from the
rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In her statement, Sheldon said Christians ``no more hate
homosexuals than they do alcoholics or chronic gamblers. We believe
the moral choices made by homosexuals are wrong and we encourage
them to change.''

 &HT;    CONTROVERSIAL FLORIDA INCUMBENT COULD FACE A CLOSE RACE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 26.
 &HT;    BY LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla., is no stranger to
controversy, or to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with controversies swirling around her dealings with a West
African businessman convicted of bribery and the Rev. Henry Lyons,
the indicted head of the National Baptist Convention USA, her
future is again being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome could affect which party will control the House of
Representatives next year.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans holding a 12-member margin, both parties are
looking carefully at any race that might be competitive. Rep. John
Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the Republican National Congressional
Committee _ the group that recruits and helps finance GOP House
candidates _ said there is an opportunity to pick up Brown's 3rd
Congressional District, which sprawls across portions of nine
counties from Jacksonville to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you are running against someone who has to refer all
of her questions about her campaign to her attorney,'' that's a
race with potential, Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Linder's committee will almost certainly give Brown's opponent,
businessman Bill Randall, the $5,000 maximum contribution allowed.
Whether it also will spend the roughly $60,000 allowed in
coordinated expenditures won't be decided until this fall, though
Linder said it is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to look at all the races and fully fund 90 to 100,
and this will probably be one of those, unless our candidate takes
a hike,'' Linder said, adding that he expects Randall to run a
competitive race.
</P>
<P>
   Linder isn't counting on unseating Brown to retain Republican
control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the key to our holding a majority. With or without
this election, we will add to our numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats are worried about holding Brown's seat, they're
not voicing those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corrine Brown is an excellent member of Congress,'' said Rep.
Martin Frost, D-Texas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. ``I think she will be judged on her record. I
have every confidence that she will be re-elected and probably
re-elected by a significant margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost noted that previous opponents have tried to tar Brown with
ethical misdeeds and failed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Corrine will be just fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite a record marred with ethical missteps Brown's
political fortunes have flourished.
</P>
<P>
   At 51, the Jacksonville native is a political veteran who served
10 years in the Legislature and three terms in Congress. During
those years she earned a reputation as a savvy politician who would
fight tenaciously for her constituents and their causes.
</P>
<P>
   She's also done things that have led political opponents to
question her ethics.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1990, Brown helped a friend win a $425,000 federal
``business incubator'' grant. The project failed, and the city of
Jacksonville was forced to repay $314,000 out of future federal
block grants. The state attorney's office investigated Brown's role
in the grant, but said there was no reason to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1993, Brown agreed to pay a $5,000 fine _ but did not admit
guilt _ after a state ethics commission found probable cause to
believe she illegally used state employees to work in her private
travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also in 1993, Brown's campaign treasurer quit after learning
his signature had been forged on several Federal Election
Commission reports by her administrative assistant. Later that
year, Brown submitted amended FEC reports showing she previously
had not reported more than $12,000 in expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In addition to her campaign finance problems that year,
Brown's chief assistant in her congressional district was
discovered to have been convicted in 1972 of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1994, the FEC issued a report that Brown violated several
campaign finance laws during her 1992 race, including using a
corporate plane without showing she had paid for it, making loans
to her campaign without showing the money came from her personal
account, and illegally accepting donations from foreign citizens
and from corporations. A Brown aide blamed the mistakes on her
unfamiliarity with differences in state and federal campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   The current controversies swirling around Brown could make those
of the past pale by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   They break down into three distinct episodes involving a check,
a car, and a trip, all first reported by The St. Petersburg Times.
Brown, who has repeatedly avoided discussing these controversies
with the media _ even filing harassment charges against two Times
reporters that were later dropped _ declined to be interviewed for
this story.
</P>
<P>
   The first controversy involves a $10,000 check Brown received in
1996 from the Rev. Henry Lyons, drawn on a Milwaukee bank account.
Lyons, who lived a lavish lifestyle as head of the predominantly
black Baptist organization, has been charged by a Florida
prosecutor with racketeering and grand theft. Prosecutors have been
trying to tie Lyons to the Wisconsin account, which held more than
$1 million in money allegedly extorted from a Canadian company.
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not list the check on her campaign finance report or
on her personal financial disclosure report.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's attorneys said the check was used to pay for buses to
carry her supporters to a rally held outside the U.S. District
courthouse in Tallahassee where a three-judge panel was deciding
how to redraw her district's boundaries. The U.S. Supreme Court had
earlier ruled that districts similar to Brown's had been improperly
gerrymandered along racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   Because the money was used to help pay for the redistricting
rally, it was not considered a campaign expense and, therefore, did
not have to be included in her campaign reports, her attorneys
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the news stories indicated Brown was not able to demonstrate
that Lyons' check went to pay for the buses. Her campaign reported
spending only $2,000 on the buses.
</P>
<P>
   The second controversy revolves around the car and the convict.
The Times reported that West African businessman Foutanga Dit
Babani Sissoko bought a Lexus LS400 _ valued at about $50,000 _ for
Brown's 32-year-old daughter, Shantrel, a lawyer with the
Environmental Protection Agency, after Brown tried to keep him out
of prison.
</P>
<P>
   House ethics rules prohibit lawmakers from receiving gifts. The
ban also extends to members' families if the gift to the relative
is an attempt to get around the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sissoko, who now lives in Mali, was sentenced in 1997 to four
months in prison, four months of house arrest and fined $250,000
for ordering his employees to attempt to bribe a U.S. Customs
officer into letting them ship two Vietnam-era helicopters to West
Africa without the necessary licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Brown lobbied members of Congress on Sissoko's behalf and wrote
two letters to Attorney General Janet Reno urging her to use her
power to deport Sissoko before his sentence was completed. Reno
refused. Brown later visited Sissoko in prison and in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The car was paid for by Karim Pouye, whom Sissoko's attorney,
Thomas Spencer of Miami, described as Sissoko's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Shantrel Brown, who lives in Washington with her mother, issued
a written statement this month denying that the car had anything to
do with her mother's efforts to help Sissoko. She said Pouye, whom
she had met in Miami in 1997 and knew was affiliated with Sissoko,
gave her the car after she told him that her grandmother's car had
been stolen in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conversation led to Mr. Pouye's offer of a car, first for
her, later titled to me,'' Shantrel Brown said, without explaining
why she got the car and not her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that the offer was made in friendship, and I accepted
it without reservation,'' she said. ``My mother was not present in
these conversations, and she had no part in my decision to accept
the car. I am an adult who makes my own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The third controversy involves a trip Brown and two aides took
to Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union in 1996.
The 10-day trip, which cost $27,861, was paid for by Itera
International Energy Corp. of Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, Brown wrote a high-pressure letter to the
ambassador of Turkmenistan complaining that Itera was being cut out
of a plan to ship natural gas between Turkmenistan and the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope that any agreement will include my constituent
and that the United States and the state of Florida, where my
district is located, will continue to have close and warm ties with
Turkmenistan,'' Brown wrote.
</P>
<P>
   House ethics rules prohibit members from attempting to ``exert
undue or improper pressure'' on a foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   Three Florida lawmakers _ Reps. Mark Foley, a Republican from
West Palm Beach, C.W. ``Bill'' Young, a Republican from Indian
Rocks Beach, and Jim Davis, a Democrat from Tampa _ have called for
a House ethics committee investigation of Brown, but in the
unwritten tradition of the Florida delegation none have filed
formal charges against her.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, the GOP congressional campaign chairman, has been
quietly looking for a member to file charges. Even if they are
filed, however, it is unlikely the investigation would be completed
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   The controversies surrounding Brown have been reported in local
newspapers in her district, but what affect they will have on her
election is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent news stories ... have helped her to consolidate the
black Democratic base,'' said John H. Libby, president of American
Public Dialogue, a public opinion and marketing research firm with
close ties to Republican candidates. ``We've seen this historically
in this country with African-American politicians, particularly
congress people.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and her opponent, Randall, are both black.
</P>
<P>
   Since the federal panel redrew the district's boundaries two
years ago, the percentage of black voters has dropped from 50
percent to about 42 percent. But it is still overwhelmingly
Democratic: 68 percent against 24 percent Republican and 8 percent
independent, according to Libby.
</P>
<P>
   With little support from black voters and with Republicans
distinctly in the minority, Randall's hopes lie with white
Democratic voters, Libby said.
</P>
<P>
   While Brown has more campaign money to spend than Randall _
$87,252 to $13,171 _ the pace of his fund raising in recent months
has been two-and-a-half times greater than hers. During the quarter
that ended June 30, Randall raised $31,216 to Brown's $12,255.

BASS HALL WILL SERVE EVERYONE FROM THE HOITY-TOITY TO THE HOI

<P>
   FORT WORTH _ The Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Performance Hall
isn't just for the traditional fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fort Worth Symphony, the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet,
the Fort Worth Opera and the Van Cliburn Foundation will present
traditional seasons at Bass performance hall starting in September,
Performing Arts Fort Worth _ the private, nonprofit organization
that built, owns and operates the $65 million downtown multipurpose
facility _ will present its own 1998-99 season of 20 performances.
Those will include Irish music, classical music satire, big band _
even a ballet on ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, we have said we would expand the range of cultural
fare offered to the community,'' said Paul Beard, managing director
of Performing Arts Fort Worth and Bass performance hall. ``We got
the cream of what's available in touring groups. It adds a little
spice to the recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual attractions will be the St. Petersburg
State Ice Ballet, which will present performances of ``Romeo and
Juliet on Ice'' on April 13 and 14. According to Beard, the ice
ballet company travels with the equipment to produce and maintain a
sheet of ice on the stage for the performance. He said that the
production is specifically designed for presentation in facilities
such as Bass performance hall.
</P>
<P>
   The guest attractions will be marketed in three subscription
series named ``Performance Takes Wing,'' ``Under the Great Dome''
and ``Feathers of Gold,'' inspired by the hall's interior dome,
prominent feather design motif and winged angels on the facade.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ice ballet, the season will range from the
New England Spiritual Ensemble (a vocal group specializing in the
performance of traditional African-American spirituals) to
legendary comic Milton Berle to pianist-humorist Victor Borge.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Irish music will be represented by the Chieftains,
winners of four Grammy awards. Contemporary dance will be
represented by the New York-based Parsons Dance Company, famous for
its high-energy, often humorous performances. The musical
avant-garde will be represented by the Philip Glass Ensemble in
``Monsters of Grace,'' a collaboration of composer Glass with
director Robert Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Subscriptions for separate seven-event series range from $81 to
$247.50, depending on seat location and which series is purchased.
Subscriptions will go on sale tomorrow, and single tickets will go
on sale Aug. 25. Single tickets will cost $12 to $50. For
information on subscription purchases, call 212-4280.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVERPOOL, England _ The patterned brown sofa and armchair with
the white linen antimacassars are where Paul McCartney and John
Lennon, bending over their guitars and scribbling in a school
notebook, wrote their first songs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese willow print wall paper doesn't reach the corner
because the McCartney family couldn't afford to buy enough, and the
bare space is painted in a color that looks just as alluring as its
name _ Corporation Cream. It was the favored shade of the Liverpool
Corp. that built government-subsidized housing in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Graceland it isn't, but 20 Forthlin Road, home to the family of
Sir Paul McCartney from 1955 to 1964, now belongs to the ages.
</P>
<P>
   The National Trust _ the conservation charity that normally
measures its yesterdays in centuries _ has bought it, ripped out
all the decorating enhancements of the last three decades, restored
its serviceable 1950s appearance and is about to make it available
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens on July 29 it will join a number of other Beatles
attractions that have increased tourism to Liverpool, a troubled
maritime city of faded glory that has struggled to recover from the
lost prosperity of its days as an industrial center and Britain's
principal trans-Atlantic port.
</P>
<P>
   The new business ventures and foreign investment that have
revived other British cities north of London steered clear of
Liverpool for years because of its divisive politics, trade union
militancy, urban riots, gang warfare and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Now tourism has become a major business in Liverpool, employing
more people than its miles of docks once did and contributing more
than $800 million a year to the local economy. And a Merseyside
Tourism and Conference Bureau survey shows that a third of the
people who come to visit say that it's the Beatles that brought
them.
</P>
<P>
   There is a permanent exhibit called The Beatles Story in the
refurbished Albert Dock complex, and a two-hour Magical Mystery
Tour that takes in places like Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields and
the Cavern Club, the small underground room with low brick arches
where the early Beatles made their debut in Liverpool in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Bought for $91,000 and restored through a $78,000 grant, the
house at 20 Forthlin Road is the most modern building the Trust has
acquired and the first time it has bought a house associated with a
living person.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year restoration posed an exhilarating challenge to
the tweedy experts from the Trust, who are more at home cataloging
Chippendale cabinets and Queen Anne settees than scouring junk
shops and Sunday flea markets for white enameled colanders,
mass-produced flower design wallpaper and parquet linoleum from one
of the least inspired eras of decorative history.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Gibbs, the Trust's historic buildings representative,
conceded that he instinctively erred in the direction of good
taste. ``I'd show something to someone who knew the house from then
and he'd say, `We never had that; it's much too smart.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Trust says it was intent on reproducing the feeling of the
time rather than an exact replica of what the house looked like
when the McCartneys lived there. A series of photographs by Mike
McCartney, the musician's younger brother, are hung throughout the
house, usually in the same room as the family moments that they
capture occurred.
</P>
<P>
   A two-story, three-bedroom unit in a row-house red-brick block
on a leafy street with a suburban feel, it was the home of the
McCartney family from 1955, when Paul was 13, until 1964, when he
had become such a celebrity that hordes of groupies staked out the
front hedge. His father, Jim McCartney, left the house under cover
at midnight to live in a house in the country that Paul bought for
him with his newly earned fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's mother, Mary McCartney, died of breast cancer the first
year they were in the house, leaving the raising of the two boys to
McCartney, then 53.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will have to buy tickets in advance to visit the house, and
they will be ferried there by minibus from nearby Speke House, a
16th-century Tudor building also owned by the Trust. They will tour
the house in groups of 14 Wednesdays through Saturdays and there
will be six trips a day. Officials say they will be able to
accommodate only 11,000 visitors a year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stepping into the house, they will encounter the famous parlor,
a strikingly modest setting for the beginning of a songwriting
partnership that would influence popular music around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner is a black-and-white Bush television that is the
same model as the one the McCartneys bought in 1953 to watch the
coronation of Queen Elizabeth. A standing lamp overhangs the sofa,
and a now empty space is to be filled with a piano when researchers
can find one similar to the upright that stood there 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A dining alcove has a case full of Beatles items supplied by
Hunter Davies, their biographer, including the 1962 sheet music for
``Please Please Me'' with the musical instruction ``Moderato (with
a beat)'' above the first bar and the group's performing contract
with Bert Kaempfert Produktion in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   The dining-room table is fitted out with four leatherette
chairs, and on a side commode is an old rotary telephone, the first
one on the block. Mary McCartney needed to be on call for her work
as a midwife.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is a trip to Betty Crocker land with period
appliances, tin boxes with ``Bread'' and ``Biscuits'' stenciled on
their sides, Lifebuoy soap bars, an overhead clothesline for dish
towels, and the original heavy porcelain butler's sink with
sycamore draining boards on either side.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the cupboard are piles of cardboard egg cartons that
the boys used to soundproof the living room walls when they played.
On a window sill is a spray of lavender of the kind that Jim
McCartney grew in the front yard, dried and crumbled into potpourri
to mask the odor of cigarette smoke in the house.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Phillips radio of the same model that McCartney wired
with earphones so young Paul could listen upstairs to Radio
Luxembourg, the only source those days for American rhythm and
blues music by people like Little Richard and Fats Domino.
</P>
<P>
   The Forthlin Road house became the place where the two young men
gathered because Jim McCartney, a widower, was gone all day working
in the cotton exchange, leaving the place empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I would sometimes sag off school and go back to my
house to write many of our early songs,'' Sir Paul wrote in an
essay on the house passed out by the Trust. It was in the front
room that they wrote their first two: ``I Saw Her Standing There''
and ``Love Me Do.''
</P>
<P>
   No keep-off sashes cover the furniture, and visitors will even
be permitted to use the original outdoor bathroom next to the coal
shed. While out back, they can gaze upon England's most famous
drainpipe. It is the one that Paul and his brother used to climb up
to a second-story bathroom window when they were locked out. The
Trust has wired it discreetly to an alarm system to prevent theft.
</P>
<P>
   Restorers removed the double-glazed windows and replaced them
with wooden sash windows from houses in the neighborhood, tore out
the interior heating and refitted the house with Bakelite light
fixtures that they had to go to Ireland to find. They bought back
some original interior doors from Beatles memorabilia dealers,
though not the door to Paul's second-floor room. It hangs in the
Hard Rock Cafe in London.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Drury, the director general of the Trust, appeared
Tuesday with a ``Beatles Fan'' pin on the lapel of his
well-tailored blue blazer and labored to convince a group
previewing the site that the act was also aimed at focusing
attention on the postwar era of social housing construction in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   One unimpressed listener had a question. ``So when are you
buying a Spice Girls house?'' he asked. &QL;

ZAMORA DECLINES TO TESTIFY IN FORMER BOYFRIEND'S CAPITAL MURDER
TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Nervous and teary-eyed, Diane Zamora took
the witness stand in the capital murder trial of her former high
school sweetheart Wednesday _ but only to say no when asked if she
would testify before the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora, already sentenced to life in prison, declined to answer
questions rather than further incriminate herself in the 1995
slaying of romantic rival Adrianne Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Without Zamora available, defense lawyer Dan Cogdell quickly
concluded his case for David Graham. Cogdell presented no
witnesses, ``standing on (Graham's) presumption of innocence,''
thereby setting the stage for final arguments and jury
deliberations Thursday. Graham, a former U.S. Air Force Academy
cadet, faces a possible life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting only 20 feet from her ex-fiance, Zamora was in the same
room as Graham for the first time in more than a year, her lawyer
said. The now-infamous couple never spoke, but their gazes appeared
to lock on each other for a few seconds as a packed courtroom and
media cameras scrutinized their every move.
</P>
<P>
   Before that momentary eye contact, Zamora smiled at her family
members and mouthed the words ``I love you'' to them. Then, until
the legal proceedings began, she sat awkwardly, her eyes darting
around the room as if trying to avoid Graham's constant stare.
</P>
<P>
   At Graham's request, Zamora, a former U.S. Naval Academy
midshipman, was summoned from a Gatesville prison where she is
serving a life sentence with a 40-year minimum incarceration.
Cogdell has told jurors that Zamora single-handedly killed Jones,
though Graham confessed at the time of his arrest to shooting her
to appease Zamora's jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Graham has asserted there was no basis for the
jealousy and that he was not involved in the killing. It was out of
love, he said, that he helped Zamora cover up the crime for nine
months before they were arrested. Graham and Zamora were high
school seniors when the crime was committed, and they were away at
college when arrested.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Don Leonard of Fort Worth ruled that
Zamora, who is appealing her February conviction, could not be
forced to testify. But for the trial record, he allowed Cogdell to
pose two questions that she then declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Zamora,'' Cogdell said, ``would you admit that you and
you alone killed Adrianne Jones in the early morning hours of Dec.
4, 1995?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the advice of my attorney I'm exerting my Fifth
Amendment privilege,'' she replied.

<P>
   ``Would you admit, Miss Zamora, that David Graham had nothing to
do at all with the cause of the death of Adrianne Jones in the
early morning hours of Dec. 4, 1995,'' Cogdell queried.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not require Zamora to say another word. Instead,
he ordered her returned to prison, even though Cogdell said he
wanted jurors to lay eyes on Zamora so they could draw their own
conclusions about whether she was physically capable of
overpowering Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said he wanted ``to use Miss Zamora in a physical
demonstration to show logistically and physically that it is more
logical that Miss Zamora had to fire the shots ... given the
testimony of the medical examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had presented testimony indicating that the butt of
Graham's handgun was used to strike Jones in the head, moments
before she was shot twice in the face at close range. The slaying
occurred in a secluded part of Tarrant County near Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County prosecutors concluded their five-day
presentation, which included 27 witnesses and about 100 pieces of
evidence, with crucial testimony from Graham's former best friend,
John Green.
</P>
<P>
   Green said that early one December morning in 1995, Graham and
Zamora crawled through his bedroom window and used his bathroom for
a lengthy clean-up. He said Graham told him not to ask any
questions about the unusual visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never here,'' he quoted Graham as saying. Prosecutors
contend the visit came within half an hour of Jones' slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The defense's decision to present no witnesses came as a
surprise to the jammed courtroom, where people had lined up as
early as 4:30 a.m. to get a glimpse of Zamora and Graham. By the
time the court opened at 8 a.m., about 30 spectators were in line
and some were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora's aunt, Maria Consuela Mendoza, later told reporters that
Zamora was overcome with emotion about having to appear at the
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was nervous, she was upset. I don't think she has that
much of a difficulty having to face him. He knows the truth,''
Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the family and to Diane, it's like Diane is on trial all
over again. ... It's not about David. It's about Diane and what
Diane has said and done in the past,'' the aunt said, adding that
family members journeyed from the Dallas-Fort Worth area to support
Zamora.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to give a smile in between holding back the tears
because it's hard,'' she said. ``It's nerve-wracking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who visits Zamora frequently, as recently as Saturday,
said there is no romantic spark between the former lovers anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' she said. ``That's a relationship gone bad. The
only thing that Diane ever did wrong was be in love with the wrong
person. I'm sure she's got mixed emotions. You don't just get over
it overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamora's lawyer, John Linebarger, agreed with Mendoza that if
Zamora had testified, it would not have helped Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left to her own devices, Diane would have had a lot to say,
but she is wise enough to follow the advice of her attorney ... and
I don't think her testimony would have been of any benefit
whatsoever to David Graham,'' Linebarger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am authorized by her to say she would have testified to the
same thing she testified to in her trial.''

   Robert Carlyle, who shed his clothes in ``The Full Monty,'' may
don a pivotal role in the film adaptation of Frank McCourt's
Pulitzer Prize-winning best seller, ``Angela's Ashes.'' Variety

Alan Parker's version of the story of the impoverished Irish
family. Carlyle would play the alcoholic, chronically unemployed
father, and Ms. Watson would play his wife.

   Ponderous Prose
</P>
<P>
   Drawing inspiration from newspapers in his hometown, Milton,
Mass., Bob Perry, a 46-year-old corporate lawyer, beat competitors
from the United States and 14 other countries to win the 17th
annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest. The challenge _ composing
wretched opening sentences for imaginary novels _ celebrates the
memory of the prolific 19th-century novelist who began ``Paul
Clifford'' with the immortal sentence: ``It was a dark and stormy
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry's 93-word prize-winning sentence begins: ``The corpse
exuded the irresistible aroma of a piquant ancho chili glaze
enticingly enhanced with a hint of fresh cilantro as it lay before
him. . .'' San Jose State University's English department, which
organized the contest, said Perry's prize consisted of much local
adulation and ``a pittance.''

<P>
   Grand Reopening
</P>
<P>
   In Munich, Germany, the Alte Pinakothek, one of the world's
great museums, is to reopen Thursday, after four years of
renovations. The $41.7 million project included modernizing the
security system and installing air conditioning to protect the
collection and glass to guard works by Durer, Tintoretto and
Bruegel from vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Flying Visit
</P>
<P>
   Count Kevin Spacey among actors with a busy, perhaps impossible,
schedule. Plans called for him to take the night off from his role
on the London stage as Hickey in Eugene O'Neill's ``Iceman Cometh''
and to fly via New York to Los Angeles Wednesday for the premiere
of his film ``The Negotiator.'' Then Spacey was to catch the
red-eye back to New York, board the Concorde and return to London,
leaving 90 minutes to reach the Old Vic in time for Wednesday
night's performance. In case of a delay, he said, he and his
colleagues ``have a good ending of the first act if I'm not
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Princely Passions
</P>
<P>
   From Renaissance royalty to the Spice Girls. That is the range
of the exhibition opening on Saturday at the National Museum and
Gallery in Cardiff, Wales, representing 500 years of art collecting
by the Princes of Wales. Among the works on display for the first
time is John Ward's portrait of Diana, Princess of Wales, in her
wedding gown, commissioned by the Prince of Wales. The show, which
runs through Nov. 8, includes sculpture, silver, arms, armor and
drawings.

N.Y. STATE ARTS GROUPS HOPEFUL ON GRANTS DESPITE NEA CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite changes in financing guidelines at the
National Endowment for the Arts that were driven in part by
anti-New York sentiment in Congress, arts leaders around the state
said Wednesday that they were hopeful that local groups would not
suffer dramatic cutbacks in grants like those they have sustained
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives voted decisively Tuesday to approve
funds for the endowment at its current $98 million a year level,
leaving in place changes in the agency rules designed to disperse
money more evenly around the country.
</P>
<P>
   New York state, which was the clear target of a ceiling passed
last year on how much organizations from a single state can
receive, garners a far greater proportion of the funds than any
other state.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the complicated way in which each state's
financing is tabulated, state arts groups are not likely to suffer
any immediate impact from the ceiling and they remain hopeful that
they will be able to weather this year's changes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even though New York's grants are just over the 15 percent state
ceiling, endowment officials and others said that because of the
way the financing is calculated, the state's level still comes well
under the 15 percent level.
</P>
<P>
   This is because much of the money goes to productions and
artworks that, while originating here, travel to venues outside the
state. Money for such programs is not counted as part of the
state's total.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several local arts leaders gave qualified praise to
the House's passage of the endowment budget while others said they
were concerned about the actions. Republican leaders in the House
have voted to kill the agency in the past, but have never
accomplished their aim because the Senate has supported the agency,
albeit at dramatically reduced levels. These cutbacks have led to
substantial reductions in endowment aid for New York artists and
institutions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earle Mack, chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts,
said, ``I'm delighted that the NEA is still alive.'' He said the
council was getting $691,000 from the endowment this year, up from
$680,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Bourscheidt, president of the Alliance for the Arts, an
advocacy group in New York City, said the action ``signals an era
of calmer discussion of federal arts funding.'' He said, however,
that he remained ``concerned over the lack of support from the New
York congressional delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding last year not to kill the arts agency, despite a
strong push by conservatives, Congress imposed a 15 percent limit
on grant funds to any one state, a provision that NEA spokeswoman
Cherie Simon called clearly aimed at New York. Between grants to
arts groups and to the State Council for the Arts, New York this
year is due to receive $12.5 million, nearly double the $6.7 given
to second-place California.
</P>
<P>
   New York's $12.5 million would represent just over the 15
percent ceiling of the $81 million of the endowment budget devoted
to grants, and so the state could would be close to losing further
grants. But $5.4 million of New York's money is designated for
traveling _ or multistate _ art shows, dance performances and
concerts, and so is not computed to count toward the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Although New York gets about a quarter of the grants for travel,
that is not material to the ceiling limits. Without the multistate
money, Ms. Simon said, New York received $7.1 million, or 12
percent of the total grant budget.
</P>
<P>
   Yet concern abounds among many arts groups dependent on public
support. Mark Rossier, marketing director of the Alliance of
Resident Theaters/New York, representing a core group of 146
theaters, said endowment financing for its members dropped 43
percent, or $1.1 million, between 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Larger institutions are better able to withstand cuts but also
dependent on federal grants. ``They have told us we can submit only
one application a year _ we used to submit 10,'' said William
Luers, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which received
$200,000 toward its $120 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   But he said: ``We're the place people enter the country. New
York is a gateway. There's no question that we feed the arts in
every state. They undervalue that.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Gould, director of Artists Space, said the studio art
group had received $20,000 this year but nothing last year. `We
don't count on government money,'' she said. ``It's no longer part
of our framework.''
</P>
<P>
   Dance companies have been particularly dependent on public
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a big cut last year, from $100,000 to $45,000,'' said
Kathy Edwards, managing director of Dance Theater Workshop in
Chelsea, one of the city's four major downtown dance theaters. ``So
it's terrible even if the money is staying the same. I certainly
applaud money going across the country, but New York City is the
dance capital of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Joyce Theater, another major dance venue in Chelsea,
federal support dropped from $200,000 _ 6 percent of its $3.8
million budget _ last fiscal year to $90,000 for the 1998-1999
fiscal year, and administrators wonder whether the 15 percent cap
is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Bernhardt, executive director of the Kitchen, another
Chelsea dance theater, said she had not applied for endowment funds
in several years, although she is applying for a $25,000 archival
preservation grant for the 1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put an unbelievable amount of work into this,''
Ms. Bernhardt said. ``And now it seems as if there will be less
money.''And, she added, ``it's the places that are the laboratories
that will get hit the hardest.''

   ``On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon''
</P>
<P>
   By Kaye Gibbons
</P>
<P>
   Putnam, 273 pages, $22.95
</P>
<P>
   THE HYPE: Oprah Winfrey added two of the author's earlier novels
to her ballyhooed book club list in December. The timing pressured
Gibbons to finish ``Occasion,'' which had been three years in the
making. She threw out 900 pages and started rewriting.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLOT: Steel magnolia Emma Garnet tells her life story,
beginning on the Virginia plantation of her tyrant father, tromping
through the Civil War with her Yankee husband, Dr. Quincy Lowell,
and ending on her final day.
</P>
<P>
   THE REALITY: Although some chapters read like ``Ladies Home
Journal,'' Gibbons' storytelling surfaces in others. The story
takes off midway through the book and, from there, charges to a
satisfying end.
</P>
<P>
   APPROXIMATE READING TIME: What should take a weekend takes
longer. The 19th-century voice makes comprehension difficult in
parts for a 20th-century reader.

BRISBY LOOKING AT THE COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ After their frustrating 7-6 loss to the
Pittsburgh Steelers Jan. 3 in the AFC playoff semifinals, emotions
were running high in the Patriots' locker room. Fingers were
pointing all over the place. Players were saying things they would
later regret. It seemed like a house divided.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration didn't end there for Vincent Brisby and Troy
Brown, two backup receivers.
</P>
<P>
   After missing 13 games in 1996 with a hamstring pull, Brisby had
returned with a strong camp in '97. But that hadn't meant much.
Shawn Jefferson, who had been acquired in '96, started opposite
Terry Glenn, and Brisby, who had caught 66 passes for 914 yards in
'95, again found himself on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, meanwhile, had his best year as a pro. Often thrust into
the frequently injured Glenn's slot, Brown caught 41 passes for 607
yards, made some big catches, and finally felt as if he were more
than a third-down receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the season ended, however, both felt they didn't
belong. The Patriots acquired Brian Stablein, which Brown thought
would severely cut into his playing time, and Brisby felt there
were too many bodies around.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby demanded a trade. Brown was also wondering if he should
explore other options.
</P>
<P>
   Well, training camp 1998 is here, and so are Brisby and Brown,
hoping to make the best of situations they still feel are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I feel like I'm going to get more of an opportuity to
display my abilities,'' said Brisby. ``I want to try to help this
team win games. The big thing was I felt I wasn't being treated
fairly because I got injured. I thought I clearly outplayed Shawn
in camp and didn't win the job. I even had a conversation with
Shawn, and even he thought I outplayed him. If I'm going against
someome on the field, I can beat them out, but if it's something
else, I can't do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing was, if it was going to be that way, why not let me
go someplace else and play for somebody else?''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tried to move Brisby but demanded a second-round
draft pick. They tried desperately to deal him during the draft,
but all that was offered was a sixth-round pick, and the team felt
Brisby was worth far more than that. And when they hired Ernie
Zampese as offensive coordinator, it seemed to signal the possible
rebirth of Brisby. Zampese's timing passing game works best with
big receivers who also can block to help the running game. The more
the Patriots looked for a big receiver _ at one point considering
Sean Dawkins _ the more they realized they might already have their
man: Brisby, who is 6 feet 2 inches and can catch the ball over the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll talked to Brisby and assured him he would get
a chance to compete again for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guy (agent Mike George) called Pete,'' said Brisby. ``He
said I'd get the opportunity to win a starting job. It made me want
to attend the offseason workouts and be a part of this team. And
just in case it didn't work out and they found someone to take me,
I was gonna be in shape and ready to go somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   This was major progress.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lasting images of Brisby from the 1997 season
occurred when Drew Bledsoe got in his face on the sidelines for
failing to get open when the quarterback was running for his life
at Jacksonville in Week 15. After the play, Bledsoe ran after
Brisby on the sidelines and lambasted him for not breaking off his
route to help the QB. Brisby stepped it up after that incident and
played well the rest of the game, catching four passes for 58 yards
in a 26-20 win.
</P>
<P>
   But that game didn't do much for Brisby's playing time or his
confidence. He caught only two passes the next two games and got
shut out in the playoff opener against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, he told the coaching staff that if he wasn't
going to be more involved, he didn't want to be brought to
Pittsburgh for the next game. This probably didn't go over well
with the staff, but out of necessity, Brisby played and caught
three passes for 37 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want an opportunity, regardless of how it happens,''
said Brisby. ``I'm glad to be here. I love the players and the
organization. I'm happy in a way that I'm not someplace else and
that I'm right here competing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Brisby fails to play well in camp, he could be
released. He's scheduled to earn $1.25 million this year and is
under contract through 2000. The Patriots could save a bundle by
releasing him. But for now, they are telling him he's competing.
And they hope his presence will motivate Glenn. Brisby says the
Glenn situation may be a reason the coaching staff is putting so
much stock in his rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   But there are 12 receivers in camp, and he knows there won't be
room for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of guys who can play and we only run two- or
three-receiver sets,'' he said. ``If you go out there and blow
teams out and we end up in Miami (for the Super Bowl), everyone
will be OK, but if we struggle and guys aren't playing ...''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is in a better mood because he has been given the starting
punt returner's job. He used to be Dave Meggett's backup, but those
duties were taken from him last year. Now Meggett is gone, and
Brown is No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good feeling to be the guy for now,'' said Brown. ``It
may take a while to get the rhythm of it back, but we'll see how
the first preseason game goes. It's my job to lose right now. But
we have Brian Stablein and Tony Gaiter and Chris Canty, all of whom
are trying to take the job.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his receiver situation, Brown knows nothing has changed
despite his 1997 contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that I have to fight for a spot every year,'' he
said. ``I just have to worry about myself and do whatever it takes
to make sure I keep what I have. I just have to do my job. I know
I'm giving it my best. They have to make a decision to keep whoever
they want.''

MAKING BOOKS: VIRTUAL HISTORY AS SHORTCUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A not too burdensome way to fill gaps in your knowledge of
history is books that could be called virtual novels. At least many
people are turning to them in the belief that they are getting
history that excites. Are they kidding themselves? Does it matter?
Like virtual reality, these books are attempts to approximate real
life, although on the written page, not on computers.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual literature is an old genre that book publishing
periodically rediscovers and reinvents. It started, its defenders
like to say, at least as early as Homer, and it was a stock in
trade for Shakespeare. Mostly the virtual novel is seen in
fictional biography, of which there have been a number of examples
recently.
</P>
<P>
   These include novels about John Brown, John Wilkes Booth, Thomas
Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and even Henry Rathbone and Clara Harris,
who were with the Lincolns in Ford's Theater on the evening of Good
Friday, 1865.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual novel of a different sort, ``The Last Full Measure''
(Ballantine) by Jeff Shaara, the final novel of a Civil War trilogy
begun by his father, Michael, is a current best seller, the big
summer read of this fact-fiction school. In it, U.S. Grant, Robert
E. Lee and Joshua Chamberlain are among the military virtuosos
cavorting about its pages in great detail.
</P>
<P>
   E.L. Doctorow in ``Ragtime'' (Random House) in 1975 may have
reinvented this way of giving readers the atmosphere of a period
without too many of its facts, by putting in cameo appearances by
such people as Henry Ford, J.P. Morgan, Evelyn Nesbit and Harry
Houdini. Don DeLillo expands on it in ``Underworld'' (Scribner).
</P>
<P>
   As a preservative of history, these gambols in the lives of the
great and famous are doubtful. Yet to some they represent, in the
words of one book-publishing executive, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, ``historical truth in an entertaining fashion, but
people are getting history.'' Well, sort of. She used Shakespeare
as an example. A more recent one is Robert Graves' ``I, Claudius,''
a classic of virtual literature.
</P>
<P>
   But one writer and critic, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said: ``Shakespeare's plays presented higher truths. The
current novels, however well done, don't. The viewers of
Shakespeare's plays knew he was making it all up.'' He added that
``it's harder to tell that today'' and that the historical
characters in current fictional biography ``are closer in time and
more important to us than Henry V.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the danger is that these species of novels can
become defining. The life of Vincent van Gogh was stolen by Irving
Stone, and the painter will forever be remembered as the crazed
genius of ``Lust for Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Is true history so dully written that there is a need for such
fictional nonfiction? Sometimes yes, but often not. Few novelists,
for instance, write with the verve and page-turning excitement of
Stephen E. Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   The writing of virtual novels is not actually intended to be
mythomaniacal. A great deal of historical research goes into them.
Russell Banks, the author of ``Cloudsplitter'' (HarperCollins),
lives near the grave of the abolitionist John Brown, who was ``a
sort of ghostly presence'' to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned what I could about the people near him,'' he said,
``about his daily life, what he ate for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   But here is a novelist speaking, not a historian: ``He became
for me as real as a fictional character. This is much more real for
a writer than the historical Brown. Which leads you to having him
do things he didn't do, like meeting Ralph Waldo Emerson.''
</P>
<P>
   His novel is different from, say, an Oliver Stone movie,
``JFK,'' for instance. Stone claims to show you the real truth. ``I
say, don't read this as history,'' Banks said. ``I'm very explicit
that I'm trying to engage the reader in a novel using historical
fact and fiction, and I feel the same freedom to use historical
information as I do to use biographical material from my own
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Byrd, the author of ``Jefferson'' and ``Jackson'' (Bantam
Books), read the diaries and read all the histories and then, he
said, ``I gave myself free rein, created fictitious characters, but
with the real characters kept close to what is known about them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``James Hemings (Sally Hemings' brother) was in France with
Jefferson, to learn French cooking for Jefferson. I invented a
little bit about him exploring the possibilities of breaking loose
from his slavery. There was lots of talk of revolution in France
then, and I had James mix with the revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that there is ``a dryness to most present academic
history, and people want to see some sense of flesh and blood and
vividness in these great figures moving across the stage.'' That's
what he tries to provide.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and Byrd write their virtual novels without an agenda
other than telling a good yarn. Gore Vidal, more than a decade
earlier, in his Random House novels ``Lincoln'' and ``Burr,''
wanted to de-deify Lincoln and rehabilitate Burr.
</P>
<P>
   Shaara speaks the lingo of virtual novels, saying that he is
actually trying ``to put a three-dimensional face on history.''
Which is what virtual reality is about, three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``I stay away from modern biographies and modern
history books and instead use the diaries and memoirs of the
historical characters and their wives and staff officers _ those
who were there and heard the words.'' At certain times in the
trilogy ``there are word-for-word quotes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters' thoughts and dialogue make these into
novels,'' he said. We don't know what Grant or Lee was thinking,
but what's in the novels is entirely what they could have been
thinking. I don't try to create controversy or manufacture or
embellish history. The events are the way they happened. What I've
added is that you see the events through the characters themselves,
and that's by definition a novel.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Literary novelists have more subtle ways of using real people.
As will be explained in this Sunday's ``Bookend'' page in The New
York Times Book Review, they give the factual person a fictional
name and then slaughter the character intellectually, often
settling an old score. Of course, everyone in the know is aware who
they are writing about.
</P>
<P>
   Like every classification of books, the virtual novel has its
highs and lows and middles. Bantam has published three mysteries
under the name Stephanie Barron in which the 19th-century English
novelist Jane Austen takes time out from her writing to solve
murders. These are supposed to be fun, one supposes. In the middle.
</P>
<P>
   As for low, no one has yet approached the standard for the
bottom reached in 1988 by Alfred A. Knopf, arguably the most
literary publishing house of all, which published ``Traveller,'' by
Richard Adams. Traveller was Robert E. Lee's horse. The novel
depicted the Civil War through Traveller's eyes. The horse, as
narrator, even spoke in what was called a Virginian idiom.

LONG-DELAYED LESSONS ABOUT FATHERS AND A WAR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 William McDonald is deputy editor of Arts and Leisure  
 By WILLIAM MCDONALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the late afternoon of an autumn day in 1962, a comrade in
arms and I were flat on our bellies in a foxhole, peering out from
under olive-drab infantry helmets across a field of tall grass
turned brown and brittle with the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rifles at the ready, we were watching for German troop movements
in a stand of maples and oaks some 50 yards off, ignoring as best
we could the headlight beams blasting through the naked trees from
the Chevy Bel Airs and Ford Fairlanes and Rambler Americans passing
by.
</P>
<P>
   These two-tone sedans and boxy station wagons were carrying
middle-aged men home through the 5 o'clock shadows after a long day
at the office, at the factory, at the shop, men who might once have
shouldered real rifles and worn real helmets and faced real Germans
and Japanese in the woods of Bastogne or in the jungle of
Corregidor, men whom my friend and I were pretending to be in what
really wasn't a foxhole but a natural hollow in that ragged little
meadow that the bulldozers then overrunning the landscape like so
many Panzer divisions had yet to rip up and reshape in the name of
postwar suburban conquest.
</P>
<P>
   Men like our fathers and uncles and the neighbor with one arm,
his other having been given up for his country.
</P>
<P>
   We were small boys, of course, and the war we were fighting was
in our heads. We were good boys, too, if not good soldiers: with
night looming and our suppers waiting, we knew when it was time to
retire from the field and troop home, secure in the faith that we'd
live to fight another day. Soon we unsnapped the leather chin
straps and tossed our helmets into a toy box, stood our air rifles
in a corner and slapped the dirt off our dungarees.
</P>
<P>
   As for the war that had so filled our imaginations, we probably
thought we were putting it aside too on that fall evening, just as
years later, when the cold fact of growing up had forced us from
our worlds of make-believe, we thought we'd put it away for good.
</P>
<P>
   But now I think that was never true. Seeing ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg's homage to the Americans who fought in
Normandy, has led me to realize that the war we boys were
re-enacting 36 years ago, the war of our fathers, stayed with us
then and has stayed with us since.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons may be as simple _ or as complicated _ as the blood
tie between fathers and sons. And they may be as large and
inescapable as a wide screen in a movie house. Certainly one can
start looking there. In the year that my friend and I were beating
back Hitler with toy rifles, ``The Longest Day,'' Darryl F.
Zanuck's epic retelling of D-Day and decidedly the father of
Spielberg's, was showing at a theater across town.
</P>
<P>
   This was the definitive World War II movie. Sprawling from the
south of England into northern France, it chronicled Operation
Overlord hour by hour, lending some humanity to the German high
command (with subtitles) but most of all glorifying the Allies
(with a glamorous cast, from John Wayne to Richard Burton).
</P>
<P>
   For young patriots playing at soldiering in a time of Cold War
and classroom duck-and-cover drills, there was probably no World
War II movie more stirring; doubtless it inspired a hundred
thousand engagements with the enemy in backyards and on street
corners across the land.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's impact had a lot to do with its timing. With a
former PT boat commander installed in the White House and the
former Supreme Allied Commander retired of late to his Gettysburg
home, ``The Longest Day'' came along as the torch was being passed
from the wise old men who had prosecuted the war to the young men
who had fought it, a group arriving at middle age in 1962 and
preparing, as John F. Kennedy put it, for ``a long twilight
struggle'' with the Red menace.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was thus as much a celebration of the generation
coming into its own as it was a tribute to the one folding its
tents. And looking on were the impressionable boys with popguns in
their hands (and girls with a less militaristic kind of wonder) _
children born well after Berlin had fallen, well after Hiroshima,
even after Korea. With no memories of war, we were young enough to
believe in its romance and myths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Longest Day'' was a kind of capstone to more than a decade
of war movies that we boys had spent many a rainy Sunday afternoon
watching raptly on television. And it hammered home, perhaps for
one last time before the world moved on, the message that Hollywood
war movies had long been delivering: that our troops were superior
and heroic, that our generals were shrewd and bold, and that our
cause was monumental and just.
</P>
<P>
   To the children watching it, a wartime propaganda movie like
``Guadalcanal Diary'' or a postwar paean like ``The Sands of Iwo
Jima'' was not just an entertainment but also a blood-lifting
pageant honoring the men all around us who had saved the world.
</P>
<P>
   And as the movies pictured them, these men were swell: tough,
brave, sometimes cocky in the face of death, smoking Luckies and
given to hard-boiled wisecracks or cornball speeches about home,
country and the girls they'd left behind. Almost invariably they
were an ethnic and social cross-section of white America, advancing
on the enemy as one, spurred on by the swelling strains of a
martial theme song or a whistled tune of glory. If any fell, they
were gallant enough not to bleed too much.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the John Waynes and Robert Mitchums did more to
shape our image of World War II than the real men who came out of
it, the men who wound up driving the Ramblers and Bel Airs.
</P>
<P>
   They, or at least the ones I knew, barely said a word about the
war. Some had brought home souvenirs _ a helmet, a holster, a set
of dog tags _ and maybe these keepsakes had precipitated a
dinner-table story or two in the distant late '40s, when memories
of service, and the scars, were still fresh. But by the early '60s
the war tales had stopped and the mementos had been consigned to
attics, where instead of acquiring luster they gathered dust.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And yet a war story or two did manage to filter down, enough to
grab hold of a young imagination. There was a friend of my father's
whose story came to us second-hand, never through him: how he had
suffered a bayonet wound to the throat, then survived the Bataan
Death March and a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp; how he had endured
an unspeakable torture involving a rat in a tin can and had been
forced to eat grasshoppers for nourishment. He lived into his 80s
with a permanent click in his throat where the bayonet had gone in.
</P>
<P>
   But war stories, for the most part, went untold, even though the
men of my family must have had some to tell. One, who had been
mistakenly drafted into the Army at the age of 38, fought in the
Battle of the Bulge. One was hastily commissioned a lieutenant in
the thick of battle in Europe when his company leader was killed.
Two served in the Navy in the South Pacific. Another wore
corporal's stripes at a home-front base.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that I can't say much more; details were hard to come by.
Indeed, only in the last few weeks have I learned that an uncle,
himself a veteran of the India theater, lost his youngest brother
in the war when the boy's ship went down.
</P>
<P>
   I don't presume to understand these men's silence. The thought
occurs that maybe they recognized all the hokum in the war movies
coming out of Hollywood but didn't want to shatter anybody's
romantic illusions about it and so just kept mum about the truth.
On second thought, though, that wouldn't have been their style. So
I prefer to leave it as something of a mystery, as something buried
in their generational makeup that inclined them not to look back.
</P>
<P>
   But had we been clear-eyed, we postwar children would have
noticed that the close-lipped veterans who oversaw our lives really
didn't resemble those full-of-moxie, hell-for-leather fighting Joes
on the screen. The men we knew, the ones working 9 to 5, mowing
lawns and coaching Little League, had little of Wayne's swagger.
They were just regular guys.
</P>
<P>
   But small boys aren't built to notice such discrepancies, let
alone reconcile them. Small boys, as a rule, aren't realists. We
preferred to see Hollywood's irrepressible GIs as faithful
renditions of the actual men who had fought the war. To us the
actors were stand-ins for the young men our fathers had been, for
the men we were born too late to know _ perhaps even for the men we
still did not know. And if they were portrayed as heroes, all the
better: what young son wouldn't want to think of his father that
way?
</P>
<P>
   Distinguishing reality from fantasy is a grown-up's task, and
Spielberg, another son of the World War II generation, has fairly
risen to it. There is, of course, some irony in saying this of a
filmmaker who has imagined 20th-century dinosaurs and a lovable
extraterrestrial. But in ``Saving Private Ryan'' he is, as he was
in ``Schindler's List,'' a realist.
</P>
<P>
   His opening sequence _ an almost documentarylike half-hour of
unrelieved carnage on Omaha Beach _ is as brutal and as damning a
depiction of warfare as one is likely to see. A filmmaker couldn't
do otherwise now, not after the bitter and disillusioning
experience of Vietnam, a war whose own horrors were sent home
nightly for public viewing. Certainly not a filmmaker of the
Vietnam generation, as Spielberg is.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that ``Saving Private Ryan'' is an antiwar
movie by intention. No Hollywood producer would or could spend tens
of millions to question ``the good war.'' Even the darkly comic
madness of ``Catch-22'' did not challenge the rightness of the
Allied cause.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Private Ryan'' were construed as antiwar, that wouldn't
be saying much anyhow. An honest movie about war these days has to
be, at bottom, against it. Rather, ``Private Ryan'' is simply
overdue cinematic recognition that the men who stormed Omaha Beach
_ or any German or Japanese redoubt for that matter _ weren't icons
or symbols or archetypes; that they weren't Hollywood's gung-ho
fakes.
</P>
<P>
   With horrific images of disembodied limbs and quivering
intestines, Spielberg reminds us of the flesh and blood that
soldiers are made of. He shows them retching onto their boots and
crying for their mothers and desperate to survive in a chaos of
flying lead. And he shows them ultimately possessing the stomach to
see a vital but nasty job through even at the cost of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges are basic, maybe obvious, lessons that may not have
sunk in with the children watching Hollywood's postwar visions of
patriotism: that the men who fought found more ugliness in war than
glory, that if they were courageous they were also scared, and that
none had to be larger than life to deserve our salute.

DRIVERS BEWARE: BUMPS AHEAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Mich.)  (af) 
 Seth Gussow, who designs electrical systems for General Motors,
writes for automobile magazines  
 By SETH GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a teen-ager growing up near San Francisco in the 1960s, Peter
Foster would occasionally steal his parents' car in the middle of
the night and drive down to Playland at the Beach in search of an
after-hours bumper-car fix.
</P>
<P>
   These days, to satisfy that urge, Foster, 43, doesn't have to go
any farther than the Exxon station he owns in Petaluma, Calif. He
keeps some of the three dozen bumper cars he owns at the station so
that he, his employees and his customers, who come from as far as
300 miles away, can whizz around an impromptu track set up on the
station grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bumper cars were designed to operate using electric power
supplied from a metal-mesh ceiling, but Foster's cars have been
converted to 12-volt battery power, which enables them to run on
any hard, flat surface. It also boosts their speed so much that
Foster has had to lay down some ground rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make drivers promise not to do any head-ons,'' he said. ``A
20-miles-an-hour head-on would not be safe. Somebody would
definitely get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster is one of a small number of enthusiasts, mostly male, who
collect bumper cars. They find cars by scanning ads in publications
like Hemmings Motor News and Amusement Business and haggling with
arcade owners who are short of cash during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   A heavily used car can cost as little as $100, while a carefully
restored one from the '50s or '60s can go for $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Some collectors remove the motor and gearbox entirely and use
the body shell to decorate a living room or den. Others, like
Foster, enjoy tinkering with the mechanical innards to return the
cars to something like their original purpose.
</P>
<P>
   What many collectors share are childhood memories of bumper cars
similar to Foster's. Beyond offering a thrill ride, Foster says,
bumper cars were also an outlet for youthful aggression. If you
were struck by a boyhood rival on the street, ``most of the time he
could get back at him pretty good,'' Foster explained, ``whereas in
a bumper car you could get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster favors cars made by Lusse, which along with Dodgem
produced most of the bumpers cars that for 40 years were a staple
at amusement parks across the country. After the 1950s, the market
for bumper cars declined, and both companies began to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgem ceased production in 1980, while Lusse remained in
business until the death of its founder, Ray Lusse Jr., in 1994.
For years, Lusse's most popular model, the Auto Skooter, featured a
metal body, while the bullet-shaped Dodgem was made of fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   Another collector, Gary Dickinson, former president and chief
executive officer of Delco Electronics Corp. in Kokomo, Ind., owns
a pair of restored 1954 Lusses. He fondly recalls summers spent in
upstate New York riding the Dodgems at Roseland Park amusement
park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he and his wife, Libby, were in the market to buy
bumper cars when they found two for sale at Knoebel's Grove
Amusement Park in Elysburg, Pa. The cars, which were subsequently
restored by Lusse, resemble 1953 Chevrolet DeLuxes, right down to
the hood ornaments, which Dickinson says Lusse bought directly from
General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the Dickinsons had planned to convert a little-used
tennis court in back of their house in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., to
a bumper-car track, but zoning ordinances prevented them from doing
so. Eventually the couple settled for a space in their basement,
where guests can drive the cars.
</P>
<P>
   The cars retain their original 110-volt AC motors, but the power
no longer comes through an overhead pole. Instead, the cars get
power through extension cords.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with extension cords, explained Mrs. Dickinson, is
that anything more than a polite tapping of the cars may tangle the
cord, or worse, disconnect the power.

TREASURIES SLIGHTLY LOWER IN PROFIT-TAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities retreated slightly
Wednesday in what dealers characterized as profit-taking on a
run-up in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar's rebound against the yen in foreign-exchange trading
helped to underpin the bond market, dealers said, and the second
and final day of testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
Board chairman, before Congress had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 10/32, to 106
10/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, rose to 5.68 percent from 5.66 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's remarks to the House Banking Committee, part of his
semiannual report to Congress, went as expected and did not give
market participants any clear signals on the course of short-term
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices moved off their lows when Greenspan said history
suggested a significant stock-market correction was likely. His
other remarks were viewed as reassuring repetitions of his
testimony on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, when he
suggested that interest rates would most likely remain stable.
</P>
<P>
   An absence of economic data, combined with slow summer trading
and anticipation of elections on Thursday for leadership of Japan's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, kept many investors from
participating in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury plans to auction $15 billion of two-year notes on
Wednesday. In when-issued trading ahead of the auction, the
two-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, Canadian Pacific Railway
is trying to persuade holders of 1,000-year bonds issued by the
defunct Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway in 1883 to exchange them
for Canadian Pacific stock or the security's face value of 100
pounds, worth $164 (U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Pacific now runs the old railroad and would like to
call these bonds 885 years early, eliminating the administrative
headache of keeping track of $1.18 million worth of the 4 percent
bonds.

PRESIDENT ASKS SMITH TO STAY IN IRELAND THROUGH TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has asked Jean Kennedy Smith, the
US ambassador to Ireland, to extend her stay through his September
trip to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Smith's younger brother, said the
president asked Smith to delay her departure from Phoenix Park for
another three months, through the end of September. Smith has
agreed to postpone her return and will stay in the job she has held
since the spring of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Smith had packed her bags and was planning to fly
back to her New York home next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reportedly wants to keep Smith in place because of the
delicate status of the Northern Ireland peace process and the
difficulty of naming her successor.
</P>
<P>
   Although a clear majority of citizens in both the Republic of
Ireland and Northern Ireland approved the peace accord reached on
Good Friday, splinter groups continue a campaign of sabotage
through terrorism. Three young boys recently burned to death when
their house was firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Mowlam, the British secretary for Northern Ireland, met
briefly with Kennedy Wednesday after a longer meeting with
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam said that progress was being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank the Senate, Congress, and the White House for not
being fair-weather friends,'' she said while posing for a
photograph with Kennedy and Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut
Democrat. ``It has been tough, and it will continue to be tough.
We've made a lot of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy praised Mowlam and British Prime Minister Tony Blair for
the roles they played in negotiating the peace accord.

IN POP MUSIC, FAILURE'S HARD BUT SUCCESS CAN BE WORSE  
 MORE FROM TUPAC SHAKUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making music after recovering from a failure or scandal can be
very difficult, but it's even harder to make a record after
recovering from a great success. For some musicians, it can be hard
to write songs knowing that every word and every note will be
scrutinized and held up for comparison against their previous work.
</P>
<P>
   Living with fame may be tough, but living up to high
expectations is one of an artist's greatest challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I write something, I think, `Do I want people to know
this?''' Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails said in an interview last
year while working on his next record, which still hasn't been
released. `` `Do I want to give up that element of my life and my
personality to be criticized?'''
</P>
<P>
   For four years, pop fans have been waiting for a new album from
Reznor, one of the biggest rock musicians of the '90s. It has been
six years since fans have heard a new album from Dr. Dre, the
innovative rapper and producer who helped invent the West Coast
gangsta sound. And it has been seven years since fans have heard a
record of original material from Axl Rose, whose band, Guns 'n'
Roses, was the biggest heavy metal act of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   What ties these three musicians together is that they have all
been struggling with new material for years, confronting their own
perfectionism, procrastination, writer's block and ambition. If
they're not geniuses, they're at least talented musicians burdened
by the notion of their own genius.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other successful pop stars in hibernation, these
musicians are not has-beens, yet. They still have hundreds of
thousands of dedicated fans who have been waiting eagerly for new
music, holding fast to rumors of album release dates that keep
getting pushed back farther and farther.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most unlikely of these acts, Guns 'n' Roses, is
suddenly selling over 10,000 copies a week of its ``Appetite for
Destruction'' album, which was released in 1987. But every year
these acts don't make new music, their audiences shrink as the
teen-age angst of some fans (a commodity all three trade in) gives
way to the responsibilities of adult life.
</P>
<P>
   Though these musicians are emblematic of three very different
genres _ heavy metal, industrial-rock and gangsta rap _ their
careers have also intersected. Rose has been working with several
former members of Nine Inch Nails and has tried to tour and
collaborate with Dr. Dre's former band, N.W.A, while Reznor and Dr.
Dre have also been talking about collaborating.
</P>
<P>
   Though the wait for new music from these acts probably won't end
this year, here's what friends, collaborators and publicity agents
had to say about their progress.
</P>
<P>
   AXL ROSE: With the exception of the keyboardist Dizzy Reed,
every past member of Guns 'n' Roses has left or been dismissed by
Rose. In their place, he has been working with musicians known for
their electronic-instrument savvy, from Moby to Chris Vrenna,
formerly of Nine Inch Nails, both of whom have since left the
project. The current band lineup is said to include guitarist Robin
Finck (formerly of Nine Inch Nails), drummer Josh Freese (the
Vandals), bassist Tommy Stinson (the Replacements) and the producer
Youth (Killing Joke and the Orb).
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Rose refused to confirm the current Guns 'n'
Roses lineup, but she did say that after resolving personal issues
and lawsuits a few years ago, Rose set about recording an
electronica-influenced album. Instead of depending on the work of
others, however, he has been teaching himself how to program
electronic instruments, make drum loops and play guitar, she said,
which is one reason the process has taken so long.
</P>
<P>
   Rose has recorded a number of demo recordings _ over 300 tapes
of music, sounds and ideas _ and is expected to enter the studio in
the fall to begin recording the new album, which is supposedly due
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   DR. DRE: After releasing ``The Chronic'' in 1993, one of the
most important rap albums of the decade, Dr. Dre left Death Row
records, renounced gangsta rap and started his own label,
Aftermath. Between working on new material for L.L. Cool J, Mack
10, and King Tee, Dr. Dre has been laboring over his next record.
The reason it's been taking so long, those who know Dr. Dre say, is
because he's a perfectionist. For his new album, he reunited with
Snoop Doggy Dogg, the popular gangsta rapper that Dr. Dre put on
the map, for two songs and has been working with a newer rapper,
Hitman.
</P>
<P>
   An Interscope spokeswoman said that Dr. Dre was midway through
the recording process and that she expected a 1999 release. Asked
for more information, she replied, ``Only God and Dre know what's
going to be on this album.''
</P>
<P>
   NINE INCH NAILS: Although Reznor hasn't released a record of new
material since 1994, his star doesn't seem to have dimmed. He
shares a perfectionist tendency with Dr. Dre, but he is also
plagued by insecurity, especially when it comes to writing lyrics,
which he is working on now.
</P>
<P>
   According to his spokeswoman, Reznor has recorded some 45 songs
for a new album, tentatively titled ``The Fragile,'' that would be
less aggressive, more musically and rhythmically sophisticated than
his past works. Reznor is considering packaging it as two
conceptually different CDs sold in one package.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rose, Reznor is no longer working with most of the
musicians who appeared on his last album. Instead, he has been
recording with guitarist Adrian Belew (of King Crimson),
keyboardist Mike Garson (of David Bowie's band), producer Steve
Albini (Big Black) and two different percussionists, Bill Rieflin
(Ministry) and Tony Thompson (Chic and Power Station ).
</P>
<P>
   Though Reznor has said he hoped to have the album out in
November, it doesn't seem likely to come out until next year. &QL;

   Shakur, Prolific
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, with no fanfare or prior announcement, Mecca Records
will be slipping Tupac Shakur's third posthumous album of new
material into stores.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``In His Own Words,'' the record mixes one of Tupac's
last interviews with unreleased songs, including two recorded with
the Notorious B.I.G., a former friend who Shakur later accused of
being involved in his shooting in 1994. The Notorious B.I.G., who
said he had nothing to do with the incident, was shot to death six
months after Shakur's death in September 1996. Both drive-by
shootings remain unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the album was not released on any label Tupac has
recorded for. It was released by Mecca, run by Joe Isgro, a 25-year
veteran of the music business who signed James Brown and Rick James
to record deals this year. And the only connection Shakur and Isgro
have is that a lawyer who helped clear Isgro of racketeering and
payola charges stemming from a 1989 indictment also represented
Suge Knight, the imprisoned head of Death Row, the label Shakur
recorded for.
</P>
<P>
   Isgro acquired the interview from Sway and King Tech, two
hip-hop musicians who interviewed Shakur for KMEL-FM, a San
Francisco radio station. He would not reveal the sources he
received the songs from, except to say that he licensed the music
for distribution through the proper channels.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Powell, a lawyer for the Shakur estate, said she was
unaware of the record and would be surprised if the tracks had been
properly licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Isgro, however, says he doesn't feel that he's exploiting the
rapper. ``There's a specific part of the interview where he says,
`Here it is, take it, get the word out,''' Isgro said. ``So I don't
look at it like we're exploiting him at all. We'll make money from
it hopefully, but that's what every record label wants to do when
they release an album.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Shakur rails against the Notorious B.I.G.,
comparing him to Hitler, and criticizes Dr. Dre. He also discusses
his 1994 shooting, his sexual assault conviction, his paranoia and
his future. In 5 to 10 years, he said, he saw himself ``having a
job at Death Row, holding stock at Death Row, having an A-and-R
job'' and releasing albums at his leisure.

   PARIS _ Manuel Poirier's movie career got off to a slow start.
He was 40 by the time his first film was released, and even then,
forced to act as his own producer, he could afford only one print.
Yet, somehow, the right people saw it and liked it and the doors
that Poirier had been knocking on for years suddenly opened. Within
two years he had made three more movies, and the last of these,
``Western,'' won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1997 Cannes
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   No small wonder that this stocky, balding Frenchman describes
himself as a realistic utopian. His original utopia was to make
films, and while he had neither the background nor the contacts to
do so, he never doubted that he would succeed. Now he is applying
his optimism to France's complex social situation.
</P>
<P>
   While he worries that French anxiety about immigration is
feeding support for the extreme rightist National Front, he
believes that different nationalities and races can, and do,
coexist happily in France. In ``Western,'' which opens in New York
on Friday, he set out to demonstrate this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to believe in utopia and a social utopia,'' he said the
other day in an interview in a small hotel in Montmartre. ``A few
years ago, when I threw out my ideas, people would say, `That's
utopian,' and the discussion would end. Now if they say that, I
keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   So, into ``Western,'' a French version of the classic road
movie, he has inserted themes of friendship, love and identity as
seen through the eyes of a Spaniard, a Russian, an African and a
good number of natives of Brittany, where the film is set. The
choice of Brittany is not accidental. Since the time of Napoleon,
this westernmost corner of France has struggled to preserve its own
culture, language and identity despite pressure for national
uniformity emanating from Paris. Brittany knows only too well what
it is like to be different and not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the seriousness of Poirier's message in
``Western,'' it is presented with humor and poignancy. Paco, a
burly Spaniard played by Sergi Lopez, is a traveling shoe salesman
who gives a ride to a hitchhiker, a slightly built Russian
immigrant called Nino (Sacha Bourdo). When Paco stops to
investigate a noise, Nino drives off in the car, which is full of
expensive shoes. Forlorn at the certainty of losing his job, Paco
is given a lift to the nearest police station by Marinette
(Elisabeth Vitali), who in turn feels sorry for him and offers him
a couch for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, sipping a coffee morosely in a local
bar-tabac, Paco spots Nino walking toward him. He chases him and
beats him up sufficiently for Nino to end up in a hospital. But
Paco soon feels guilty, and when he visits the injured Russian, he
is touched by Nino's explanation that the stolen car represented
his only hope of ever picking up a woman. Paco has never had this
problem. Indeed, he is getting along famously with Marinette until
she suggests that they test their new love by separating for three
weeks. By now recovered, Nino is ready to hit the road again. And
Paco, at a loose end until his trial separation from Marinette is
over, reluctantly joins him.
</P>
<P>
   With Nino still looking for love and Paco evicted by love, their
friendship is then forged by a series of adventures and mishaps. On
the way, they meet Baptiste (Basile Siekous), a self-proclaimed
Breton even though he comes from the Ivory Coast, who is ever
cheerful although he gets around only by wheelchair. He shares with
them a game called Bonjour la France, in which they sit in an
outdoor cafe and say good morning to passers-by. Some ignore them;
others offer the expected French response of ``Bonjour, monsieur.''
One man gives the amused Baptiste an equally sincere suggestion:
``Go back to your own country.''
</P>
<P>
   The feel-good mood of the film was evidently a welcome antidote
to the pessimism that had become fashionable here of late (at least
until France won the World Cup soccer championship this month).
</P>
<P>
   And this no doubt helped the movie to earn excellent reviews in
French newspapers. Writing in Le Monde, though, Jacques Mandelbaum
wondered whether the moral of ``this multicultural fable'' was not
a trifle optimistic. ``It stems from the fiction that, no matter
where he is born, no matter where he lives, everyone feels at home
in this world,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Poirier identifies with outsiders because he
was born in Peru of French parents who returned to France to live
in the Paris suburbs when he was 4? Perhaps, he conceded. A more
likely explanation, though, is the road-movie-like life he led
before he finally realized his dream of making films. ``I was
inside society and outside because I was looking for myself,'' he
said softly.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping out of school at 16, he did a series of odd jobs
until he seemed to find a metier as a cabinetmaker. He felt
trapped, though, and soon moved on, at one moment working as a
volunteer at a prison, at another teaching carpentry to
underprivileged children in a community center. But the idea of
movies stayed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a teen-ager, just the fact of seeing a film made me
feel less lonely,'' he said. ``I realized that through a film you
could share an emotion, a sensation, a point of view, a reflection.
And I thought, `Wouldn't it be wonderful to be able to share your
feelings this way?' One day the idea simply became too strong, so I
stopped work and decided to make films.''
</P>
<P>
   He began in the late 1980s with three short films, which were
shown in festivals and on television. But his relative success with
shorts provided no bridge to feature films. He wrote his first
screenplay, ``La Petite Amie d'Antonio,'' or ``Antonio's
Girlfriend,'' about a young woman's love for an immigrant Spanish
construction worker, but he could find no backer.
</P>
<P>
   Depressed by his problems, he left Paris and moved to the tiny
Normandy village of Morsan, 100 miles to the north. And there, one
strange evening, he shook off his blues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to collect milk from the nearby farmer,'' Poirier
recalled. ``He was watching an interview on television with a movie
director who was recounting the success of his latest film. I
remember walking out of the farmhouse and thinking, `What am I
doing in this village when that other director is on television?'
And that somehow gave me a burst of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still unable to raise the money for a full-length film, he
tapped funds available for shorts and made the first 20 minutes of
``La Petite Amie d'Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after showing this appetizer to a French television
company, he was able to acquire the rest of the film's modest
$400,000 budget. The film's good notices led him to the producer
Maurice Bernart, who backed Poirier's second movie, ``... a la
Campagne,'' or ``... to the Countryside,'' a semi-autobiographical
story about a Parisian man who moves to Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Next came ``Marion,'' a somewhat darker film that touches on
class tensions and differences through the story of a wealthy
Parisian couple with a weekend mansion in Normandy who try to adopt
a little girl from a working-class family.
</P>
<P>
   While these two films did modestly well, ``Western'' is clearly
Poirier's breakthrough film in France: it has drawn 1.2 million
viewers. And it is his first film to be released in the United
States. It also reinforces a nascent trend in French movies to turn
away from the concerns of middle-class Parisians to what
non-Parisians like to call ``real people.'' For the director,
though, it simply involved pulling together themes that have long
interested him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to make a road movie, and the savagery and
isolation of Brittany worked well for that,'' he explained,
lighting a cigarette and sipping a beer. ``I had been dealing with
the question of friendship in earlier movies and I wanted to go
further to address the question of identity. I also wanted to make
a film about love. Then suddenly, all these elements came together:
the road, Brittany, two friends, identity, the question of being
different, women, love.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Lopez, 38, as Paco was almost automatic. Lopez's
movie debut was as Antonio in Poirier's first feature film. After
that film was completed, in what the French call a ``coup de
coeur,'' the rookie director said he wanted Lopez to appear in
every film he made, even if only in a walk-on part. For Paco's
partner in ``Western,'' Poirier sought a different image, ``someone
small, with an accent, not too successful with girls, not from the
Mediterranean.'' Bourdo, 36, a theater actor, acrobat and mime who
moved to France from Russia in 1990, proved the perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were making `Western,' we weren't thinking about
Cannes or success or anything,'' Bourdo said in a telephone
interview from Marseilles, where he is working on a new film. ``We
were just living the adventure that Manuel Poirier had put us into.
The film was like a voyage. We made a very good trip with Manuel.
Sergi became my best friend, and Manuel was great. For me, our
society today is not normal, but Manuel is normal. He is fair, so
he's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Poirier decided to shoot ``Western'' chronologically, but he
said that this approach suited a road movie in which the story was
evolving and improvisation was possible, and in which Lopez and
Bourdo could gradually build up their real friendship. In the
process, Poirier was able to find his new utopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Western,' in contrast to the unhealthy atmosphere in much
of France, there is the reality of very different people who can
live together,'' he said. ``They may be a minority, but I know they
exist in France. You have a Spaniard, a Russian, an African,
whites, who can all laugh together. It's not the reality of the
country, but it is a reality. It exists, so it is less utopia. But
perhaps it was utopia that enabled me to make the film.''

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Tom Rothman, president of 20th Century Fox film
production, is a very happy studio executive. ``The boys are
back,'' Rothman said, speaking of the studio's two summer hits,
``Doctor Doolittle'' and ``There's Something About Mary,'' which
owe a hefty share of their box office success to teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, predicted
that the company's doomsday film ``Armageddon,'' which opened
somewhat disappointingly on the Fourth of July weekend, could
emerge with the biggest box office gross of the summer, $185
million to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and ``Zorro'' also playing powerfully
among young men, it's turning into a summer of boy's films that
crossed over into larger audiences of families (``Dr. Doolittle'')
and girls (``Armageddon''). And Robert Simonds, Hollywood's
foremost producer of boy films, couldn't be more delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing right now is a reaffirmation that the teen
male really does represent a tremendous amount of cash at the box
office,'' he said. Males from 12 to 22 remain the single most
reliable segment of the moviegoing public _one third of the
audience _ even though their influence at the box office has dipped
a bit in favor of young girls and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Simonds, whose newest boy film, ``The Waterboy,'' with Adam
Sandler and Kathy Bates, is to be released by Disney in November,
is an improbable movie producer. He majored in philosophy at Yale,
wears a suit and tie to work every day, keeps his hair short and
speaks like a shrewd, cheerful businessman. Which, in some ways, he
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly great at producing, but it's just nobody
else was doing what I do,'' he said. What Simonds has done, in a
curiously unflamboyant way, is carve a niche and dominate the
lucrative market of teen-age boys' films. He admitted this will
probably never earn him an Academy Award or a seat at the table of
top Hollywood producers like Scott Rudin (``The Truman Show,'' ``In
and Out'') or Brian Grazer (``Liar, Liar,'' ``Apollo 13''). But
he's earning piles of money.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with his training as a philosophy major (his thesis was on
the nature of evil) and a shrewd sense of the bottom line, Simonds,
34, has developed and produced a dozen films in the last eight
years, including hits like ``Problem Child,'' ``Happy Gilmore,''
``Billy Madison'' and ``The Wedding Singer.'' Though critics have
hardly raved, the films have struck a chord with (mostly) young
male audiences. Though lately he is extending his reach to older
males, too, Simonds said most of his movies have a target audience
of boys from 12 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of these movies have is a blatant disregard for
authority, because when you're a teen you don't have the
traditional weapons of power or money or social status,'' he said.
``So what you have is shock _ and shock is a really important
weapon for a teen.'' His movies also have the classic ``snob versus
slob, popping pretentious balloons, which teens love.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex is surprisingly muted in his films. ``I don't know how you
make sex funny,'' he said. ``And in a weird way, the girls in these
films are like straight men. They're on pedestals. They're
unattainable.''
</P>
<P>
   In emerging as one of the most successful producers in town, he
turned the system upside down in a simple way: the director,
generally considered the king of the world on a movie set, is a
commoner in Simonds' films, not quite an afterthought but
definitely a hired hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually in the movies you're servicing a director's vision,''
said Simonds at his office at Universal Studios. ``In the TV
business directors are more interchangeable because it's built all
around Seinfeld or Roseanne or Drew Carey. My movies are along
those lines. An Adam Sandler movie is all Adam Sandler. The
sensibility and point of view is consistent and idiosyncratic as
opposed to a Spielberg or Bob Zemeckis movie, where the actors are
interchangeable.''
</P>
<P>
   `I Control the Process'
</P>
<P>
   Simonds centers his movies around a star; he's made five films
with Sandler. The star controls the script. A production designer
is hired by Simonds and the star together with an editor and most
of the cast. Simonds and the studio agree on a release date. Then
Simonds hires a director, usually a young filmmaker from television
or the video world, only a few weeks before the cameras are to
roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I control the money, I control the process,'' Simonds
said. Such a public credo would send most Hollywood directors into
shock, but the philosophy is actually a throwback to the 1930s and
'40s, when moguls like Louis Mayer and Jack Warner often picked
directors under contract to make a film based on who was available
that week. And legendary producers like David Selznick often
controlled directors too.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Simonds unusual is that he's candid about practicing
a kind of producing that has no cachet but has never really gone
out of style in Hollywood. Over the years, top action producers
like Jerry Bruckheimer and Joel Silver have often hired young or
first-time filmmakers, partly to control them as well as the
process. But those two have never quite admitted it.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Silver, chairman of Universal Pictures, where Simonds
makes most of his movies, spoke admiringly of the producer. ``If he
says a movie will cost X, that's what it'll cost. If he tells me
what the movie is going to be like, that's what it's going to be.
In a business of surprises, that's a very good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Simonds grew up in Phoenix, Ariz., where his father, Robert,
sells water to the city and state. Majoring in philosophy
``literally prepared me to do nothing,'' said Simonds, who fell in
love with the movie business as a child on the Universal Studios
tour. The studio's theme park rides are visible outside his window.
He moved to Los Angeles after graduation and worked as an intern at
the MGM studios in 1985. Soon he yearned to be a producer.

 HOLLYWOOD: a producer. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``So I started coming up with ideas and finding writers who were
also starting out, and we tried to set up pitches,'' Simonds
recalled. ``They were designed to be these low-budget comedies that
weren't star-contingent. They were hopefully things that would fly
under the radar so that on my first one or two I wouldn't be
replaced. I felt like one of those mammals in the age of dinosaurs,
scurrying around trying not to be seen.'' Once stars arrive on a
film, they often replace producers with their own associates.
</P>
<P>
   Two young screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski,
who later wrote ``Ed Wood'' and ``The People vs. Larry Flynt,''
sold him on a comic version of ``The Bad Seed,'' about a devilish
child adopted by an unwitting man. John Ritter signed on to play
the father. Universal agreed to back it for less than $10 million.
Simonds found a young director, Dennis Dugan, who later made
``Happy Gilmore.''
</P>
<P>
   A Niche Few Cared About
</P>
<P>
   ```Problem Child' had some really funny moments, but the film
itself didn't really add up,'' Simonds said. ``We all had this
psychotic ambition that made up for whatever flaws the film had.
And it actually made truckloads of money.'' The film grossed $55
million in the United States, $25 million overseas and $20 million
on video.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Problem Child,'' Simonds said he found his calling as a
producer of teen-age boy comedies: ``It was the one area that I
felt I could compete in, a niche that most of the producers here
didn't care about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What was great about something like `Problem Child' was that
the movie was green-lit regardless of the director, regardless of
the star,'' he said. ``So many people around here are in this
limbo, saying, `Oh sure, we'll make this movie if Tom Cruise wants
to do it or Bob Zemeckis wants to direct it.' I don't want to play
that game.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience taught him that producing should be viewed as a
business. ``One-third of the job is getting the package right,
getting the script right; a big third of it is marketing and
another big third is distribution, finding a safe corridor where
the big movies aren't going to stomp you to death, getting the
right weekend to open.'' (Many of Sandler's movies open around the
relatively quiet Presidents' Day weekend).
</P>
<P>
   His background in philosophy also helped, he said. ``Philosophy
teaches hopelessness and hopelessness teaches comedy,'' he said.
``And ultimately all philosophy is, is training in rational
argument. As a producer, that's 90 percent of your job. It's trying
to formulate a cohesive point of view out of chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Simonds has had a flop or two, notably ``Airheads,'' a 1994 Adam
Sandler comedy about three metalheads who take a rock radio station
hostage. ``We got cocky and put it in an unsafe corridor, the
middle of the summer,'' he said. ``And in hindsight we were
basically making fun of the people who were supposed to be coming
to see the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has a very successful track record. His films generally
cost $10 million to $15 million. ``We're averaging a 33 percent
return on investment, which is huge for the movie business
considering the standard return on investment for a comedy is like
6 percent,'' he said. By far his best film, and one of the most
successful, was ``The Wedding Singer,'' with Sandler and Drew
Barrymore. It cost $22 million, and grossed $77 million in the
United States. More a love story than a boys' comedy, it is one of
the few films produced by Simonds with a strong appeal to girls.
</P>
<P>
   Simonds lives in Beverly Hills with his fiancee, Angela
Featherstone, who played the woman who jilted Sandler in ``The
Wedding Singer.'' He has half a dozen projects in production, with
comedians like Sandler, Norm McDonald and Chris Tucker, who is
starring with Mariah Carey in ``00 Soul,'' a black James Bond
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian David Spade was in Simonds' office earlier in the
day, pitching an idea that the producer adored. ``He sat right
there and said, `I have a comedy and I play a gay guy who goes out
one night and gets hit on the head by a disco ball, gets total
amnesia, and his father sees this as an opportunity to reprogram
him as a straight guy.' I laughed and said, `I love it,' and that's
it. We're going to make that movie.''

PICTURETEL REPORTS PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PictureTel Corp. eked out its first quarterly operating profit
in more than a year, despite lower revenues, and said Wednesday it
plans to acquire a Silicon Valley firm whose technology will
broaden PictureTel's menu of video conferencing services.
</P>
<P>
   Starlight Networks Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., specializes in
video streaming technology, which allows video transmission over
data networks.
</P>
<P>
   By blending Starlight's streaming capabilities with its own
video conferencing expertise, Picturetel will be able to offer
customers the ability to not only participate in a live meeting
from remote locations, but also to store and retrieve the recorded
session for use in corporate briefings, long-distance training, and
business television.
</P>
<P>
   There are other applications as well. An important speech by a
company's chief executive, for instance, could be viewed nearly
instantaneously on the desktop computer of thousands of employees
scattered around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market segment that is just beginning to take off,''
said James Stone, an analyst with Preferred Capital Markets, a San
Francisco brokerage firm. ``And I believe it's going to be a very
important market.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies are still negotiating terms of the deal, so it was
unclear how much PictureTel would pay for Starlight, a privately
held company with 55 employees.
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel will use to its common stock as currency to finance
the deal, although it will also pay some cash.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the video collaboration industry said buying
Starlight is a smart move by PictureTel, even though the purchase
will hurt short-term earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They happened to land one of the most well-positioned
companies in the video streaming industry,'' said Jason Ader, an
analyst with H.C. Wainwright &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``It's a perfect
complement for PictureTel's strategy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of new chief executive Bruce Bond, the once
high-flying company is trying to get back on track after stumbling
badly in 1997 amid an industry-wide slump.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Andover, Mass., company turned a corner when it
announced a return to profitability, excluding special charges.
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel, which remains the market leader in sales of video
conferencing equipment despite its recent troubles, reported a
second-quarter profit of $1.2 million, or 3 cents a diluted share.
The figure does not include an $11.6 million write-off of
inventory, a discontinued product line, and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Including the charge, the company's net loss for the quarter was
$6.7 million, or 17 cents per diluted share. That compares with a
net loss of $4.9 million, or 13 cents per diluted share, in the
year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly gain, which was PictureTel's first operating
profit since the first quarter of 1997, was achieved despite lower
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel's sales fell 11 percent to $104.6 million compared to
the same period a year ago. The drop in revenue is due to pricing
pressure from competitors, as well as a continued slowdown in the
industry as customers grapple with buying decisions in the face of
new technologies, Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our strategies was to get the company in a position
where it could make money at a lower revenue rate,'' said Bond, who
earns praise from analysts for quickly turning the company around
since his arrival in March.
</P>
<P>
   The return to profitability, said Ader, ``bodes extremely well
for the future and is a tribute to Bruce Bond and Dick Goldman,''
the company's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman announced Wednesday he will resign from PictureTel in
September, after just one year on the job. Bond said it was an
amicable separation and praised Goldman's leadership during ``a
difficult financial period.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said he decided to take advantage of an escape clause in
his employment contract to assess his career options.
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel also announced that Frazer Hamilton, who worked
previously with Bond at two other companies, would join PictureTel
in the newly created position of vice president of business
processes and quality.

   WASHINGTON _ Playfully considering the possibility that he may
be dull, California's Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gray Davis
said Wednesday his image as an austere political figure may
actually help him win in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying your dues counts,'' said Davis, California's lieutenant
governor, at a luncheon here with Washington political reporters.
Voters, he insisted, are tired of candidates who are all ``flash
and dash'' and geared more to be a ``replacement for Jay Leno''
than governor. Instead, people are looking for a candidate with ``a
solid, substantive vision'' of California's future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also confided, tongue-in-cheek, that he has appointed an
18-member ``task force on dullness'' because he was ``so tired of
being called dull.'' He said the group recommended that ``I keep my
charisma on hold because `dull' seemed to be a path to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis made the comments after some reporters suggested that
Republican candidate Dan Lungren, California's attorney general,
was, in contrast to Davis, a deft ``Reaganesque'' campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor said his GOP opponent ``may have more
charisma.'' However, apparently envisioning headlines that might
result from that statement, Davis quickly backtracked, adding,
``But he may not have more charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton once advised him
that he needed ``an Al Gore shtick.'' He was referring to the vice
president's frequent jokes about his own reputation as a wooden
speaker. Davis described Gore as ``my charisma coach.''
</P>
<P>
   On a serious note, Davis pointed to issues that divide him and
Lungren. One is abortion, Davis said, adding that he is
``pro-choice'' and that Lungren is ``anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   On anti-smoking litigation, Davis said that in January 1997 he
became a leading plaintiff in a San Diego lawsuit to recover
health-related damages from tobacco companies. He said Lungren was
late on the issue, becoming the 37th state attorney general to file
suit in June 1997 when the state legislature authorized such a
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in San Francisco, Dave Puglia, Lungren's campaign
director, said in a phone interview that Lungren was unable to file
earlier because the legislature had granted the tobacco industry
immunity from state lawsuits. Lungren succeeded in persuading the
legislature to rescind the immunity, Puglia said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said he first supported limiting military-style
assault weapons in 1985. Four years later, then Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian signed legislation banning 60 types of assault
weapons and allowing the attorney general to add ``copycat''
weapons to the list. Lungren, Davis said, has done little to add
such guns to that list.
</P>
<P>
   Puglia said Lungren sought to add copycat weapons to the list in
1991 but has been blocked by the courts and is now appealing to the
state supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's campaign page on the World Wide Web stresses his
support of legislation that added 10 years to the sentence of a
criminal who uses a gun, 20 years if the gun is fired and
25-years-to-life if a victim is wounded. The page also stresses
Lungren's support of background checks for prospective gun buyers
to weed out convicted criminals and the mentally ill, saying the
state attorney general's office has denied 30,000 gun purchases.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   David was in Washington for a fundraiser Tuesday night at the
home of Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., one of two major Democratic
opponents that he beat in the June 2 primary. President Clinton and
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt attended the party.
</P>
<P>
   That event plus fund-raisers Davis is holding in New York and
Chicago will net his war chest close to $1 million, according to
his campaign manager, Garry South.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he expects to spend between $20 million and $30
million on the campaign and expects Lungren to spend more.
</P>
<P>
   Davis tweaked the Washington reporters, reminding them how they
had once dismissed him as ``road kill'' and ``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign season opens, he joked, the only thing that
would get him nervous would be ``if the Washington pundits
predicted (my victory).''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton will join him at a fund-raiser Aug. 11 at the
St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, an event chaired by the city's
mayor, Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also made it clear that although Gov. Pete Wilson is
leaving office, he still looms large as a campaign target.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat cited Wilson's backing of Proposition 187, which in
1994 barred most social services and education to undocumented
immigrants, and Proposition 209, which in 1996 ended affirmative
action in state hiring, contracting and admissions to public
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   While Davis praised Wilson for reducing class size, building the
economy and fighting crime, he blamed the governor for ``a legacy
of division and distrust'' that he said will make it ``even
harder'' for Lungren to win this fall.

SPIELBERG SHREDS HOLLYWOOD IMAGE OF WWII  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE FRIDAY JULY 24)

<P>
   UNDATE - Steven Spielberg won't let his 13-year-old son see his
new movie _ and he doesn't think you should let your kids see it,
either.
</P>
<P>
   That's an unusual warning from a filmmaker who has created some
of history's favorite family films.
</P>
<P>
   But Spielberg's latest creation is a shock to the system:
``Saving Private Ryan,'' is the most realistic war movie ever made
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   As a master of film fantasy, Spielberg gave us the galaxy's most
endearing alien (``E.T.``), thrilling monsters (``Jaws'' and
``Jurassic Park'') and the wildest adventure that never happened
(''Raiders of the Lost Ark'').
</P>
<P>
   All of Spielberg's successful fantasies share one quality: They
take the audience along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Spielberg uses all the emotional
techniques at his command to take us on the ultimate non-ride: into
the mechanized maw of modern war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' follows a single squad of American GIs
through the D-Day landing at Omaha Beach, one of the biggest
foul-ups of World War II, and onto an impossible mission: rescuing
one soldier from behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   This is war seen not from the grand sweep of the generals'
battle plans but from one narrow strip of the front, as a few
desperate soldiers try to survive the random death striking down
everyone around them.
</P>
<P>
   The battle scenes, particularly the opening 24-minute invasion
of Omaha Beach, contain some of the rawest footage of what it looks
like when human bodies are ripped apart by machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   How far would Spielberg go to depict the carnage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not go as far as what those real boys experienced 55
years ago,'' the director said. ``I couldn't go that far. That was
the line I didn't allow myself to cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only a glance at what they had to endure on that beach
and live with for the rest of their lives. I intended to make the
most realistic war film ever.''
</P>
<P>
   If Spielberg takes only a glance at the horrors of war, it's a
harder look than most filmmakers would have dared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drew a line in the sand of Omaha Beach,'' he said. ``I got
close to the line but never crossed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people will think he did. According to co-star Matt Damon,
the lab technician who developed the footage of the bayonet fight
in the final battle pleaded with Spielberg to cut it from the film.
He did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to glorify war,'' Spielberg said. ``I was set
and determined to debunk the myth of war created by hundreds of
World War II films. So I needed to make it real. But I also needed
people to allow themselves to experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Longest Day,'' the 1963 D-Day epic starring John Wayne,
Robert Mitchum and Henry Fonda, is the ultimate Hollywood World War
II movie: It's big, it's fought gloriously, and whenever faced with
reality it goes Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' covering some of the same hard-won
territory, provides the antidote of grim reality to everything
Hollywood has ever shown us about World War II _ from the
propaganda films made during the war to build home-front spirit, to
the scores of adventure movies that simply used the war as a
backdrop for visceral excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's intention was to honor the soldiers who fought in
World War II by depicting their battles accurately, not cleaned up
and glorified in typical Hollywood style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is closer to some of the Vietnam War
films _ ``Full Metal Jacket,'' ''Platoon,'' ''Hamburger Hill'' _
that graphically depict the physical butchery and mental taxation
of modern battle.
</P>
<P>
   But there was always an asterisk attached to those Vietnam
films. They were viewed as political statements, condemning an
unpopular war fought under a cloud of suspicious political
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   World War II, in contrast, was always the good war, with most of
the world united against Hitler's threat to humanity's future.
</P>
<P>
   World War II films always emphasized the heroism of soldiers who
fought the Nazi horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' slaps us back to reality, stating
plainly that for the guys on the front line there is only war, that
getting killed in a good war makes you just as dead as getting
</P>
<P>
   killed in a bad war.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Baptism of fire' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg contends that the film's opening battle, as gruesome
as it is, ``puts the audience inside the physical experience of
Omaha Beach and creates a brotherhood between the audience and
those eight guys who survived that battle when they go on their
next mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that baptism of fire, the audience would be on the
journey, but as spectators rather than as brethren.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, who typically makes movies aimed at the widest
possible audience, doesn't want his fans confused. He warns people:
``If you think this movie is going to be too hard on you, then you
shouldn't see it. This is not a kinder, gentler Steven Spielberg
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would advise that people 14 and under should not be allowed
to see the picture at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get up at the age of some of the boys who died there
on the beach, you should see a picture about those who did what you
could do.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' opens on Omaha Beach because those sands
were turned into a killing field where some 2,000 American GIs died
on one day.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spielberg, ``Seventy percent of those boys who hit
the beach had never seen combat before. Many of them died without
ever reaching the beach or during their first seconds on the
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Spielberg, the generals planning the invasion
deliberately chose green troops to lead the first wave. ``They
thought that seasoned troops might not want to go through D-Day
because they knew how bad it can get,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   The troops sent in that first wave were told the beaches and
bluffs would be cleared of German defenders by bombing runs and
Naval bombardment, that they would land unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs and shells sent against German emplacements were
successful at other Normandy landing points. But at Omaha Beach,
they fell long or short. The GIs storming the beach from landing
craft came upon Germans fully prepared to kill them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two minutes, they were no longer green,'' Spielberg said,
``and hopefully neither is the audience. The audience is completely
in line with the young boys who had never seen combat.''
</P>
<P>
   That's due to Spielberg's skill at re-creating the chaos of
battle yet keeping us tightly focused on the humanity of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, like his cast, was acutely aware of his obligation to
the living and the dead of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been for me less than honorable to have just
done one more World War II movie,'' Spielberg said, ``to use their
sacrifice as simply a backdrop for action and adventure. They
didn't have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   When Spielberg chose the ensemble cast to back up star Tom
Hanks, he inadvertently did something unusual: He cast a squad of
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks directed ``That Thing You Do!'' and part of his TV
miniseries about the space program, ``From the Earth to the Moon.''
Co-star Edward Burns, who plays a disgruntled member of Hanks'
squad, wrote and directed three films, including ``No Looking
Back.'' Matt Damon, who plays the paratrooper the squad tries to
rescue, won an Oscar for co-writing ``Good Will Hunting.'' Two
other soldiers in the squad, Adam Goldberg and Vin Diesel, are also
movie directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know some of the others were filmmakers until they
began second-guessing me,'' Spielberg claimed. ``I said to Vin and
Adam, `Who do you think you are, directors?' And they said, `Yeah,
we are.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They all had opinions about things. It was great being around
a bunch of directors, It was like the DGA (Directors Guild of
America) was making the movie with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Damon intends to direct his own scripts someday, the
actor studied Spielberg during the production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned enough to know that I can't put into use most of the
stuff he does,'' Damon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven is so brilliant. The level of decision-making and the
speed at which makes those decisions and the confidence at which he
does it _ it's unlike anything I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks was equally impressed with how Spielberg dealt with such a
large-scale production, which included 750 extras from the Irish
army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see instantly that we were working with the most
facile guy in the world,'' Hanks said. ``There is a handful of guys
who do it as well as Spielberg, and most of them are dead.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Reality-based shoot &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg not only had to deal with the massive logistics of an
epic war movie, he had to keep talented actors focused on the
nuances of their performances amid the frenzy of a
special-effects-dominated battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He created this atmosphere for us to act in, in which the
truth of the moment was very truthful,'' Hanks said. ``For
Spielberg, nothing matters but the truth of the shot. If it's real,
it will be self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie Burns said, `Can you believe how fast this guy is
shooting?' All of us actors who were directors swore that we'll
never be slow again.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon was awed by the way Spielberg packed the frame with action
during the battle scenes. ``It's so chaotic. It creates this
atmosphere and sense of horror,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks also credits the director with being willing to change the
screenplay dramatically once he agreed to play the leading role of
Captain Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was originally a cigar-chewing, Medal of Honor winner,''
Hanks recalled. ``We've seen that guy a million times, a standard
war hero. It's not interesting as an actor, and it's false to what
actually happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks' Captain ended up as a man pushing himself beyond his
personal limits of stress to hold up his obligation to his men _
not an invincible warrior but a man doing the best he can under
impossible conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie is not a vehicle for me,'' he said. ``It's not
about any one of us. It's about honoring the past.''
</P>
<P>
   When the director chose the rest of the supporting cast, he was
looking for guy-next-door types, non-heroes stuck in a rotten
situation, trying to fight their way out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People looked different back then,'' Spielberg said. ``They
were closer to the immigrant stock of the '30s and '40s than we are
today. People look prettier now than they did 60 years ago. Then,
they were more rough-hewn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went with people who looked like the soldiers I see on the
World War II documentaries on the History Channel, which I love.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg was equally obsessive about getting the detail of
soldiering in 1944 right. To do that, he hired a military expert
who had worked on other war films, retired Marine Capt. Dale Dye.
Then Spielberg took it one step further than most filmmakers: He
actually listened to what Dye told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be the most authentic representation of World
War II,'' Spielberg said. ``When I told that to Dye, he said,
`Sweeter words have never been spoken.' I gave him permission to be
technically obsessive.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see that obsessive attention to detail throughout the
movie: in the way different ordnance sounds when fired, in the
small, quick move of a soldier as he taps a clip against his helmet
to realign the bullets before inserting the clip into his rifle, in
the changing skin tones of a man bleeding to death.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg had his technical crew study the impact of the
different ordnance being used on that beach, so that when shells
and bullets hit the sand it would look authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Dye told Spielberg when the big shells landed that ``I don't
want to see any stinking Hollywood fireballs.''
</P>
<P>
   There are none, and no heroes outracing them to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other movie where they're even trying to be this
authentic,'' Hanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Recalled Damon: ``If a stunt looked too stunty, he cut it out.
Spielberg is smart enough to hire these incredible people like Dye.
Add that to his wizardry with a camera and his ability to tell a
story.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dye was Spielberg's litmus test, the Vietnam veteran
performed similar functions for the actors searching for
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best resource was Dale Dye standing right off camera the
entire time,'' Damon said. ``He watched us like a hawk. If you did
something wrong, he was going to tell you. It's the ultimate for an
actor. We all look for the real people to base our characters on.''
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Camp was critical &QL; 
 &QL; 
Before the filming began, Dye took Hanks and his seven-man squad
for six days of basic training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the lecture, then we marched out to our camp,'' Hanks
said. ``We were wet and cold and tired and miserable, which worked
out well because we play guys who are wet and cold and tired and
miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Their training ``was about how far you can push your body,''
Hanks said. ``Without those six days, it would have been a
different movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon wasn't invited to boot camp, which disappointed him at
first because he wants ``every advantage and angle I can get on
making a character authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Damon realized, ``It was an ingenious ploy on Spielberg's
part because the movie is about these eight guys risking their
lives for this one guy. By excluding me, when I showed up on the
set and asked, `Hey, guys, how was boot camp?' the seeds of
resentment were already planted in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg shot the opening D-Day battle first and spent three
weeks doing it, so that by the end of the battle the actors would
feel the exhaustion and shock that the survivors of the landing
were left with.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first day on that beach, it was mind-boggling,''
Hanks recalled. ``The only way of doing a movie like this is as
authentically as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg divided that three-week battle production into
geographic zones: in the water, on the sand, at the sea wall, up
over the bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a new brand of chaos and hell at every one of those
sections,'' Hanks recalled. ``It was extremely physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks found it hard to struggle from the landing craft through
the surf. To add to the feeling that everything is bearing down on
you, he ``kept weight in my pack so I wasn't moving too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   They filmed that battle in three-minute bursts on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   In between shots, while the camera crews set up for the next
burst, the actors ``lay down on the sand and went to sleep because
the trailers were too far away,'' Hanks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be true to what those guys went through, not just
to the survivors but to the dead,'' the star added. ``We didn't
want to do this play-acting an Army man thing where we all have
rubber weapons. We owed it to the memory of the whole enterprise of
D-Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg also consulted with survivors of the Omaha Beach
landing, some of whom watched the filming on the Irish coast. ``We
had one man who lost his entire company in that landing. He was the
only survivor,'' Spielberg recalled, adding that some of the
veterans couldn't watch the filming because it brought back too
many memories.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing ``Saving Private Ryan'' to ``All Quiet on the Western
Front'' and ``A Walk in the Sun,'' two realistic war movies
directed by Lewis Milestone, Spielberg thinks of his film as a
``documentary to what really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to get people to think twice when they pass a
memorial cemetery. ``Look at it. Don't forget it's there. Take your
hat off to the people who allowed us to have the life we're living
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg clearly made this movie to stir our conscience and
make us reflect upon our history. As a movie with a big message,
``Saving Private Ryan'' fits with his other two historic epics:
``Schindler's List,'' about the Nazi horror of exterminating
civilian populations, and ``Amistad,'' about the brutality of the
American slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   But Spielberg claims he is not on a cinematic mission to
dramatize history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a deliberate plan to make these great social
movies,'' he said. ``I did not set out on a crusade to do relevant
movies about history. I have never had a career plan or spent time
charting my own destiny. No one mortal can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then how does he choose which projects to film?
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust my intuition,'' he replied. ``I have been wrong a lot.
But you can't trust your intuition, get screwed by it, and then
never trust it again. You have to keep trusting it.'' &QL;

 &HT;    SENATE PANEL REJECTS CLINTON NOMINEE FOR AIR FORCE SECRETARY
 &HT;    By SHANNON JOYCE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One week after hearing testimony challenging
Florida state Sen. Daryl Jones's personal integrity, a Senate panel
Wednesday rejected his nomination to become the first black
secretary of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare refusal to approve a nominee for the civilian chief of
a military branch, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 9-9 on
a motion to send Jones's nomination to the full Senate, killing his
nine-month bid for the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have lost a fine opportunity to get a good man,''
Committee Chairman Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said after the vote.
``All the propaganda that has come out against him has turned the
public against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond was the only member of the committee to cross party
lines and vote in support of Jones. While Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.
Va., and Charles Robb, D-Va., said they would not vote to send a
positive recommendation to the Senate, they did vote to forward the
nomination without any recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who testified on behalf of Jones, said
``The committee's failure to approve him is a tragedy, and a
tremendous loss for America.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Jones was a ``highly
qualified, superb nominee'' who had ``more than adequately answered
the concerns that were expressed by various senators.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Clinton had not decided if he would continue to
push for Jones or choose another nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Jones told reporters at the Pentagon that none of the objections
raised against him ``made logical sense to me.'' He said he would
keep his reserve status and return to Florida to campaign for
re-election to his state Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My constituents are very supportive. ... I hope I am welcomed
back with open arms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 43, an Air Force Academy graduate and former fighter
pilot, faced an unusual daylong grilling last week on allegations
about his fighter pilot status, his work as an Amway salesman, and
his involvement in a bond sale to finance an expansion of Miami
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Republican committee members said the claims of dishonesty and
inappropriate behavior from fellow officers cast too much doubt on
Jones's integrity and ability to unify and inspire Air Force
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This candidate, in my judgment, was brought before this
committee with a record of fact so fulled with controversy and
conflict that he will be unable to serve as a leader to inspire the
persons under him, particularly those in uniform,'' said Sen. John
Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Warner and other committee members have questioned whether Jones
voluntarily chose, as he testified, to stop flying F-16 fighter
planes when he was a member of the Air Force Reserve in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he couldn't juggle the demands of elected office and
a new law practice and still put in the required aircraft training.
After his superior officer, Col. Thomas Dyches, warned him to
commit to training or face a review panel, Jones said he chose to
step down.
</P>
<P>
   Dyches told the committee last week that he ordered Jones to
stop flying, saying Jones ``misrepresented the facts'' during his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Another fellow officer said he saw Jones pitch Amway products to
enlisted personnel, a practice forbidden under Air Force rules.
Jones denies the claim, and no enlisted personnel have come forward
to say they were pressured.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case we have a 180-degree difference in what has
happened,'' said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. ``I can't write that off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission cleared Jones of
wrongdoing in an inquiry of the Florida bond sale. A Miami
securities firm was one of several local firms that handled bond
sales for the city, but officials thought the firm was too small to
handle such a large project. As an unsalaried employee of the firm
paid on commission, Jones persuaded county officials to let it
handle the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the committee had questioned whether Jones acted
more as a consultant, a role that would have required that he
register with Florida regulators. Members of the committee met with
representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission last
month, but many continued to question Jones's involvement last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's supporters said his unique qualifications fit perfectly
with the demands of a job that has both military and political
responsibilities. He is the only nominee for the position in recent
history who graduated from the Air Force Academy, served in the
active-duty Air Force, the Air National Guard and the Air Force
Reserve. After earning a law degree from the University of Miami,
Jones served two years in the Florida House of Representatives and
six in the Florida Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said accusations do not prove
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess in my mind the question comes down to what are the
proven allegations,'' Glenn said. ``I think if we're going to wreck
a man's career, the least we should do is take testimony under oath
and find out who is telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said. ``I'm disappointed that
they didn't let the full Senate decide.''
</P>
<P>
   A vocal supporter of Jones's nomination, Levin accused the
committee of trying to rob Jones of his dignity and his fellow
officers of being ``out to get him.''

   BECKET, Mass. _ Hungry theatergoers visiting the Jacob's Pillow
Dance Festival can find a restaurant, a pub and a snack bar on the
grounds. But anyone who arrived on Tuesday night would also have
discovered an artistically delectable treat inside the Ted Shawn
Theater: a choreographic smorgasbord served up by the Miami City
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   It was an evening of tidbits. All the pieces were short, and
most were excerpts from longer works. They proved a fine
assortment.
</P>
<P>
   The full title of this presentation to recorded accompaniment
was ``Edward Villella and Dancers From Miami City Ballet,'' and it
featured 10 of the company's 50 members. Some people in the
audience might have wondered what part Villella, the troupe's
director, would play in the performance. Although he was one of the
greatest stars of the New York City Ballet, he no longer dances.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he served as host of the feast, commenting on the
presentations with great charm. Using culinary imagery, he likened
the program to an hors d'oeuvres buffet and a Spanish tapas meal.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised that most of the ballets would emphasize
relationships. The relationships turned out to be of two kinds:
esthetic affinities among choreographers, styles and historical
periods and emotional relationships between people. Although these
ballets were plotless, they did express feelings and served as
reminders that George Balanchine, Villella's mentor, once remarked
that two people onstage were ``a story in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   From the 19th century came the buoyant pas de deux from ``Flower
Festival at Genzano,'' by Danish choreographer August Bournonville.
This duet for lovers begins with a gentle stroll, then develops
into joyous leaps and bounds. Jennifer Kronenberg and Didier Bramaz
were sweetly flirtatious as the lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kronenberg looked delicate in the small darting steps.
Bramaz kept his arms in repose in the passages that required his
feet to perform intricate beats. The way the dancers appeared both
merry and decorous made it possible to understand what Villella
meant when he called Bournonville a ``moral choreographer.''
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine shared Bournonville's fondness for speed and
lightness. ``Valse Fantaisie'' certainly made that evident.
Balanchine must have loved this waltz by Glinka; he kept on
choreographing it. The Miami company gave his 1953 staging for a
man and three women, rather than the more familiar 1967 version for
a principal couple and an ensemble of four women.
</P>
<P>
   The performance by Paige Fulleton, Tricia Albertson, Joan Latham
and Arnold Quintane suggested that this lesser-known production
deserves to be better known today. Groups kept forming and
dissolving with remarkable rapidity, and the dancers remained at
ease in all the quicksilver comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the fleetness and delicacy associated with the
Danish style, Balanchine admired the imperial dignity of the
Russian style in which he was trained. One of his most stately
duets, the pas de deux from the ``Diamonds'' section of ``Jewels,''
received a suitably aristocratic interpretation by Deanna Seay and
Eric Quillere. Ms. Seay revealed that she realized that benign
aristocrats show their good breeding through their confidence
rather than their arrogance, and Quillere was an attentive,
princely partner.
</P>
<P>
   What was billed as the ``concert version'' of ``Who Cares?''
turned out to be the sequence of solos and duets that are the
choreographic heart of this ballet to orchestrated Gershwin songs.
Coming after extroverted ensembles and preceeding a splashy finale,
these smaller-scaled episodes convey a sense of intimacy. The cast
invested each solo with its own special personality. Ms. Seay was
frisky. Ms. Kronenberg emphasized the choreography's quirky shifts
of weight and direction. Ms. Fulleton whirled happily. Quillere was
insouciant. And when the women took turns dancing with him, each
duet suggested that these were people who loved to be together.
</P>
<P>
   The program included two works by the company's capable resident
choreographer, Jimmy Gamonet De Los Heros: ``Nous Sommes'' and a
suite from ``Transtangos.'' ``Nous Sommes'' was the more striking.
Filled with complicated lifts and entwinings, this pas de deux
could have been nothing but blatant exhibitionism. But the way
Iliana Lopez and Franklin Gamero focused so intensely upon each
other made each virtuosic phrase the choreographic equivalent of a
passionate sigh by lovers totally immersed in their own private
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transtangos'' combined classical ballet with Argentine tango
dancing. The mixture looked forced at times. But Gamero was
convincing in a brooding solo in which leaps eventually resembled
acts of defiance, and his duets with Ms. Lopez were sultry and
sizzling.

 &HT;    GLENN REMEMBERS FELLOW ASTRONAUT SHEPARD
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Glenn said Wednesday he was ``shocked''
by the abrupt death of fellow Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard, who
had been battling leukemia but seemed to be doing well when they
two spoke weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him not too long ago, '' Glenn said in a brief
press conference Wednesday. ``And he had hoped to be down at the
flight in October when I'm scheduled to go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 77, returns to orbit Oct. 29 for a space shuttle flight
that will make him the oldest man ever in space. Glenn said Shepard
acknowledged being at ``half throttle'' because of his illness, but
Glenn still was optimistic that he might be able to attend the
Florida launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was enthusiastic about it, wanted to be there if he
could,'' Glenn said. ``I thought he might well make it to the end
of the year, at least, because he seemed to be in pretty good
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn spoke warmly and respectfully of his partner in the elite
fraternity of seven men chosen to be America's first astronauts.
Although Glenn was always the straight arrow and Shepard nurtured a
bit of a wild streak, the two worked well together.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was Shepard's backup for the historic 1961 flight that
made him the first American in space. The pressure to succeed in
space was enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are times when you try and break the tension,'' Glenn
remembered. ``I had a picture that I had installed on the
periscope, or installed in the capsule to break the tension a
little bit, which he got a big kick out of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't describe the picture,'' Glenn said, smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said Shepard reciprocated with a prank when Glenn flew
America's first orbital mission in 1962. At the time, a popular
character in comedy television named Jose Jimenez talked about
wanting to be an astronaut, and Shepard loved it. He did the
routine himself during training, talking as the Jimenez character
did of feeling sorry for mice that were being used in early rocket
tests.
</P>
<P>
   So when Glenn achieved orbit during his flight, he reached for a
piece of equipment only to see a felt mouse with pink ears and a
long tail float out into the middle of the capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``These little pressure breakers (are what) you remember very,
very well,'' Glenn said. ``And I still have that little mouse.''

OF THE MIND AND ARTISTS WHO LOSE IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years there has been a lot of interest, not least from
composers, in the artistic productions of people who would have
once been called mad. The Danish composer Per Norgaard devoted a
period of his composing life in the '80s to the multitudinous
scrawlings of Adolf Wolfli, who spent decades in a Swiss asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfli's writings have also been set as songs by the German
composer Wolfgang Rihm, as have the poems of Robert Walser.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination of such material is plain to see. Wolfli's and
Walser's poetry invites us to extend our sympathies, and probably
to discover that the mentality of the deeply and permanently
disturbed is not so strange to us.
</P>
<P>
   For a composer, that invitation might easily have creative
consequences, especially in an age when many artists have felt a
call to explore extremes of feeling. Whereas Heine was the most
important of the German Romantics to Schumann, the modern taste is
for Holderlin, and especially for the scary drafts and fragments he
produced during his long period of derangement.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz Holliger, the Swiss composer and oboist, fashioned a whole
cycle of choral and instrumental pieces based on late Holderlin.
Bruno Maderna created a Holderlin opera back in the '60s, and the
Hungarian composers Gyorgy Kurtag and Gyorgy Ligeti have both
visited the same territory more recently.
</P>
<P>
   The writings of mad poets offer an interesting corrective to the
way madness has often been portrayed in literature. Unlike Ophelia,
for instance, the authentically insane do not seem to give voice to
graceful if disconnected images, to statements that identify the
causes of their insanity or to trenchant insights into other
people. Nor do they sing.
</P>
<P>
   Music itself, in the case of Ophelia and others, is a sure sign
of madness. Rarely is it so in real life.
</P>
<P>
   If we look for musical counterparts to Wolfli, Walser and
Holderlin _for mad people who composed music or for professional
composers who declined into madness and went on writing _ we draw a
blank. Wolfli's output included musical notations, but only shreds.
Composers who lost their sanity _ like Schumann and Wolf, both of
whom were apparently suffering the effects of syphilis _
simultaneously lost the will or the ability to compose.
</P>
<P>
   A haunting photograph in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and
Musicians shows Wolf staring into the camera under the supervision
of his nurse. In that state he composed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Schumann's last works were composed during his lucid intervals,
and they show signs not of incipient madness but of a collapsing
imagination. One listens in vain for anything monstrous or
extraordinary in his Violin Concerto; it is simply weak.
</P>
<P>
   A possible borderline case is Berlioz. But though he did odd
things on occasion _ like fall in love with Ophelia and make the
mistake of marrying the Irish actress he had seen embody the
character on stage, Harriet Smithson _ he functioned competently in
society, and did so in roles that required him to communicate
accurately and appropriately with others: as conductor and, indeed,
music critic. And though his music may be weird and wild at times,
it is not deranged.
</P>
<P>
   If madness in music is hard to distinguish, there might be two
explanations. One would be simply that all music is mad. This was
the view of those Greek authors who identified poetic and musical
creation as kinds of madness, and it is not unpersuasive.
</P>
<P>
   But it leaves out of account the fact that in poetry we can
broadly separate the mad from the sane, the Wolfli from the
Wordsworth, whereas active composers of the mad sort are not at all
easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the comparison here is complicated by the fact that
nearly everybody in modern societies can write, but only a tiny
minority have the training and the ability to compose. Most people
could, if pushed, produce a pair of rhyming lines in a regular
meter. Very few would be able to achieve something like the musical
equivalent: set down two four-bar melodic phrases, the second
answering the first.
</P>
<P>
   We must regret the fact that basic creative skills are not
taught at an early age in music as they are in literature, but they
are not. This fact must at least partly account for why the
expression of madness is much more likely to come in words than in
music.
</P>
<P>
   That this is so, though, even for professional composers,
restores the puzzle of the lack of mad music. We may have to
conclude that musical composition is just impossible for someone
whose brain is not operating efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   The many criteria that have to be considered and the complexity
of the notation, even for an elementary melody, are beyond what the
unbalanced mind can achieve. This would be a heartening thought,
that musical compositions, in their very existence, are testaments
to sanity and logic.
</P>
<P>
   If we want to hear music that instead speaks of madness _ of
real madness, not the madness depicted by conventional melancholy
and flights of virtuosity in 19th-century opera; by the
strong-flavored expressionism Rihm brings to bear on the poems of
Wolfli and Walser, or by the cold isolation Stravinsky used for the
inmates of Bedlam in the most disturbing mad scene yet devised,
that of ``The Rake's Progress'' _ then it would be futile to search
a music library.
</P>
<P>
   Craziness abounds in music but not among composers. It comes out
where the disciplines of writing a score cannot bar it. Performers
and improvisers: search their ranks for the mad.

<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Nervous and teary-eyed, Diane Zamora took
the witness stand in the capital murder trial of her former high
school sweetheart Wednesday _ but only to say no when asked if she
would testify before the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora, already sentenced to life in prison, declined to answer
questions rather than further incriminate herself in the 1995
slaying of romantic rival Adrianne Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Without Zamora available, defense lawyer Dan Cogdell quickly
concluded his case for David Graham. Cogdell presented no
witnesses, ``standing on (Graham's) presumption of innocence,''
thereby setting the stage for final arguments and jury
deliberations Thursday. Graham, a former U.S. Air Force Academy
cadet, faces a possible life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting only 20 feet from her ex-fiance, Zamora was in the same
room as Graham for the first time in nearly a year. The
now-infamous couple never spoke, but their gazes appeared to lock
on each other for a few seconds as a packed courtroom and media
cameras scrutinized their every move.
</P>
<P>
   Before that momentary eye contact, Zamora smiled at her family
members and mouthed the words ``I love you'' to them. Then, until
the legal proceedings began, she sat awkwardly, her eyes darting
around the room as if trying to avoid Graham's constant stare.
</P>
<P>
   At Graham's request, Zamora, a former U.S. Naval Academy
midshipman, was summoned from a Gatesville prison where she is
serving a life sentence with a 40-year minimum incarceration.
Cogdell has told jurors that Zamora single-handedly killed the
16-year-old Jones, though Graham confessed at the time of his
arrest to shooting her to appease Zamora's jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Graham has asserted there was no basis for the
jealousy and that he was not involved in the killing. It was out of
love, he said, that he helped Zamora cover up the crime for nine
months before they were arrested. Graham and Zamora were high
school seniors when the crime was committed, and they were away at
college when arrested.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Don Leonard of Fort Worth ruled that
Zamora, who is appealing her February conviction, could not be
forced to testify. But for the trial record, he allowed Cogdell to
pose two questions that she then declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Zamora,'' Cogdell said, ``would you admit that you and
you alone killed Adrianne Jones in the early morning hours of Dec.
4, 1995?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the advice of my attorney I'm exerting my Fifth
Amendment privilege,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you admit, Miss Zamora, that David Graham had nothing to
do at all with the cause of the death of Adrianne Jones in the
early morning hours of Dec. 4, 1995,'' Cogdell queried.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not require Zamora to say another word. Instead,
he ordered her returned to prison, even though Cogdell said he
wanted jurors to lay eyes on Zamora so they could draw their own
conclusions about whether she was physically capable of
overpowering Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said he wanted ``to use Miss Zamora in a physical
demonstration to show logistically and physically that it is more
logical that Miss Zamora had to fire the shots ... given the
testimony of the medical examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had presented testimony indicating that the butt of
Graham's handgun was used to strike Jones in the head, moments
before she was shot twice in the face at close range. The slaying
occurred in a secluded part of Tarrant County near Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County prosecutors concluded their five-day
presentation, which included 27 witnesses and about 100 pieces of
evidence, with crucial testimony from Graham's former best friend,
John Green.
</P>
<P>
   Green said that early one December morning in 1995, Graham and
Zamora crawled through his bedroom window and used his bathroom for
a lengthy clean-up. He said Graham told him not to ask any
questions about the unusual visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never here,'' he quoted Graham as saying. Prosecutors
contend the visit came within half an hour of Jones' slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The defense's decision to present no witnesses came as a
surprise to the jammed courtroom, where people had lined up as
early as 4:30 a.m. to get a glimpse of Zamora and Graham. By the
time the court opened at 8 a.m., about 30 spectators were in line
and some were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora's aunt, Maria Consuela Mendoza, later told reporters that
Zamora was overcome with emotion about having to appear at the
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was nervous, she was upset. I don't think she has that
much of a difficulty having to face him. He knows the truth,''
Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the family and to Diane, it's like Diane is on trial all
over again. ... It's not about David. It's about Diane and what
Diane has said and done in the past,'' the aunt said, adding that
family members journeyed from the Dallas-Fort Worth area to support
Zamora.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to give a smile in between holding back the tears
because it's hard,'' she said. ``It's nerve-wracking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who visits Zamora frequently, as recently as Saturday,
said there is no romantic spark between the former lovers anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' she said. ``That's a relationship gone bad. The
only thing that Diane ever did wrong was be in love with the wrong
person. I'm sure she's got mixed emotions. You don't just get over
it overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamora's lawyer, John Linebarger, agreed with Mendoza that if
Zamora had testified, it would not have helped Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left to her own devices, Diane would have had a lot to say,
but she is wise enough to follow the advice of her attorney ... and
I don't think her testimony would have been of any benefit
whatsoever to David Graham,'' Linebarger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am authorized by her to say she would have testified to the
same thing she testified to in her trial.''

 &HT;    DESPITE WEIGHT OF FAST-TRACK, AFRICA TRADE BILL MAY STILL FLOAT
 &HT;    By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Critics of the Africa trade bill stepped up their
opposition Wednesday, arguing that the measure's strengths have
been wiped out as it heads to the Senate floor as part of a bigger
trade package.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wonders if this act could have any imaginable benefits at
all,'' Randall Robinson, president of TransAfrica said at a news
briefing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a longtime opponent of the bill, has maintained that
the measure designed to strengthen ties with the continent's
long-neglected sub-Saharan region imposes unfair conditions on
African countries while benefiting large foreign corporations.
</P>
<P>
   But the future of the controversial trade bill -- strongly
backed by the Clinton administration, most African national leaders
and big corporations for its effort to open U.S. markets to African
exports -- is even less certain following Tuesday's mark-up in the
Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks who wanted a 'good' Africa bill more or less got
slapped,'' said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global
Trade Watch, which lobbied against the original bill. ``The . . .
bill was sacrificed by super-gluing a bag of hot potatoes to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallach -- who, like Robinson, supports the idea of an Africa
trade bill -- labeled Tuesday's maneuvering as a way to ``cause
political embarrassment'' to President Clinton and use the
House-passed version of the bill as a vehicle to push other
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel attached controversial ``fast-track'' trade
legislation to the bill, which has little chance of passing in the
House. Even the Clinton administration, which tried to push
authority to negotiate trade deals without Congressional approval
last year, winced at having fast-track added the the Africa trade
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., an opponent of fast-track, was
wavering on whether to support the Africa trade bill to begin with.
But she opposed the measure in the Finance Committee on Tuesday,
calling fast-track a ``poison pill'' to the Africa bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as fast-track is a part of it, that settles the
matter,'' said her spokesman, Michael Briggs.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance's revival of fast-track, as well as adding a
number of trade measures to the Africa bill -- including expanding
NAFTA benefits to 24 Latin American and Caribbean nations -- has
generated concern not only from opponents but supporters of the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   At the crux of their concern is that the bill now only grants
duty-free access to textiles from Africa only if the garments are
assembled and cut from U.S. fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``That negates virtually the entire bill,'' said Larry Neal,
spokesman for Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who supports fast-track
legislation. ``We may pass an Africa trade bill where no trade will
actually occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The textile amendment has even worried the author of the House
version of the bill, Philip Crane, R-Ill. who said the change
``strips the most significant benefits for African nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Rep. Crane and a coalition that has promoted
the bill since it narrowly passed the House last March, say the
damage done to the bill can be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not entirely what we want,'' said Elliott Hall, co-chair
of a coalition made up of 60 businesses that endorse the bill.
``But we expect compromises will be made when it comes to the
Senate floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see whether fast-track drags this bill down,'' he said,
conceding that in order to get the Africa trade bill out of
committee, concessions had to be made.

<P>
   IZINGOLWENI, South Africa _ One day earlier, the workers from
the South Coast Hospice had at least brought food. But this day
they had only bad news to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   They had not been able to find anyone willing to donate a coffin
for Ennie Gambushe's daughter, Mercy, who had died of AIDS. Nor had
they come up with the $18 needed for a traditional burial.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gambushe, 64, with chronic arthritis that makes it
difficult for her to stand up, absorbed the blow without saying a
word. It was hardly her only concern: outside, dirty and dressed in
rags, were the 15 grandchildren, none older than 12, that she was
now responsible for.
</P>
<P>
   Years after many other sub-Saharan countries, South Africa has
finally begun to see its people die from AIDS. In almost every
cluster of desperately poor huts tucked into the rolling hills of
KwaZulu/Natal Province, the slow wasting fatal disease that few
will admit to is wreaking its havoc.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic in this country is now one of the fastest growing
in the world. Experts say South Africa _ protected by apartheid's
isolationism from major exposure to infection, and with a health
system better than any other on the continent _ had a unique
opportunity to prevent the kind of explosion of AIDS cases that has
ravaged the rest of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1990s the country was in the grip of
negotiating a peaceful transition from white supremacist rule. With
the possibility of civil war looming, no one paid much attention to
halting unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, many experts say, the government's efforts to combat
the epidemic have been slow and marred by scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Today almost three million South Africans _ about 12 percent of
all adults _ are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
more than double the number only three years ago. The rate of
infection is highest, at 20 percent, among women in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that it may be only a few years before South
Africa's infection rates will equal those of its neighbors Zimbabwe
and Botswana, where 25 percent of all adults are infected.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, experts believe that the virus is most
prevalent among South Africa's poor blacks. In some parts of
Africa, the epidemic first roared through the urban elite. They had
the money to travel and tended to have more sexual partners. But in
South Africa, it is poor blacks _ because they search the country
looking for jobs and often have sexual partners in their villages
and where they work _ that have been hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   What impact the virus will have on South Africa's economy, the
largest on the continent, remains an open question. But there is
little doubt that it will bring new levels of misery to the very
poor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is already evident in places like Izingolweni _ rural areas
where the way of life was for decades dictated by apartheid laws.
The able-bodied went off to work, forbidden from taking their
families with them. But it is here that they came to marry, to
celebrate holidays or when they were ill, old or dying.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road from Mrs. Gambushe is an 11-year-old girl who
alone nursed her dying parents last year, barely able to keep them
clean and fed as their bodies, worn down by the HIV virus,
shriveled from dysentery and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   There is a dying mother of nine who struggles with a husband who
beats her because he believes she gave him the disease.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a young man, rail thin, who worked for a while in
the city of Durban, but who has come home to die now. He is not
accepted by his family because they suspect he has AIDS and are
afraid that they too will catch it. Though the young man is allowed
his hut nearby, he must tend to himself. Many days he is too weak
to fetch water from the river and the workers find him lying in
filth.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, such people receive few services. The South
Coast Hospice originally began as a non-profit organization working
out of a small house in a white neighborhood, catering largely to
middle class people dying of cancer in the seaside town of Port
Shepstone.
</P>
<P>
   But 18 months ago, the group began trying to reach out to the
black population dying of AIDS. At first, the hospice concentrated
on delivering pain killers as it had for whites. But soon they were
carting food, clothing and whatever else they could into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good does it do to bring pain killers when you find that
the caregiver in the household doesn't have the strength to roll
the patient over because she is starving,'' said Kathleen
Defilippi, the director of the non-profit group. ``So we didn't
want to, but we had to get involved in handing out food parcels and
whatever else was needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gambushe's difficulty in providing a coffin for her
daughter is not unusual, the hospice workers said. Many these days
are buried wrapped only in sheets despite the deeply held Zulu
belief that those who are not put to rest properly will come back
to haunt their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, we even have to give them the sheets,'' said
Judy Ndaba, who visits patients four days a week. The fifth day,
she receives counseling as do all the other workers, because what
they see is so draining.
</P>
<P>
   As the workers, try to tend to patients they must often do so
without acknowledging that the patient has AIDS. Here as elsewhere
in the country patients are too ashamed and too frightened to tell
anyone their diagnosis. Often enough, they die with their secret.

   P &UR; aul McCartney &LR;  has written to Chancellor  &UR; Michael Bishop  &LR; of
University of California at San Francisco to protest tests in which
squirrel monkeys will be subjected to blasts of sound. The
experiments are designed to research high-frequency hearing loss
suffered by humans when they attend rock concerts or are near
planes taking off.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of the noise, to be ``administered'' in four-hour
sessions, is greater than that made by jet engines. says the
monkeys will be anesthetized before the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The matter came to McCartney's attention through People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, which had been alerted by San
Francisco Audio store owner  &UR; Radley Hirsch &LR; . Hirsch had refused to
sell UCSF loudspeakers for the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I most strongly object to these cruel tests,'' McCartney wrote
to Bishop. ``In a technologically sophisticated world and one in
which we are supposed to be sufficiently aware of the nature and
needs of the other species to respect them, there can be no excuse
for inflicting such misery on these intelligent, feeling beings.
That the monkeys may be anesthetized before they awake to find
themselves bafflingly deaf is no consolation.''
</P>
<P>
   UC's &UR; Alice Trinkl  &LR; said that the university has no record of
having received McCartney's letter, which was dated July 6, and
that the experiments are ``in process.''

 IZINGOLWENI, South Africa: their secret. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mrs. Gambushe, for instance, does not know that Mercy died of
AIDS. Mercy did not want to tell her and the health workers are
bound to follow her wishes. Another of Mrs. Gambushe's daughters
died last year, and again, she does not know why. It is the
children of both daughters that Mrs. Gambushe is now looking after.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient, Nomusa Dlamini, who has been ill for three
years, has also not told her family she has AIDS. She does not fear
only for herself. She worries that, if her sisters knew, they would
be too frightened to take care of her two young children after she
dies.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, even wives are afraid to tell their husbands they are
HIV infected. Because the women, run down by the hard lives they
lead and many children they bear, are most likely to show symptoms
first, husbands will not believe that they have been faithful and
sometimes throw them out of the house or beat them like Esther
Xolo. Her husband now believes their last two children are not his.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, Ms. Xolo burst into tears, begging the
workers to talk to her husband, who has taken to living on his own
and hoarding the food the workers bring the family.
</P>
<P>
   Even though, the disease is often not acknowledged, the villages
have seen enough AIDS so that suspicion runs high.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients live in virtual isolation because of it. Vusumuzi
Tabhu, who has told no one he is suffering from AIDS, has gotten
little help from his family since he came home last year. On a
recent day, he greeted the workers with a grin. He had been feeling
better in the last few days and had done his laundry.
</P>
<P>
   They teased him about having found a girlfriend, an exchange
that he clearly enjoyed. But the workers say that he suffers a
great deal. Even when the workers bring him food, his family often
takes it from him. They too are hungry, and he is far too weak to
stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sometimes go into the household and you see that the
person is isolated,'' said Dr. Terry Gilpin, the director of nearby
Murchison Hospital. ``You'll see that the sick person's plate and
utensils are in the corner away from everyone else. You see it a
lot, people are ignorant about the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Murchison, like many other hospitals in KwaZulu/Natal, is
already overwhelmed by the numbers of AIDS patients. Most nights,
15 patients sleep on the floor. While infection rates are rising
throughout South Africa, the hardest-hit area is KwaZulu/Natal,
which includes a port city and numerous truck routes connecting it
to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are no similar models to study, economists say it is
impossible to predict what is likely to happen to South Africa's
economy. Some believe that the bigger corporations will be able to
adapt to a decline in the labor pool.
</P>
<P>
   Most are already in the process of shedding employees as they
mechanize, computerize and, in general, try to become more
competitive. In addition, the growing mobility of the international
labor pool means that South Africa could go outside the country to
fill gaps that arise.
</P>
<P>
   But already it is clear that the measure of hardship in this
society will rise sharply. Young people will be dying at a time
when they are usually contributing to a family's income. And many
will be leaving behind children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on what the macro level impact will
be,'' said Alan Whiteside, an economist at the University of Natal
in Durban who studies such issues. ``But at the micro level you
will see great misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite South Africa's relatively advanced public health
services, the country is still struggling financially and the
government is not even discussing providing treatment for AIDS
itself. Few of the private medical insurance companies will pay
either.
</P>
<P>
   According to Peter Bassey of the National Association of People
Living with HIV/AIDS, fewer than 1 percent of South Africa's
infected are being treated with life prolonging drugs such as AZT.
Most of those people are paying for the drug themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are there any national programs yet to try to block the
transmission from mother to child, either by offering AZT to
infected pregnant women or by providing formula so they can avoid
transmission through breast feeding.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government has made progress in dispensing condoms
(about 140 million last year) and in offering treatment for
sexually transmitted diseases, which helps reduce the spread of
AIDS. Also, about one-tenth of the country's secondary teachers
have been trained to teach youngsters about the disease and how to
avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government's two most visible steps against AIDS were
both headline-making fiascos.
</P>
<P>
   The first was an ill-fated traveling musical, Sarafina II, meant
to warn the illiterate about the dangers of AIDS. As soon as it
opened, AIDS experts called some of its dialogue dangerously
inaccurate and its message unclear.
</P>
<P>
   It then turned out that the show had cost a relative fortune _
nearly $3.3 million. The health minister, Dr. Nkosazana Zuma,
commissioned a friend to write it, by-passed bidding rules to give
him the job and then lied to Parliament about the whole affair.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, Dr. Zuma announced that South African scientists
had made a major breakthrough in the search for an AIDS cure. She
invited researchers who claimed to have discovered the miracle cure
_ a skin patch _ to bypass the Medicines Control Council, the
equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration, and bring some of
their cured patients before the Cabinet to plead for funding.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts, including the council, were aghast when they
found out that human trials had been performed secretly _
especially when they learned that the Virodene contained a
poisonous solvent. Since then, Dr. Zuma has dismantled the council.
She continues to back Virodene research.
</P>
<P>
   These days the South Coast Hospice workers visit more than 300
patients a month, though they have yet to secure funding for next
year and may have to shut down. The workers are particularly
worried about the fate of the children they see.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old girl who nursed her parents, Kugu Sengane, spent
most of last year alone with them and her toddler brother. Her
relatives showed up only in the last few months, ready, it seems,
to take over the two shacks her parents built. These days the
workers are worried about the girl. She seems afraid to speak in
front of her aunts and appears to do most of the housework.
</P>
<P>
   There is also little possibility that the 15 children in Mrs.
Gambushe's care will go to school anytime soon. They will all be
living on her pension now, less than $80 a month. The school fees
and mandatory books and uniforms amount to about $120 a year for
each child. Sitting motionless on the straw mat inside her
virtually empty house, Mrs. Gambushe answered questions about the
future in a monotone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I will do now,'' she said. ``I don't
know.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   P &UR; aul McCartney &LR;  has written to Chancellor  &UR; Michael Bishop  &LR; of
University of California at San Francisco to protest tests in which
squirrel monkeys will be subjected to blasts of sound. The
experiments are designed to research high-frequency hearing loss
suffered by humans when they attend rock concerts or are near
planes taking off.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of the noise, to be ``administered'' in four-hour
sessions, is greater than that made by jet engines. says the
monkeys will be anesthetized before the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The matter came to McCartney's attention through People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, which had been alerted by San
Francisco Audio store owner  &UR; Radley Hirsch &LR; . Hirsch had refused to
sell UCSF loudspeakers for the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I most strongly object to these cruel tests,'' McCartney wrote
to Bishop. ``In a technologically sophisticated world and one in
which we are supposed to be sufficiently aware of the nature and
needs of the other species to respect them, there can be no excuse
for inflicting such misery on these intelligent, feeling beings.
That the monkeys may be anesthetized before they awake to find
themselves bafflingly deaf is no consolation.''
</P>
<P>
   UC's &UR; Alice Trinkl  &LR; said that the university has no record of
having received McCartney's letter, which was dated July 6, and
that the experiments are ``in process.''

SENATE PANEL KILLS $100 MILLION IN FUNDS FOR MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key Senate committee Wednesday killed a measure
that would have given Massachusetts $100 million in highway money
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was two months to the day after Trent Lott, the Senate
majority leader, and Tom Daschle, the minority leader, shook hands
on an agreement to earmark the funds for Massachusetts and the same
amount for Alabama, with the money coming from the pending
water-resources bill. The agreement cleared the way for approving
the $200.5 billion highway spending bill on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was struck after Senators John F. Kerry and Richard
Shelby, an Alabama Republican, each threatened to block passage of
the final version of the highway spending bill unless the Senate
leaders pledged to find more money for their states.
</P>
<P>
   Highway money for Massachusetts was cut back in the final 24
hours of haggling over the transportation bill _ the biggest pork
barrel measure in history _ because of funding promises made to
other states. Kerry worked out the agreement to get additional
highway dollars from another bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee rejected
that move Wednesday by deleting the provision that would authorize
the $20 million a year in extra money for Massachusetts and Alabama
on a 12-6 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, chairman of
the committee, voted in favor of the funding. Senator Bob Smith, a
New Hampshire Republican, voted against the money for his
neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat and former governor who
had been active in the battle to equalize highway funding among the
states, proposed killing the provision, saying it would put the
entire water-resources bill at risk of a parliamentary challenge on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry called Wednesday's committee vote a temporary setback and
said Senate leaders were surprised by the action. He predicted that
the funding authorization would be added to the bill later in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership is thoroughly committed to doing it and will do
it, and will probably do it in conference,'' said Kerry. ``Their
commitment is absolutely firm.''

ROBERT YOUNG, 91, ACTOR KNOWN FOR WHOLESOME TV IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Wash.)   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Robert Young, an actor who created solid, wholesome,
common-sense characters on television in ``Father Knows Best'' and
``Marcus Welby, M.D.'' while privately battling some personal
demons, died Tuesday night at his home in Westlake Village, a Los
Angeles suburb. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   After a prolific career as a dependable film actor during
Hollywood's golden age in the 1930s and '40s, he went on to even
greater success in the two long-running television shows that were
among the most popular of their respective decades.
</P>
<P>
   Young's television roles were built on integrity, clarity and
kindness. Although ``Father Knows Best,'' which Young originated on
NBC radio in 1949, was a classically wholesome and idealized
portrait of family life in the Midwest, circa the 1950s and early
'60s, Young insisted that the character he played, Jim Anderson,
should be more realistic than other sitcom dads, who were often
dimwitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be the father, but not a boob,'' he told a
producer friend during the process of developing the radio show. He
and the show's creators sought to portray ``what we thought would
be representative of a middle-class American family, if there was
such a thing,'' Young once recalled. ``There probably isn't, but
that was what we were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour show had its television debut in 1954. The
program, in which Jim Anderson, his wife, Margaret, played by Jane
Wyatt _ Young was the only member of the radio cast who made the
transition to television _ had three children, was not particularly
successful, and CBS canceled it in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   But so many viewers demanded that it be reinstated, and urged
that it move from 10 p.m. to an earlier time slot so that the whole
family could watch, that NBC picked it up the following season and
showed it at 8:30, initially on Wednesdays. The show prospered on
NBC and then back at CBS. In its 1959-60 season, its last with
original episodes, ``Father Knows Best'' had its most successful
year, ranking sixth among all television shows. Successful reruns
followed on CBS and ABC until 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Young ``never had any problems about being a prima donna,''
Billy Gray, who played the son, Bud, on the show said Wednesday.
``He was very generous as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Father Knows Best'' ceased production, Young said he had
tired of the role and wanted to move on. Like ``Seinfeld,'' it was
one of the rare cases in the history of television when production
of a series ceased at the peak of its popularity. Young himself
always defended the program but seemed fully aware of its
white-bread style and shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Adding subplots about illness or drugs or serious problems, he
once said, ``would have been like taking a beautiful painting and
obliterating it with black paint _ and that really would have
turned the audience off.'' He added, ``We never intended the series
to be more than a weekly half-hour of fun and entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief semi-retirement, which Young said he loathed _
``When anyone says `retire,' I say `retire to what?''' he once said
_ he was cast in 1969 as Marcus Welby, a Santa Monica general
practitioner who involved himself in the lives of his patients.
</P>
<P>
   Former NBC chairman Grant Tinker, who in 1969 was a television
executive at Universal Studios (which produced ``Marcus Welby,
M.D.''), recalled in an interview that Ralph Bellamy was set to
play the role. ``Robert Young suddenly appeared and was sitting in
my office,'' Tinker said. ``Someone had gotten him the pilot
script. His opening words to me were, `I want to be Marcus
Welby.''' Young got the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very sympathetic quality to Young as an actor,''
Tinker said. ``You can easily confuse him with a kindly doctor. He
was also a guy who had a backbone. He was very determined.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour show, with James Brolin as his youthful medical
sidekick, had its premiere on Sept. 23, 1969, and was an instant
success. It became the biggest hit in the history of the ABC
network up to that time. Part of its initial success was that the
competition was weak because CBS and NBC opposed it with news
documentary programs. But viewers clearly adored the show and
remained faithful to it against stronger competition in later
years. The show's last telecast was in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show itself, unlike ``Father Knows Best,'' dealt
with serious problems like autism, blindness, LSD side effects,
drug addiction and leukemia, Marcus Welby himself was something of
a fantasy doctor who took a deeply personal approach to all of his
patients. He treated not only physical ailments but the fears and
family issues of each person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's understanding and dedicated,'' Young once said of Marcus
Welby. ``These are words that for some reason have fallen into
disuse. I knew from the start that I had to come back and play this
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who won two Emmys for ``Father Knows Best,'' won a third
for ``Welby.'' He was also held in esteem by medical groups.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the characters he played and his public image, Young was
a complex and, in many ways, troubled figure.
</P>
<P>
   He was married to the same woman for more than 60 years. Young
was 17, and in high school, when he met Elizabeth Louise Henderson,
who was 14. They married in 1933. She died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Young is survived by their four daughters, Betty Lou Gleason,
Carol Proffitt, Barbara Beebe and Kathy Young. He also had six
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But his life was sometimes difficult. He had a history of
alcoholism and depression and attended Alcoholics Anonymous
meetings while he was making ``Father Knows Best.'' In 1991, at 83,
he tried to commit suicide by running a hose from his car's exhaust
pipe to the interior of the vehicle. The attempt failed because the
battery was dead and the car wouldn't start.
</P>
<P>
   Young later admitted that he had been drinking when he asked his
wife to enter into a suicide pact with him and then tried to take
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the son of an Irish immigrant building manufacturer, was
born in Chicago on Feb. 22, 1907, the fourth of five children. The
family moved to Seattle and then Los Angeles when he was a boy.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Young wanted to be an actor. He took part in
high school dramatics and, after graduation, studied and acted at
night at the Pasadena Community Playhouse. He worked part-time as,
among other jobs, a drugstore clerk and loan collector.
</P>
<P>
   His theater work and good looks stirred Hollywood's interest in
1931, and a screen test brought his first role in ``The Black
Camel,'' a Charlie Chan mystery. Signed by MGM, Young soon appeared
in an extraordinary number of films in the early 1930s _ in the
course of four years he appeared in 24 pictures, playing serious
roles in many of them.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in such films as ``The Sin of Madelon Claudet''
(with Helen Hayes), ``Hell Divers,'' ``Strange Interlude,''
``Tugboat Annie,'' ``The House of Rothschild'' and ``Today We
Live.''

<P>
   Slowly, Young forged a career not so much as a top movie star,
in the vein of Clark Gable or Gary Cooper, but as a dependable
actor whom audiences enjoyed watching. His co-stars included Greta
Garbo, Joan Crawford, Myrna Loy, Katharine Hepburn, Greer Garson,
Norma Shearer and Jean Harlow.
</P>
<P>
   Among his most noted pictures at MGM were ``Three Comrades'' and
``The Shining Hour'' (both made in 1938), ``Northwest Passage''
(1940) and two 1942 features, ``Joe Smith, American'' and ``Journey
for Margaret,'' in which he played a war correspondent who
befriends a British orphan. The film made Margaret O'Brien, who
played the orphan, a star.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most memorable performance was in RKO's 1945 love
story ``The Enchanted Cottage,'' in which young played a
battle-scarred war veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics said Young's later films were some of his best,
including ``Claudia'' (1943), ``Those Endearing Young Charms''
(1945), ``Crossfire'' (1947), ``Sitting Pretty'' (1948) and
``Goodbye, My Fancy'' (1951).
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a plodder,'' Young once said. ``My career never had any
great peaks. But producers and directors knew I was reliable. So
when they couldn't really get the big stars, they'd say, `Let's get
Bob.' As a result I always kept working, each time a little
higher.''

HOMER IS COMBINATION OF PHYSICS, STRENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ninth inning at 3Com Park. Close game, bases
loaded, Mark McGwire stepping in against Giants closer Robb Nen and
his 100 mph heat.
</P>
<P>
   It's a frightening scenario for the Giants, but probably just
what most fans are hoping to see when San Francisco takes on the
Cardinals and their fearsome slugger tonight and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   If McGwire can get a chance to take some cuts, and a few
technical details of energy transfer, aerodynamics and meteorology
fall into place, there's a good chance he could even loft a home
run into the faraway upper deck seats at 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   No one has done it before, but there's a first time for
everything. Unlikely though it may be, scientists and a Chronicle
review of stadium dimensions suggest it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire can do it,'' said Robert Adair, a Yale University
physics professor who held the title ``Physicist of the National
League'' from 1987 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it might unfold, based on estimates provided by Adair
and Drexel University physicist Donald Larson:
</P>
<P>
   If Nen's pitch starts at 100 mph, it will slow to about 90 mph
within the 0.8 seconds or so it takes to reach the batter's box.
For every 5 mph off that speed, the resulting hit will travel about
3.5 feet less distance, all else equal.
</P>
<P>
   To get it into the strike zone, the 6-foot-5 Nen has to pitch
the ball at a downward angle of about minus 10 degrees. To get the
ball out of the playing field, McGwire has to swing upward, at an
angle of about 20-25 degrees, so the ball starts at an angle of at
least 35 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 33-ounce Louisville Slugger will be traveling 70 to 75
mph if measured at the ``sweet spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a swing delivers about 10,000 pounds of force at the point
of contact, which lasts all of about 1/ 2000th of a second. Even if
he connects perfectly, most of the energy is dissipated in heat and
vibration. Both ball and bat heat up a bit, and the formerly round
baseball is momentarily crushed about one-quarter inch lopsided.
</P>
<P>
   Contacting the ball slightly below dead center helps generate a
backspin of about 2,000 rpm _ about the same speed as a standard
asynchronous motor _ as the ball takes off. The backspin generates
aerodynamic lift and perhaps about a 5 degree steeper flight path
as the ball moves higher.
</P>
<P>
   The initial speed of the ball off the bat is between 125 and 130
mph if it's a towering home run. It reaches a maximum altitude of
about 165 feet above the field. It stays in flight 6.2 seconds
before it reaches the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch just clears the upper deck at the left field foul line
in fair territory. Precise measurements taken by The Chronicle last
week show this to be a distance of 433 feet, 7 inches. The vertical
height is 56 feet, 6 inches at the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Such a home run would travel about 470 feet if allowed to return
to field level without hitting anything, assuming a steep fall of
about 60 to 70 degrees. That would be a prodigious shot, but within
McGwire's recent range _ he hit one at San Diego on Monday night
estimated at 458 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, no line drive would make it into the upper deck
at 3Com's left field. Calculations show it would have to leave the
bat at a screaming 132 mph, starting at a low 26 degree angle,
reach only 92 feet maximum height and take just 4.2 seconds to
reach the stands. Projected out to ground level, the distance would
be about 502 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire-style huge fly ball is more likely to do the trick _
but only if the park's notorious wind doesn't intervene. Every 10
mph of wind blowing in takes about 30 feet off the ball's flight.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologist Jan Null at Golden Gate Weather Services expects
``a typical summertime pattern'' for the Cards-Giants games.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures Wednesday night should be in the low 60s with
westerly winds gusting to about 20 mph, dying after dark. Expect
mostly sunny skies Thursday, temperatures in the low 70s, cooling
rapidly during the game as the seabreeze kicks in, wind gusting
again in the 20 mph zone.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures 10 degrees warmer allow the same home run to travel
about four feet farther, because the air molecules spread out and
generate less resistance on a warm day. Falling barometric pressure
also helps _ figure four feet more distance for each one inch drop
in the mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Such factors don't matter much when the ball is under a full
head of steam leaving home plate. But wind and weather wield a
mighty influence on the ball's endflight, often clipping the final
trajectory into nearly a dead drop.
</P>
<P>
   If the ball hits a blowing hot dog wrapper at 3Com, all bets are
off. But even if it doesn't collide with any airborne flotsam, the
flight path is not easily predicted, said Adair, the physicist.
</P>
<P>
   The flight path of a home run ``is not an ellipse or a hyperbola
or parabola or part of a circle,'' Adair said. ``It's a little more
complicated. But oh, it's a pretty thing.''
</P>

EXPERTS SAY MCGWIRE COULD HIT WHERE NO ONE EVER HAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDITORS: This is a sidebar to HOMERUNS)   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Those elusive upper deck seats beyond left field
at 3Com Park _ where no home run has ever landed before _ are well
within striking range of St. Louis slugger Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Even straightaway dead center may be closer than you think.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle enlisted a crackerjack team of baseball experts to
measure the potential for McGwire to reach the outer limits at
3Com. The experts included physicists, a baseball wonk, a licensed
land surveyor and a 14-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he can do it,'' said soon-to-be ninth-grader Aarde
Cosseboom, son of surveyor Peri Cosseboom and an ardent McGwire
fan. ``All he has to do is just nick fair territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of home runs have reached the upper deck in right field,
where the cheap seats are closer to the field and a hitter-friendly
wind sometimes blows. But the upper deck seats in left field have
been there since 1972, surviving such long-ball greats as Willie
McCovey and Dave Kingman with nary a dent.
</P>
<P>
   Peri Cosseboom, who helped map out the Candlestick skyboxes in
the mid-'80s, began the field work by setting up a Swiss-made
infrared distance gauge on top of home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The $25,000 device, which gives readings on both horizontal and
vertical distances, is accurate to within about one quarter of an
inch within a range of about 3,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretical home-run trajectories and distances were calculated
by Drexel University physicist Donald Larson (not the same Don
Larsen who pitched the perfect game in the 1956 World Series) and
Yale University's Robert Adair. Exploratorium physicist Paul
Doherty confirmed key results, aided by David Barker on the field.
</P>
<P>
   While his dad squinted through the viewfinder at home plate,
young Aarde and his mother, Carol, equipped with a two-way radio
and accompanied by a Chronicle reporter, traipsed around the outer
regions of 3Com lugging a six-foot metal staff topped with a
special reflective glass.
</P>
<P>
   Following the major-league rule book, all distances were
measured from the apex at the back of home plate.
</P>
<P>
   We first checked the distances down the line from home plate to
first and third. Ninety feet, on the button.
</P>
<P>
   Then we checked the signs on the outfield fence, quickly
discovering that the 400-foot marker in dead center is really just
397 feet 7 inches from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' said a Giants spokesman, offering no clue as to when
the sign might be repainted.
</P>
<P>
   The 365-foot signs in the power alleys turned out to be about
364 feet from home plate. Close enough, we figured. Distances at
the foul lines also proved to be accurate within a few inches.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the all-important left-field nosebleed sections.
</P>
<P>
   Results showed that even McGwire would have to strain to make
the upper deck anywhere near left-center.
</P>
<P>
   It's a prodigious 518 feet 11 inches to the right edge of the
scoreboard at bleacher level. A home run there would have to exceed
McGwire's record Busch Stadium blast of 545 feet earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the left field foul line, however, it's a mere 433
feet 7 inches. The railing at the front of the upper deck stands is
56 feet, 6 inches above the field.
</P>
<P>
   A ball hit that far, that high, would have to reach a height of
about 135 feet over left field. It would travel about 470 to 480
feet if the ball were able to complete its trajectory and land at
field level.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire would have to swing a little under the ball, generating
some backspin that would add a nice aerodynamic lift. That way, the
ball could leave his bat at about 35 degrees off horizontal, then
steepen to about 40-42 degrees as it neared the apex over left
field.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 40,000 fans all holding their breath might help, too.

FROM SOUTH-CENTRAL TO THE CENTER OF HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (For release Sunday, July 26)  
(lb) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The director F. Gary Gray was eating lunch in a
modest West Hollywood restaurant recently when a messenger arrived
with a document that needed urgent attention. As Gray scribbled his
name on the papers, three young men at the next table leaned over
to congratulate him, saying they had just attended an early showing
of his new movie, ``The Negotiator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, 28, smiled sheepishly, a bit embarrassed by all the
attention but obviously enjoying it. ``Stay grounded _ that's what
I keep saying to myself _ stay grounded, because there are more
things in this industry that are artificial than real,'' said the
director, who grew up in tough South-Central Los Angeles and came
to feature films through his directing of music videos for rap
artists.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Gray is soon going to have problems staying
grounded. After impressing critics two years ago with ``Set It
Off,'' an action drama about four desperate women who stage a bank
heist, he stands to attract even more attention for ``The
Negotiator,'' which opens on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey, the new movie deals
with two Chicago Police Department hostage negotiators who square
off when one of them, played by Jackson, becomes a hostage-taker
himself after he is the target of false accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The film is, in Spacey's words, ``like a locomotive _ it doesn't
stop moving,'' and early test screenings have been so successful
that Warner Bros., which is releasing the movie, is promoting it
blockbuster-style. ``Based on its previews, it'll do a tremendous
amount of business,'' said Robert Daly, co-chairman of Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who is as friendly as he is assured and ambitious, began
his career as a news cameraman, and then turned to directing music
videos for performers like Ice Cube, Mary J. Blige, Whitney Houston
and Coolio. It was this experience that led him into feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Gray quickly agreed to make ``The Negotiator,'' his third
feature, shortly after reading the script by James DeMonaco and
Kevin Fox. ``It was such a smart screenplay, and while I was
reading it, the visuals kept popping in my mind,'' he explained.
But making the movie wasn't quite so simple.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the project belonged to Walt Disney, and Sylvester
Stallone was offered the hostage-taker part. By all accounts,
Stallone insisted on major script revisions _ above all, he wanted
the other hostage negotiator to be a woman. Stallone was also not
especially interested in being directed by Gray, because of the
filmmaker's relative inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Disney eventually dropped the project, and it was picked up by
Warner Bros. Stallone departed, and the two actors whom Gray wanted
in the first place _ Jackson and Spacey _ read the script. By
chance, the two actors, who had appeared briefly together in 1996
in ``A Time to Kill,'' then discussed the script at a party last
year at the home of Ed Limato, a prominent agent at International
Creative Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin and I really enjoyed the scene we had,'' Jackson said,
referring to ``A Time to Kill.'' ``We talked about `The
Negotiator.' He said, `If you do it, I'll do it.' It was as simple
as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that what appealed to him especially about the
script was its lack of convention for an action drama. ``The fact
is, you have two guys who are negotiators, who use words as opposed
to shooting each other,'' he said. ``Each page has dialogue and not
a lot of descriptive action. It was unusual that way. You don't
find that in action films. It had the right combination of tension
and verbal jousting.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey said that preparations for ``The Negotiator'' were
unusual in that he and Jackson worked on the screenplay for several
weeks with the two writers and the director. ``We were paying
attention to all the details that sometimes get stripped in movies
like this,'' he recalled. ``We wanted characters that were more
than cardboard cutouts _ and not just our characters but all of
them.'' Other members of the cast include J.T. Walsh, who died in
February, Ron Rifkin and Regina Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Gray seems alternately confident, bemused and
jittery about his career now. Only 14 years ago, he was a bit of a
wayward kid in South-Central Los Angeles. His parents had divorced.
He lived with his mother, a secretary; his father lived in Chicago
and worked at an Army base. An uncle, Phil Lewis, an actor, was
staging a show called ``The African American,'' about the black
experience, and issued an invitation to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like, `You need to see this play with your little
brother,' and I'm like, `Tough guys don't see plays,''' recalled
Gray. ``I finally decided to go, and I was blown away. I knew then
and there that there was something there for me. I became a
stagehand, worked behind the scenes, did the lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's parents decided that he should leave Los Angeles and live
with his father in Chicago so he could attend Highland Park High
School, a respected public high school. There, Gray immersed
himself in the visual arts, and began to yearn to be a director.
``It's a great school; I wish more public schools were like that,''
said Gray. ``That school really made it possible for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved back to Los Angeles, partly to enter Los Angeles City
College, which he attended for a year, but mostly to pursue the
notion of being a director. ``What I was taught at high school was
not so much to dream but to set realistic goals that you can
clearly define,'' he said. ``Dreams are very lofty, but there are
solid steps you have to take in order to achieve each goal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His first job was on a camera crew that filmed Stevie Wonder
receiving an award. That was followed by freelance jobs at cable
networks like E, CNN and Black Entertainment Television.
</P>
<P>
   At 23, having saved some money, he tried to make a short film
about gang violence. It was never completed, because of financial
problems, but it led to lots of work directing music videos, and
lots of recognition: His video ``Fantastic Voyage,'' with Coolio,
earned Gray the 1995 Billboard Music Video Award for Best Rap
Video. That same year he was a four-time winner at the MTV Music
Video Awards.
</P>
<P>
   His music videos clearly helped him develop the style that he
brings to feature films. ``I took a storytelling approach to almost
all my music videos,'' he said. ``I shot a beginning, middle and
end. I used cranes and steady cams, and a lot of my earlier videos
had dialogue in them. It was great for me. I was given the
resources to do little films.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the rapper Ice Cube offered Gray money so that the
director could rewrite and complete a short dramatic film he had
been working on. ``But then he said, `Instead of me giving you
money to finish a short film, why don't we do a feature film.' And
I said, `Yes, this is what I've been dreaming of.'''
</P>
<P>
   His feature debut, ``Friday,'' a comedy about surviving life in
South-Central, starred Ice Cube and Chris Tucker. Although it was
dismissed by critics as a slight frivolity, it was one of the more
profitable films of 1995, grossing $30 million after having been
made for $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Set It Off,'' which starred Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah and
Vivica A. Fox, seized the attention of studio executives and
producers. The modest film, about some black women who decide to
rob a bank after struggling in vain to carve out meaningful lives,
reached beyond the action-drama genre and emerged as a big hit for
New Line. It led directly to ``The Negotiator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone else directing `Set it Off' could have made an
exploitive film,'' said David Hoberman, who produced ``The
Negotiator'' with Arnon Milchan. ``But Gary created a work in which
all women were complex characters and were far from stereotypical.
The film had momentum. After seeing `Set It Off,' I knew Gary could
do `The Negotiator.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gray is aware of himself as a black filmmaker in the
predominantly white world of Hollywood, he is young enough for
racial barriers not to have been much of a factor in his career, he
believes. ``I didn't face the same challenges that I'm sure Spike
Lee had to face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Friday,'' his debut, Gray was offered several movies
unrelated to race, but he chose ``Set It Off'' because, he
recalled, it had the best script. And although Jackson, one of the
most prominent black movie stars, is a lead actor in ``The
Negotiator,'' racial issues are not a component of the new movie.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, taking on ``The Negotiator'' was obviously a major
leap for the young filmmaker: the budget of ``Set It Off'' was $6
million; ``The Negotiator'' cost $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   The higher stakes didn't make Gray change his on-set style,
though. ``What surprised me was his ability to listen to people _
and then make his own decisions,'' said Hoberman. ``I really don't
know a lot of young directors who have the ability and personal
confidence to ask the actors, the producers, members of the crew,
`What do you think?' He really listened, and then he made his own
decision. There's a very strong sense of maturity about Gary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said that ``Dog Day Afternoon,'' the 1975 Sidney Lumet
film, influenced him as he was making ``The Negotiator.''
``Obviously these are two totally different films,'' he said, ``but
that was a great hostage movie. And that film must have been an
amazing challenge. How do you manage to feel totally sympathetic to
the Al Pacino character, a bank robber who's trying to get money
for a sex-change operation for his gay lover?'' He laughed. ``They
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's background in music videos still shapes his approach to
movie making. While reading the script for ``The Negotiator'' _
over and over again, even during the filming _ and while blocking
out scenes, he listened to music. ``I'll listen to music and read
the script and I feel propelled, I'll start typing really fast,
type out the definition of a scene, where the characters are, the
visual approach,'' he said. ``Music sparks something in me _ I
don't know what.'' The music, he said, ranged from Marvin Gaye to
Bach.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful that he'll listen to much Bach for his next film,
which he wants to be ``a really eerie, tense movie,'' he said. To
avoid being pigeonholed, he wants to move from genre to genre.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the genre, he's trying to avoid being the sort of
director who becomes successful and turns into a megalomaniac. ``I
just don't understand this need to abuse people,'' he said. ``If
someone is like that, then it was in them in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who is unmarried, recently moved into a new home in the
San Fernando Valley. But he gave his old home to his mother and his
older sister, who works in the insurance business. ``I want them
close; they're a good source of reality,'' Gray said with a grin.
``They keep me honest. And sane.''

SCIENTISTS SCRUTINIZE POSSIBILITY THAT MARK MCGWIRE WILL BREAK 
 RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDITORS: This story has two sidebars, slugged UPPERDECK
and  HOMER)   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Did birds evolve from dinosaurs? Is there life
in outer space? Will Mark McGwire break the home-run record?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though it might not seem on par with the other major questions
of the age, the possibility that the St. Louis Cardinals slugger
will surpass 61 home runs in a season is inspiring a level of
scientific scrutiny worthy of a NASA moon shot.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists are obsessing over the dynamics of the ball-bat
collision. Statisticians are recalculating probability
distributions after every game. Psychiatrists are poring over
post-game interviews for hints of ``success neurosis.''
</P>
<P>
   They will soon have data from San Francisco to add to the mix,
as the former Oakland Athletic baseball player prepares to take the
field here. Big, friendly crowds are expected _ 30,000 Wednesday
and 40,000 &UR;  &LR; Thursday, double the usual turnout for weekday games at
3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   At his current pace, McGwire would break the record by early
September, easily eclipsing Roger Maris of the New York Yankees,
who hit 61 in 1961, when he surpassed the immortal Babe Ruth, who
hit 60 in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   It's perhaps the most hallowed record in all sports _ serious
business for practitioners of the art of baseball analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I update my spreadsheets every night,'' said Gene Sunnen, an
Oakland businessman, general manager for the 1988 Watertown Pirates
in the short-season Class A New York-Penn League and a former
national president of the Society for American Baseball Research.
``It's one of my great joys in life.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, theoretical
physicist Porter Johnson has been setting aside his full-time
studies of high-speed subatomic particle collisions to ponder the
aerodynamics of McGwire's awesome taters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get the right spin on the ball,'' Johnson
said, noting that McGwire's ferocious uppercuts _ bat speeds
approaching 75 mph when measured at the bat's sweet spot _ generate
ball speeds of 120 mph or more at launch.
</P>
<P>
   Drexel University physicist Donald Larson built an elaborate
home-run distance-measuring program, which he loaded into his
laptop and brought with him to Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium for
a recent Phillies-Cards game.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, said the disappointed professor, ``McGwire didn't
hit any home runs that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle architect-consultant John Pastier is still refining his
estimate of a memorable home run McGwire hit off Mariners
fireballer Randy Johnson last year at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium officials pegged it at 538 feet _ right up there with
some record breakers, although it's hard to say exactly because
home-run distances are notoriously fuzzy and have not been
systematically recorded until recent years. Pastier estimated
McGwire's Kingdome homer at 470 feet. Reliable estimates,
meanwhile, put a McGwire homer at Busch Stadium in May at 545 feet,
one of the longest home runs in history.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Mantle's famed 562-foot dinger that sailed out of
Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C., was likely hit only about 510
feet, according to calculations by Robert Adair, a retired Yale
University professor and one of the nation's top experts on the
physics of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear to have measured the distance to where the ball
stopped rolling,'' Adair said. ``It always helps a home-run hitter
when his team happens to employ a publicist without a lot of
scruples.''
</P>
<P>
   Calculating the distances McGwire has been reaching makes up
just one subspecialty in the new science of the long ball.
Statisticians also are having a field day.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, having hit 43 home runs so far, finished last night's
game in San Diego on pace to hit 71 by the end of the season,
according to the charts appearing in nearly every sports section in
America.
</P>
<P>
   That's accurate, as far as it goes. But does that mean McGwire
really is a shoo-in to surpass Maris and Ruth?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, said Scott Page, an economics theorist and ``huge
Tigers fan'' at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Projecting what will happen during the rest of the season based
solely on the home runs McGwire has hit so far is ``linear
extrapolation'' that assumes no change in the frequency of home
runs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit like predicting a coin that landed heads-up five
times in a row will land heads up the next five flips, too. Maybe
it will, maybe it won't.
</P>
<P>
   In McGwire's situation, you have to look deeply into such things
as career vs. seasonal percentages, intentional walks,
psychological factors and team standings and schedules in order to
compute the odds.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, McGwire has been hitting one home run in every
7.1 at-bats, nearly a dinger every other game assuming three to
four chances per outing. Easily enough to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   A safer forecast, though, might be based on McGwire's career
rate of one homer per 11.5 at bats. At that pace, he would hit 17
more this year _ and would tie Ruth for second place.
</P>
<P>
   But consider that McGwire clearly has taken his power-hitting to
a new level for the past three seasons. Over this latest long
stretch, he's been consistently hitting a home run every &UR;  &LR; 9.1
chances.
</P>
<P>
   That pace would give McGwire about 24 more home runs, &UR;  &LR; plenty to
beat the record for the season. All things considered, Page figures
there is at least an 85 percent probability that McGwire will do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides an injury, another factor that could sour his chances
would be if opposing managers avoid pitching to McGwire, who
already has 22 intentional walks. The full-season record is 45, set
by the Giants' Willie McCovey in 1969. Maris, batting ahead of
Mickey Mantle, evidently wasn't intentionally walked at all in
1961; the statistic wasn't recorded in Babe Ruth's era.
</P>
<P>
   Big crowds are coming out to witness every McGwire swing, adding
some pressure on managers to give him some chances, particularly if
St. Louis stays out of playoff contention and games late in the
season do not affect the standings of opposing teams.
</P>
<P>
   Even if circumstances prevent McGwire from breaking the record,
Sunnen maintains that his phenomenal home-run percentages already
place him in the front ranks of baseball deities.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth hit a home run every 8.5 at bats during his peak year.
Maris went long every 9.7 at bats in his storybook season. McGwire
is well ahead of them both in terms of consistent power hitting,
and he is clearing fences nearly five times the 1998 average for
major league players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the greatest home-run hitter in baseball history,''
Sunnen said. ``It's his home-run frequency that's off the charts.
He's hitting them faster than the Babe ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   The big unknown is whether McGwire will fade in the stretch,
perhaps allowing the intensifying media pressure to shake his
legendary concentration. He has already taken to limiting questions
about the home-run record, and complained at one point this season
that he felt ``like a caged animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Leary, a University of California at San Francisco
professor and psychiatrist at San Francisco General Hospital, said
he is on the lookout for signs that stress might be starting to get
to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he seems to be holding up well, Leary said, adding that
McGwire's decision to limit interviews on the Maris-record subject
``is a healthy move.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His maturity is going to be helpful,'' Leary said. ``He also
appears to be quite a disciplined person in how he approaches
batting. He doesn't swing at bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Leary wonders what might happen as McGwire starts closing in on
60 home runs and the ghost of Babe Ruth starts to appear every time
he steps to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts call it ``success neurosis'' _ the disabling fear that
can strike just on the verge of reaching a lifelong goal. It could
happen to anybody, even big-league athletes.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire says he just wants to win games and help his team. Even
so, the home-run record is something truly special for anyone in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody but McGwire knows ``what it means to him personally, how
it works into his own personal psychology,'' Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where it's possible he could have some problems as he
gets closer. It may affect him in ways that are hard for us to
predict _ it could be detrimental, or he could really rise to the
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has seemed a bit testy lately, which Leary finds a
worrisome sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if he's a little brittle about it,'' the psychiatrist
said. ``He might be a bit more tightly wound than might be
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   He also might have the good sense to just forget about it and
get out there and have some fun.
</P>
<P>
   Batter up.

MONDAVI SETTLES ESPY CHARGES  
 BY PETER SINTON 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - REVERSE, EMBARGOED FOR MONDAY AMS OF JAN.   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Mondavi Corp. agreed to pay $150,000 yesterday to settle
charges that it illegally wined and dined a former Clinton cabinet
official to the tune of $394.
</P>
<P>
   The Napa Valley winery acknowledged that in October 1993 it gave
six bottles of its reserve wines worth $187 to former Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy at the request of Espy friend and former
Sun-Diamond Growers lobbyist Richard Douglas. It also admitted to
paying for an American Wine Appreciation Week dinner valued at $207
for Espy and his girlfriend the following March.
</P>
<P>
   For these transgressions, Mondavi agreed to pay $100,000 in
civil damages to the U.S. Treasury and contribute $20,000 to defray
the cost of Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz's investigation. It
also earmarked $30,000 to increase corporate awareness of laws
prohibiting gratuities to public officials.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Since 1994, Smaltz has been investigating approximately
$35,000 worth of illegal gratuities allegedly offered to Espy. So
far, the independent counsel has won about a dozen convictions and
recovered close to $11 million in civil penalties and criminal
fines.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  During Espy's visit to the Mondavi winery and the dinner in
Washington, D.C., the independent counsel said that Espy and
Mondavi officials discussed government funding to combat the grape
vine-eating pest Phylloxera as well as to promote the marketing of
wine and the health benefits of moderate wine consumption.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  They also talked about trade issues related to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Given the company's dealings with Espy and his department,
Mondavi and its employees were banned under federal law from
providing ``anything of value'' personally to Espy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Besides the gratuities, Smaltz said that Espy received a note
from a senior Mondavi official inviting him visit the winery and
use its guest house anytime.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our people made an error of judgment when pressured to
provide wine for Espy's personal use,'' said winery President
Michael Mondavi. ``We have learned from that mistake and we look
forward to improving the way our company and our industry deal with
government agencies.''

WELLS FARGO PROFITS STAMPEDE 48% IN 2ND QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - WELLS   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. announced yesterday a 48 percent jump in profits
in the second quarter from year-earlier levels, with most of the
gain coming from reduced expenses.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loan volume and deposit balances at the West's second-largest
bank actually declined.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, which recently announced plans to merge with Norwest
Corp. of Minneapolis but keep its name and headquarters in San
Francisco, reported $337 million in net income for the past three
months ($3.91 per share) compared with $228 million ($2.49) in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Paul Hazen said small-business and middle-market
lending, auto leasing and capital markets ``have been especially
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   However the bank's net interest income of $1.15 billion in the
past quarter was up just $24 million over the previous quarter and
matched year-earlier results. In addition, average core deposits
and assets have dropped 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively,
during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, noninterest income in the second quarter was $735
million compared with $726 million in the first quarter and $679
million in the second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Loan, credit card, ATM fees and other charges increased 16
percent during the year to $272 million in the past quarter. But
most of the noninterest income increases resulted from the $58
million gain on the sale of the bank's mortgage servicing business.
</P>
<P>
   Noninterest expenses fell $149 million, or 12 percent, to $1.1
billion in the most recent quarter. A year ago, expenses were way
up because of computer glitches and other problems caused by the
bank's rushed integration with First Interstate Bancorp.
</P>
<P>
   Wells continued to cut payroll in the past quarter. It had
31,620 employees at the end of June compared with 32,414 three
months earlies and 33,216 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it was a decent quarter,'' said Van Kasper analyst
Joseph Morford. ``There was strong commercial loan growth,
improving asset quality and Wells has stabilized customer service
problems. The only disappointing note was some deposit runoff after
a couple quarters of increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells' earnings beat analysts' estimates by about 11 cents per
share, but the bank's stock dipped $10.38 yesterday to close at
$369.63.
</P>
<P>
   In other banking earnings, Chase Manhattan said income rose 16
percent to $1.1 billion. Citibank reported $1.1 billion in profit,
up 8 percent. And BancOne reported $487 million in profit, 10 times
higher than a year ago, when acquisition-related costs hurt
profits.

STREET SMARTS/MARK VEVERKA  
 TOP EXECUTIVES AT BORDERS SELLING A HEFTY CHUNK OF THEIR STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - STREET SMARTS   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Top executives at Borders Group, the brick-and-mortar retailer that
was a Johnny-come-lately to selling books, music and merchandise
over the Internet, have decided to unload a substantial amount of
stock in the company.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six top executives _ including the chairman and CEO of the Ann
Arbor, Mich., retailer _ filed to sell more than 1.1 million shares
between April 3 to June 1 at prices as high as $34, according to
CDA/Investnet, a financial research firm in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The insiders opted to part with their shares just as Borders'
story was starting to get rosier. Borders is the nation's
second-largest seller of books, but it was the last among the
big-three booksellers to hawk books over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Borders' top execs from cashing in some
chips at a critical juncture for the company: the long-overdue
launch of its online operations.
</P>
<P>
   Borders still has a ways to go to catch Amazon.com in the online
race. Amazon of Seattle was first, and it has been one of the stock
market's Internet darlings ever since it went public in May 1997.
Its stock has soared more than fourfold since the beginning of this
year, closing yesterday around $132. And it has arguably been the
most successful online retailer to date.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line was Barnes and Noble. In an attempt to catch up,
Barnes and Noble launched its online operation about a year ago.
The New York-based operator of some 485 bookstores is expected to
rack up online sales of about $1 million for the inaugural year of
its Website. That compares with $500 million in projected revenues
for Amazon this year, which would more than double last year's
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' stock also has its Internet mojo working. Its shares are
trading at around $45, up 50 percent from the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Borders, the last one in the pool, launched its
online operations in May and expects revenues generated from
electronic commerce not to exceed $25 million by the end of the
year, according to Marilyn Horn, its director of investor
relations.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Borders' brass filed to sell their shares right
around the time that the company was unveiling its Web site.
Chairman and CEO Robert DiRomualdo sold 288,850 shares, trimming
his stake (stock, options and warrants) to around 2.3 million
shares, Horn says.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Vice Chairman George Mrkonic shed more than
630,000 shares, cutting his position to around 1 million shares,
Horn says. Four other insiders accounted for the remaining 120,000
shares sold.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of funny, isn't it? Wall Street analysts, who rely
heavily on the CEO for information and guidance in their research,
love Borders. In fact, all 12 analysts who follow Borders recommend
the stock to their clients as a ``buy,''according to Bloomberg L.P.
</P>
<P>
   So what did the company chieftains do? They dumped a boatload of
shares.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Borders' Horn says that the executives remain
confident in the future performance of the company's stock. They
merely sold off shares, she says, to pay certain tax and debt
liabilities that they owed on shares that they were awarded. Most
of the executives had opted for stock instead of cash wages,
getting little or no salary for the past three years, Horn
explains.

FIRM'S SCORCHING NEW INVENTION  
 BY DAN FOST 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - FIRE   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new fire-resistant paint designed to prevent flames from
engulfing a house was put to the test Sunday in suburban Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Some walls of a wood-frame house in Washougal, Wash., were
painted with Firefree 88 from San Rafael-based International Fire
Resistance Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Then a fire was set. When flames blew out the windows,
firefighters rushed in to end the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fire destroyed part of a room, the walls coated
with the new product were charred but still structurally sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real impressive,'' said Larry Saari, captain with the
Washougal Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   In other tests, the paint also was applied to mahogany paneling,
cedar shake shingles and flammable ceiling tiles. In all cases, the
surfaces were charred or bubbled up but were not incinerated in
seconds, as were surfaces that were left untreated.
</P>
<P>
   After years of laboratory experiments, and with a patent
application pending, International Fire Resistance Systems now is
producing the new paint and expects to manufacture 1.5 million
gallons this year. The privately held company does not disclose
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm jazzed, actually doing it in the real world and seeing it
all come together,'' said company founder, chief executive and
part-owner John Simontacchi.
</P>
<P>
   The company claims that Firefree 88 can withstand temperatures
of up to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit. The paint sells for the
relatively high price of $50 a gallon and is available only to
contractors who have been licensed by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Simontacchi, a contractor for 27 years, was serving as an expert
witness in construction litigation cases when he saw a need for a
low-cost way to prevent fires from spreading in condominium
complexes &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He started working with a professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, and then with Early American Paints, which
is based in Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't find anything that worked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The few products available were for industrial applications,
according to Harlan Kline, technical services manager for Ameron,
an Orange County maker of industrial coatings. They were typically
expensive products to protect oil rigs, where the appearance of the
paint is not important, Kline said.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of paint-makers tout ``intumescent'' products that resist
fire, according to Lucho Mauricio, business agent for the
International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades in San
Francisco. But those products are designed for metal and don't
stick to the wooden walls when the fire heats up, Simontacchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Through much experimentation, involving part science and part
luck, a chemist at Early American Paints solved the adhesion
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Simontacchi and his team improved the paint's fire resistance by
incorporating ceramic technology similar to that used in the space
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   But the formula still had two problems: It was hard to apply,
and it didn't look good enough for residential use. So the team
kept tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, they had devised a method to add colors and a way
to apply it with a heavy duty, airless spray pump.
</P>
<P>
   Some home owners use the paint, which is manufactured only in
white, as is. Others tint it, paint over it or cover it with
wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   The company has four licensees in the Bay Area, including Phil
Bass, owner of Bay Area Painting in Castro Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Bass already has used Firefree 88 on some homes in Mill Valley,
and he now is putting it on a condo complex in Rohnert Park. He has
contracts lined up in San Jose and Santa Rosa, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really starting to take off,'' he said. ``People want
something that's going to make everything a little safer. Before
long, you're going to see great interest from the insurance
companies.''

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The temperature is hovering in the 90s as the
California sun starts to sink outside, but inside the Capitol
Records tower on Vine Street, it's dimmer and cooler as a tall,
elegant woman begins a torch song, her voice lingering like lotion
on the words ``Some days, it's too warm to find, a slow, hot
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Her face is unfamiliar, but her name is not. And as Monica
Mancini sings this half-forgotten song with lyrics by Norman Gimbel
and music by her father, Henry, from the ``Peter Gunn'' television
series, the old hands surrounding her in the studio nod at one
another and smile slowly in the conviction that Ms. Mancini's face
won't be so unfamiliar for long.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two decades as a studio and backup singer for
musicians as diverse as her father, Michael Jackson, Dolly Parton
and Vicki Carr, Ms. Mancini is embarking on a solo career, singing
her father's music. She is also recording her first solo album,
tentatively titled ``Fathers and Daughters,'' as the first artist
signed by PBS Records, a joint venture between Warner Brothers
Records and PBS, for release this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, it didn't occur to me to do his stuff before,
because he was here to do it,'' Ms. Mancini said of her father, the
prolific Hollywood composer, arranger and conductor, who died of
pancreatic cancer in 1994 at the age of 70. When she once proposed
that she might sing his songs with him in concert, she recalled
during a break in a recording session the other day, ``He said, `I
work alone, kid.' I also wasn't ready yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in her 40s and newly married to Gregg Field, a veteran
drummer for Frank Sinatra who anchors her band, Ms. Mancini said
she finally felt ready to take on signature songs like ``Moon
River,'' ``Two for the Road'' and ``Days of Wine and Roses.'' ``It
just seemed that all the energies came together,'' she said. So
far, the response has been positive. Reviewing her debut at the
Cinegrill nightclub here earlier this month, The Hollywood Reporter
declared simply, ``She's got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Singers from Natalie Cole to Hank Williams Jr. have parlayed
parental repertories into revived careers of their own, of course,
and Ms. Mancini's venture comes just as the cool, spare sound of
'60s composers like her father and Burt Bacharach is enjoying a
revival as ``lounge music'' for Gen X-ers. But she is taking no
chances, surrounding herself for this record with veteran
colleagues of her father, from the arranger and conductor Patrick
Williams to Terry Woodson, a former bass trombone player for
Mancini and now a conductor; last year he led a monthlong tour of
Japan in which Ms. Mancini first tried her hand at her father's old
songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a certain class to it and a certain style and a certain
feeling,'' Woodson said in trying to explain the enduring appeal of
the Mancini sound. ``They're beautiful melodies, and they have a
timeless thing about them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Ms. Mancini's mother, Ginny, who had her own 30-year career
as a ``session'' singer in Hollywood and a member of Mel Torme's
Mel-Tones, her daughter's breakout is exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been really trying to analyze this explosion that's
happened to Monica in the last few weeks, and it's almost as if
she's had all this inside her and now let her musical passion
explode,'' Mrs. Mancini said in a telephone interview. ``It's quite
extraordinary what's happened. It's almost spooky, because I get
the feeling Henry's somehow still there with a baton in his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Mancini, who made her professional debut with the
Henry Mancini chorus at Lake Tahoe, Nev., when she was 14, brought
a blown-up photograph of her father at the podium to her first
recording session this summer as inspiration. Her father, who
played the flute and piano, could not sing at all, ``would not even
try,'' as she puts it. But she said she ``knew from a really young
age what I was going to do, I was following in my mother's
footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mancini started at Colorado Women's College in Denver to be
near the ski slopes, but then got hired for a touring Las
Vegas-style show led by Peter Marshall, better known as the
avuncular host of ``The Hollywood Squares'' game show, and never
looked back. ``It was my first taste of the road, and I loved it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the recording session the other day, accompanied by George
Doering on a lone acoustic guitar, Ms. Mancini sang a plaintive
rendition of ``Dear Heart,'' the movie chestnut that became a huge
hit for Andy Williams, with the familiar Jay Livingston-Ray Evans
lyrics altered just a bit in memory of her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could kiss you hello, at our front door,'' Ms. Mancini
sang with a catch in her throat, ``my dear heart, I'd want you to
know, you'll leave my arms nevermore.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening in the small control room, seemingly on the verge of
tears himself, Field broke the silence, declaring proudly, ``That
kind of chilled the room out, didn't it?''

STRATUS COMPUTER TO LAY OFF 15 PERCENT OF WORLD WORK FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With no end in sight to the Asian economic crisis that is
choking its business, Stratus Computer Inc. says it would lay off
350 people, or 15 percent of its worldwide work force.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the job cuts will occur in Massachusetts, where
the company employs about 1,200 people, said Stratus chief
executive Bruce Sachs. Stratus plans to eliminate an additional 50
jobs through voluntary attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Stratus, based in Marlborough, Mass., makes powerful computers
that are designed for uninterrupted use, such as the systems that
run telephone networks or banks.
</P>
<P>
   Like many technology companies, Stratus has been hurt by the
Asian economic crisis, which has delayed decision-making by many
corporate customers. Historically, Stratus generates as much as 40
percent of its revenues in Japan and the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly can't change the economy over there,'' Sachs said
Wednesday. ``Because we don't see a change in the revenue picture
in the short term, we need to adjust our expenses accordingly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the layoffs, Stratus said it will take a
restructuring charge of $20 million, or about 83 cents a share, in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs added that Asia remains an important market for Stratus
and the company is well-positioned for growth once the economy
recovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to back off on our investment in the Far
East,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   News of the layoffs accompanied the release of the company's
quarterly financial results after the close of the stock market
Wednesday. The company had already warned investors last month that
it would record a loss for the second quarter, sending its stock
tumbling 24 percent. Wednesday its shares closed at 22 13/16, up
1/16.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, Stratus reported a loss of $10 million, or 42
cents per share, compared to a profit of $17.4 million, or 71 cents
a share, a year earlier. This year's second-quarter results
included a charge of $10 million, primarily to reserve for excess
inventory focused at Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the three-month period ended June 28 fell to $134.3
million, from $167.6 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the troubles in Asia, Sachs said business was good in
Europe, but weaker than anticipated in North and South America. The
company said it expects those business conditions to continue and
to hurt overall financial results in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said, ``We remain confident, nonetheless, that our core
value of continuous availability remains essential to the rapidly
growing market for mission-critical telecommunications and
financial services applications, and we will continue to invest in
these areas.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Stratus is well-positioned for the long term in our
strategic markets. We are confident of our ability to get the
company back on track and to become a more efficient and profitable
organization.''

DISTINCTIVE VOICES PAST AND PRESENT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Please note subslug for TEXACO-OPERA-QUIZ) 
(af) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A favorite stump-the-panel segment on the Texaco Opera Quiz
during the Saturday afternoon radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan
Opera is the ``singer ID.'' Recordings of, say, five unidentified
tenors singing the same phrase of a particular aria are played in a
row, and the panelists are asked to name them.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how difficult it can be to recognize the voices of
even famous tenors like Carlo Bergonzi or Giuseppe di Stefano. A
voice may be great without being that distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   But there are voices that seem immediately identifiable, one of
them being the heldentenor of the Canadian Ben Heppner, who will
sing his first Tristan in the Seattle Opera's new production of
``Tristan und Isolde'' on Saturday and who, along with other
distinctive singers of today, is represented in a batch of new
compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   No voice past or present, however, is more recognizable than
that of the Swedish tenor Jussi Bjoerling. Opera buffs can battle
over who the century's greatest tenor was, and Bjoerling would be a
definite contender.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, he is at least the century's most distinctive tenor.
No one else sounded quite like him, as I am reminded by ``The Jussi
Bjoerling Edition: Studio Recordings 1930-59,'' new from EMI
Classics (5 66306 2; four CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Bjoerling's sound is extraordinarily rich and radiant. Many
tenor voices share those attributes, of course, but the giveaway in
Bjoerling's case is the plaintive quality of his sound. According
to stereotype, Nordic voices are supposed to be cooler than Latin
voices.
</P>
<P>
   And at least in approach, Bjoerling's singing is Nordic: he
never engages in overt emotionalism, never allows the seamless flow
of his line to be broken by expressive indulgences. Yet even when
he is singing something cheerful, a hint of sadness, an aching
warmth, comes through, almost in spite of his manner. It's just
there in the sound.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, ``Questa o quella'' from Verdi's
``Rigoletto,'' which Bjoerling recorded in Stockholm in 1944, when
he was 33. Although he makes the Duke sound appropriately
lecherous, a touch of ache in the sound nearly melts you and makes
you want to find excuses for the character's womanizing: the Duke
is a sexual compulsive, a pathetic man fleeing his own insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bjoerling sings a truly sad aria, like ``E la solita
storia'' from Cilea's ``Arlesiana,'' recorded in 1947, also in
Stockholm, the effect is devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many superb singers today, it is still uncommon for a
voice to come along that could easily be identified on the Opera
Quiz. But there are some, as those new CDs attest.
</P>
<P>
   Heppner is the first true heldentenor to have appeared in some
time. His voice has the requisite thrust, stamina and power for the
hefty dramatic roles of the German repertory. What makes his sound
recognizable, however, is its color. Most heldentenor voices seem
built from the bottom up, with baritonal shadings even in the high
register. Heppner's sound has a tenorial quality from his beefy
bottom range to his ringing top.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors are evident in ``Dedication'' (RCA Victor
09026-63104-2), a program of songs by Beethoven, Schumann, Liszt
and Strauss in which Heppner is joined by Craig Rutenberg, a fine
pianist. A song recital might seem a risky venture for Heppner,
given the intimacy of the art form.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners may need time to adjust to the sheer impact of his
sound in these songs, even when he sings softly, which he does with
grace. But it is worth making the adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   As a new generation of recital singers emerges _ interesting
artists with lighter voices and a literate approach to song, like
the baritone Matthias Goerne and the tenor Ian Bostridge _
Heppner's work harks back to a time when major opera singers
unleashed their voices in lieder.
</P>
<P>
   The great German bass-baritone Hans Hotter and the Canadian
tenor Jon Vickers, for example, used to give larger-than-life
performances of Schubert and Schumann song cycles. Their
interpretations had charisma, and Heppner's have it, too. Yet
although Heppner brings his customary intelligence and subtlety to
these performances, the sheer presence of the voice sometimes
obscures the finer details.
</P>
<P>
   The Strauss and Liszt songs emerge as vibrant, impassioned,
visionary Romantic statements. Most impressive of all is the
performance of Beethoven's ``An die Ferne Geliebte,'' in which the
protagonist, anguished over a separation from his beloved, asks the
brook, the clouds, the birds and the wind to convey his messages.
</P>
<P>
   The work is not exactly a cycle but rather a set of six songs
linked by piano transitions into one continuous composition, with
the first song reprised in altered form as an epilogue. It takes
musicianly know-how like Heppner's to make the songs cohere as a
whole. But credit also goes to Rutenberg's sensitive and alert
playing, especially his cogent handling of those awkward
transitions. Heppner's singing is at once tender and formidable,
and in its colorations, truly distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   The great Lily Pons, with her lightness, agility, bright tone
and delicacy, probably set the standard and defined the style for
all the French coloratura sopranos who have followed. Now Natalie
Dessay has arrived to change all that.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dessay, a petite French soprano, just 32, shares qualities
with Pons and her national tradition. When she wants to, she can
sing with delicacy and a cool French restraint. But anyone who
heard her last fall at the Met, as Zerbinetta in Strauss' ``Ariadne
auf Naxos,'' knows that despite her diminutive stature, she has a
rich-textured voice with considerable carrying power.
</P>
<P>
   And it is uncommon for a coloratura soprano to combine, as she
does, brilliant agility and warm, affecting sound all the way from
her chest voice to the stratosphere, where she can toss off high Fs
and even Gs with seeming ease.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dessay's latest recording, ``Vocalises'' (EMI Classics 5
56565 2), is no doubt calculated for popular appeal. With the
Berlin Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Michael Schonwandt, Ms.
Dessay offers a program of lighter works and novelties, mostly
French, that allow plenty of opportunities for technical display.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several of the selections, like Rachmaninoff's ``Vocalise,'' pay
homage to traditional vocal exercises, or vocalises, in which
everything is sung on the syllable ``ah.'' But Ms. Dessay's
haunting performance will seduce you into thinking that the
Rachmaninoff is great music. Her sound is vibrant and lush, yet she
can sing finespun pianissimos with focused tone and hushed beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes an elaborate and unusual 14-minute concerto
for coloratura soprano and orchestra by the Russian composer
Reinhold Gliere, sung entirely as vocalise. Delibes' ``Filles de
Cadix'' is an enchanting little work in the style of a folk song,
with fancy coloratura flights, including a climactic high F sharp,
which Ms. Dessay sings exquisitely.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to hear Ms. Dessay in more substantial repertory,
her earlier EMI disks include a splendid recording of Mozart
concert arias. There is also an album of French arias, an
intelligent selection that includes a scintillating performance of
that Pons tour de force, the ``Bell Song'' from Delibes' ``Lakme.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to distinctive sound and style, Russian singers
tend to be a class unto themselves. But even among Russians, the
baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky has a particularly recognizable sound,
which, though hard to describe, is almost as hard to mistake.
</P>
<P>
   There is a gravelly quality to his tone, especially in the low
range, though grainy remnants of that color are present throughout,
even in his mellow midrange and poignant top voice. This is a
characteristic, not a flaw; it makes his singing sound earthy and
exceptionally mature for his age, 36.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hvorostovsky first made his name in Russian repertory,
major bel canto roles, including Riccardo in Bellini's
``Puritani,'' figured prominently in his early career. He has
worked extensively in the Italian tradition, even when his husky
sound might seem less than ideally suitable. He obviously believes
in what the Italian tradition can bestow in terms of legato line,
evenness of tone, and unforced production.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of his commitment came in his recent Philips recording
``Arie Antiche'' (289 456 543-2), a program of 17th- and
18th-century Italian arias and art songs, performed with the
Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, conducted by Neville Marriner.
</P>
<P>
   Hvorostovsky's singing here will not be to all tastes: he lacks
some agility in passage work, and at full voice he sometimes sings
with a muscular quality more characteristic of the Russian school.
But he is deeply drawn to this music, and the best of his work is
very fine, including some lovely accounts of Gluck arias and a
superb performance of ``Sorge infausta,'' an elegantly brilliant
aria from Handel's ``Orlando.''
</P>
<P>
   Hvorostovsky's latest Philips recording, ``Olga and Dmitri''
(289 454 439-2), is a program of arias and duets with another
Russian singer of strongly identifiable vocal color, the
mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina. Patrick Summers conducts the English
Chamber Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borodina's dusky-textured, flexible voice is a good match
for Hvorostovsky's earthy lyric baritone. In arias and duets from
Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Czar's Bride,'' they are stylistically
authoritative and vocally lustrous. A duet from Saint-Saens'
``Samson et Dalila'' also receives a dramatically powerful and
handsomely sung performance.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise here is the singers' commanding, fervent,
Italianate performances of selections from Donizetti's neglected
``La Favorita.'' The more dramatic bel canto repertory, like this,
suits them better than Rossini's ``Barbiere di Siviglia,'' which is
also represented here.
</P>
<P>
   Hvorostovsky is a little driven and humorless in Figaro's famous
``Largo al factotum.'' Rossini's barber and handyman is only
pretending to complain that everybody wants something from him;
actually, he loves his job. And Ms. Borodina's execution of
Rosina's effervescent roulades is somewhat mannered; in strings of
16th notes, she tends to overemphasize the first note of every
couplet. Yet overall, this is a rewarding disk from two distinctive
singers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, when it comes to unmistakable voices,
Bjoerling remains the standard-setter. For most of his mature
career, he recorded for RCA Victor, including many operas still
available. The most fascinating recordings from the new EMI
collection are from his early days. In the first and oldest
selection, ``Celeste Aida,'' recorded in 1936, the 25-year-old
tenor already sounds like nobody else, before or since.

BULLS TO NAME FLOYD COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is one large question hovering above Chicago this morning.
And it is not: Who is Tim Floyd? Rather: What about Michael?
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls are prepared to name former Iowa State coach
Floyd their coach. The team is expected to announce Thursday that
Floyd will succeed Phil Jackson as the head man of the six-time NBA
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd _ the man Michael Jordan said he couldn't play for and the
man Jackson referred to as ``Pink'' _ arrived in Chicago Wednesday,
only hours after resigning from Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't comment any further right now,'' Floyd said
when approached by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably the last thing Bulls fans want to hear. The city
was in a frenzy exactly one week ago when Jordan gave an impromptu
press conference in suburban Chicago after playing a round of golf.
At that time, Jordan reiterated that the only coach he wanted to
play for was Jackson. He also said he didn't want to play on
another team. Based on those words, it appears Jordan's brilliant
career is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael needs to take his time and see how all of the pieces
fall into place,'' said David Falk, the powerful agent who
represents Jordan. ``We only have one piece of the picture. It may
be that piece is of sufficient weight to outweigh everything else.
Only time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Jordan was spending his time doing something that he
may do with more frequency if he retires: playing golf. He did not
respond publicly to news of Floyd's resignation. But his words from
July 16 still resonate: ``I don't know Tim. I don't have anything
against Tim Floyd. To (play for him) is like starting all over
again, and that's what I don't want to do. He may want to do that,
but I don't. I don't condemn him. I don't condemn (the Bulls) for
hiring him. But I just don't feel that I want to start with someone
who really doesn't know me and doesn't know the way I play the game
of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   So the drama is set. Floyd, a fishing buddy of Chicago general
manager Jerry Krause, is putting himself in an unenviable position.
He could be known as The Man Who Pushed Jordan Away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows the story of the toad that got the princess to
kiss him, so hopefully, it will work out,'' said Bulls center Bill
Wennington, holding out hope that Jordan will return. The
consensus, though, is that the Bulls will be radically different in
1998-99. Jordan's departure would probably preclude the return of
Scottie Pippen. And Dennis Rodman, who called the potential hiring
of Floyd ``a joke,'' is most certainly gone. It may be the same
story for many of the Bulls, whose number includes nine free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a near-expansion situation for Floyd, who
accumulated 243 wins as a head coach at Iowa State, the University
of New Orleans, and Idaho. Friends of the 44-year-old native of
Hattiesburg, Miss., initially predicted he would stay at Iowa State
because he didn't want to be known as the coach who forced out
Jordan. Obviously, that is no longer a concern.
</P>
<P>
   The news out of Chicago has created a buzz around the NBA. Teams
such as the Pacers and Heat now believe they are the ones to
conquer in the Eastern Conference. And in the West, the Jazz and
Lakers have to like their chances of winning a title. The hiring of
Floyd also has to affect the psychology of other coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Celtics coach and president Rick Pitino said he
didn't think many teams could sign Antoine Walker. He was fearful
that the Bulls _ without Jordan, Jackson, Pippen, and Rodman _
could be in position to sign Walker to a long-term contract. Now
the Bulls could be in position to not only take the Celtics' best
player but those of other teams as well. They will be significantly
under the salary cap if they don't re-sign any of their free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   The only stable thing about the Bulls now is that they have a
coach. They don't know if all their assistants will return. And
they don't know if all their players will return, No. 23 most
notable among them.
</P>

ECONOMIC SCENE: BATTLE OVER RIGHT TO SUE HEALTH GROUPS ISN'T GOING
AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With congressional Democrats and Republicans jockeying fiercely
for the high political ground on patients' rights, there is a good
chance that efforts to clamp down on abuses in managed medical care
will come to naught this year. But it's a sure bet that at least
one issue of contention, the right to sue health maintenance
organizations for malpractice, will be back on Congress' agenda
very soon.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the quarter-century-old bar to suits against
medical insurers is, on its face, outmoded because managed care
virtually guarantees that insurers as well as doctors have a role
in choosing treatment. For another, the shield is apt to be
breached anyway, as frustrated judges look for ways to hold HMOs
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a novel proposal by Jeffrey O'Connell and James Neale
of the University of Virginia Law School is so timely. Indeed,
while their ``early offer'' approach to giving both sides potent
reasons to settle malpractice suits seems most relevant to the
managed care controversy, it offers equal promise for coping with
traditional doctor-patient litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Employment Retirement and Income Security Act of
1974, or Erisa, shields fiduciaries that administer health care
against negligence suits. The idea was to encourage employers to
offer this vital fringe benefit by protecting them against injury
claims where they had little control over the wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
   But with managed care the rule these days, the shield seems
unfair. Why should a patient be able to sue a doctor who denies him
adequate care, but not the insurance company that ordered the
doctor not to provide the care?
</P>
<P>
   Why, indeed? A few years ago, when premiums were rising at
double-digit rates and health care inflation threatened to eat the
Federal budget alive, policy makers were quietly relieved to have
this inconsistency on the books. But now that cost-cutting is out
of vogue and jokes about drive-through heart transplants ring
hollow, Democrats have added the right to sue to their ``patients'
bill of rights'' wish list.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, O'Connell said, is that the tort system is an
inefficient way to compensate injury victims. And that goes double
for medical malpractice, where the issues are more technical.
``Juries have enough trouble figuring out who is at fault in auto
accidents, let alone failed surgical procedures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By no coincidence, a host of studies have shown that most
successful malpractice suits are unjustified while the vast
majority of those injured by medical procedures never see a penny _
or are compensated many years after the fact. Even so, 60 to 70
cents of every dollar paid in malpractice insurance premiums is
spent fighting over claims.
</P>
<P>
   In O'Connell's view, simply extending liability to insurers
assures more of the same. But the most familiar alternative to the
negligence system, ``no fault'' coverage, has problems of its own.
</P>
<P>
   With no-fault auto insurance (which O'Connell pioneered in the
1970's), the injured are compensated for medical bills and lost
wages by their own insurance companies. And in the handful of
states that have also erected formidable legal barriers to suing
for intangible ``pain and suffering'' _ notably Michigan _ no-fault
has done a decent job of covering tangible losses while keeping
down insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connell argues that no-fault translates poorly into
malpractice coverage. While injuries resulting from auto accidents
can be more or less pinned down, it is often very difficult to
isolate the injury caused by a medical procedure: A patient with
cancer was treated and got sicker. What portion of the outcome was
caused by the cancer and what portion by the treatment?
</P>
<P>
   ``In Sweden, where they have no-fault malpractice,'' O'Connell
said, ``arbitrators make that decision. But that approach would
likely break down in our more litigious society.''
</P>
<P>
   A better alternative, he argues, is a system in which
malpractice defendants would have a relatively brief period _ say
four months _ in which to offer to cover plaintiffs' economic
losses, plus reasonable attorney fees in return for eliminating
their tort liability. Plaintiffs would be free to refuse the offer,
and probably would in cases of flagrant medical error. If they did,
though, they would be required to prove ``intentional or wanton
misconduct'' rather than simple negligence.
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost inevitable that malpractice liability will be
extended to managed care providers. That, in turn, will almost
surely lead to efforts to contain malpractice costs without denying
compensation to the most deserving.
</P>
<P>
   What worries O'Connell is that the lessons from the long,
tortuous history of no-fault auto insurance will be ignored in
redesigning malpractice. Unless great care is taken in changing the
incentives of both plaintiffs and defendants, he argues, reforms
intended to deliver swift, efficient justice will boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incentives aren't part of the problem,'' O'Connell said.
``They are the problem.'' &QL;

SO FAR, SO GOOD FOR WALL STREET COMPUTERS IN YEAR 2000 TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street's 10-day-old project to test how its
computers will cope with the transition to the new millennium moved
forward Wednesday to Jan. 3, 2000, the first trading day of the
next century, with no major glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone much better than we anticipated,'' said John
Panchery, Year 2000 project manager for the Securities Industry
Association. Indeed, yesterday, as on the earlier days that
simulated trading on Dec. 29, 30, and 31, 1999, the only problems
that cropped up involved miscommunication unrelated to the date
between the various computers set up for the testing.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully scripted project, which began July 16, covers
stocks, options, corporate and municipal bonds and securities known
as unit investment trusts. Although the simulation is no more than
a low-volume rehearsal for a much broader trading test next spring,
computer experts around the world are scrutinizing the test because
it involves 29 brokerage firms, all major stock exchanges and the
corporations that clear and process trades for them. The $270
billion securities industry is the first to move beyond individual
companies testing their own computers and programs toward testing
conditions where computers link many different businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The participants have been looking for signs of electronic
foul-ups that could occur if computers or programs running on them
fail to recognize that the first days of the year 2000 come after
the last days of 1999. The problem is a vestige of the once-common
programming technique of using just two digits to refer to the year
in dates _ 98 for this year, for example. Many programs do not
recognize that 00, for the year 2000, or 01, for 2001, represent
valid, later dates than the 99 they see for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 problems can result in inaccurately generated data,
faulty calculations and computer shutdowns. In some cases,
computers may function normally when confronted with a date in 2000
but fail to restart after being shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The testing is scheduled to continue with a simulation of Jan.
4, 2000, for mutual funds and Jan. 22, 2000, an options expiration
date, but the test yesterday was considered the last big question
mark by many of the participants in this preliminary round. Not
only did it simulate the first day when trades will be entered in
the new century, but it also covered the final step of the
three-day clearing and settlement process for many trades initiated
on the first day of testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are feeling good,'' said Leslie Tortora, chief
information officer and managing director at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
``An enormous amount of energy and preparation has gone into making
this successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The trading systems tested this month are only some of many that
will have to function well for Wall Street to sail smoothly into
the new century, including those of businesses outside the industry
that supply electricity, telecommunications and other essential
services. Ms. Tortora said she hoped one of the benefits of the
project would be to encourage a similar effort by telephone
companies.

<P>
   ``I think we really don't want to politicize this heat wave by
trying to indicate that there is a cause that is not proven at
all,'' said the Texas Republican in an interview on C-SPAN's
Washington Journal program.
</P>
<P>
   The senator was asked about Gore's remarks in a July 16
Christian Science Monitor article in which the vice president
blasted Congress for ignoring the global warming issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much more proof do we need that global warming is real?''
Gore was quoted as saying as he advised lawmakers to ``go outside
and feel the temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison dismissed Gore's comments, saying ``actually the
science does not in any way indicate that we are in a global
warming because of anything that is in the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Actually we're in a cooling period. It's not a cool
cooling period but for the last 20 years we have been coming into a
cooling period from the high in the (19)40s when it really was from
natural causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, however, acknowledged that the sizzling Texas weather
had taken a serious toll on the state's agriculture industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is serious, and the sad thing is we really don't see
any relief,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Larry Haas said that the vice president was not
trying to politicize the issue. Haas said that, while no single
heat wave can be attributed to global warming, the country has
experienced record temperatures in 1997 and the last six months of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus of mainstream scientists is that humans are
having an effect on the climate. And, in light of all that, the
president and vice president feel strongly that Congress should
stop blocking their initiatives to address global climate change,''
Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Hutchison's office cited different sources
to prove their points about whether the Earth's temperature was
rising or falling.
</P>
<P>
   The White House produced a study by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center that
found 1997 to be the warmest year in this century, based on land
and ocean temperature data. One of the authors of the study
concluded the trend of upward temperatures likely was the result of
the increase in greenhouse gases due to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hutchison's office cited an article in the Dec. 4,
1997, Wall Street Journal by two chemists at the Oregon Institute
of Science and Medicine who claimed that global warming was a myth.
They said that during the past 20 years temperatures have tended to
go down, based on satellite data and measurements from weather
balloons. The authors wrote that long-term temperature increases
are likely due to changes in solar activity, not pollution.

SUCCESSFUL MOUSE CLONING BOOSTS RESEARCHERS' CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Researchers in Hawaii have created the first
identical copies of mice from adult mouse cells, erasing lingering
doubts about science's ability to clone mammals of different
species and providing a cheap but powerful tool for further cloning
research.
</P>
<P>
   Using techniques similar to those that produced the cloned lamb
Dolly but with important changes, the Hawaii researchers have
created three generations of genetically identical mice _ clones of
clones of clones _ totaling 50 individuals, the scientists said
Wednesday. The feat was all the more stunning because researchers
as recently as 10 years ago had found mice so difficult to clone
that they speculated it might be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The mice were created in the laboratory of Ryuzo Yanagimachi, a
renowned 69-year-old reproductive biology researcher at the
University of Hawaii's medical school. But at a press conference
here, he credited the idea and the ``hard work'' that produced the
mice to Teruhiko Wakayama, a young post-doctoral fellow from Japan
who has been working in Yanagimachi's lab.
</P>
<P>
   The first-born mouse clone, named ``Cumulina'' because she
sprang from a donor cell called a cumulus cell, and the 49 others
are all female. That is because the only adult mouse cell that the
researchers were successfully able to clone was the ``cumulus''
cell, which is found only in the ovaries of female mice.
Yanagimachi hinted that the researchers had solved the problem of
making male mouse clones, but would not confirm it because the work
has not yet been published.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement, documented in a report in the current Nature
magazine, is a long-awaited followup to the announcement more than
a year ago of the birth of Dolly, the first mammal cloned from an
adult cell, at the Roslin Institute in Scotland. Since that time,
some scientists had speculated that no one could replicate the
cloning of Dolly, and some had even questioned whether Dolly was an
authentic clone.
</P>
<P>
   But those worries have been laid to rest by the mouse cloning
report and also by two reports in Nature Biotechnology saying that
DNA fingerprinting has conclusively shown that Dolly was born from
a cloned adult mammary cell from a sheep. John Eppig, a mouse
reproduction specialist at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor,
Maine, said in a telephone interview that the mouse cloning was
welcome validation of the pioneering work of Scotland's Ian Wilmut,
who led the team that produced Dolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has repeated it _ and repeated it gloriously,'' said
Eppig. The scientists led by Yanagimachi have ``confirmed that the
excitement about what Wilmut did is justified.'' Moreover, he said,
the creation of the mouse clones emphatically showed that the
technique known as ``nuclear transfer'' that produced Dolly can
work in other species.
</P>
<P>
   The success in mice also confirms the stunning finding in the
creation of Dolly that an adult cell, which has gone through a
process of development that commits it to a specific role, such as
a nerve, bone or liver cell, can be ``reprogrammed'' to start life
all over again as an embryo cell. It is the reprogramming of the
adult cell's nucleus, which contains all its genes, that enables
scientists to create a new individual that is identical to the
adult from which the cell was taken.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishment has no direct implication for the contentious
debate over whether cloning humans should be attempted or
permitted. One scientist noted that in the process of making the
mouse clones many fetuses died or were malformed and for that
reason the technique shouldn't be tried in humans.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary accompanying the report in Nature, Davor Solter
of the Max Planck Institute in Germany hailed the cloning feat and
said being able to copy mice, with their short gestation period and
well-understood genetics, ``opens up the possibility of a broad
experimental analysis of mammalian cloning and of the factors that
determine its outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, mice are very cheap compared to the large farm
animals, and having them in genetically identical copies will speed
research in fundamental biology and drug development.
</P>
<P>
   James Robl, an animal reproduction scientist at the University
of Massachusetts in Amherst, said at the press conference that the
ability to clone mice will shift a great deal of basic research on
cloning to the rodents and away from larger animals like sheep and
cows, in which studying many key questions ``takes too long and
costs too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   Robl, who is a consultant to Advanced Cell Technology in
Shrewsbury and president of a recent spinoff, ACT Agriculture, said
that future uses of animal cloning include everything from making
many copies of outstanding meat- and milk-producing cattle to
creating animal and even human tissues for implantation into
patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Coleman, an official of PPL Therapeutics, a company that is
commercializing the technology used in creating Dolly, said that
among other things cloning could enable scientists to make cows and
sheep immune to diseases like BSE (``mad cow disease'') and
scrapie; to manufacture medically important antibodies in cows; and
to modify pig organs so that they could be implanted into human
patients without causing immune rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The international team headed by Yanagimachi included scientists
from the University of Tokyo; the Babraham Institute in Cambridge,
England; the University of Pavia in Italy, and the Jackson
Laboratory in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   As with Dolly, creation of the mouse clones involved, first,
plucking a cell from an adult that would be transferred into an egg
cell from the same species to make an embryo. Yanagimachi selected
three types of cells in the mouse that are known to be quiescent _
resting, rather than dividing _ and thus would be good candidates
for genetic ``reprogramming.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the cells _ a cell from the male testis and a brain cell
_ failed to produce viable offspring. But using the donor cumulus
cell from a female mouse ovary, the scientists succeeded.
Altogether, just 2 to 3 percent of the embryoes that were created
developed into live offspring.
</P>
<P>
   There are tens of thousands of genes in an adult cell, but only
a minority of them are ``turned on,'' or active, because the
remainder aren't needed for the cell's specific role. Until the
birth of Dolly, it had been biologic dogma that once a cell had
developed to this point, the silent genes in the cell's nucleus
couldn't be turned on again, and thus it would be impossible to
create a new individual from an adult cell. But the research that
yielded Dolly showed that in fact the cell's clock could be
rewound, its switched-off genes reactivated, and its nucleus used
to make an embryo capable of full development.
</P>
<P>
   Where Dolly's creator Wilmut had starved the donor nucleus in a
laboratory dish until it was forced into a non-dividing state,
Yanagimachi and Wakayama chose non-dividing cells to begin with.
And where Wilmut used an electric shock to insert the nucleus into
a recipient egg whose only nucleus had been removed, the Hawaii
researchers used a special micropipette to inject the donor nucleus
into the mouse egg cell to create the new embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi said he and his colleagues then immersed the embryo
in a chemical solution to activate the embryo _ that is, turn on
its genes. It was apparently in that short period of time that the
donor nucleus reprogrammed itself so that its genes were all able
to function and initiate the development of the fetal clones.
</P>
<P>
   After the embryo had divided a number of times, the embryo was
implanted into the uterus of a surrogate mother mouse to continue
development.

PRESIDENT ASKS SMITH TO STAY IN IRELAND THROUGH TRIP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has asked Jean Kennedy Smith, the
US ambassador to Ireland, to extend her stay through his September
trip to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Smith's younger brother, said the
president asked Smith to delay her departure from Phoenix Park for
another three months, through the end of September. Smith has
agreed to postpone her return and will stay in the job she has held
since the spring of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Smith had packed her bags and was planning to fly
back to her New York home next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reportedly wants to keep Smith in place because of the
delicate status of the Northern Ireland peace process and the
difficulty of naming her successor.
</P>
<P>
   Although a clear majority of citizens in both the Republic of
Ireland and Northern Ireland approved the peace accord reached on
Good Friday, splinter groups continue a campaign of sabotage
through terrorism. Three young boys recently burned to death when
their house was firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Mowlam, the British secretary for Northern Ireland, met
briefly with Kennedy Wednesday after a longer meeting with
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam said that progress was being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank the Senate, Congress, and the White House for not
being fair-weather friends,'' she said while posing for a
photograph with Kennedy and Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut
Democrat. ``It has been tough, and it will continue to be tough.
We've made a lot of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy praised Mowlam and British Prime Minister Tony Blair for
the roles they played in negotiating the peace accord.

GERMAN DEBATE ON HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL IS REKINDLED BY POLITICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Just nine weeks before national elections, a political
insurgent moving back to Germany from New York has injected a
question into the campaign that some thought taboo: should Germany
abandon its project to build a huge memorial to the Holocaust on
the ruins of Hitler's Third Reich?
</P>
<P>
   The insurgent, Michael Naumann, a prominent publisher who has
been a vocal player in the German takeover of American publishing
interests in New York, was nominated last weekend as the opposition
Social Democrats' cultural czar. He would assume the post if
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democrats are toppled in
the Sept. 27 election.
</P>
<P>
   In the few days since his selection, Naumann has stirred a fiery
debate. ``It is hard to see how you could smash much more china
than this man has done in just a few hours,'' Kohl said during a
campaign swing Wednesday among vacationers in northern German beach
resorts.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews and public appearances, Naumann _ who
said that his maternal grandfather was Jewish, but that he is not _
has raised the possibility that a Social Democratic government
would do what Kohl depicts as unthinkable and lay the memorial
project to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real memorials in Germany are the concentration camps,''
Naumann said in a telephone interview Wednesday night. The
projected memorial ``will not lead psychologically to what a simple
visit to Bergen-Belsen evokes in a more shocking manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, the huge monument sought by Kohl would
represent ``a memorial for memory, a suspension of guilt in art.''
And he accused Kohl of displaying a ``crude understanding of
historical memory, which thinks that things can be finished by a
modeled memory, and then you move on in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Naumann's earlier remarks in interviews with German newspaper
reporters and broadcasters drew criticism from some government
politicians but also evoked the deep ambiguities _ among German
Jews and within political parties _ surrounding one of the most
emotive debates confronting Germany more than a half-century after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democrat challenger to Kohl, said
Tuesday that he felt ``very close'' to Naumann's views. But some
Social Democrats said the issue should not be part of the election.
``This is not suited to an election campaign,'' said Peter Conradi,
a Social Democrat supporter of the monument.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's support for Naumann seemed intended to underscore
Kohl's discomfort at rising disputes associated with the project.
But it also reflected a marked, and possibly generational, shift
away from the inhibitions of Kohl's era.
</P>
<P>
   It elicited outrage from some German Jews, sympathy from others
and disdain from yet more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the great vision of the federal man of culture, and
if Naumann really has no greater concerns, then all I can say is:
poor culture,'' said Ignatz Bubis, head of the main representative
organization of German Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Since the idea of a memorial to honor Holocaust victims was put
forward 10 years ago, it has become ever more divisive, drawing
objections from politicians, authors and intellectuals that no
artistic construction could possibly reflect the enormity of the
Holocaust, and that the presence of such a monument will serve not
to kindle memory but rather to take the place of it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kohl, who has taken a close personal interest in
the project, has insisted that a final choice among four designs
for the monument would be made before the election, for a
ground-breaking ceremony next January _ whoever is chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Like the debate preceding the Vietnam war memorial in
Washington, the discussion has coaxed forth the nation's ghosts, to
such an extent that countless deadlines for the project have
slipped. Twice this year, in March and June, deadlines for an
announcement from Kohl have passed without word from him.
</P>
<P>
   An initial design competition for the memorial was canceled in
1996 and Kohl ordered a new contest. That produced four finalists,
including one design by two Americans, Richard Serra and Peter
Eisenmann, which is viewed as the front-runner, even though Serra
pulled out of the project in early June.
</P>
<P>
   The American design in its original form envisaged a huge
labyrinth of 4,000 stone pillars of varying heights scattered over
an area of 180,000 square feet on a site between the refurbished
German Parliament in the Reichstag building and the
steel-and-concrete commercial center under construction at the
Potsdamer Platz.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolically, the monument would straddle the erstwhile
no-man's-land around the Berlin Wall and would lie directly above
or close to some of the landmarks of the Third Reich, including
Hitler's bunker.
</P>
<P>
   The initial Eisenmann-Serra project has been scaled down,
according to German press reports, to a monument of some 2,000
pillars. But that has not halted disputes that cross political
lines, divide German Jews and seem to defy any quick solution.
</P>
<P>
   No stranger to controversy, Naumann, 56, has headed Metropolitan
Books/Henry Holt Inc., in New York, which is a unit of the German
publishing giant Holtzbrinck. Earlier this year, another big German
publisher, Bertelsmann, acquired Random House, prompting concerns
among some American authors about the German inroads.
</P>
<P>
   Known in Germany as a publisher and journalist, Naumann
announced plans to leave Holtzbrinck on election day, whether or
not the Social Democrats win.
</P>
<P>
   But, given the furor surrounding his political debut, had he had
second thoughts about his remarks?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not changed my views,'' Naumann said. ``I do not have a
single friend in Germany of Jewish denomination who is in favor of
this.''

SENATE PANEL KILLS $100 MILLION IN FUNDS FOR MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key Senate committee Wednesday killed a measure
that would have given Massachusetts $100 million in highway money
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was two months to the day after Trent Lott, the Senate
majority leader, and Tom Daschle, the minority leader, shook hands
on an agreement to earmark the funds for Massachusetts and the same
amount for Alabama, with the money coming from the pending
water-resources bill. The agreement cleared the way for approving
the $200.5 billion highway spending bill on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was struck after Senators John F. Kerry and Richard
Shelby, an Alabama Republican, each threatened to block passage of
the final version of the highway spending bill unless the Senate
leaders pledged to find more money for their states.
</P>
<P>
   Highway money for Massachusetts was cut back in the final 24
hours of haggling over the transportation bill _ the biggest pork
barrel measure in history _ because of funding promises made to
other states. Kerry worked out the agreement to get additional
highway dollars from another bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee rejected
that move Wednesday by deleting the provision that would authorize
the $20 million a year in extra money for Massachusetts and Alabama
on a 12-6 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, chairman of
the committee, voted in favor of the funding. Senator Bob Smith, a
New Hampshire Republican, voted against the money for his
neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat and former governor who
had been active in the battle to equalize highway funding among the
states, proposed killing the provision, saying it would put the
entire water-resources bill at risk of a parliamentary challenge on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry called Wednesday's committee vote a temporary setback and
said Senate leaders were surprised by the action. He predicted that
the funding authorization would be added to the bill later in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership is thoroughly committed to doing it and will do
it, and will probably do it in conference,'' said Kerry. ``Their
commitment is absolutely firm.''

testify about Microsoft today to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Analysts say he might talk about Microsoft's attempts to steal
customers by offering sweet deals on other products _ a tactic
similar to those at the heart of the antitrust complaints against
the company. RealNetworks say Glaser's testimony will be very
specific, but give no clues other than that. Microsoft has decided

In a letter to Vice President Al Gore, Locke also urged Gore to

TONTZES OUST HOEVELERS AS FATHER-SON CHAMPIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ Chris Tontz decided to take some chances in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he and his father, Dr. Bill Tontz, were able to
conclude Charlie and Charles Hoeveler's five-year reign as US
Father and Son national tennis champions at Longwood Cricket Club
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked second nationally, right behind the Hoevelers, the Tontz
team from San Diego defeated the Hoevelers, of Roth, Calif., for
the first time in four attempts, earning a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory in
a match that lasted more than two hours on the grass courts. They
had also gone three sets last year in the final. But this time the
Tontz duo concluded the Hoevelers' record-tying run, equaling the
five titles in a row captured by J.D.E. Jones and son Arnold from
1928-32.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth game of the third set was decisive. Chris's backhand
pass off the return during the service break made the difference. A
third-year professional (ranked No. 640 in singles, 220 in doubles)
after having been California-Irvine's No. 1 player for three
seasons, Chris grabbed the opening point by using that tactic. Then
the senior Hoeveler, Charlie, double-faulted before Chris belted
another backhand winner off the return. One point later, the
Hoevelers slammed a serve-and-volley half-volley into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Charlie was moving a lot at the net to help his dad out,
so I had to go down the line to see if he kept moving, so I had a
free shot down the line,'' Chris said. ``I thought I was going down
the line too often, but even if Charlie was there, if I hit the
ball hard enough, it's still a tough shot.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th game, on Chris's serve, the Tontzes converted on
their third match point. Chris double-faulted on the first, then
shouted, ``I'm so tight right now.'' On the second, Charlie
Hoeveler ripped a backhand long. And on the third, Hoeveler floated
a backhand lob long.
</P>
<P>
   This was the biggest match of Chris Tontz's career. ``I know
this means a lot to my dad _ he trains the whole year for this, and
I want to do well for him,'' said Chris. ``I was tight when I was
serving for the match, but when I shouted out those words, that was
my way of loosening up, to just let it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams played well, and that's what delighted Charlie
Hoeveler. ``Chris Tontz was a dominant player,'' said Charlie, who
runs summer sports camps for Nike. ``He was magnificent. He hardly
missed a first serve. His returns were terrific and he poached at
the net. Backhands, forehands, on both sides, Chris played
extremely well. He just didn't miss. He hurt us. His dad was solid
and we didn't break him. I thought they beat us at full strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Hoevelers had advanced by beating Kelly and
Clayton Hall of Anchorage, Ky., by withdrawal in the semifinals.
The second-seeded Tontzes ousted third-seeded Paul and Kevin Van
der Sommen of Oneonta, N.Y., 6-3, 7-6, in the other semi, then
claimed the big prize.

FILIPINOS WHO FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II SEEK FULL VETERAN STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Filipinos who fought alongside U.S. soldiers in
World War II urged Congress Wednesday to provide full veterans
benefits to surviving members of the Philippine army, telling a
House panel they deserve the recognition for defending American
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ganio, a prisoner of war and veteran of the battles of
Bataan and Corregidor, told the House Committee on Veterans Affairs
that the veterans only seek what they earned and deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Ganio, 78, said he wanted ``justice after waiting for the past
52 years. Pride is pride, good is good, and justice is justice. We
ask for justice now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganio, a citizen of the Philippines who spoke on behalf of the
American Coalition for Filipino Veterans, said he spent two months
of hard labor in Corregidor where Japanese soldiers beat him with
baseball bats.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had an unbreakable faith in America during his time
in the Philippine Commonwealth Army.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Esclamado, chairman of the National Federation of Filipino
American Associations, an organization that represents some 3,000
Filipino American Associations, said that although the veterans
were not U.S. citizens, they fought for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best test of allegiance for the Constitution of the United
States is how much one risks in defense of that oath,'' he told the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines was a U.S. commonwealth when the Japanese seized
the island nation after weeks of brutal fighting in December 1941
and early 1942. The islands were retaken more than two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Ganio told the House panel that all Filipino soldiers took the
formal oath of allegiance to the U.S. flag and Constitution. Ganio
and about 20 other veterans who attended the hearing wore their
uniform jackets and hats decorated with medals and insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Tagumpay Nanadiego, a Veterans' Affairs official at the
Philippine Embassy, said there were more than 100,000 Filipinos who
fought to defend the American territory.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer than 75,000 survivors today, about 22,000 of
whom live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that granting full
benefits to veterans of the Philippines could cost $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Members of some elite Philippine military units were granted
full veterans benefits, but a 1946 law rescinded most benefits for
all other Filipino veterans who fought in World War II with the
U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 1946 law did extend some disability benefits to the
Filipino veterans who were wounded in combat.
</P>
<P>
   What Ganio and the other veterans who attended Wednesday's
hearing seek are full disability compensation, burial allowances
and pensions for their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Snook of the Congressional Research Service said there
were several factors behind Congress' 1946 decision to rescind some
benefits, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The cost of the providing full benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some members of Congress rated service in the Philippine army
below that of service in the U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some lawmakers believed that benefits would create a
privileged class in a newly independent nation with a developing
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Filner, D-Calif., has introduced legislation to provide
full benefits for all Filipinos who fought in World War II,
including those who are not U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill says we will restore dignity and honor to these
proud veterans,'' Filner said. ``We will remedy historical
injustice. We will make good on the promise of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure has nearly 200 co-sponsors, but the Department of
Veterans Affairs opposes the bill and says current law provides for
the well-being of these veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Esclamado, who was shot at by a Japanese officer at the age of
14, said there was no justification for denying benefits to
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war, the U.S. promised to pay the war damage claims
of Filipinos ... but the U.S. reneged even in this promise,'' he
said. ``These Filipinos are losing faith in America's sense of
fairness and justice.''

SAIL CLUBS SAFE HAVEN FOR NOVICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ITAL)The second-happiest day in a sailboat owner's life is the
day he buys his boat. The happiest day is the day he sells it. _
Anonymous(END ITAL
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Judy Cosgrove spent countless days looking up at
the dockside office of the California Sailing Academy near her home
in Marina del Rey. She had sailed Sunfish and Lasers at Penn State,
but there are differences between sailing a dinghy around a lake in
college and plying the Pacific in a deep-keeled sailboat. One day,
she stopped in. That was two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Cosgrove, 38, has chartered a boat or taken part in a
club sail nearly every weekend. She has gained two of the American
Sailing Association's certifications: the Basic Keelboat Standard
and the Basic Coastal Cruising Standard.
</P>
<P>
   She has also learned to race and has studied celestial
navigation, preparing her one day for the ASA's most rigorous
endorsement, the Offshore Passagemaking Standard _ the proven
ability to skipper a sailing vessel on a long sea passage, making
all navigational, mechanical and crew-welfare decisions in all
waters under all conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The most demanding club sail Cosgrove has been on was a foray to
the Channel Islands aboard a 40-foot Scandinavian-made flush-deck
racing sloop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sailed North from Marina del Rey to Paradise Cove where we
anchored for a night,'' she said. ``Then we set sail for Anacapa
(Island). We put in a night at Little Scorpion (an anchorage on
Santa Cruz Island) and another night at Smuggler's Cove and went
ashore and hiked around. It was great. It was the first time I had
every really lived aboard a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Her choice to join the academy puts her among a growing number
of sailors who choose the camaraderie and support of a sailing club
over the often lonely and expensive prospect of owning a sailboat,
which a wag once likened to standing in a bathtub filled with ice
cubes while feeding a wad of $100 bills, one bill at a time, into a
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing clubs serve as intermediaries between boatless sailors
who pay monthly dues and charter fees and boat owners willing to
lease out their boats to offset costs.
</P>
<P>
   Dues tend to be on par with what you'd pay for health club
membership and optional charter fees equivalent to a day of ski
rentals and lift tickets in the local mountains: About $150 will
charter a 30-foot sloop with full galley, inboard engine and marine
head to be used at the member's discretion for a 24-hour period.
Some clubs discount the rate for multiple-day charters.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs also arrange member day sails and live-aboard offshore
clinics, where skills like advanced spinnaker handling and
navigation are taught. Informal sails offer only bonhomie and the
chance for beginning sailors to benefit from cruising with more
experienced crew.
</P>
<P>
   The first body of knowledge for the beginning club sailor is the
ASA's Basic Keelboat Standard. It is taught mostly on the water. It
includes the points of sail, nomenclature and sail theory, how to
handle rigging and maneuvering in different conditions, safety at
sea and right-of-way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we do,'' says Rick Mosier, president of Marina
Sailing, ``is we put you on the boat with an instructor. There are
three students to a boat. You learn the parts of the boat _ the
shrouds, the sheets, all the rigging. During the lesson, one
student is at the helm, another handles the sheets and the third
observes. We have a rotation system that ensures each person gets
ample time at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   Marina Sailing, which has boats and facilities at a number of
local harbors, including Marina del Rey and Long Beach, combines
the Basic Keelboat and Basic Coastal Cruising standards into nine
lessons, which work out to be about $50 per lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Another sailing club, Offshore Islands Sailing in Oxnard's
Channel Islands Harbor, offers the option of taking the Basic
Keelboat and Basic Coastal Cruising standards as separate courses.
Students who pass the former may then sign out the club's Illusion
12s, Capri 22s and Santana 22 until they feel they're ready for the
latter. Class size is limited to two students, and _ true to its
name _ Offshore holds nearly all of its lessons in unprotected
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to give students a realistic picture,'' said club
president Steve Smith. ``We want it to be hands-on. The homework
can be done at home. We do man overboard drills out in the open
ocean, so it's much more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students find out that the hardest part of the whole thing is
finding the swimmer. We use a buoy that's about the size of a
person's head. With a foot of wind chop, the thing is disappearing
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dues, Offshore has a monthly charter minimum of $45,
which is forfeited if no boats are chartered. Offshore charges
about $100 for each of five full-day lessons for its combined Basic
Keelboat and Basic Coastal Cruising certifications.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the ASA-sanctioned courses and bareboat charters, most
clubs tend to hold racing programs. They also offer privileges to
visiting members of other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   With the common standards, a member of a Marina del Rey-based
sailing club with an Intermediate Coastal Cruising certification
could set up a charter through a sailing club in, say, Puget Sound
or San Francisco Bay, and the club would know the sailor has met
the training and experience for the given rating.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Munns of the ASA points out that all standards are minimum
standards. In some sailing waters, site-specific training may be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't start a person out lake sailing and then put him
in the Santa Barbara Channel without additional training,'' Munns
said. ``We can assess their skills, then figure out where you need
to get to.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Sailing Association's national club-information
line is (800) 877-7774, Ext. 1512.

TESTING THE WATERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The American Sailing Association administers the
following keelboat certifications:
</P>
<P>
   Basic Keelboat Sailing: Sailors must sail a keelboat of about 20
feet in moderate wind and sea conditions in familiar waters without
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Basic Coastal Cruising: Sailors must cruise safely in local and
regional waters as both skipper and crew on an auxiliary-powered
sailboat of about 20 to 30 feet in moderate winds and sea
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   From there, sailors can test for a series of additional
certifications, including (in ascending order): Bareboat
Chartering, also known as Intermediate Coastal Cruising; Coastal
Navigation; Advanced Coastal Cruising; Celestial Navigation; and
Offshore Passagemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced sailors may challenge any of the ASA standards by
demonstrating both sailing knowledge and on-water skills.

ALBACORE MISSION YIELDS FRUSTRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ Armies of longfins. Can't-miss angling. Albacore
galore.
</P>
<P>
   I'd heard the stories and read the counts out of the San Diego
landings _ 1,000-fish days the norm. I caught the fever when the
largely elusive tuna began showing up in Ventura County fish counts
by mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Plans were made, but as soon as I could get on a boat the bite
petered out and died. Trips I had reserved spots on were canceled
three times in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I could have motored down to San Diego, where 10 albacore
per rod were not uncommon. But my name was slated to grace the
manifest of a four-day boat leaving port there in mid-August, and,
by now, the albacore challenge had become something more regional
for me. I wanted to catch a longfin out of my own backyard of
Ventura, or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Albacore, you see, are the slot machines of Pacific game fishes;
no species is more of a gamble to catch. A pelagic, or open-ocean
denizen, the long-finned tuna swim constantly to find food sources
and agreeable water temperatures, so much so it's impossible to
tell where they'll strike next.
</P>
<P>
   Usually they are found from 50 to 100 miles offshore, or farther
_ a long haul, to say the least. Once schools are located, anglers
need to dedicate up to 30 hours on a party boat with little notice
ahead of time if they want to score.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, albies seldom show in Southern California. The last
significant Southland run before 1997's El Nino-driven bounty _ the
earliest run in a half-century and one of the richest seasons _ was
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   By the sounds of it, this year's run is starting up where last
year's left off, and San Diego anglers are virtually guaranteed
albacore. That just reaffirmed my mission: Catch an albacore at
home.
</P>
<P>
   So desperate had I become, I even agreed to ride on a spotter
plane to track the wily tuna out of Oxnard. But even that fell
through. Besides, what tackle do you use from a plane?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fax came across my deck _ an exploratory albacore
trip out of Santa Barbara _ and I bit. Bummer is, we got halfway to
Japan and still didn't catch a thing. 0-for-the-boat. A total skunk
for 13 anglers.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard that the best way to jinx a trip is to let a
sportswriter aboard, but this was out of my hands _ out of
anybody's hands. We went to Las Vegas and came back broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``You roll the dice,'' said Merit McCrea, skipper of the
luckless Seahawk LXV who oversaw anglers troll from sunup to 4 p.m.
before turning back at a spot some 110 miles south of port. ``Like
they say, `Heroes or zeros.' Today we were zeros.''
</P>
<P>
   You could feel the collective energy slipping away well before
the Seahawk _ at this point dubbed by some the Seaskunk _ returned
home in what amounted to an expensive, 29-hour boat ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' said fellow angler Ed Sanfilippo, who frequents
a bass-fishing tournament circuit when he's not tickling the keys
as a senior locksmith for the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power. ``It shouldn't happen with me.''
</P>
<P>
   That about sums up an experience that is difficult to explain or
accept. Every angler knows there's always a chance; they just hope
against hope it doesn't happen to them. There are few emptier
feelings... at least in the fickle realm of recreation.
</P>
<P>
   It must be difficult for party-boat captains to say with any
sincerity, ``Come fish with us again,'' after such a hapless trip _
even when they have done everything right. When they watched
diligently for meter marks on their fish finders, scoured the sea
for balls of baitfish and squinted for bird life until new wrinkles
bore into their foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   Skippers take it personally when seaweed and kelp are the only
things biting and their customers come home with empty fish sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, people feel like they got totally ripped off,''
said McCrea, who explored every spot he wanted to on the trip but
spied just five breaching bluefin tuna that teased him and
disappeared in ``hello, good-bye'' fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He warded off dockside requests for refunds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried,'' he explained. ``It could have gone the other way _
10 guys hammering the snot out of them _ and we wouldn't have
charged any more.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as it is said ad nauseam, ``That's why they call it fishing
and not catching.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a phrase I detest, but one that couldn't be more
appropriate. &QL;

ADVERTISING: MARKETERS BUSY CHANGING ASSIGNMENTS  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another busy day along Madison Avenue, as several
national marketers, well known and otherwise, made changes on
advertising assignments with billings estimated at more than $120
million.
</P>
<P>
   The largest involved barnesandnoble.com, the online division of
the bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. in New York, which named the New
York office of TBWA Chiat/Day to handle its account. Billings were
estimated at $38 million to $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   The account for the online division, along with the creative
duties for the parent Barnes &AMP; Noble, had been handled for less
than a year by Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano in New York. Weiss,
Whitten recently began running a campaign to reintroduce the
division's Web site (www.barnesandnoble.com), which competes
against online booksellers like Amazon.com; not long afterward,
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Weiss, Whitten decided to end their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Boyd, a spokesman for barnesandnoble.com, said the decision
to hire TBWA Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom
Group, came after a six-week review that had been narrowed to that
agency and two other finalists: DDB Needham New York, part of the
DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom, and Deutsch Inc. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   While TBWA Chiat/Day has been hired to handle the online
division, Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble,
said, ``The idea has always been to have one agency to deal with
both parts of our business.'' As a result, she added, ``we will be
getting together with TBWA Chiat/Day to discuss our needs'' beyond
the division's ads.
</P>
<P>
   The barnesandnoble.com decision came on the heels of a victory
by the Venice, Calif., office of TBWA Chiat/Day in landing a large
account, Kinko's Inc., after a review. Billings for that
assignment, announced on Tuesday, were estimated at $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another marketer, the Clairol division of Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co., expanded its relationship with Intuition Group in New York by
naming the agency to introduce a hair color brand to be called
Revitalique. Billings were estimated at $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Intuition Group, a unit of WPP Group PLC, was awarded the
assignment after a two-month review that also included another
Clairol roster agency, Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in New York, part of
True North Communications. Intuition Group already handles
advertising for two other Clairol brands, Nice 'n Easy and Natural
Instincts' Exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Another review that ended Wednesday involved Cargill Inc. in
Minneapolis, the international marketer, processor and distributor
of agricultural, food, financial and industrial products that is
the world's largest privately held conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill selected Martin/Williams Advertising in Minneapolis as
the first agency to handle its corporate advertising account.
Billings were estimated at $10 million to $20 million. The six-week
review also included undisclosed agencies. Martin/Williams, which
is part of Omnicom, will create a campaign intended to develop the
Cargill corporate identity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   3Dfx Interactive Inc. in San Jose, Calif., which markets 3D
graphics for personal computers, named Goodby, Silverstein &AMP;
Partners in San Francisco as the first agency to handle its
advertising. Though billings were not disclosed, the trade
publication Advertising Age estimated them at $20 million to $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   Goodby, Silverstein, which is also part of Omnicom, was awarded
the 3Dfx account without a review. Porter Novelli in San Francisco,
yet another Omnicom shop, will handle public relations along with
Copithorne &AMP; Bellows in San Francisco. And Red Sky Interactive in
San Francisco, which is affiliated with the Communicade interactive
division of Omnicom, will handle interactive assignments.
</P>
<P>
   And Yesawich, Pepperdine &AMP; Brown in Orlando, Fla., has been
awarded four accounts with combined billings estimated at more than
$30 million.
</P>
<P>
   One came from Renaissance Hotels and Resorts in Washington, part
of Marriott International, which named the agency to handle
advertising for individual American and Canadian properties. That
assignment, with billings estimated at more than $5 million, had
been handled by McCann-Erickson New York, part of the
McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.,
which continues to handle brand advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Zion, Ill., and
Tulsa, Okla., named Yesawich, Pepperdine to handle advertising and
direct marketing, which had been handled in-house. Billings were
estimated at $7 million to $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandy Lane Resort in Barbados, West Indies, named Yesawich,
Pepperdine as the first agency to handle its account in the United
States; those billings were estimated at $2 million. And the St.
Petersburg/Clearwater Area Convention and Visitors Bureau in
Florida renamed the agency to handle its account for an additional
three years; the assignment will be handled by the St. Petersburg
office of Yesawich, Pepperdine. Billings were estimated at $5
million for each year.
</P>
<P>
   For all that activity, more big moves are expected soon,
including a decision on a review by Ernst &AMP; Young in New York for
its account, with billings estimated at $3 million. Advertising Age
reported that D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles in New York, a unit of
MacManus Group, would land the account; a decision may come
Thursday.

STRUG REMAINS INSPIRING FIGURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Lifetime procrastinators, disabled individuals,
grown men in airports everywhere and children -- her favorite --
won't allow Kerri Strug's valiant vault two years ago today fade
away.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA sophomore who will transfer to Stanford this fall said
matter-of-factly that she's also a home wrecker, sort of. Females
in poor relationships or bad marriages have informed her that her
gutsy leap in the Atlanta Olympics gave them the faith and
inspiration to start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd been in a bad situation, saying they had to realize
that they had to do something to make it better,'' said Strug, 20.
``They didn't know what to do, and they'd resolved to do what's
best for them because of what they saw in me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing to think that, in a couple of seconds, my
life changed and I made an impact on so many people in the world.
To me, it was my job to make that vault. No matter what the
circumstances were, I was supposed to do it. Now I realize why it
made such an impact. It was a pretty special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Peterson, Strug's San Francisco-based manager, and Strug
are almost always amazed by stories they hear of Strug's influence.
One overweight girl who shed 40 pounds turned her bedroom into a
Strug shrine, and an elderly woman attributes a life-saving daily
walking routine to Strug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, and we always walk away going, `Wow!' '' Peterson
said of the many functions she attends with Strug. ``I remember
looking up to Mary Lou Retton and the impact she made on me,''
Strug said. ``I never thought I'd be in a similar situation.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 23, 1996, the unassuming 4-foot-9, 90-pound dynamo known
as Baby in U.S. gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi's tumbling stable put
her mind over matter, and her team over herself, to etch perhaps
the most indelible moment at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu had bitten the Georgia Dome pad on her two
vaults to excite the gaining Russians at the end of the team
competition, and then Strug flubbed her 1 1/2 twisting Yurchenko.
</P>
<P>
   With only 30 seconds to attempt her second and final vault,
Strug tried standing on the pad but slipped onto her right knee.
Her left hand reached back to rub two torn ligaments in her left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a prayer and a boost of adrenaline projected
Strug full-throttle down the runway, over the apparatus and into
the soul of a nation. She landed square, heard another crack from
her left ankle and still executed a pirouette, her left knee bent
with her left foot six inches off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown at the time, the U.S. women would have still won their
first team Olympic gold medal because of average floor routines by
the last two Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Strug's 9.712 score, though, locked it up. But her aggravated
injury prevented her from competing in the individual all-around,
for which she had prepared for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it first happened, I thought it was the end of the world
because I didn't get to accomplish all the personal goals I had set
for myself,'' Strug said. ``Now, two years later, I realize I
probably accomplished a lot more and made more of an impact than if
I had won an individual medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything turns out for the best. Sometimes, you don't
realize it at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Strug is very active with half a dozen charitable organizations,
including the Special Olympics, Children's Miracle Network and
Muscular Dystrophy, and her docket is filled with
motivational-speech engagements.
</P>
<P>
   She figures she has spent six weekends in Southern California
since she moved here to attend UCLA after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Atlanta, I thought I'd go to college, compete in
gymnastics and study pre-Med,'' Strug said. ``I definitely didn't
think I'd be on an airplane every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosting ``Saturday Night Live'' in the fall of 1996 was another
windfall, and Strug displayed a keen sense of self-deprecating
humor when one skit featured a parody of her stunning vault.
</P>
<P>
   She has written ``Landing on my feet: Diary of dreams,''
detailing her life from when she left home in Tucson at 13 to train
with Karolyi in Houston up to the Olympics, and ``Heart of gold,''
a children's book.
</P>
<P>
   Her height, high-pitched voice and heart are magnets to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They relate to me,'' she said. ``I'm relaxed with them and I
have a great time. I think they can feel that and feed off that.
Kids are our future, and I think it's important that they have good
role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of problems out there. There are a lot of bumps
in the road, a lot of down times, but I tell them not to be normal.
Try to be extraordinary. They need someone to give them a push, to
say, `You can do it. You can beat the odds.' That's the best thing
I've gotten out of Atlanta, making an impact on kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   Strug is interning at ``Entertainment Tonight'' this summer.
Soon she'll pack up her 3-year-old green BMW 318i in front of the
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and zip to Stanford, her mother
Melanie's alma mater whose undergraduate population is about a
third of UCLA's claustrophobic 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   A stint helping out the Bruins' gymnastics team turned Strug
into more of a cheerleader than an assistant, an uncomfortable
position for anyone who has competed at the highest international
level.
</P>
<P>
   She might even return to the area for graduate school or to
break into the entertainment industry, public relations, marketing
or television.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for now it's time to find new goals, to move on to the
next chapter,'' Strug said. ``Atlanta seems so long ago, but in
other ways it seems like yesterday. It's odd. To me, I was just
Kerri the gymnast, and tomorrow no one would care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then overnight, everyone knew me. I didn't realize it would
last so long, but it's just kept going. It makes me feel
privileged.''

 A 1960s SOLUTION TO A '90s PUZZLE  (af) 
 James Ryan is working on a book about late-20th-century
inventions  
 By JAMES RYAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a recent advance screening of Disney's remake of its classic
1961 film ``The Parent Trap,'' a girl about 7 or 8 years old was
overheard to say: ``You know what I like about this movie? This is
a family movie kids will like.''
</P>
<P>
   This pint-size critic had put her thumb squarely on something
that has been tormenting Hollywood of late: how to create films
that will appeal to young moviegoers without alienating their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Meyers, a veteran screenwriter who is making her
directorial debut with the new ``Parent Trap,'' which opens on
Wednesday, has viewed the predicament from both sides. The mother
of two young daughters, she approaches filmmaking knowing exactly
what it's like to suffer through an excruciating matinee, glancing
repeatedly at a watch and praying for the closing credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely wanted to make a movie where the parents were
going to have a really good time and the kids were going to have a
good time,'' she said recently.
</P>
<P>
   However daunting the task of trying to appeal to all ages,
though, Ms. Meyers had an enviable head start in taking on a remake
of ``The Parent Trap.'' The original movie, written and directed by
David Swift, had a cross-generational appeal that Walt Disney
Studios was famous for in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, it
starred the British actress Hayley Mills, who was fresh from
Disney's, and Swift's, hit ``Pollyanna,'' for which she had won a
special Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Parent Trap,'' Ms. Mills brought her rare combination
of innocence and precocious insight to playing each of two
14-year-old twins who had been separated at birth. One lived in
Boston with her mother, portrayed by Maureen O'Hara, and the other
lived on a California ranch with her father (Brian Keith). By
fluke, they meet at a summer camp, then conspire to get their
parents back together.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four decades have passed since this double dose of Ms.
Mills entranced moviegoers young and old. Though the original
``Parent Trap'' has aged remarkably well _ it's an ever-popular
video rental, and several made-for-television sequels starring Ms.
Mills were made in the late 1980s _ children today aren't what they
used to be. Nor are their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary audiences have greater expectations when it comes
both to special effects and to the realistic portrayal of
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime fan of the original, Ms. Meyers, 48, wrote the
screenplay of the remake with her husband, Charles Shyer. They kept
the basic plot intact but instituted a variety of subtle changes to
make the story more suitable for a late-1990s audience. (They had
performed a similar generational face lift for the 1991 remake of
``Father of the Bride.'')
</P>
<P>
   In directing the new ``Parent Trap,'' Ms. Meyers was aided by
the use of the latest digital filmmaking techniques, which helped
her elicit a striking dual performance from her own young star,
Lindsay Lohan, 11. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson portray the
girls' parents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first modifications agreed upon by Ms. Meyers and
Shyer was the need to lower the twins' age. ``We tried to figure
out what today equals 14 in 1961 and came up with 11,'' Ms. Meyers
explained. ``Fourteen-year-olds today are wearing makeup, starting
to dress like women, and boys are on their minds.'' In other words,
today's teen-age twins may well be too self-absorbed to care
whether their parents get back together or not.
</P>
<P>
   With the new age established, Ms. Meyers said, the rule of thumb
on what to retain from the original story was ``if it works, keep
it.'' ``Our aim was not to deliver an original screenplay but to
remake something that you loved and want to see again,'' she said.
``It's okay to retell a story as long as you tell it really well.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little to be done to the central idea of separating
twins at birth, and then never informing them of the situation:
such a course of action seems as improbable and harsh today as it
did in 1961. Ms. Mills, 52, recalled that even as a girl she found
the idea quite odd. ``There's none so queer as folk, as they say,
so get over it,'' she said by telephone from her home in London.
``It makes for a much better story.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise came from a short story by the German writer Erich
Kastner. A 1954 British movie, ``Twice Upon a Time,'' was also
based on the story. ``If you dissect it, it's a very tough thing
they did,'' Ms. Meyers said of the 1961 production.
</P>
<P>
   More relaxed social mores did allow the makers of the new
version to try to give a better explanation for the twins'
separation _ by having the couple meet, marry and, presumably,
conceive the babies during a whirlwind romance aboard the QE2.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, female characters underwent the most
extensive changes in the rewrite. In the original, the twins'
mother (Ms. O'Hara's character) lived with her father and an
overbearing mother, did charity work and longed for a new man to
come into her life. In the remake, Ms. Richardson portrays a
much-sought-after British dress designer who lives with her father
_ the mother has been replaced by a butler _ and seems relatively
satisfied with life as a single mom.
</P>
<P>
   The California twin's housekeeper is now a thoroughly modernized
nanny who has a close and open relationship with the young girl.
``In the '60s you didn't hang out with your nanny; now kids do,''
explained Ms. Meyers. And the father's gold-digging love interest
has been transformed from a coiffed debutante chaperoned by her
mother into a publicity agent with a gay assistant. The father owns
a vineyard, not a ranch.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond seeking a more contemporary characterization, the
filmmakers were greatly aided by technological advances of the last
35 years. In using one actress to portray two twins in a credible
way, Ms. Meyers had the advantage, first, of a computer-aided
motion-control camera _ so-called because a computer records the
camera's every movement, making it possible for a sequence to be
repeated exactly on subsequent takes. She also benefited from the
digital editing process, in which images can be removed and added
by computer.
</P>
<P>
   In Swift's day, the mirror-image effect was created largely by a
split-screen filming technique, he said. Shooting from a fixed
camera, the right side of the film was exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Ms. Mills and her double would change costumes and wigs
while the film was rolled back,'' recalled Swift. ``We would play
the scene again shooting on the left half of the film. Both takes
would have to be perfect for the shot to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills remembers this process well. ``It was very
constricting,'' she said. ``You couldn't cross over the center
line, and the camera shot had to be lined up against something
absolutely perpendicular.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift, who worked under the close supervision of Walt Disney
himself, also had to include dozens of shots of the back of the
head of Ms. Mills' double, Susan Henning. In the 1961 film, when
the twins' faces appear in the same frame, they are side by side,
usually with a tree or post between them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyers and her special-effects coordinator, Jim Rygiel, were
able to avoid what he calls the curse of the twin effect by using
the motion-control camera, which allows the actor to roam freely,
knowing adjustments can be made later.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her ``Parent Trap'' predecessor, Ms. Meyers could view on
video all of her ``pass A'' takes _ that is, the initial versions
of a sequence, with Ms. Lohan portraying one of the twins. The
director would then choose which she liked best while Ms. Lohan
changed costumes, to portray the other twin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a digital artist, sitting in front of a computer
screen with an electronic tablet, would quickly sketch a line
around the image of the actress, frame by frame. The background
could then be removed digitally and the rough image of it
superimposed behind the image of the second twin when ``pass B'' _
the sequence with Ms. Lohan appearing as the second twin _ was
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyers could watch an approximation of the scene with both
characters unfold on the monitor as it would appear in the finished
film. Later, in the editing room she would have the luxury of
choosing from several pass B takes.
</P>
<P>
   Technology also made Ms. Lohan's job easier than Ms. Mills'. In
most cases, she would act out a scene with her double, who would
mime the words while she listened to her own voice from the earlier
take on a small microphone.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, especially during close-ups, a monitor would be
placed next to her and she could play the scene out regarding a
video image of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very, very good at it,'' recalled Rygiel. ``She just
led with it. Young people seem to be more comfortable with
technology. It was as simple as listening to a Walkman with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyers, who sought advice from Harold Ramis, the director of
``Multiplicity,'' in which the Michael Keaton character clones
himself, said that the process of making the new ``Parent Trap''
gave her a new appreciation of Swift's accomplishment in the early
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``David did a great job given the limited way he had to do
effect shots,'' she said. ``You never felt stuck on those scenes
because of the camera tricks. And it is so emotional and so
gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Technological innovation aside, the real appeal of ``The Parent
Trap'' has not changed over the years. ``Who among us has not
contemplated at one time or another the existence of a twin we do
not know about?'' said Swift. And among the children of divorce,
who has not dreamed of their parents getting back together? In
addition, those who have not directly experienced divorce have
usually felt the pain of being estranged from a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a lot of movies, but that's the one remembered more
than the others,'' said Ms. Mills. ``It's remarkable. As queer as
the circumstances, a lot of people have told me that `The Parent
Trap' addressed a situation that was very similar to their own
lives and it helped them deal with it.''

ALAN SHEPARD, FIRST AMERICAN IN SPACE, DIES AT 74 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: An expanded story, OBIT-SHEPARD-1STLD, will move by 9 p.m.
ET. This version can stand alone, however.) 
(th) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Shepard, the first American to fly in space, lifting
national spirits at a decisive moment of Cold War anxiety, and
later one of only 12 astronauts to walk on the Moon, died Wednesday
at a hospital in Monterey, Calif. He was 74 and lived Houston and
Pebble Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The family would not disclose the cause of death, saying only
that it came after a long illness. But another former astronaut,
Sen. John Glenn, said that Shepard had been suffering from
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of May 5, 1961, Shepard became an immediate
American hero. A lean, crew-cut former Navy test pilot, then 37, he
began the day lying on his back in a cramped Mercury capsule atop a
seven-story Redstone rocket filled with explosive fuel. After four
tense hours of weather and mechanical delays, he was shot into the
sky on a 15-minute flight that grazed the fringes of space, at an
altitude of 115 miles, and ended in a splashdown in the Atlantic
Ocean 302 miles downrange from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Though not much by today's standards, the brief suborbital
flight had stopped a whole country in its tracks, waiting anxiously
at radios and television sets. When the message of success came
through _ with a phrase that would enter the idiom, ``Everything is
A-OK!'' _ everyone seemed to let out a collective sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union's Yuri Gagarin may have been first man into
space, 23 days before, and have flown a full orbit, but now the
United States finally had reason to cheer. In fact, Shepard's
success is credited with giving President John F. Kennedy the
confidence to commit the nation to the goal of landing men on the
Moon by the end of the decade. He announced the goal to Congress on
May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goldin, NASA's director, said the Shepard flight was ``a
tremendous statement about tenacity, courage and brilliance,''
adding with a tone of lingering awe: ``He crawled on top of that
rocket that had never before flown into space with a person aboard
and he did it. That was an unbelievable act of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Logsdon, a political scientist at George Washington
University and author of ``The Decision to Go to the Moon,'' said,
``One can make the argument that the success of the Shepard flight
enabled the decision to go to the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., a historian and a member of the
Kennedy White House staff, recalled that the Gagarin flight and
then the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Cuba a few days later had given
``Americans a slight inferiority complex.'' Then the Shepard flight
produced ``a great exhilaration and renewed our confidence in our
capacity as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hailed Shepard as ``one of the great heroes of
modern America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the first flight, Shepard made a comeback from a
serious inner ear problem called Meuniere's syndrome that had
grounded him. And it was also a comeback flight for the space
program.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, 1971, he took off for the Moon in Apollo 14, the
first lunar mission since the near-disaster of Apollo 13 the year
before. He and Edgar Mitchell spent 33 hours on the Moon, a visit
made memorable by Shepard taking several spirited whacks at golf
balls with a makeshift 6-iron he had brought along. The balls
sailed in the low lunar gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived every golfer's dream,'' Clinton remarked. ``Taking a
6-iron and hitting the ball, in his words, `for miles and miles.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was one of the original seven Mercury astronauts chosen
in 1959 by the fledgling space agency and introduced to the nation
with great fanfare. His death leaves only four survivors: Scott
Carpenter, L. Gordon Cooper, Walter Schirra and Glenn, who at 77 is
training for a kind of farewell flight on the space shuttle in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom died in a cockpit fire during a
launching-pad training exercise in 1967. Donald ``Deke'' Slayton
died of cancer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Shepard retired from both NASA and the Navy, where he
had achieved the rank of rear admiral. Already wealthy from real
estate and other investments, he became chairman of Marathon
Construction Corp. in Houston and later founded his own business
company, Seven Fourteen Enterprises. The name recognized his two
missions, Freedom 7 and Apollo 14.

TOP DRAFT PICK MISSES COWBOYS' PRACTICE, OTHER NOTES (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE IVEY and CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
Ellis misses practice Missing a couple days of training camp was
bad enough, but sleeping on the floor? Now that's rough.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rookie defensive end Greg Ellis, the Dallas Cowboys' first-round
draft choice, did not practice yesterday for the second consecutive
day due to muscle spasms in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis had finished getting dressed for Tuesday morning's
full-pad practice when he bent over to pick up his shoulder pads
and felt a twinge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared me,'' he said. ``I thought something really serious
was wrong. Thank God it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of the training staff, Ellis slept on the floor
that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the dorms, so we don't have that nice plush
carpeting,'' Ellis said. ``It was just that hard rug.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his back was a little bit tight yesterday, but he felt
well enough to practice. The trainers, though, told him to wait
until today.
First fight of camp No training camp would be complete without at
least one feud. Yesterday morning, rookie tackle Flozell Adams and
linebacker Nate Hemsley obliged with a brief brawl on the practice
field.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsley, who gives away seven inches and 115 pounds to Adams,
apparently was upset about being pancaked to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over, and that's it,'' Adams said. ``That skirmish has
nothing to do with anything. That's done and over with now.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave Campo, who saw the fracas, said he
wasn't too concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to waste a lot of time and have fights every day,
but every now and then it's good to get the juices flowing and have
people get excited and show a little emotion,'' Campo said.
Morgan back in camp Air Force 2nd Lt. Beau Morgan is getting closer
to the day he can pursue his football career full-time.
</P>
<P>
   The free-agent running back is in training camp for the second
consecutive season on a part-time basis. On Aug. 12, he's scheduled
to return to his post at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado
Springs, Colo. In the spring, he plans to petition for his release
from active duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, I'll be able to concentrate fully on
football,'' Morgan said. ``I love the Air Force, and, right now,
it's my job. Playing in the NFL, though, that's my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, an option quarterback at Air Force, said he is learning
his new position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm soaking everything in and getting better every day,'' he
said. ``I'm lucky to have this opportunity, and I plan to make the
most of it.''
Countdown to Kickoff 46 days until regular season begins Cowboys
coach Chan Gailey said the team might get its first look at
cornerback Deion Sanders by the end of the week and certainly by
next week. Sanders, who had arthroscopic surgery on his left ankle
May 29, has not made a full-time appearance at training camp. He
has participated in some limited drills with the defensive backs
but has spent the majority of his time watching. He has drawn some
attention from the crowds while jogging around the field and
jockeying with teammate Michael Irvin about Irvin's battles with
the young cornerbacks.
Spotlight on ... Free-agent prospects The players: Defensive end
Alonzo Spellman
</P>
<P>
   The Scouting Report: Signing the former Chicago Bears defensive
end is unlikely. For one, his litany of off-field incidents during
the off-season make him an unattractive fit, despite his talent.
Also, as one Cowboys official put it, how can you seriously
consider the guy when his agent, Leigh Steinberg, hasn't heard from
him and doesn't know where he is.
Plays of the day Out of the shotgun, Troy Aikman threw a perfect
strike between two defenders to Stepfret Williams on a deep post
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest _ if not the best _ hit of the practice came from
cornerback Kevin Mathis on running back Tarik Smith, who tried to
stop Mathis' blitz but ended up on his backside.
Who's hot Stepfret Williams: He had a good practice yesterday,
reminding everyone why he was a key third-down target last season.
Williams made several great catches yesterday, most of them over
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Toby Gowin: Despite not being pushed that hard by rookie
Barry Cantrell, Gowin has looked quite impressive to special-teams
coach Joe Avezzano. ``That kid's leg just keeps getting stronger.
He's awesome.'' Who's not Tight end Sean Simms: The free agent from
Nevada-Reno looked bad twice. He missed a block on defensive end
Herman Smith that allowed Smith to tackle Emmitt Smith about 5
yards deep in the backfield. Later, he dropped a well-thrown
sideline pass from Jason Garrett.

<P>
   The weather didn't deter several dozen children, who sat in the
``KidZone'' bleachers located near the end zones. The youngsters
relentlessly chanted for their favorite players: ``Emmitt, Emmitt,
Emmitt,'' and of course ``MOOSE!'' and ``Deion, Deion, Deion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the morning session, the children were rewarded
when Irvin stopped by with a football. The wide receiver signed the
ball and gave it to a young fan in a wheelchair. Irvin stuck around
to sign autographs for another 10 minutes.

SPORTS COLUMN: DIFFERENT JETS _ BETTER BUT WORSE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ For the New York Jets, more so than for most
teams in most sports, living up to expectations has always been
more difficult than creating those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Just when last year's Jets were expected to qualify for the
playoffs in their season finale in Detroit, they lost. In too many
other years, just when the Jets did qualify for the playoffs or
were expected to win a big game, they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having soared to a 9-7 record in Bill Parcells' first
season as coach following the 1-15 disaster of two seasons ago, the
Jets' expectations are suddenly high again: make another run at the
playoffs, if not surely qualify for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But will they? Or can they?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the expectations are, I've got mine,'' Parcells was
saying Wednesday as his team gathered for training camp. ``And
they're higher than most people's.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was not about to be specific. He knows better than to
put a number on his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Jets followers are still smiling over what Parcells on Wednesday
described as ``a miracle last year; you won't see that again in 10
years in this league.'' But whatever their expectations are, don't
base them on what last year's Jets accomplished. These Jets are
different with a different (and more difficult) schedule:
</P>
<P>
   Different quarterback (Glenn Foley), different running back
(Curtis Martin), different fullback (Jerald Sowell), three
different starters on the offensive line (center Kevin Mawae, left
guard Todd Burger, right tackle Siupeli Malamala), and three
different starters on defense (left tackle Jason Ferguson, right
end Anthony Pleasant and free safety Raymond Austin).
</P>
<P>
   Of those nine players, only Martin and Mawae are proven pros.
The others, even Foley, are unproven.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not a question of these different Jets living up to the
expectations created by last year's Jets as it is these different
Jets creating some expectations of their own.
</P>
<P>
   With a schedule that includes an opener in San Francisco and a
visit to Kansas City, these Jets might be a better team than last
year's Jets and yet not have as good a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talent and potential is like horsepower in a car,'' Parcells
said. ``Somebody's got to come in and step on the gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Be assured that Parcells will step on the gas, but the Jets
could get stuck in their own division, again. For all the fun of
last year's 9-7 record, the Jets were only 2-6 in the American
Conference East, beating only the Patriots and the Colts. Against
nondivision opponents, the Jets were 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Patriots won't be as good without Martin. Maybe the
Dolphins won't be as good as Dan Marino ages. Maybe the Bills won't
be as good without Marv Levy as coach and maybe the Colts won't be
as good with a young Peyton Manning at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not as if the Jets know how good they will be,
especially with the uncertainty at quarterback. When two-a-day
workouts begin Thursday, Foley will take more snaps than Vinny
Testaverde, signed as a backup following Neil O'Donnell's release
in late June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rooting for Foley,'' Parcells said. ``He's feisty. He's
got a little cowboy in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of the coach's assessment, Foley smiled and said, ``That's
better than spunky,'' another word used to describe him last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Foley added: ``I grew up in a family of four boys. You have to
be feisty.''
</P>
<P>
   In 25 possessions as the Jets' quarterback last season, Foley
generated 10 scores _ six touchdowns, four field goals _ for a 40
percent average. In contrast, O'Donnell generated only a 32 percent
average in 159 possessions with 48 scores: 24 touchdowns, 24 field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``And playing games that mean something in December,'' Foley
said, ``we got a little taste of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley didn't get a taste, though. He was hobbling on a damaged
knee in December after having had shoulder surgery in 1995. But
that's why, on Parcells' orders, he has bulked up to 220 pounds,
with about 12 pounds of muscle. Wednesday he was wearing a size XXL
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits better,'' he said, smiling. ``I wore an XL last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Jets want, of course, for Glenn Foley and everybody
else, is a XXXIII shirt, as in the Super Bowl on Jan. 31, 1999, in
Miami. But that's too much to expect.

PANTANI FINDS HIS MOUNTAIN PLAYGROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLATEAU DE BEILLE, France _ Marco Pantani has been saying for
months that this is not a Tour de France for climbers, among whom
he is far and away the best. Not demanding enough, he insists, not
enough mountains, not enough finishes on peaks to deprive lesser
climbers of their chance to make up lost time on long descents.
</P>
<P>
   Enough is enough, or basta, as the Italian leader of the
Mercatone Uno team would say. Pantani rode a wonderful race
Wednesday, timing his acceleration away from the pack exactly right
and climbing with nimble ease to win the last of two stages in the
Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   He finished 1 minute 26 seconds ahead after the 105-mile 11th
stage, from Luchon to the dusty and uninhabited Plateau de Beille,
as the sun returned and the temperature rose to the high 80's.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani also rose from 11th to fourth place over all with the
Alps, his other playground, still to come. Three days of climbing
start there on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   How about Bobby Julich, though? The native of Glenwood Springs,
Colo., who rides for the Cofidis team based in France, came in
third and solidified his hold on second place over all by finishing
seven seconds ahead of Jan Ullrich, the defending champion and the
man in the leader's yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable during the last climb,'' Julich said,
referring to a steep section with a rating in the highest level of
difficulty. ``I even felt stronger at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where he left Ullrich behind in the final kilometer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode a cautious race,'' Julich said. ``I've got to lay it on
the line in the Alps and see if I can win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He now trails Ullrich, a German with Telekom, by 1:11. Third
over all is Laurent Jalabert, a Frenchman with ONCE, 3:01 behind,
the same deficit that Pantani has in fourth place. Another
favorite, Abraham Olano, the Spanish leader of the Banesto team,
quit Wednesday because of a hip injury he suffered in a crash
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich labored mightily at the front of the pack chasing
Pantani up the final ascent, setting a strong pace with Julich on
his back wheel. At one point, the German looked around for a
teammate, seeking some help, found nobody and carried on the
pursuit himself. Even when he faltered, he still finished eighth in
the 149-man field.
</P>
<P>
   After all his troubles with weight and lost racing time this
spring, Ullrich has come through the Pyrenees in yellow and looks
strong. Many riders, including Julich, have been warning that
Pantani could become his main rival, but that may depend on the
final time trial, a day before the finish in Paris on Aug. 2, where
Ullrich will be heavily favored.
</P>
<P>
   A lot will also depend on how well Julich bears the pressure in
only his second Tour. After the crash, injury and withdrawal
Tuesday of the Cofidis leader, Francesco Casagrande, Julich heads
the team. His troops include two other riders who excelled
Wednesday: Roland Meier, a Swiss, finished second after a long
breakaway, and Kevin Livingston of Austin, Texas, finished ninth,
2:01 behind Pantani.
</P>
<P>
   Cofidis, a team in its second year and one with few results
earlier this season, now has Julich in second place, Meier in ninth
and Livingston in 11th, and all are strong climbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody climbs faster than Pantani, however. He proved that once
again Wednesday with his fifth stage victory in the Tour and his
triumph last month in the three-week Giro d'Italia, where he
crushed the pack in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But Pantani does tend sometimes to accelerate too late, as he
did Tuesday, when he finished second after a long descent in which
he could not overtake the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because he doesn't always use his head,'' said Lucien
van Impe, a strong climber when he won the Tour in 1976, said.
``That's his problem. He climbs with his legs, not always with his
head.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no problem Wednesday. Pantani sped away from about 20
riders after a kilometer or two of the final climb and simply kept
speeding away. He overtook Meier, who had led him by four minutes
earlier, within five kilometers (3.1 miles) and rushed to the
summit, pausing only to pour fans' bottles of water over his shaven
head.
</P>
<P>
   With the heavy fog of Tuesday gone, the stage across the
Pyrenees afforded gorgeous views of the forested mountains and
their villages of gray stone houses and slate roofs. The sky was a
flawless baby blue and the pastoral quality of the day rang with
the sound of bells from grazing herds of cattle.
</P>
<P>
   There was a solemn sense to the stage as well. The pack paused
at Kilometer 40 while flowers were laid at the monument to Fabio
Casartelli, the Italian rider with Motorola who died after a crash
there on July 18, 1995, a month short of his 25th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Meier attacked. Large crowds applauded him
en route and even passengers on a train that briefly ran alongside
the course leaned out the windows to cheer him on. The Swiss had a
good thing going for him until Pantani used his head. &QL;

CHINESE GYMNAST PARALYZED IN WARMUP FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The 17-year-old Chinese gymnast left paralyzed
after landing on her head while warming up for a Goodwill Games
vault competition was in guarded condition Wednesday at the Nassau
County Medical Center, able to speak and with some movement in her
arms but unable to move her legs.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Sang Lan _ the 1997 Chinese national champion in
the vault _ would walk again, a doctor treating her said that while
he remains optimistic, ``I'm still going to say (it's) unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Leone, her attending physician, whose specialty is
orthopedic spinal surgery, said Sang was able to flex her elbows,
extend her wrists, and feel her shoulders Wednesdayand was aware of
her situation. ``She understands that she has a very serious
condition,'' he said. ``She is very frustrated about not being able
to move her legs. But I have to tell you, she really hasn't cried
much. She's a very tough young lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it is an incomplete injury, meaning that certain parts
of the spinal cord work while others do not, some improvement in
her condition can be expected, Leone said, although there is no way
to know how much. ``It's a very unstable injury; it's
unpredictable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements are being made to bring Sang's parents to her
bedside from Ningbo, about 40 miles from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The five remaining Chinese gymnasts planned to continue
competing last night, despite being shaken. ``They assure me they
will do their best,'' said Tu Mingde, secretary general of the
Chinese Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sang's injury was diagnosed as a fracture dislocation of
vertebrae C-6 on C-7, essentially a shift of one bone into another.
She was in traction Wednesday, being treated with steroids and
undergoing further tests after having her spinal column realigned.
After waiting several days for the swelling to go down, she is
expected to undergo surgery to fuse the vertebrae. Leone said Sang
would also be treated with a nerve-regenerating agent.
</P>
<P>
   Leone said Sang could return to China a week after surgery to
continue her recuperation closer to home, ``where she will probably
be able to make better gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened Tuesday night at the Nassau Veterans
Memorial Coliseum while Sang was warming up with what was described
as a ``very simple'' movement, a handspring off the vaulting horse.
But her body rotated too far, according to a witness, and instead
of landing on her feet, she hit the mat headfirst.
</P>
<P>
   First to reach her was Octavian Belu, the Romanian national
coach who was waiting for one of his gymnasts to warm up after
Sang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard bad sound,'' said Belu, like the crack of a broken
leg.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly warned those rushing to her aid not to touch her and
asked her through an interpreter if she could feel anything. ``She
said, `I don't feel my legs,''' Belu reported, although ``she had
no face like afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   The warmup movement Sang was attempting, often referred to as a
vault ``timer,'' is a handspring on the vaulting horse performed by
even a Level 5 gymnast. (It is not until progressing past Level 10
that a gymnast is termed ``elite.'') Although there were no
spotters to catch her should anything go awry, Bart Conner, the
1984 Olympic gold medalist who's here as a broadcaster for TBS,
said Wednesday that spotters wouldn't be considered necessary
during a simple warmup. ``It's a common routine that had a sad and
unlucky result,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Team leader Yuxin Zhao said Sang told the Chinese coach, Liu
Quinling, that ``even she did not know how it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Sang's severe injury is not the first at the elite level of the
sport. In 1980, Elena Moukina, a Soviet gymnast who had won the
world championships two years earlier, broke her neck in practice
and became a paraplegic. In 1988, US gymnast Julissa Gomez was 15
when she broke her neck during a practice vault at the World Sports
Fair in Tokyo. She died several years later of complications.
</P>
<P>
   Still, members of the gymnastics community Wednesday defended
the safety record of their sport. ``I can assure you that the meet,
the matting, and the equipment all were in complete compliance with
the international rules,'' said Kathy Scanlon, president of USA
Gymnastics. While expressing sorrow, she added, ``But as sometimes
happens in sports and in life, accidents do occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Abie Grossfeld, who coaches at Southern Connecticut State
University and has been involved in gymnastics for decades, also
cautioned that gymnastics should not be judged too harshly because
of Tuesday's accident. ``It wasn't a very dangerous thing she was
doing,'' he emphasized.

TEXAS TOPS LIST FOR POTENTIAL OF A CHEMICAL ACCIDENT DISASTER,
GROUP SAYS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEFANIE ASIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Harris County ranks first in the country for the
potential of a chemical accident disaster, an environmental
watchdog group reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County, which includes most of Houston, has 3.1 million
people and is the largest county in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Park, an industrial city of 30,000 people about 10 miles
east of downtown Houston, ranked second in the United States for
ZIP codes at risk for such a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The report, published by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group
and the National Environmental Law Center, considered the volume of
dangerous chemicals, the nearby population and the type of
chemicals among other factors, said Andrew Thompson, the PIRG
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report should sound an alarm in Harris County,'' he said.
``Citizens have a right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on their calculations of ``worst-case scenarios,'' Harris
County and Texas ranked No. 1 in the potential for danger of a
killer toxic cloud. Los Angeles was No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Other Texas counties making the top 50 list were Brazoria,
Calhoun, Dallas, Galveston, Jefferson and Nueces.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that 2.6 million people in Texas live within a
range of a toxic cloud that could result from a chemical accident
near their home.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thompson could not cite specific safety troubles at any
plant, he said companies need to redesign facilities to be safer.
</P>
<P>
   These companies need to prevent such an accident from happening,
he said, even though it could be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not a pipe dream,'' he said. ``It's public health
we're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the East Harris County Manufacturer's
Association, representing 100 plants, termed the report as
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Jack Coe said there is some risk of chemical accidents
because of the number of plants, but companies are continually
working on making the plants safer. He said from time to time there
are ``nuisance'' releases of chemicals into the air, but none as
serious as PIRG warns against.
</P>
<P>
   Coe said the plants also are working toward reducing the number
of those releases. When possible, firms also are using alternative
chemicals to replace dangerous ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have demonstrated that we can safely manage risks
associated with our operations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said U.S. PIRG thinks the public should demand more and
that the federal government ought to have higher standards for such
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for companies in Texas to stop downplaying
toxic risks and start giving complete information about potential
accidents,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies representing the most dangerous potential for chemical
release are chemical manufacturing, food products, primary metal
industries, pulp and paper and fabricated metal products, according
to the report.

<P>
   Two discoveries have moved scientists toward solving the riddle
of what causes Alzheimer's disease, which devastates memory and
personality among an estimated four million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston research group said Wednesday they it found a gene
variant that more than triples a person's risk of developing
late-onset Alzheimer's compared to siblings without the gene.
Thirty percent of the US population may carry the newly discovered
gene, called A2M-2.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery suggests the possibility of a drug mimicking the
gene's normal function, scientists said, protecting susceptible
individuals against brain damage or perhaps even reversing it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Texas in San Antonio
have revised scientists' understanding of the only other
established gene for late-onset Alzheimer's, called apoE-4. That
gene, carried by four to eight percent of Americans, does not
determine whether an individual is likely to develop the disease,
as scientists thought. But those who have it are likely to get
Alzheimer's symptoms at a somewhat earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apoE-4 gene affects `when' and doesn't affect `whether,'''
said Dr. Deborah Blacker of the Massachusetts General Hospital, a
member of the group that discovered the new late-onset gene. On the
other hand, A2M-2 affects ``whether'' but not ``when.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports on both findings will appear in the August issue of the
journal Nature Genetics. The findings were released early to
coincide with presentations at an international Alzheimer's meeting
in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Much of scientists' excitement about the new late-onset
Alzheimer's gene stems from the fact that scientists already know a
good deal about its normal function and the protein it makes. Often
when researchers find a disease-linked gene they don't know what it
does, and sometimes they can't even identify a specific gene but
only a ``region of interest'' on the chromosome where the gene
resides _ the equivalent of locating the haystack but not the
needle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very exciting,'' commented Dr. Steven Moldin of the
National Institute of Mental Health, ``because it implicates a
precise part of a specific gene, and the biology of that gene gives
us a lot of guidance and hints of what to look for'' in deciphering
the Alzheimer's process.
</P>
<P>
   Moldin's institute, a federal agency, funds a repository of
tissue and data from families with Alzheimer's disease, which the
MGH group used to screen for the new gene.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven DeKoskey of the University of Pittsburgh, who chairs
the national Alzheimer's Association scientific advisory council,
predicted the gene variant's discovery will illuminate the
``cascade of abnormality'' behind the disease and ``how we can turn
that toward therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   The normal version of A2M, which is short for alpha-2
macroglobulin, is one of the so-called ``housekeeping genes'' that
cells need to keep their internal affairs orderly. It is a key
player in the brain's toxic waste-disposal system _ a role that
dovetails with current ideas about how Alzheimer's disease clogs
the brain with a buildup of abnormal proteins.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the gene variant is missing five
crucial genetic elements called ``base-pairs'' out of the tens of
thousands that make up the entire gene. That makes it less
efficient at its garbage-clearing task, leaving those who carry the
gene at greater risk of the debris accumulation that characterizes
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of this protein as a big sponge,'' said Rudolph E.
Tanzi of the MGH's genetics and aging unit, who presented the
findings Wednesday in Amsterdam. ``It soaks up excess proteins and
takes them to a receptor called LRP. The receptor takes them to
structures in the cell called lyosomes, which are like garbage
disposers that grind them up so they can be disposed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigating 310 families afflicted with Alzheimer's, the MGH
group found that individuals who had the A2M gene variant developed
the disease 3.6 times more often than siblings who did not. That is
the same magnitude of risk that researchers earlier found among
individuals who carry the apoE-4 variant rather than the normal
form of that gene.
</P>
<P>
   Two other labs have reproduced the MGH group's findings, using
cells from the same families. But researchers said it will be
important for other labs to replicate the new findings among
different families, using the same type of analysis, a new method
called family-based association.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzi, Blacker and others stressed the A2M gene variant, like
apoE-4, will not be useful as a tool for screening individuals for
their risk of developing Alzheimer's, at least not in the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have one of these variants or the other, or both, and
escape Alzheimer's,'' Tanzi said. ``If someone told me I was
positive for both, I would not despair.''

<P>
   POLITICIANS-ARTS (Washington) _ Today as yesterday and the day
before, with Republicans as well as Democrats in control of the
White House, with Democratic as well as Republican majorities on
Capitol Hill, the arts and intellectual activity in general are
often bashed and seldom boosted by political Washington, left or
right. By R.W. Apple Jr. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   REAL-WAR-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ If we post World War II children
had been cleared-eyed, we would have noticed that the close-lipped
veterans who oversaw our lives really didn't resemble those
full-of-moxie, hell-for-leather fighting Joes on the screen. The
men we boys knew, the ones working 9 to 5, mowing lawns and
coaching Little League, had little of John Wayne's swagger. They
were just regular guys. But small boys aren't built to notice such
disparities, let alone reconcile them. Small boys, as a rule,
aren't realists. Distinguishing reality from fantasy is a
grown-up's task, and Steven Spielberg, another son of the postwar
generation, has fairly risen to it. There is, of course, some irony
in saying this of a filmmaker who has imagined 20th-century
dinosaurs and cuddly extraterrestrials. But in ``Saving Private
Ryan'' he is, as he was in ``Schindler's List,'' a realist. By
William McDonald. &UR; ( &LR; Moved).

 &UR; FILMS and VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  POIRIER-FILMS &UR;  &LR; (Paris) _ Manuel Poirier's movie career got off
to a slow start. He was 40 by the time his first film was released,
and even then, forced to act as his own producer, he could afford
only one print. Yet, somehow, the right people saw it and liked it
and the doors that Poirier had been knocking on for years suddenly
opened. Within two years he had made three more movies, and the
last of these, ``Western,'' won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1997
Cannes International Film Festival. By Alan Riding. (Moved).

   GRAY-NEGOTIATOR-FILM (Los Angeles) _ An interview with the film

Gray, who grew up in tough South-Central Los Angeles came to
feature films through his directing of music videos for rap
artists. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   PARENT-TRAP-FILM (Undated) _ At a recent advance screening of
Disney's remake of its classic 1961 film ``The Parent Trap,'' a
girl about 7 or 8 years old was overheard to say: ``You know what I
like about this movie? This is a family movie kids will like.''
This pint-size critic had put her thumb squarely on something that
has been tormenting Hollywood of late: how to create films that
will appeal to young moviegoers without alienating their parents.

<P>
   JERRY-HERMAN-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ Jerry Herman is returning
to Broadway this week on a deeply personal note. The 66-year-old
composer-lyricist for such huge successes as ``Hello, Dolly!,''
``Mame'' and ``La Cage Aux Folles'' _ a Broadway figure who is both
a symbol of a golden era and an undervalued songwriter _ was
diagnosed with HIV 13 years ago and watched his health decline.
Since then with the help of protease inhibitors, which he takes
after every meal, the outgoing and perennially smiling composer
said his restored health _ he also had a triple heart bypass last
year _ energized him for the first time in a decade and has led to
``An Evening With Jerry Herman,'' starring Lee Roy Reams, Florence
Lacey and Herman himself at the Booth Theater for a two-month run
that opens on Tuesday. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JENKINS-SEATTLE-OPERA (Seattle) _ No one else runs an opera
company, or talks about opera, with the fervor of Speight Jenkins.
``You see, in `Tristan und Isolde,' Wagner wanted everyone in the
audience to experience his frustration in not being able to
consummate his love for Mathilde Wesendonck,'' Jenkins, the general
director of the Seattle Opera, said recently, warming to his
favorite topic. The Seattle Opera's new production of ``Tristan und
Isolde,'' which opens on Saturday evening, brings together the
hottest Wagner singers of the moment, the Canadian tenor Ben
Heppner and the English soprano Jane Eaglen, for the first time in
the title roles. By David Schiff. (Moved).

   MAD-ARTISTS (Undated) _ In recent years there has been a lot of
interest, not least from composers, in the artistic productions of
people who would have once been called mad. By Paul Griffiths.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   OPERA-TENORS (subslug) (Undated) _ A Favorite stump-the-panel
segment on the Texaco Opera Quiz during the Saturday afternoon
radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera is the ``singer ID.''
Recordings of, say, five unidentified tenors singing the same
phrase of a particular aria are played in a row, and the panelists
are asked to name them. It's amazing how difficult it can be to
recognize the voices of even famous tenors like Carlo Bergonzi or
Alfredo Kraus. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EAGLEN/SCHAFER-ALBUMS (Undated) _ Singers are forever trying to
create inventive programs, balancing art songs with arias, serious
material with lighter fare, the familiar with the novel. On
records, the challenge is perhaps even greater than in the concert
hall, for the choices must stand the tests of time and repeated
listening. How gratifying, then, to encounter two new cleverly
assembled vocal disks. Ostensibly these albums are similar, each
featuring a rising soprano singing music by Mozart and Richard
Strauss. By David Mermelstein. (Moved). Photo.

   PALMER-ROCK-FAME (Undated) _ When the Hall of Fame announces its
14th annual class of inductees this fall _ the selection process
began earlier this month _ it's a sure bet that Earl Palmer won't
be among them. Who? Though few people have heard of Palmer, this
73-year-old has had a greater impact on rock than many a Hall of
Fame shoo-in. By Tony Scherman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PULITZER-PRIZE-JAZZ (Undated) _ Trivia question: who was the
first jazz musician to win the Pulitzer Prize for music? Hint: it
wasn't Wynton Marsalis. The honor belongs to Mel Powell, who won in
1990 for a two-piano concerto called ``Duplicates.'' By Terry
Teachout.

   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BUMPER-CARS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ A look at Peter Foster, a
collector of bumper cars. Bumper cars were designed to operate
using electric power supplied from a metal-mesh ceiling, but
Foster's cars have been converted to 12-volt battery power, which
enables them to run on any hard, flat surface. By Seth Gussow.

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PA-LANCASTER-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ The Lancaster sanctuary is
getting smaller, thanks in part to the car that conveys you into a
part of the world that retained its serenity until the postwar
years. In the last three years, more than 1,000 acres of farmland
in Lancaster County have vanished. The car culture has gulped down
big chunks of a landscape long associated with the horse-drawn
carriage. Open land has been turned into sites for suburban

CONSTRUCTION MISHAP CONTINUES TO PARALYZE TIMES SQUARE

 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tuesday's collapse of an elevator tower at a Times
Square construction site continued to disrupt the routine of
midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, as dozens of local shops remained
shuttered, hundreds of police officers directed traffic away from
blocked-off streets and multitudes of tourists and workers
marveled, muttered _ and adapted.
</P>
<P>
   For now, adaptation will continue to be the requisite approach
to life in the epicenter of New York City, city officials say. They
said the shops and streets will remain closed at least for the rest
of the week, while construction workers draw a 700-by-100-foot
curtain around the broken scaffolding that runs up the northern
side of the Conde Nast building, on Broadway and 42nd and 43rd
Streets. The curtain, made of reinforced nylon, will allow workers
to take apart the scaffolding under safe conditions, a process that
could take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called on the developer, the Durst
Organization, and the general contractor, Tishman Construction
Corp. _ whose controlling families have been financial supporters
of his past political campaigns _ to compensate in some way the
many businesses that were forced to close because of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very, very useful to a few of the businesses that
might be particularly strapped for cash over the next three to four
days if some reasonable sum of money were made available,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident's many legal implications were largely left for
another day, while its social implications were more in evidence.
Police officers, tourists, workers and residents found themselves
grappling with the abrupt change visited upon one of the busiest
corners of the world. The west side of Broadway was open to
pedestrian while the east side was closed; those wanting to walk
north on Avenue of the Americas were sent to Fifth Avenue or Eighth
Avenue; and drivers wanting to go across town unimpeded hadn't a
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Many tourists found the emptiness of a barricaded Times Square
rather exhilarating; ``This is actually cool,'' said Lisa Winton,
of Omaha, Neb., as she waited for tickets to a Broadway matinee.
But the momentary charm of upheaval had waned for many locals; one
inconvenienced man stomped down 42nd Street, screaming epithets
that might have constituted a felony in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   During lunchtime at the epicenter of it all _ Broadway and 44th
Street _ a clearly agitated police lieutenant screamed at gawkers
to move along. ``The answer is no!'' he shouted. ``Goodbye! Keep
moving! It's dangerous to stay here!'' An elderly tourist responded
by steadying her camera and snapping his photograph.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, the zany moments there loomed the sobering sight
of the half-completed Conde Nast building, its crumpled scaffolding
gleaming in the hot sun like the broken pieces to some gargantuan
Erector set.
</P>
<P>
   A ghostly quiet along Avenue of the Americas between 42nd and
43rd Street whispered of the emotional and financial costs yet
tallied. The only vehicles to be seen were squad cars, fire
engines, and a blue-orange-and-white bus labeled ``Interagency
Command Center.'' All nine stores on the west side of the street _
Pronto Pasta, Olympic Photo and Electronic, City Jeans, the Hop Won
Express restaurant _ were dark. Closed as well was the business,
around the corner on 43rd Street, that had paid the greatest price:
the Woodstock Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 8:30 Tuesday morning _ just as the helter-skelter
pace of Times Square began to quicken _ a spine of steel broke away
from some scaffolding alongside the Conde Nast building and pierced
the hotel's roof, sending tons of metal and debris through the
floors below. Twelve residents were injured, and one crushed to
death: Thereza Feliconio, 85, whose style of dress and zest for
life belied the fact that she lived in subsidized residence for the
poor.

POSSIBLE BREAK IN MIDEAST NEGOTIATING FREEZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A flurry of diplomatic and political contacts and
press leaks raised strong expectations Wednesday of a long-awaited
break in the negotiating freeze between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is afoot remains indistinct in the crossfire of
hints and denials, but Jerusalem is abuzz with reports of
high-level contacts among Israelis, Palestinians, Jordanians,
Americans and Egyptians, and a new sense of urgency from Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest indication of movement came from Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai, whose meeting on Sunday with a senior
Palestinian negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas, was the first such contact
in months.
</P>
<P>
   Though the meeting produced only an agreement to hold further
meetings, Mordechai urged Washington Wednesday to send a senior
official to help bridge the gaps. Later his spokesman, Avi
Benayahu, said he expected that Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, would meet with Mordechai as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined Mordechai's appeal. ``We are getting to
a point where we need to know whether the parties themselves are
committed to trying to resolve their differences and move
forward,'' said Michael McCurry, the White House spokesman. ``We
cannot make the decisions that they have to make for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians also denied that any further meeting with
Mordechai was in the offing, and all senior Palestinian officials,
including Abbas, insisted that no progress had been made. The
official Palestinian position has been that Abbas met Mordechai
only to learn whether the Israelis had accepted proposals made by
the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But Abbas made a quick trip to Jordan Wednesday to meet with
Crown Prince Hassan, and there were reports that the Jordanian
foreign minister, Jawad al-Anani, had met with both Arafat and
Netanyahu over the weekend. Arafat also flew to Cairo to meet with
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   For several months now, the State Department has been trying to
win agreement to a package that would include an Israeli withdrawal
from another 13 percent of the West Bank, and a Palestinian
commitment to concrete measures to combat terrorism, extradite or
jail suspected terrorists sought by Israel and revise the
Palestinian National Covenant to exclude any call for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have said they accept the American plan, but
until now the Israelis have resisted a 13 percent withdrawal and
have set stringent conditions for the Palestinians, like the
convening of the full Palestinian National Council to adopt a new
charter.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in the Israeli press, Netanyahu has
proposed a compromise under which he would cede the 13 percent if a
quarter of it became a ``national park'' in which the Palestinians
could not build. He has also reportedly extended the time frame for
revising the Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority has refused to respond to these
demands publicly, insisting that having accepted the American
proposals, it is awaiting Israel's response.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mordechai's request Wednesday that the United States intercede
was evidently based on the expectation that the Americans could
persuade the Palestinians to budge. But after waiting so long for a
decision by Israel, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
reportedly disinclined to resume direct mediation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense among Israeli politicians and commentators,
however, that after all these months, Netanyahu cannot delay a
decision further, and now needs to close a deal by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   There are several sources of pressure on the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament is preparing to leave on its summer break at month's
end, and Netanyahu has pledged to put any agreement to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the political pressures are rising. Leaders of
the Third Way party have publicly declared they will quit the
coalition if he does reach an accord. And President Ezer Weizman
created a national stir by calling for early elections, or at least
a government of national unity, to break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the prime minister's office insist privately that
he is genuinely anxious to make a deal but that he needs an
agreement he can present to his right-wing constituents as meeting
his promise of ``peace with security.'' He also has to avoid the
impression that he is accepting an American proposal that he had
resisted for so long and at such political cost, and so his hope is
to reach an agreement directly with Arafat, the officials add.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Arafat is prepared to deal only with the
Americans, and let the Americans deal with Israel.

COMMENTARY: THE STONE WALL OF SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It only took 10 or 15 years for the Police Department
to find out that some of its officers had set up light housekeeping
with a madam and her prostitutes in a brothel not far from Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good job,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The episode may have
been sordid and regrettable, but it convinced him, he said, that
the Police Department does ``a tremendous job'' monitoring itself.
Kudos all around.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder how many other scandals are being uprooted
with similar dispatch by the department's crack Internal Affairs
investigators. If we're lucky we'll find out about them around the
end of the first decade of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to be a rat, but I'll tell you the truth, the
whole thing makes me sick,'' said an officer who spent Wednesday's
hot and humid rush hour helping pedestrians navigate the chaos that
resulted from Tuesday's construction accident in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, who asked that his name not be used, said: ``I know
guys that are up to this and that. But the public thinks we're all
scum, which is not true. I think the good guys are getting a raw
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   They sure are, and it's because the Police Department has proved
again and again that it will not police itself, and has fought like
the Allies on the beaches of Normandy against the creation of a
responsible outside agency to investigate police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Mollen commission, in its report on police corruption that
was issued in July 1994, said: ``From the beginning of our
investigation we were struck by the difference between what the
commission was uncovering about the state of corruption and
corruption controls within the department, and what the department
was publicly _ and privately _ stating about itself. The department
maintained that police corruption was not a serious problem, and
consisted primarily of sporadic, isolated incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said the authors of the report: ``The commission found
that the corruption problems facing the department are far more
serious than top commanders in the department would admit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department will never voluntarily open its doors and
let the public in on the full extent of corruption, brutality and
other criminal activity in its ranks. Every now and then the door
is forced open a little and we get a whiff of the stench within.
But that's all.
</P>
<P>
   So the bad guys flourish and the entire department is demeaned.
Worse, criminal behavior goes unpunished and victims of police
misconduct are most often left without redress _ and are sometimes
unjustly punished themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and his police commissioner, Howard Safir, are the
latest in the long, long line of top city officials who have been
willing to close their eyes and cover their ears when it comes to
police misconduct. And their aggressive opposition to an outside
monitor is clear evidence that they don't want anyone else homing
in on police activity that is illegal, shameful, often brutal and
at times murderous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of creating an atmosphere where we look the other way,
we should be demanding zero tolerance for police misconduct as we
demand zero tolerance for offenses by the general public,'' said
City Councilman Sheldon Leffler, who is the chairman of the
Council's Public Safety Committee and an advocate of an independent
police monitoring agency.
</P>
<P>
   Leffler said in an interview that he believed ``most of the
mayor's positions are good positions, good government positions.''
But he said the mayor's ``deference'' to the police had put him on
the wrong side of the independent monitor issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people,'' said Leffler, ``and particularly the police,
cannot be counted on to use their best efforts to uncover their own
dirty laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mollen commission, referring to supervisors within the
Police Department, used the term ``willful blindness'' to describe
their eagerness to remain ignorant of conduct that was corrupt and
often brutal. Giuliani and Safir are evidence that ``willful
blindness'' is not limited to irresponsible mid-level supervisors,
but is a characteristic easily found at the very highest levels of
command.

PANEL REJECTS EX-PILOT FOR AIR FORCE SECRETARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former fighter pilot who was hailed by supporters
as ``an American success story'' was rejected Wednesday by a Senate
panel as President Clinton's nominee to become the first black
secretary of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   In an embarrassing blow to Clinton, his nomination of Daryl L.
Jones, a Florida state senator, collapsed in the Senate Armed
Services Committee amid allegations that Jones lied about his
military record and engaged in improper business activities.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination died on a 9-9 vote, marking the first time in
recent history the Senate panel has rejected a president's choice
to head a branch of the military.
</P>
<P>
   The snub marked the worst setback for a Pentagon nominee since
the Democratic-controlled Senate rejected President Bush's choice
of former Texas Senator John G. Tower to be defense secretary in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country has lost a fine opportunity,'' said the
committee's Republican chairman, Senator Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina, moments after the vote. ``This was a good man who had all
the qualities to make a fine Air Force secretary, and I regret this
committee did not give the full Senate a chance to vote on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's nine other GOP members bucked Thurmond to oppose
Jones, including Senators Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Bob Smith
of New Hampshire. All eight Democrats on the committee supported
sending the nomination to the full Senate for a confirmation vote,
including Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   However, two Democrats on the panel _ Senators Robert C. Byrd of
West Virginia and Charles S. Robb of Virginia _ indicated they
would vote against Jones's confirmation if it were to reach the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was ``clearly disappointed'' by the setback, said his
press secretary, Michael McCurry. ``We deeply regret the fact that
the full Senate will not hear the merits of the nomination,''
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Jones, 43, said none of the questions about his
honesty and integrity ``made logical sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones refrained from criticizing the committee's vote
or its nine-month investigation of him _ an exercise one senator
described as ``an incredible crucible'' _ Jones said: ``I never
really thought that I had enemies until I became nominee for
secretary of the Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was valedictorian at his high school in Mississippi
before he graduated from the US Air Force Academy and became an
active-duty fighter pilot, faced the stiffest resistance to his
nomination from former members of the reserve fighter squadron unit
he later joined at Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. He was the
first black pilot in the unit's history.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of volatile hearings, the former squadron members
and others accused Jones of embellishing his flying record,
accepting flight pay he had not worked for, and wearing flight
wings he had not earned. He also was accused of wrongfully
pressuring enlisted troops to buy Amway products that he was
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Jones faced additional questions about lobbying fees he accepted
from a Florida bond firm involved in a county airport expansion.
The Senate committee received a private briefing last month from
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has reviewed the fee
payment. Lieberman said the SEC indicated Jones was not the subject
of a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Jones denied all the allegations. But the committee's
Republicans said testimony by numerous witnesses contradicting
Jones raised too many questions about his character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force needs to have a leader of unassailable
credibility,'' Snowe said. ``Unfortunately, I came to the
conclusion that the nominee didn't bear sufficient accountability
as well as judgment to be an effective secretary of the Air Force
at this point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Warner, a Virginia Republican and former Navy
secretary, said the allegations against Jones convinced him Jones
would be ``unable to serve as a leader and inspire those who served
under him, particularly those in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, of New Hampshire, a Vietnam-era Navy veteran, said
conflicts and contradictions in Jones's testimony caused him to
oppose promoting him to a position vital to national security.
</P>
<P>
   But Thurmond and the committee Democrats said none of the
allegations against Jones had been proven. And some Democrats said
many of the allegations were products of envy and racism generated
by former members of Jones's reserve unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people who did not want him in that squadron
because he was the first African-American,'' said Senator Carl
Levin of Michigan, the panel's highest-ranking Democrat. ``Some
people decided they would oppose his career advancement, and they
kept a file on him that was unofficial and inappropriate. That led
to maintaining the drumbeat of some of these allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond said the Clinton administration did nothing substandard
in vetting Jones for the position or in advocating for him. He
described Jones simply as a victim of ``all the propaganda that
came out against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones would have succeeded Sheila E. Widnall, the first woman to
serve as Air Force secretary. She resigned last fall to return to
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Clinton must search for
a new nominee, while F. Whitten Peters continues to serve as acting
Air Force secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's supporters on the committee, aware of the Republican
opposition, asked only that his nomination be forwarded to the full
Senate without a recommendation, rather than a favorable or
unfavorable recommendation. But the panel deadlocked, killing that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Levin also floated the prospect of sending the nomination to the
Senate with an unfavorable recommendation. But he dropped the idea
when Republican members balked.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Kennedy said: ``The committee acted irresponsibly. On
a matter of this importance and on a nominee with the impressive
qualifications of Daryl Jones, the full Senate should have the
chance to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he would return to Florida to seek reelection to the
state Senate. Leaving the Pentagon Wednesday afternoon, Jones said,
``My constituents are very supportive. I hope I am welcomed back
with open arms.''

 &HT;    Shallow `Expectations' a Dickens of a love story _ just
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Don't be misled by the title. This isn't an
adaptation of the Dickens novel so much as a slick 1990s fantasia
on similar themes. Only instead of Miss Havisham and her ancient
wedding cake, we get Nora Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft, waving a
cigarette holder), laying the ham on thick.
</P>
<P>
   She's the man-hating eccentric who lures blue-collar boy Finn
(the Pip figure) into her crumbling Florida mansion. There, she
pays him to be the dance partner to her snooty ward, Estella. The
boy grows up to be Ethan Hawke, madly but secretly in love with the
girl, who blossoms into Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Finn loses Estella, leaves Florida and pours himself into the
flashy art scene, funded by a mysterious patron. (He assumes it's
Dinsmoor.) And there he once again meets Estella, and the runaway
prisoner (Robert De Niro) whom he first encountered as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is as shallow as the bay water surrounding Dinsmoor's
mansion. Or the backbiting art circles the adult Finn enters. But
director Alfonso Cuaron, who's mad for the color green, shoots with
silky finesse. It's a guilty pleasure. Grade: B

 &HT;    Hit producer Dupri scores in his own right
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who's listened to the radio should be laughing at those
who've doubted that Jermaine Dupri could make a hit record for
himself. He's been doing it for almost the past decade for Xscape
(``Just Kickin' It''), Da Brat (``Funk-dafied'') and Mariah Carey
(``Always Be My Baby''). He's doing it now for Usher (``My Way'')
and Jagged Edge (``Gotta Be''). And the 25-year-old,
million-selling College Park-based producer has finally done it on
his solo debut.
</P>
<P>
   Fashioned like a Quincy Jones project _ all guest artists, no
single with Dupri alone _ ``Life in 1472'' is one of the better rap
albums released this year. With Jay-Z (``Money Ain't a Thing''),
Mase (``You Get Dealt Wit'') and Too Short (``Jazzy (expletive))''
contributing, some might ask, ``How could it not be?'' Well,
nothing is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   And give Dupri some credit. That he can keep up with talent of
such varying deliveries and tones testifies to his ability not only
to produce a good record but rap on one.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat, though: The language is rougher than one might
expect from the guy first known as the producer of kid rap act Kris
Kross (``Jump''). Intermittently, Dupri uses the ``b'' and ``n''
words as terms of endearment and derision. Guess that's how he's
living in 1472.

   ``U.S. Marshals'' (PG-13) _ Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S.
Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This
time, Gerard is on the trail of an ex-CIA operative implicated in
two murders, played by Wesley Snipes. While this installment lacks
some of the emotional resonance of the original, it offers an
exhilaratingly detailed look at what it takes to be a fed. Through
it all, Jones attacks his role like a pit bull. Grade: B+

   ``Four Days in September'' (R) _ This Oscar-nominated,
fact-based drama from director Bruno Barreto (``Dona Flor and Her
Two Husbands'') is the emotionally complex tale of the young
Brazilian idealists who kidnapped the U.S. ambassador (Alan Arkin)
in 1969, hoping to draw attention to their country's military
regime. The film is a melancholy tribute to the collision between
idealism and brutal reality. Its centerpiece is the growing
friendship between Arkin (excellent as always) and his student
captor (Pedro Cardoso), who may be the one assigned to shoot the
ambassador if things go wrong. In Portuguese and English, with
subtitles. Grade: B+

</P>
<P>
   ``Kissing a Fool'' (R) _ Two lips up. David Schwimmer plays a
smarmy sportscaster who enlists his best friend (Jason Lee) in a
scheme to ``test'' his new wife's fidelity. The movie follows a
predictable romantic-comedy path, with a few fresh twists. But fans
of Schwimmer's puppy-cute ``Friends'' character, Ross, will be
astonished at how easily the actor slips into the guise of a
not-so-nice guy. Grade: B

<P>
   ``The Education of Little Tree'' (PG) _ An unassuming, quietly

the story of a half-Cherokee, half-Caucasian orphan named Little
Tree (Joseph Ashton) who goes to live with his grandpa (James
Cromwell), a backwoods mountain man, and grandma, his Native
American wife (Tantoo Cardinal). These two teach the boy everything
from moonshining to making a spiritual connection with nature.
Little Tree also learns harsher lessons about prejudice. Grade: B

deliver his lecture on a legendary missing tribe from New Guinea,
he enlists the kids to cake themselves with mud and body paint and
perform for his video camera in the back yard. The setup is primed
for comic skewering of academia and the media, but it's full of
diluted jokes and impossible situations. Grade: C-

   Comparisons with the Clash are de rigueur in any mention of
Rancid. The California quartet has always displayed its influences
like a tattered badge of punk honor. The derivative part is
beginning to change, however, as Rancid grows into a more
consistent and distinctive unit. The songs here carry more weight
than on previous outings, while the band's spring-loaded tightness
is wound even tighter. Rancid's widening scope gets a little help
with appearances by the Specials' Lynval Golden and Neville Staples
and dance hall reggae biggie Buju Banton. These scrappy neo-punks
have yet to match the early work of their primary influence, but
give 'em enough rope and they just might deliver something that
good next time.

   What with all things '80s being once again in vogue, it was only
a matter of time before Howard Jones, the purveyor of such sunny
synth-pop hits as ``New Song'' and ``Things Can Only Get Better,''
resurfaced. New Wave's answer to Deepak Chopra may have tamed his
famed rooster mane, but his cloyingly upbeat outlook remains
intact. ``Every woman, child and man / Has the power in their
hands,'' Jones asserts on ``Let the People Have Their Say,'' which
bops along to the same perky synth groove that propelled many of
his past hits. You'll hum along, and you may temporarily feel
better, but you may hate yourself in the morning.

husky, Toni Braxton-like vocals on ``I Love Him'' with relatively

Granted, Maria's habit is not an easy one to slip into, but as she
goes, so goes the show _ and the recording. Broadway regular Luker
isn't up to the task. She has neither the buoyancy of Mary Martin
nor the crystalline high notes of Julie Andrews. And it's a shame.
These old hills are still alive with the sound of music, but this

Come True'' could sustain its momentum whenever you decided to
resurface, but never mind all that. The full-bodied, bluesy and
horns-based ``Save Your Love for Me'' affirms that you're still
just as gorgeous vocally. As on your BNH standout ``Stay This
Way,'' you can still take us there spiritually. And if we don't
mind a few too many instances of pretty and eclectic filler, we
should run out and get this long-awaited solo debut.

 &HT;    Friends help Griffith perfect her blend of country, folk
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- With a voice as big and clear as a blue Texas sky,
Nanci Griffith is one of new country music's most bankable
crossover commodities. Straddling the line between folk and
country, she has spent two decades pushing the limits of new
acoustic music with her semi-autobiographical songs of loners,
losers and lovers.
</P>
<P>
   But she hasn't let her newfound stardom eclipse her roots. For
the second time in five years, Griffith returns to the wellspring
of her songwriting with a collection of covers _ performed with a
who's who of folk and country music _ that tips a hat to her heroes
and influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other Voices, Too'' is a sparkling follow-up to 1993's Grammy
Award-winning ``Other Voices, Other Rooms.'' And, like its
predecessor, the sequel combines traditionals and neoclassics, all
anchored by the Austin, Texas, native's strong, effortless vocals
and intricate guitar work. The guest list features 67 musicians,
including Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett, Steve Earle, Guy Clark,
Richard Thompson, Lucinda Williams and John Prine, and is backed by
Griffith's Blue Moon Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights include fresh retreads of Richard Thompson's
rollicking ``Wall of Death'' and Sandy Denny's wistful ``Where Does
the Time Go?'' She celebrates the godfathers of American folk, with
rousing covers of Pete Seeger's ``Deportee'' and Woody Guthrie's
``If I Had a Hammer.'' And she delivers velvety duets with Williams
on Bobby Ferguson's gorgeous ``Wings of a Dove'' and Lovett on the
ballad ``Dress of Laces.''
</P>
<P>
   There are places where Griffith goes over the top with
we-are-the-world overkill (37 musicians pile on for ``Wasn't That a
Mighty Storm''). But, overall, this is a strong addition to the
14-album Griffith catalog: a collection of chestnuts and new gems
polished to shiny brilliance.

 &HT;    Rich `Crown of Jewels' does Scruggs' family tree proud
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- As the son of bluegrass legend Earl Scruggs, Randy
Scruggs grew up in a home where members of the Carter Family and
other musicians came and went, and he had carte blanche to roam
Nashville's recording studios and rehearsal halls. So being around
talented musicians should be routine for him. But there's nothing
blase about his fleet acoustic and electric flat-picking and
singing on these 12 collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly psyched by his father, Vince Gill, Emmylou Harris, Iris
Dement, Joan Osborne, Trisha Yearwood, Bruce Hornsby, Travis Tritt
and others, Scruggs reaches a magical level. ``I wanted to
collaborate with the artists who influenced and have helped me,''
he says from his Nashville home, ``and it was a real gift to have
the freedom to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning cut is ``Passin' Thru,'' about life's travails
and its brevity, written with Johnny Cash and performed with
Osborne. ``That's something I wanted to say in song and it's
something Johnny has spoken about in songs,'' Scruggs says. It has
the drive of a Bob Dylan song and vocals reminiscent of Dylan's
work with Joan Baez.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Dement give new life to ``Wildwood Flower,'' while
``I Wanna Be Loved Back,'' with Yearwood, calls to mind the emotion
of love songs recorded by Earl Thomas Conley, who helped Scruggs
write it. Tritt dusts off Poco's ``Amie'' and gives it a gentle,
pleasing ride. The title track, a song about pain being universal,
features Hornsby's distinctive keyboards and vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Other cuts are equally impressive, making this talent-rich
collection remarkably strong from start to finish. No skippable
cuts here.

 &HT;    Spielberg has no monopoly on great WWII flicks
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- They are A-lists to end all A-lists.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks, Matt Damon and Steven Spielberg. Sean Penn, Nick
Nolte, George Clooney and legendary, long-vanished director
Terrence Malick (``Badlands,'' ``Days of Heaven'').
</P>
<P>
   All this and World War II?
</P>
<P>
   You betcha. Coming soon to a theater near you: the Last Great
War. The assault begins Friday with Spielberg's spectacular
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Malick's eagerly anticipated ``The Thin
Red Line'' is due this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone more interested in the war at home _ i.e., on
video, laserdisc or DVD _ here are a few of my favorites. And
apologies upfront to fans of John Wayne. I always preferred the
Duke in westerns or ``The Quiet Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Red One'' (1980): B-movie master Samuel Fuller
rummages through his old-soldier's trunk to bring us the blood,
guts and glory of the grunts' war as Sgt. Lee Marvin leads some raw
recruits (including Mark Hamill) from North Africa to
Czechoslovakia. Marvin, a former Marine and full-time drinker in
real life, took to the movie uniform all too well. When an
assistant director tried to help him with his costume, he slammed
the man against a wall and snarled, ``Never touch a soldier's
leggings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope and Glory'' (1987): John Boorman's magnificent,
irresistible comic memoir about growing up in London during the
Blitz. This is a salute to British pluck filtered through the
impish chaos of childhood's priorities. Boorman wanted to make the
film before his elderly mum died, so he had to pass on a little
something called ``Fatal Attraction.'' As it happened, both movies
were nominated for an Oscar; both lost to ``The Last Emperor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Midnight Clear'' (1992): A heartbreakingly effective,
eloquently devastating comment on the insanity _ and odd
brotherhood _ of war. In the winter of '44, a squad of GIs
(including Ethan Hawke and Gary Sinise) is sent to occupy a
deserted chateau and report on enemy movements. Director Keith
Gordon hits just the right tone: harrowing hyper-realism mixed with
the delicate mystery of a Christmas wish.``The Bridge on the River
Kwai'' (1957): David Lean's masterful Oscar winner about delusion,
heroism and glory-mongering in a Japanese prison camp. Alec
Guinness is the imperious British officer who will build his bridge
come hell, high water or William Holden, who has orders to blow the
thing up. Sessue Hayakawa is Guinness' doppelganger _ the
inflexible but somehow admirable camp commandant. This is one of
Guinness' signature roles, yet he turned it down three times. And
he wasn't even first choice: Lean preferred Noel Coward or Charles
Laughton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attack!'' (1956): Director Robert Aldrich had more
action-packed fun with another favorite, ``The Dirty Dozen.'' But
here, he uses the Battle of the Bulge as the backdrop for a deadly
clash between a craven commander (Eddie Albert) and a heroic
subordinate (Jack Palance). While Aldrich portrays the war as
unquestionably just and its true heroes as unassailable, he also
savages a system rife with politics and self-interest. This is one
of the movies Spielberg showed to Hanks before shooting ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To Be or Not to Be'' (1942): Ernst Lubitsch applied his famous
comic ``touch'' to this daring and, in its time, controversial
farce about a band of Polish actors, led by Jack Benny (!), working
to sabotage their Nazi conquerors. A month before the film's
premiere, Benny's beautiful, talented co-star, Carole Lombard, died
in a plane crash while promoting war bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I Won the War'' (1967): ``A Hard Day's Night'' and
``Help!'' director Richard Lester went solo with John Lennon and
made this gruesomely inventive, absurdist black comedy about
British soldiers sent on a mission to build a cricket pitch behind
enemy lines. And look closely at that spindly lieutenant; he's
Michael Crawford, later reborn as Broadway's ``The Phantom of the
Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Years of Our Lives'' (1946): Coming home has never
been depicted better than it was in William Wyler's Oscar-winning
saga of three veterans facing new battles on the home front.
Hollywood pros Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright and Dana
Andrews are joined by real-life veteran and double amputee Harold
Russell, who took home two Academy Awards. But he wasn't the only
one who knew the territory. When he accepted the project, Wyler
said, ``I've come home twice myself from war, and I know just how
these fellows feel. No man can walk into the house after two or
three years and pick up his life as before.''
</P>
<P>
   And lest we forget:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Dictator,'' ``Patton,'' ``The Dirty Dozen,''
``Mister Roberts,'' ``The Great Escape,'' ``Casablanca,'' ``Hail
the Conquering Hero,'' ``The Guns of Navarone,'' ``The Last
Metro,'' ``The Victors,'' ``Home of the Brave,'' ``From Here to
Eternity,'' ``The Night of the Shooting Stars,'' ``Stalag 17,''
``Das Boot,'' ``The Elusive Corporal'' and ``Stairway to Heaven.''

 &HT;    Fired producers: CNN was bullied to retract report
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a blistering critique of CNN, two producers fired
for their roles in the Tailwind nerve gas story stood behind their
original report and blamed the network's top management for
``caving into pressure'' from government officials.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, April Oliver and Jack Smith said the network's
decision to retract and apologize for their story, which first
aired June 7 on ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' had nothing to do with
reporting flaws in their work outlined in a subsequent
investigation conducted by noted lawyer Floyd Abrams and CNN
counsel David Kohler.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Smith said, CNN's backpedaling on the story was a
``corporate calculation'' by CNN Chairman Tom Johnson and President
Richard Kaplan, whom they described as being more concerned with
having a working relationship with the Pentagon than standing up
for the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest disappointment was CNN's cave,'' Smith said. ``I
can take a firing, but it was difficult to watch CNN executives
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who appeared Wednesday with Oliver at a Freedom Forum
discussion here, also contended that Johnson was bullied by former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and officials at the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. ``Tom Johnson values his comfort with the
Pentagon,'' Smith said
</P>
<P>
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said, ``We did not cave to pressure
from the Pentagon or veterans groups or anyone else. The only
pressure we felt was that which was exerted by an extremely
powerful and clear report by Floyd Abrams that proved to us that
the Tailwind story could not stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Since retracting the story, CNN has made a small financial
settlement with retired Adm. Thomas Moorer, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs at the time of Operation Tailwind, who was a source on CNN's
story. After the June 7 broadcast, Moorer claimed Oliver and Smith
had taken his quotes about Tailwind out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver and Smith painted a picture of Johnson, Kaplan and other
top CNN producers being heavily involved in reporting and editing
the Tailwind story.
</P>
<P>
   Months before the broadcast, Oliver and Smith compiled a
150-page briefing book detailing sources who were interviewed, a
document they said was vetted by CNN brass.
</P>
<P>
   Their story, titled ``Valley of Death,'' contended that the U.S.
military used the potentially lethal nerve gas sarin in an attack
on a village base camp in Laos in 1970 during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has adamantly denied that nerve gas was ever used
during the war, and it countered Tuesday that the only biological
weapon deployed was a less toxic form of tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were sending me flowers,'' Oliver said of her CNN
superiors' initial reaction to the Tailwind broadcast. She also
recalled CNN attorney Kohler proclaiming, ``No one is going to get
sued over this one.''
</P>
<P>
   No lawsuits have been filed, but the story has caused lingering
embarrassment for CNN, which has been struggling to increase
ratings amid increasing competition by other all-news cable
networks. CNN founder Ted Turner was dragged into the Tailwind fray
and issued his own mea culpa, calling the story ``a screw-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of Oliver and Smith's criticisms were aimed at the
CNN chain of command, they also picked apart conclusions drawn by
Abrams and Kohler in their 52-page report. Abrams and Kohler said
the Tailwind story ``could not be supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver and Smith countered with their own 77-page response in
which they described Abrams' report as ``weak and superficial.''
They said Kohler's involvement was a ``conflict of interest''
because he had vetted their work before it aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in top CNN management read it (the briefing report
prepared by the producers) before the furor erupted and signed off
on it,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   While Oliver and Smith were dismissed from their jobs,
correspondent Peter Arnett, who conducted three on-camera
interviews, got a reprimand for his part in the story. Pam Hill,
another senior producer involved in the Tailwind story, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver contends that even though several key subjects
interviewed in the Tailwind report have since retracted or changed
their on-camera remarks, she remains convinced that the story was
factually correct.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said she has since gotten additional accounts
corroborating her story from other military personnel who served in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth said these accounts contain nothing new.

 &HT;    `Simpsons' creator has his eye on future
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Matt Groening has seen the future, and it
looks a little bug-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Groening, creator of ``The Simpsons,'' unveiled his next Fox
prime-time cartoon series Wednesday at the Television Critics
Association meeting. It's ``Futurama,'' which will be a midseason
replacement series (as was ``The Simpsons'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' will tell the story of Fry, who is frozen on New
Year's Eve 1999 and wakes up 1,000 years later, in 2099. His main
companions will be Leela, ``a sexy female alien with one eye,''
Groening said, and Bender, ``our robotic Homer Simpson. He's
lovably corrupt, loves his vices. I think he's the first robot in
science-fiction history who shoplifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening said he was inspired by the science-fiction novels he
read in the '50s and '60s by Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein,
Philip K. Dick and others. And not just the texts, but the art on
the book's dust jackets, which he's been collecting at used-book
stores for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take all these conventions of science fiction and
have fun with them in a Simpsons style,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``Futurama'' look somewhat Simpsonian, with
bulging eyes and prominent overbites. ``This is a result of my
limited drawing style,'' he joked. ``I've been drawing this way
since I was a kid, and it's the only way I know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new series will be filled with the pop culture of
the future, just as ``The Simpsons'' is in the present. ``The No. 1
show on TV is called `The Mass Hypnosis Hour,''' he said. ``It's on
Fox, no doubt.'' Celebrities may appear as themselves, ``but only
if they're willing to appear as a disembodied head in a jar.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Entertainment President Peter Roth said he has been begging
Groening for three years to launch another series; it's very
unusual for the creator of such a successful TV series not to move
on and create another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the whole universe. That's why it took three
years,'' Groening said.
</P>
<P>
   Groening also divulged a couple of more tidbits from the
upcoming season of ``The Simpsons.'' In one of the ``Treehouse of
Horrors'' Halloween segments, Bart and Lisa will be sucked into
their TV and find themselves on ``Ally McBeal.'' And Groening said
he is negotiating with Rupert Murdoch to play himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the smallest paycheck he's ever seen,'' Groening
said.

<P>
   The makers of herbal supplements are in the business of selling
stamina and serenity in a bottle. But as the public's appetite for
such products as St. John's wort and echinacea has strengthened,
the business itself has become anything but serene.
</P>
<P>
   Once largely the province of obscure manufacturers with limited
distribution, these pills and powders are no longer consigned to a
spot next to the bee pollen at the local health-food store. Now
they carry trusted brand names and command premium shelf space in
supermarkets, drug stores and mass retail chains around the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   With billions of dollars in sales up for grabs, however, the
battle for market share has become intense, pitting large drug
companies and consumer products makers against one another.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, questions about the value of those pills and
powders have become more pointed, courtesy not only of government
regulators and consumer advocates but also of drug companies that
have opted to stay on the herbal sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The big new makers and retailers of the supplements argue that
they are simply providing natural solutions for good health in an
age of self-medication, and that they are drawing criticism in part
because their products are seen as cut-rate competition for
high-profit pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Products like St. John's wort, whose fans see it as an
alternative to Prozac, and echinacea, which is touted as effective
in boosting the immune system, are plant-based substances whose
properties can help to alleviate everyday ailments, their
manufacturers say. They are also quick to note that the substances
have been used for centuries in Asia and Europe and are
increasingly being accepted as an adjunct to Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But industry critics say the manufacturers' motives are anything
but wholesome. Like clothes designers who slap their labels on
lines of jeans, the manufacturers are simply seeking to cash in on
the latest fad that has turned mainstream, the critics say. The
difference, they add, is that putting respected names on herbal
remedies lends undeserved credibility to a loosely regulated
industry of products with sometimes questionable safety and
efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, the competition to establish leading
brands is intensifying. Celestial Seasonings Inc., known for its
teas, is counting on its earthy image to sell a line of 17 herbal
supplements introduced in April. The products include a formula
containing St. John's wort called Mood Mender, which the company
says is useful for a positive outlook.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products Corp., which makes Centrum vitamins, is
seeking to capitalize on that brand by extending it to herbal
remedies scheduled to hit store shelves later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer Corp., which makes One-A-Day brand vitamins and minerals,
is entering the market next month with a line of products that
combines vitamins and herbs. They include formulas for ``a healthy
emotional balance,'' which contain St. John's wort and a second
supposedly mood-enhancing ingredient, kava, and another containing
Ginkgo biloba, an herbal substance that ``helps support memory and
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   And Warner-Lambert Co. says it is testing substances that may
become part of a line it plans to introduce, possibly later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Wal-Mart has got into the act with private-label
supplements it introduced last year and sells near store pharmacies
under the name Spring Valley.
</P>
<P>
   What has all of these companies suddenly hopping on the herbal
bandwagon is greater consumer demand, particularly among aging baby
boomers, for products that offer the hope of staying youthful. A
frustration with traditional health care is also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is respond to what the customer is
asking us for,'' said Paul Beahm, a divisional merchandising
manager at Wal-Mart. ``More and more, the public is focused on
prevention and health care needs, and the vitamin and nutritional
supplement category is one they've been asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a law that watered down the Food and Drug
Administration's regulatory authority over dietary supplements,
including herbal products, has made the industry much more
palatable to retailers and marketers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all this, retail sales of the supplements have
increased sharply, growing by 18 percent just last year, to $3.6
billion, and 43 percent since the regulatory changes were adopted
in 1994, according to the Nutrition Business Journal, a trade
publication. By the year 2000, the industry is expected to grow by
an additional 50 percent or so.

   ``The increase in consumer confidence in these products is
indicative of the overall explosive growth in this category,'' said
Stephen Hughes, president and chief executive of Celestial
Seasonings. ``As the major brands and more established companies
come into this category, it's going to segment the category into
premium brand and the others, and every major mass retailer and
drug retailer is looking at private label.''

 &HT;    The Hendricks Experience
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Standing alone on an empty stage, 17-year-old Duane
Martin is learning a little about theater, more about tough love.
His teacher in both realms is Freddie Hendricks, 42. Duane is
playing an inner-city rake, bragging about a sexual conquest: ``I'm
the king, man!'' He proudly pulls from his pocket the condom that
the girl gave him to use, still sealed in its gold foil wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chilling moment. But not chilling enough for Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't sound like no king to me! Are you reciting poetry? I
can go home and read poetry!'' cries the director of the Freddie
Hendricks Youth Ensemble of Atlanta, who wrote the scene in ``Psalm
13'' _ a musical drama about teen pregnancy, opening tonight _
based on discussions with his 34 performers, ages preteen to early
20s. Hendricks rises from his seat in 7 Stages and stalks toward
the worried-looking Duane. For a time in the early '90s, just after
he founded the troupe, Hendricks was so poor that he was homeless,
crashing for the night on friends' floors. Today he has an
apartment across from Atlanta City Hall, though with his ever-weary
eyes, shapeless socks dragging on the ground and jeans
more-than-fashionably torn up, he could almost pass for his former,
transient self. Yet his scowl is that of the perfectionist, and he
is not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to what you're saying, man: `I milked that girl, like a
cow!''' Hendricks lets out a demonic laugh _ suddenly transformed
from gentle artist into scary punk. ``You used her, just like
you've been used all your life, right? This is the theater! Make me
feel it! Paint me a picture with your biggest brush!''
</P>
<P>
   Duane repeats the scene: The improvement is astonishing. He
comes down from the stage; Hendricks embraces him. The hug is a
purging of the ugliness they have just conjured up and faced down.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks has been working pocket miracles like these for eight
years. He gives young performers professional pride but keeps their
emotions free of show biz gloss: honest, pure, even raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a grass-roots organization that could
produce such strong work,'' says Alliance Theatre artistic director
Kenny Leon, ``while giving its young people such confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble's shows use electrifying dance, drama, music and
rowdy comedy to explore such subjects as child abuse, AIDS and
drugs in the schools. It creates at least one original show a year
for its residency at 7 Stages, while touring throughout the year to
schools, community centers and fellowship halls as far away as St.
Louis. The work has rough edges: That's its nature _ and its
beauty. Yet it can be so compelling that it was featured at the
recent National Black Arts Festival and prompted International
Creative Management, a top Hollywood agency, to send a talent scout
to a ``Psalm 13'' rehearsal. He sat pressed against the wall of a
Reynoldstown gym, wide-eyed at the almost overwhelming energy
produced by 30-odd souls filling the space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a hunger that burns in all of us that's
unexplainable,'' says Imani Simmons, 14. ``It's like when you
perform, the world is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   `God Is in Control'
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks calls his work ``a ministry''; indeed, the singers can
have the clear and tender sound of a choir. Matters of faith are
often discussed around the Reynoldstown rehearsal hall: a community
center across the MARTA tracks from Inman Park that sits next to a
steel plant and across from a bungalow where a rooster patrols the
front yard. The kids' clothes bear trendy sportswear logos as well
as religious messages. ``God Is in Control,'' says one T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the self-styled minister has an aspect of the field general.
He demands ``AR-TIC-U-LA-TION!'' whenever the actors' diction
becomes unclear. His performers push their bodies and souls to the
hilt in every dance and dramatic scene, pound out ferocious rhythms
against a violent world, sing of their dreams for a better one,
carry their healing message into neighborhoods that hurt. They are
warriors of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned discipline from my stepfather, an Army officer,''
Hendricks says. ``He only left out the love. I got that from my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night when I was young, I dreamed there were children at
my window crying, `Save us, save us,''' the artist continues. ``I
went through some bad times, growing up in Columbus, but I always
said I would help to make sure other kids didn't have to go through
that.''
</P>
<P>
   His kids perform without pay for the nonprofit troupe, which
draws its $108,000 annual budget mainly from the fees it gets from
guest appearances before professional, social service and fraternal
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   His kids come from diverse backgrounds. There are children of
Atlanta artists and students at private colleges. They work
shoulder to shoulder with kids who were much more than ``at risk''
when, attracted mostly by word of mouth, they joined the ensemble.
Says Johnell Easter, 22: ``I was stealing credit cards, breaking
into candy machines _ stupid, irrelevant stuff. This company gave
me direction, a focus, goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ngaujah, 21, told of a night in his early teens when a
friend was severely beaten by kids from a rival neighborhood in
College Park, and it was only his mother forcing him to go to
church the next night that kept him out of a retaliatory shootout
and probably saved his life. Music director David Kote nodded with
sad recognition. Unbeknownst to Michael, he had been among the
rival group that swept down Michael's street and was dodging
bullets while his future colleague was listening to hymns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's why David and I are crazy tight today,'' Michael
says. ``That life is behind us now but not that entire world.
That's what keeps us doing what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to home
</P>
<P>
   ``Psalm 13,'' like most Hendricks shows, was born out of the
Circle: a sit-on-the-floor discussion group in which the entire
company brainstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks says ``the number 13,'' including the difficult 13th
year of life, ``kept popping up everywhere.'' On a hunch that he
can't explain, he looked up Psalm 13 in the Bible. The line,
``Lord, how long must I bear pain in my soul?'' connected with his
ideas about the crisis of unwanted pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the black community needs to hear this message,''
Hendricks says, ``but so do all communities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the circle, arguments erupted between girls and boys, and
between those wanting to proclaim pregnancy without marriage wrong
and those wanting more emphasis on the positive life options for
those who decide to raise the child. The many viewpoints were grist
for a show that offers no one simple answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show hits close to home,'' says Jekonni Barber, 15,
``because we all have friends and brothers and sisters who weren't
ready to have babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to home, too, for the director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had stepbrothers, cousins, friends who were teen dads,''
says Hendricks, whose soft-spoken, shy persona is so different from
the general who barks out orders at rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   He takes a breath, then takes the plunge. ``I was a teen dad
myself. The girl lost the baby, but it was still a mistake I made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish,'' Hendricks adds, almost in a whisper, ``I had had
somebody to tell me not to do that.''

<P>
   But not everyone sees the trend as a healthy one for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand that this is not about health and
this is not about well-being; this is about money and jumping on a
bandwagon,'' said David Kessler, a former head of the FDA and now
dean of Yale University's medical school. Kessler waged a vigorous
but unsuccessful battle against the law that virtually stripped his
former agency of its authority to regulate herbal and other dietary
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   For healthy people, most of the products pose little or no risk,
and some, containing garlic and ginseng, may even be helpful,
Kessler said. The danger, he said, is that some people with
potentially life-threatening illnesses will use the products in
place of standard medical treatments. That has always been a risk,
but the marketing giants now pushing into the industry can pitch
these formulas to more consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they are positioned in the marketplace can lead people
down roads to ineffective treatments,'' Kessler said, pointing to
products whose names, he argued, could cause consumers to think
they could be used instead of prescription drugs. ``If you promote
a product as Mood Mender, you have a responsibility to that person
who is depressed, and if that product doesn't work, you are doing
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People with specific illnesses look at these products a
different way than the healthy person,'' he added, ``and it is
through their eyes that the marketplace must be judged.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, critics say, the supplements can be quite
dangerous indeed. The FDA, for example, is attempting to rein in
the use of the herbal stimulant ephedra, which is sold by various
companies in a formula under different names. The formula, which
manufacturers say is safe, has been linked to more than a dozen
deaths nationwide. Marketers promise that the pills provide an
amphetaminelike rush, aid in weight loss and even increase sexual
sensation, but medical experts say they can cause heart attacks,
strokes and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The big-name herbal pill dispensers now entering the market say
they are sticking to more ``mainstream'' substances and argue that
those formulas are safe and effective when taken by healthy people
in recommended doses. Besides, they say, unlike the little-known
manufacturers that once dominated the industry, they have the
research and development budgets and purchasing clout to insure
product quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend tens of millions of dollars putting together
manufacturing and quality-control processes,'' said Elliot
Friedman, chairman and chief executive of Pharmaprint Inc., which
is producing the supplements that American Home Products is
planning to market under the Centrum name. ``The big companies are
very protective of their brands.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be, but the critics say consumers have a false sense of
security about the regulatory oversight of supplements. They
mistakenly assume, the critics contend, that the supplements are
subject to the same scrutiny as toothpaste, cough drops and other
seemingly benign products under the FDA's watch. The agency
requires those goods to carry general cautionary labeling and
dosage information, and it imposes limits on the claims that can be
made in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal supplements are regulated by a looser set of standards.
Before the passage in 1994 of the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act, manufacturers were prohibited, for instance, from
making claims about the potential benefits of their products. But
the revised guidelines allow companies to advertise the health
effects of herbal supplements _ without having to conclusively
prove their effectiveness _ so long as the wording does not suggest
that the products prevent, treat or cure disease.
</P>
<P>
   That gives companies much greater range in making product claims
than manufacturers of, say, mouthwash. While a company cannot claim
an herbal supplement cures cancer or relieves depression, for
example, it can say that it ``promotes prostate health'' or ``aids
in mental focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also worry that pharmaceutical companies will attempt to
classify some products as herbal supplements instead of as drugs to
skirt the rigorous process required to bring a drug to market.
</P>
<P>
   That complaint is at the heart of a battle between the FDA and
Pharmanex Inc., which manufactures a product called Cholestin,
which it sells as an supplement in Wal-Mart and other big chains.
The FDA wants to ban the substance, maintaining that it is an
unapproved drug because it contains a natural form of a key
chemical in the cholesterol-lowering prescription drug Mevacor,
made by Merck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pharmanex won the first round in the battle _ which
was prompted by Merck's complaints about the product _ when a judge
issued a preliminary injunction lifting the FDA's administrative
ban of Cholestin. The company contends that the product is a
natural alternative for people who are too healthy to take the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as other drug makers begin producing herbal pills,
the FDA is struggling to find a way to exercise its limited
oversight authority.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products declined to provide an executive to
discuss its supplements business beyond issuing a statement through
a public relations representative saying, ``Herbals represent a
large and growing market with increasing consumer acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, analysts estimate that the Centrum line alone has the
potential to generate $80 million in revenues within a year of its
introduction, a figure Friedman calls ``on the low side.'' His
company's share would be 10 percent of pretax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said the industry's growth could be even greater as
more retailers make room for brand-name supplements on their
already crowded shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are looking for a name they trust and, to be honest,
that's why we went with Centrum,'' he said. ``Pharmacists know it,
doctors know it and consumers know it. That is the edge in bringing
these new people into the fold.''

NUMBER OF PEOPLE SICKENED FROM TAINTED TEXAS OYSTERS HITS 368

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The number of people sickened from eating raw
Galveston Bay oysters is still mounting as experts gather at a
national conference to study the outbreak and seek remedies.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, state health officials had documented 368 cases
of illness from raw oysters tainted with ``Vibrio
parahaemolyticus'' bacteria. The bay was closed to oyster
harvesting June 22 because of the rash of sickness.
</P>
<P>
   The total of confirmed victims outdistanced the nation's
previous record: 208 cases in an outbreak from oysters harvested
along the Pacific Northwest coast last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although most illnesses in the current outbreak were in Texas,
health officials also have confirmed cases in California, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The illness can be fatal for someone with an immune deficiency.
Although a few people have required hospitalization, officials
said, most who became ill suffered flulike symptoms such as
diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever and headache.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts and people in the shellfish industry are meeting
this week at the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference in San
Diego to review lab test results and determine how to prevent a
recurrence and when to reopen harvesting in Galveston Bay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oyster wholesaler Joe Nelson of Smith Point, in Chambers County,
said his employees have been out of work for a month with no end in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're having to look for other jobs. It's kind of rough on
all of us,'' he said. ``We're still trying to substitute by
bringing in oysters from Louisiana to fill our orders. We don't
have any idea what to expect.''
</P>

(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The bacterium causing this outbreak is not associated with
pollution and had never been found in Galveston Bay in
concentrations that would cause illness, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Elliott, who heads the state's microbiology lab in
Austin, said there are a dozen strains of ``Vibrio
parahaemolyticus'' and only one has been identified in victims of
the current outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   This strain could be more potent than the others and therefore
harmful in lower concentrations than it normally takes to cause
illness, he said. However, he added, this strain has not been
detected in oyster samples taken from the bay since the outbreak
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't found this particular strain, but the bacteria
species itself is still out there,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bay is a big place. We might not have sampled in the right
spot, or possibly it's died out now.''
</P>
<P>
   While the drought and high temperatures are suspected of
allowing this bug to flourish, Elliott said the exact cause may
never be known.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, there was an outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted
fever in northeast Texas about 12 years ago and since then there's
been nothing,'' he said. ``There may never be a scientific
explanation for this. It's like looking at a jigsaw puzzle with a
third of the pieces missing.''

MAKING THE CASE FOR AN OVERLOOKED SWING PIANIST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Terry Teachout is the music critic of Commentary and a contributing
writer for Time 
By TERRY TEACHOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trivia question: who was the first jazz musician to win the
Pulitzer Prize for music? Hint: it wasn't Wynton Marsalis. The
honor belongs to Mel Powell, who won in 1990 for a two-piano
concerto called ``Duplicates.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the composer of ``Duplicates'' had long since
stopped playing jazz by the time he collected his prize. But
Powell, who worked with Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller in the
1940s, was for a brief time among the best-known big-band sidemen
in America, and when he died on April 24, jazz connoisseurs mourned
him not as a relatively obscure composer of nontonal classical
music, but as one of the most underrated pianists of the swing era.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Powell's early career seems almost too good to be
true. A protege of the stride pianist Willie (The Lion) Smith, he
began sitting in at Nick's, the Greenwich Village nightclub in New
York City that was the headquarters of the guitarist-raconteur
Eddie Condon, at the age of 14. In 1941, when he was only 17,
Powell joined the Goodman band, and within months was attracting
national attention both as pianist and arranger (he wrote the
charts for the clarinetist's hit records of ``Jersey Bounce'' and
``A String of Pearls'').
</P>
<P>
   He spent the war years playing in Miller's Army Air Force band,
and once he came home from Europe in 1945, it seemed a safe bet
that he would quickly establish himself as a major voice in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Powell used his G.I. Bill benefits to go to Yale, where
he studied classical composition with Paul Hindemith. He resurfaced
in the mid-'50s, making a series of well-received records on his
own and with Goodman. Then, in 1957, he abandoned jazz altogether,
spending the next three decades teaching at Yale and the California
Institute of the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   His albums went out of print, and his glory days as a jazz
prodigy were soon forgotten, save by record collectors with long
memories. Not until 1986 did he play in public again, and his
``return'' consisted of a two-week jazz cruise on board the S.S.
Norway; a rare neuromuscular disorder subsequently forced him to
give up playing.
</P>
<P>
   All this would be of purely academic interest were it not for
the fact that Mel Powell was no ordinary jazz pianist. In his
earliest records, he blended the smooth, unruffled clarity of Teddy
Wilson and the darting unpredictability of Earl Hines into a highly
personal style noteworthy for its sparkling touch and extreme
virtuosity _ his technique was easily comparable to that of Art
Tatum _ to which he later added a sophisticated harmonic vocabulary
drawn from his studies with Hindemith.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he was a first-rate jazz composer and arranger who
was responsible for four of Goodman's most individual recordings,
``The Count,'' ``The Earl,'' ``Mission to Moscow'' and
``Clarinade.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof of Powell's remarkable gifts can be heard on a new CD
called ``Benny Goodman Plays Mel Powell'' (Hep). The latest in a
series of compact-disk compilations focusing on Goodman's prewar
arrangers, this album contains a dozen of the charts Powell wrote
between 1941 and 1946 (plus another arrangement attributed to him
incorrectly, the famous cover version of ``Why Don't You Do
Right?'' sung by the young Peggy Lee).
</P>
<P>
   ``Benny and I could fly, we could play as fast as anybody,''
Powell told Ross Firestone, Goodman's biographer, and he wasn't
exaggerating: ``The Earl'' and ``Mission to Moscow'' both contain
clarinet-and-piano chases that leave no doubt of Powell's ability
to keep up with his speed-demon boss.
</P>
<P>
   Except for ``The Return of Mel Powell'' (Chiaroscuro), recorded
live on the Norway in 1986, ``Benny Goodman Plays Mel Powell'' is
the first jazz album to be issued under the pianist's name since
the '50s. But he can also be heard to brilliant effect on another
Goodman CD, ``Slipped Disc'' (Columbia), a collection of 14
performances recorded in 1945 with an all-star sextet that featured
the vibraphonist Red Norvo and the bassist Slam Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Wilson plays on the first six sides, Powell on the
remainder, and the juxtaposition of the two pianists is
illuminating. To say that the younger man holds his own is to
grossly understate the case _ he is in fact far more inventive than
Wilson, whose postwar playing was fluent but all too often bland,
and the crisp, twinkling solos Powell bats out on ``Tiger Rag,''
``I Got Rhythm,'' ``Liza'' and ``China Boy'' are as exhilarating as
a tightrope walk on a breezy day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Powell's later recordings with Goodman, including a blazingly
fast 1947 sextet performance of ``The World Is Waiting for the
Sunrise,'' were briefly available on a four-CD set from Mosaic that
is, alas, no longer in print.
</P>
<P>
   Also out of print in this country are the solo albums Powell
made for Vanguard after studying with Hindemith; fortunately, two
of them, ``Borderline'' and ``Thigamagig,'' have been reissued on
an English CD available through import outlets. Recorded in 1954,
these trio albums feature the tenor saxophonist Paul Quinichette
and the trumpeter Ruby Braff, who both play beautifully throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Powell is at all times the center of attention, not
merely for the fleet invention of his up-tempo solos but also for
his pensive, arrestingly angular reharmonizations of ballads like
``What's New?'' and ``You're My Thrill,'' in which listeners
familiar with Hindemith's music will immediately recognize the
master's touch.
</P>
<P>
   The originality of ``Borderline'' and ``Thigamagig'' is clearer
in hindsight than it was 44 years ago. At a time when even the most
harmonically advanced jazz pianists were still digesting the
implications of the music of Debussy and Ravel, Powell was moving
in a different direction entirely, and had he continued to explore
post-impressionist harmony in a jazz context, he surely would have
come to be regarded as a stylistic innovator.
</P>
<P>
   But his interest in jazz was rapidly waning _ he later admitted
to the author Gene Lees that the only reason he continued to work
with Goodman in the '50s was the money _ and when Yale hired him to
teach composition in 1957, he quit jazz for good.
</P>
<P>
   Why did so superlatively gifted an artist turn his back on the
music that made him famous? ``I have decided that when I retire I
will think through my decision to leave jazz with the help of Freud
and Jung,'' Powell told Whitney Balliett in a 1987 New Yorker
profile.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate reason, he explained, was that he had grown tired
of playing the same charts night after night with the Goodman band.
But he went on to offer a more complex rationale: ``I had done what
I felt I had to do in jazz. I had decided it did not hold the
deepest interest for me musically. And I had decided that it was a
young man's music, even a black music.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Powell's jazz playing is far more likely to be
remembered than his classical compositions, which have never
appealed to more than a tiny coterie of admirers. The
uncompromising serialism he favored had long since fallen from
fashion _ even academic fashion _ by the time of his death. Yet
more of his recorded performances are now available on CD than ever
before, and his Vanguard albums will doubtless be reissued in the
United States at some point in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   When that finally happens, a new generation of delighted
listeners will discover what their grandparents would gladly have
told them: the winner of the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for music was also
one of the very best pianists ever to play jazz.

BAY STATE DRIVING LICENSE TO BE TOUGHER TO GET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KIEHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Inside the T-N-T driver's education school, the walls
are plastered with newspaper clippings depicting grisly car wrecks
involving teen-age drivers.
</P>
<P>
   All around, posters in garish colors announce the dangers of the
road, and the commandments for safe driving: no drinking, no
speeding, no horseplay.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 13 students cooped up in driving class in suburban
Hull this week, the posters just didn't seem to register.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's telling you to grow up and be responsible, but
they're not letting us do that,'' said Michael Hurwitz, 16, of
Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state is poised to help focus the attention of youth
drivers by tripling the number of training hours required for a
license and by imposing new restrictions such as prohibiting
teen-aged drivers from having other teens in the car.
</P>
<P>
   If the new restrictions become law, as expected, Massachusetts
would be the 22d state to adopt a graduated licensing scheme in
recent years. It would represent the first significant overhaul of
the student driver system in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   For many adults, the change can't come too soon. In
Massachusetts, 46 percent of 16-year-old drivers are in an accident
before their 17th birthday, according to the American Automoblie
Association. Nationally, about two-thirds of 6,319 teenagers killed
in car crashes last year were riding in a car driven by another
teen, according to federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't learn driver's skills overnight,'' said Allan
Williams, senior vice president of the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety. ``Let them get on-the-road driving experience to
build up their skills, but keep them in protected situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even driving instructors like Tony Kuzmicki, who runs T-N-T
driving school with his wife Tina, agree that classroom instruction
cannot match real driving time in giving teenagers confidence and
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the kids you have to do at least 30 hours before even
getting a license,'' Kuzmicki said. ``They're reckless when they
get out there with their friends. They forget everything they've
learned and they try to show off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts bill, which was introduced by Rep. Peter
Larkin, a Democrat of Pittsfield, would extend the number of
supervised driving hours, from six to 18, and prohibit junior
licensees from driving between midnight and 5 a.m. unless
accompanied by a parent or guardian. And for the first six months
after obtaining a junior license, teenagers cannot have any
passenger under 18 in the car with them unless someone over age 21
is in the front seat.
</P>
<P>
   The bill attempts to address some of the problems that make
teenage drivers so dangerous, chief among them, experts say,
distractions from passengers, a willingness to take risks, speed,
alcohol, and simple inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   The result, say sponsors of the bill, are accidents that claim
teenage lives with a frightening frequency. Last Wednesday, a
16-year-old from Randolph crashed his car carrying six friends into
a brick wall in Pawtucket, R.I. Two of them were killed -- a
16-year-old boy from Randolph and a 15-year-old girl from
Attleboro.
</P>
<P>
   A study released in April by the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety found that in the past 20 years, the death rate among
16-year-old drivers nearly doubled -- from 19 deaths per 100,000
drivers in 1975 to 35 per 100,000 in 1996 -- while the rate
declined for the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young drivers are more likely to exceed the posted speed
limits, they weave in and out of traffic, and they are less likely
to wear safety belts,'' said Arthur Kinsman, a spokesman for the
AAA of Southern New England, a sponsor of the Massachusetts bill.
``They have feelings of invulnerability and don't understand what
they have to lose and how easy it is to be injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and House passed different versions of the graduated
license bill earlier this year. Larkin said he expects to have a
compromise bill up for a vote in both houses before the end of the
session next week. The bill is expected to pass easily, and Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci has indicated he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamic of putting youths behind the wheel with little
experience has contributed to the mayhem on the highways,'' said
Larkin, who had three high school friends killed in a car crash.
``I can still feel the shock of that moment. No one thinks they're
more indestructible than a 17-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety experts say that earlier attempts to reduce teenage
accidents by cracking down on drunk driving and expanding driver's
educations programs failed in the 1980s. They are just now learning
that what really works is to get teenagers to spend more time
behind the wheel, not in classrooms.

   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia _ Refugee families, their children looking
stunned and exhausted, continued to arrive in this ethnic Albanian
town Wednesday with detailed accounts of the terrors they say they
survived in a battle between rebels and government forces in
Orahovac.
</P>
<P>
   Their accounts are being meticulously collected by local
officials to be turned over to human rights groups and are likely
to be repeated and become part of the accepted history of the
revolt by ethnic Albanians against the Serbian government.
</P>
<P>
   However, most of the accounts appear to be exaggerated, no
matter how sincerely the witnesses insist they heard artillery
shells smash homes or saw Serbian troops burning the businesses of
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, for the first time since separatist rebels attacked
Serbian targets in Orahovac, just south of here, on Saturday, the
Serbian authorities, who maintain their hold on the city, let
reporters get past the outskirts and see what damage there was.
</P>
<P>
   Both Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanian refugees assert
that their people were victims of murder and kidnappings. Their
assertions could not be confirmed based on a visit to the city.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, that there was fierce fighting in some
parts of Orahovac, and Wednesday at least two bodies were still on
the street. During the fighting there was sustained firing of
cannon and light artillery or mortars. At times, small-arms fire
was nearly constant.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, there may well have been enough noise and confusion
to terrify civilians hiding in basements, especially if, as they
have been told to believe, they were likely to be killed if their
side did not win the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Damage was intense in places, but rather limited in extent.
There was no evidence apparent to support assertions of wholesale
shelling of civilian areas or wanton burning of entire
neighborhoods by gangs of armed Serbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shelling destroyed 150 to 200 hundred homes in my
neighborhood alone. The whole city was on fire,'' said a man here
Wednesday, showing great agitation and signs of severe emotional
stress. ``I saw this myself,'' said the man, who was unwilling to
give his name, saying he was too frightened. But everyone in a
group of about 20 other refugees nodded in agreement with his
story. Some had accounts of their own, all equally vivid.
</P>
<P>
   In the glowing hot emotions generated by what has become a civil
war overlaying the cultural divisions between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians, what is true is not nearly as important as what is
believed. The truth is more difficult to manipulate than beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials here, who would not give their names, said the
count of refugees streaming in from Orahovac had risen from 12,000
to about 15,000 by Wednesday. Although the figures could not be
confirmed, the streets here are swollen with crowds of people, many
of whom are obviously refugees.
</P>
<P>
   A local official here, who said he was searching for the
complete truth of what happened over the last few days in Orahovac,
showed page after page of signed and dated statements from refugees
detailing the destruction of homes by shelling and of 37 murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the proof here, from what people saw with their own
eyes, about genocide. This is the truth,'' he said. ``I myself saw
half the town in flames before I managed to escape with my family
over the mountains. No one will be able to go back there to live.''
The man said he could not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   On the Serbian side, before the camera of the
government-controlled television network, the mayor of Orahovac, an
ethnic Serb, stood on the steps of city hall speaking dramatically
of what he called a genocidal attack on the city by ethnic
Albanians. ``Every Serbian house was a target. You only have to
look here for the evidence,'' he said, swinging his arm around to
the street, which, contrary to his declarations, showed no signs of
battle damage.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what had happened to the 20,000 or so residents of
the city the mayor said most of them were back and being protected
by government forces. However, only four civilians were seen in the
city. Three of them were told to keep quiet by police and pushed
inside their home by police when a reporter approached.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the damage apparent in and near Orahovac seems to have
been caused by looting. Along the road on which government forces
advanced to retake the city, there was almost no store which had
not been cleaned out of all goods.
</P>
<P>
   In the city itself, few stores were left untouched. It is not
clear who did the looting within the city.
</P>
<P>
   On one block, windows of the neighborhood stationery store were
smashed, and the shelves cleared of everything but a box of
staples, two ballpoint pens, and a poster of Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Windows of the next store had been blackened by smoke then blown
out by the heat of a fire so intense that nothing remained but
cinders and the ceramic tiles of the floor. A brown suit coat and
blue overalls, still on coat hangers, were left draped over the
ledge of a window. Nothing else was left, not even the shelves.

ALAN B. SHEPARD JR.; FIRST AMERICAN IN SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr., who became America's first man in
space and the only person to hit a golf ball on the moon, died in a
California hospital of leukemia early Wednesday. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has lost a shining star,'' NASA administator Daniel
Goldin said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shepard's steely confidence combined with his unassuming
public demeanor helped propel him to the status of a national hero
after his historic 16-minute flight on May 5, 1961, made him
America's first space traveler. That brief sub-orbital foray helped
salve the nation's wounded pride after having been beaten to the
honor of sending the first human into space by the Soviet Union's
Yuri Gagarin, just 23 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who are old enough to remember the first
spaceflights will always remember what an impression he made on us
and on the world,'' said President Clinton Wednesday. ``So I would
like to express the gratitude of our nation and to say that our
thoughts and prayers are with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shepard was grounded for six years after that first flight
because of an inner-ear problem that affected his balance. But the
problem was later corrected surgically and he returned to the
astronaut corps in time to fly to the moon on the Apollo 14 mission
in 1971, becoming one of only 12 human beings to walk on the lunar
surface.
</P>
<P>
   That mission helped restore America's faith in the space program
after the dangerous and suspenseful Apollo 13 mission, which
suffered a serious explosion that prevented it from landing on the
moon. All three astronauts survived that mission unscathed after a
series of close calls, as recounted in the movie ``Apollo 13.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shepard's Apollo 14 mission also came close to being
thwarted by a hardware problem, but was salvaged as a result of
quick thinking by a team of computer engineers at Draper
Laboratories in Cambridge, Mass., who were able to reprogram the
onboard computer to bypass a faulty ``abort'' switch. The mission
culminated in Mr. Shepard's now-famous lunar golfing spree, in
which he lofted a couple of balls into near-oblivion using a
makeshift club he had secretly arranged to take along.
</P>
<P>
   He later explained that he hit the golf balls to demonstrate to
young people the great differences between the lunar environment
and that of Earth: its total airlessness and reduced gravity, only
one-sixth that of Earth's.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of nearly routine space missions, it is difficult
to remember the suspense Mr. Shepard's first flight generated. The
Soviet Union had successfully launched the first satellite four
years earlier and the American people had witnessed television
images of one US rocket after another erupting in flames on the
launch pad. Mr. Shepard, riding on a converted Redstone ballistic
missile, had few of the safety measures _ or the amenities _ of
later spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that mission in a television interview, Mr. Shepard
said that at the time ``all of us certainly believed the
statistics,'' which said there was ``probably 88 percent chance of
mission success and maybe 96 percent chance of survival. And we
were willing to take those odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shepard's Apollo 14 crewmate Edgar Mitchell said recently
that ``we did what we set out to do and had a good time doing it.''
Mitchell added that ``it was the common attitude: `We get paid to
do this?' It was the greatest adventure of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up on a family farm in Derry, N.H., Mr. Shepard spent
his first five years of schooling in a one-room schoolhouse with
one teacher and 25 students in grades one through six. He later
credited the discipline and study skills he learned during that
time, along with a strong home life in what he called a family of
hard workers, with helping propel him toward a life of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shepard took an early interest in aviation, working at a
small airport in return for the occasional opportunity to fly as a
passenger on small planes and, eventually, pilot them.
</P>
<P>
   Born Nov. 18, 1923, Mr. Shepard was old enough to remember
Charles Lindbergh's epochal solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean,
and he would later describe Lindbergh as a boyhood hero, whom he
met later in life.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shepard's family could not afford to send him to college,
but he passed the entrance exams for the US Naval Academy and later
as a Naval officer received his first real flight training. He then
became a military test pilot, which put him in position to be among
the first group chosen for astronaut training by the newly created
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   He became part of the original Mercury Seven group of
astronauts, America's first space fliers, who were widely
celebrated in magazines and personal appearances even before the
first spaceflight took place. They were the subject of Tom Wolfe's
1979 book ``The Right Stuff.'' The others were M. Scott Carpenter,
L. Gordon Cooper, Wally Schirra, Donald K. ``Deke'' Slayton (who
died in 1993), John Glenn Jr. (now a senator from Ohio, who is
preparing to return to space aboard the US space shuttle, this
October), and Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom (who died on the launch pad in
the Apollo 1 fire).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Andrew Chaikin, &UR;  &LR; author of the book ``A Man On the Moon,''
which details the history of the Apollo program, said Wednesday
that while there was intense competition among the Mercury Seven to
be the first one in space, Mr. Shepard ``always believed that he
was the best guy to walk through those doors. He never had a
moment's doubt that he should be the first American in space.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shepard, who died in a hospital in Monterey, Calif., is
survived by his wife, the former Louise Brewer, whom he met at the
Naval Academy. He also leaves two daughters and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who was the second man on the
moon, said Wednesday that ``Alan Shepard was the pioneer's pioneer,
the pilot's pilot, and the man who opened space for all Americans.
I cannot convey to you how much he was admired by those of us who
watched and then followed him through that magic door into space.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House paved the way Wednesday for renewing
trade ties with China by striking down a resolution that would have
ended normal commerce because of the Communist nation's human
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 264-166, the House rejected a measure that would
have revoked President Clinton's decision last month to extend
``normal trade relations'' for another year with China. The status,
in previous years, has been called ``most favored nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was hailed by supporters of China trade as a strong
signal of Congress' willingness to continue the 26-year-old policy
of constructive engagement that began with President's Nixon's
visit in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote all but guaranteed that China will continue to
receive trading privileges for at least another year. The Senate
must also act to approve the annual renewal, but the outcome in
that chamber is expected to mirror the House action.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of trade with China joined with opponents in taking
issue with many aspects of the U.S. policy pushed by Clinton. But
they said that denying China many of the same low tariffs enjoyed
by most other U.S. trading partners would likely cause a trade war
and lead to the reversal of many political and social reforms made
by China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also warned that breaking off normal trade ties with
China would exacerbate the economic crisis in Asia and further
damage U.S. exports to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a severe economic depression facing many Asian nations,
the United States cannot afford to adopt a protectionist response
to objectionable behavior by the Chinese government,'' said House
Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Archer pointed out that U.S. workers and firms do $17 billion in
trade with China each year and ``revoking normal trade relations
... could trigger more currency devaluations in the region, further
compounding the steep drop in demand for U.S. exports.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Archer noted in a statement issued through his office that
Texas-based industries would be significant losers. The businesses
make more than $651 million from China each year with exports that
range from ceiling fans to airborne navigational systems.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While sympathetic to concerns about human rights and possible
transfers of U.S. technology to China, Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas,
said the United States could not discount the fact that China has 1
billion consumers eager to buy American-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is our fourth largest trading partner. ... This is a bad
idea that will only hurt the American worker and the American
economy,'' Bentsen said of the move to undercut U.S.-China trade
ties.
</P>
<P>
   The trade preferences have been renewed annually by every
president since Jimmy Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argue that the huge U.S. trade imbalance with
China has helped support the oppressive policies of the Beijing
leadership and allowed the Asian nation to continue its military
buildup and improve its missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our trade deficit with China is financing the present
leadership in China,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents were more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   Citing recent allegations that U.S. technology may have been
transferred that has helped improve Chinese missile guidance
systems, Rep. James Traficant Jr., D-Ohio, said it would be
``stupid'' for Congress to continue support of normal trading
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a debate about trade anymore. This is a debate
about national security,'' he said. He implored his colleagues who
support continuing normal trade ties to ``wake up'' before ``there
is a Chinese rocket stuck right up your assets.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of those who railed against the campaign violations,
human rights abuses and possible conversion of U.S. technology to
Chinese military use finally supported continuation of normal trade
relations. They cited concern that American businesses in China
would lose out to European and Asian rivals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it has in the past, the annual China trade debate brought
together an unusual coalition of allies. Liberal Democrats joined
conservative Republicans to oppose renewal of normal trade ties,
and Christian right groups sided with labor unions in their
opposition.

 &HT;    ASA, pilots resume talks; airline posts 32 percent earnings
increase
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Atlantic Southeast Airlines and its pilot union have
resumed federally mediated contract talks in an effort to avert a
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Wednesday, the commuter affiliate of Delta Air
Lines posted a 32 percent jump in second quarter profits, aided by
the addition of new jets.
</P>
<P>
   A union spokeswoman said ASA management offered a revised
contract proposal when mediators convened the two sides for the
first time since pilots rejected a tentative agreement last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Progress is being made, and talks are continuing at this
time,'' the spokeswoman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based ASA and the union reached a contract agreement in
January, but rank-and-file pilots in March rejected the proposed
pact by a resounding 413-43 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The union membership has authorized a strike if talks fail and
mediators declare an impasse, but such a scenario is still weeks or
months away.
</P>
<P>
   The off-again, on-again contract talks date to late 1995, and
pilots still fly under the old agreement. Among the issues is pay,
which now ranges from $15,000 to $60,000 _ far under levels at
Delta and other large airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots contend the wages are also subpar among commuter
carriers, especially in light of ASA's financial success. They also
want relief from what they contend are unfair scheduling practices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ASA said its profit was $19.5 million, or 65 cents a
share, in the second quarter, versus $14.8 million, or 49 cents a
share a year earlier. Revenue grew 7.1 percent to $106.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The results topped expectations, pushing ASA stock up $1.81 1/4
to $48.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, ASA posted profit of $32.9 million, or $1.09
a share, on revenue of $200.4 million, against $25.5 million, or 85
cents, on revenue of $189.3 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributes the improved results in part to new
50-seat jets deployed last fall. The jets are spurring traffic
growth, as evidenced by an 11 percent gain in revenue passenger
miles for the first six months of the year, on flat capacity.

 &HT;    Flat earnings stomp CCE
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises set off a Wall Street stampede
by releasing flat second-quarter earnings and a warning that
profits would be much lower than expected until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based bottler said earnings will be crimped this
year and the next _ though they should surge in 2000 and 2001 _
because of a $5 billion capital spending plan. The company will
expand warehouse and production facilities, add to its delivery
fleet and install 840,000 new vending machines and other beverage
dispensers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the stepped-up investments, per-share earnings will
hit only 25 cents this year, with about 10 percent earnings growth
projected for 1999, the company said. In 2000 and 2001, growth
rates should accelerate to more than 50 percent in each year, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   The average analyst forecast was 35 cents this year and 53 cents
for next year, with a 23.6 percent average increase over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The stock was among the most active Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange, with nearly 8 million shares trading _ more than 15
times this year's average daily volume. CCE closed at $35.31 1/4,
down $3.68 3/4, a 9.5 percent drop in value.
</P>
<P>
   CCE's second-quarter earnings came in at the low end of Wall
Street estimates, which ranged from 27 cents to 31 cents and
averaged 29 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's largest bottler reported net income of $111 million,
or 27 cents a share, compared with $111 million, or 28 cents a
share on fewer shares, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 27
percent, to $3.68 billion, from $2.91 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, net income fell 23 percent, to $60 million,
or 15 cents per share, on revenue of $6.65 billion. This compares
with $78 million, or 20 cents per share, on revenue of $5.05
billion in the previous six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence in the outlook for the stock has not changed one
bit,'' said Marty Romm, a beverage analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston. The firm arranged the sale of a 3 million-share block of
CCE stock for $35 per share on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every seller, there's a buyer,'' said Romm, who called
CCE's strategic direction ``very appropriate.'' ``The actions the
board took to increase capital expense can only increase their
growth in volume and cash operating profit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the second-quarter and year-to-date net income
primarily reflects the expected impact of its acquisitions of
British, Canadian and New York bottling operations, and related
accelerated spending on new trucks, vending machines and coolers.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Summerfield K. Johnston Jr. said the $5 billion expense
reflects the company's long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates are low, the economy is strong, our business
has unparalleled momentum, and the Coca-Cola system has never been
stronger,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   CCE's sales rose 8 percent in the quarter, compared with a 2
percent gain in the previous second quarter. In the United States
and Canada, CCE's sales volume was up 9 percent, and it rose 4
percent in European markets.

 &HT;    MindSpring enjoys another strong quarter
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- MindSpring Enterprises on Wednesday posted its third
consecutive profitable quarter and once again beat analysts'
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Internet service provider _ the largest ISP in
the Southeast and the largest independent ISP in the country _
reported second-quarter revenue of $25.1 million. The company
reported a profit of $2.02 million, or 24 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period last year, MindSpring reported a loss of
$1.43 million, or 19 cents per share. MindSpring also reported a
subscriber base of 393,000, up from 341,000 last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected MindSpring to earn
18 cents a share. The results were reported after the stock market
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the second quarter, MindSpring President and Chief
Operating Officer Michael S. McQuary said, ``We're obviously very
proud of our results. Everyone asks us what the secret potion is,
but the truth is what's unique and magical about our company is the
hard work and the dedication of our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuary said the company was not for sale but MindSpring is
always weighing potential opportunities to buy as well as sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wanted to buy MindSpring, it would have to be
somebody good for our investors, our employees and our
subscribers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have to be someone who really values the culture of
what we've built here, someone who shared our zeal for making our
customers happy. It's a short list of people,'' McQuary said.
``There's nobody we're mulling over right now, but that's the
criteria we'd measure it against.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MindSpring were up Wednesday on hopes the company
would beat analysts' estimates. After hitting a high Wednesday of
$141.37 1/2, MindSpring closed at $140.31 1/4, up $13.68 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring, trading at $12.87 1/2 just one year ago, has watched
its stock price double over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Grosz, an analyst at Everen Securities Chicago, said,
``In general it looks like a very strong quarter. Their subscriber
numbers were in line with our estimates but their earnings per
share was six cents above.''
</P>
<P>
   Grosz said MindSpring's second-quarter success reflected the
company's ability to keep costs down and develop its Web hosting
business.

COMMENTARY: UNCLOSED FILEGATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Remember Filegate? Three years ago we learned that
the White House had been regularly pulling the files from the FBI
on hundreds of Republicans _ ostensibly for security clearance, but
including hundreds of former Reagan and Bush appointees never being
considered for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton partisans shuddered at shades of an ``enemies
list.'' White House spokesmen dismissed it as a ``bureaucratic
snafu,'' caused by a Secret Service that couldn't keep its lists
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion fell on D. Craig Livingstone, a Democratic advance man
unqualified for his sensitive security post. Because some Clinton
appointees had drug problems in their pasts, White House operatives
may have felt that a supply of political mud was needed to drive
off potential critics.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI admitted wrongdoing in being so complaisant, apologized
and said it would never again ship files over without proper
paperwork. But it was obviously not qualified to investigate White
House abuse of its files; Janet Reno asked for independent counsel,
and the matter was assigned to Ken Starr, who had an organization
up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has never come to closure. Years passed; Livingstone,
seeking no immunity, testified to Congress that everybody and
therefore nobody was to blame. Starr's investigation languished.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the public interest in privacy, an organization
called Judicial Watch launched a class-action suit in behalf of
people whose files had been unlawfully examined. This week it
provided The Washington Times with an expanded list of names of
those whose most intimate affairs may have been examined by this
political operative and his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The list, still growing, is up to 900 names; some, like Linda
Tripp, were holdovers, but at least 400 were not _ from James Brady
to James Baker, John Whitehead to James Carville. (Some White House
snoop probably said merrily, ``Let's see what they've got on
Carville.'')
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecutor cannot indict after all this time, he should
issue a report. Here are questions that need answering:
</P>
<P>
   Was Livingstone hired at Hillary Clinton's suggestion? Who gave
this former bar bouncer the names of the targets of White House
curiosity _ names that he then ordered up from a roundheeled FBI?
Did the FBI send over only summaries, as the White House claims, or
were raw files or letters sometimes included?
</P>
<P>
   Before being returned to the FBI, were the contents of these
confidential files typed into White House computer data bases? ``I
can see a secretary or some poor intern being relegated to typing
up somebody's information on the computer,'' Livingstone told the
reporter Bill Sammon of The Washington Times this week, ``... so
that the president could read it or the chief of staff could read
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is this series invader of privacy blithely envisioning the
transmission of FBI files loaded with hearsay smears being fed to
the president himself, for reading amusement on his computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Whodb, pronounced ``who-to-be,'' the White House
Office Data Base, has on it tens of thousands of potential
contributors and people who owe the Clintons favors, accessible by
name, affiliation, race and religion. We do not yet know what else
is in these political dossiers.
</P>
<P>
   Who in the White House cooked up the excuse offered when
Filegate first surfaced, that the Secret Service was to blame for
providing an outdated list of names? After Secret Service agents
testified to Congress that this was untrue, and that the names of
former White House aides were clearly marked ``inactive,''
Clinton's Treasury harassed the agents with a costly investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate counter-investigated that harassment; the agents were
exonerated and their legal bills paid. Now, ironically, the White
House is posing as the big friend of a Secret Service reluctant to
testify _ while clinging to the canard that an inefficient Secret
Service was the cause of hundreds of invasions of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton stonewallers talk about the president's privacy, and
as White House spinmeisters seize the issue of privacy on the
Internet, think about Livingstone's eye to the keyhole of more than
400 Republican bedrooms. If Starr cannot indict, he should report
forthwith; then, if necessary, Congress should act. &QL;

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UNLUCKY LIVE IN PUBLIC HOUSING
</HEADLINE>
 Takes)-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN and JANETTE RODRIGUES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When the blast-furnace heat of the day
finally recedes about 8 p.m., the community comes alive. Adults sit
on front stoops and chat with neighbors. Laughing, dripping
children run between creaky sprinklers while a grouchy old-timer
yells at them to stay off his lawn. Teen-age couples wander about,
holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   It all mimics a Norman Rockwell painting _ except Rockwell
didn't live in public housing. That's what these folks call home.
They are residents of Cavile Place, a 300-unit apartment complex
run by the Fort Worth Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd includes the stereotypical perceptions: a pregnant
13-year-old, a 30-year-old woman with 12 children and another on
the way, a 16-year-old who will be arrested a few nights later on
armed robbery charges.
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy to overlook the 15-year-old computer brain, the
17-year-old determined to go to law school and the 63-year-old
retired maid who is a member of the Fort Worth Housing Authority
board and once represented the city in a meeting with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our good and our misguided,'' says Barbara Deckard,
67, who has lived in Cavile Place since 1958. ``Mostly, we're just
people like anybody else. Except not many people care to come to
public housing and find that out.''
</P>
<P>
   `THEY DESERVE QUALITY'
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth runs six public housing areas _ Butler, Ripley
Arnold, Cavile, Hunter, Fair Park and Fair Oaks _ as well as other
scattered sites. In all, there are 1,398 public housing units
ranging from one-bedroom apartments to houses.
</P>
<P>
   Cavile, the third-oldest complex, sits squarely in the Stop Six
neighborhood near the intersection of East Rosedale Street and East
Loop 820, ringed by bars and churches.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of Cavile's 850 to 900 residents is there by accident.
Most are African-American, but Anglos and Hispanics make up about
20 percent of the ethnic mix. When tenants sit around on their
front steps in the evening and swap life stories, their tales
always share a common theme: There was no place left to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as families that include a husband or father, if I said
10, I'd probably be counting too many,'' says Bettye Walker, 53,
the Cavile housing manager.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have lived in Cavile for an extended period, such as
Deckard and Housing Authority board member Callie Pollard, describe
the community as a one-time residents' paradise that turned bad and
is now relatively safe again.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, gangs and drug dealers made Cavile their base. The
wide ``alley'' bisecting the apartments became a speedway for
drive-by shootings. Old-timers describe the peculiar popping noise
that clotheslines make when snapped by bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place was a total mess, a hellhole,'' Pollard says. ``But
we changed. Most of us decided we weren't going to put up with that
stuff anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of Fort Worth opened a branch next to the
complex office. The Fort Worth library installed a small Cavile
branch instantly known as COOL (for ``Cavile Outreach Opportunity
Library'').
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Pollard said, ``The police gave us a storefront, and
most of all, they gave us Whitehead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whitehead'' is what Cavile tenants call Cpl. Jim Smith of the
Fort Worth Police Department. He earned the nickname because of his
gray hair. Smith, 53, spends all his on-duty hours at Cavile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get very possessive'' about Cavile, Smith says. ``Most
people here are decent and hard-working. They deserve quality
police protection. If anyone involved in criminal activity moves in
here, we're going to find out, and we're going to move them out.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Smith was shot and severely beaten by the
brother of a resident during an attempted arrest for drug
possession. After he recuperated, Smith came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big step was putting up gates in the alley to stop
drive-bys,'' he says. ``Most of the problems, always, came from
outsiders, anyway. The big concern we still have is drugs, but
that's the same anywhere. I care about the people here.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lucky for that kid who shot Whitehead that the police
arrested him before the residents got hold of him,'' Pollard says
with a sharklike grin. ``I think it would have gotten pretty ugly.
We look out for our own, and Whitehead is one of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BASICS _ OR A SHOWPLACE
</P>
<P>
   When you move into Cavile, you don't get much besides the basics
_ and new friends.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment buildings are squat, red-brick rectangles that
soak up the heat of the sun. Scrubby grass grows all around.
Inside, rooms are small, with yellowy-white concrete walls and pale
linoleum floors. Each unit has a stove and refrigerator, but no
other furniture or appliances. The air smells of disinfectant and
bug decay. Some residents complain about rats. Two years ago, the
housing authority installed air conditioning, which works
intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   Earl ``Bubba'' Lee, 10, takes it upon himself to meet everybody
moving in, although he sometimes warns as well as greets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You people got roaches, I hope you know,'' Bubba shrilly
informs a fledgling tenant.

   Yolanda Lacy, 30, sometimes welcomes new neighbors with a pie or
some other treat. She asks them to let her know if her two sons,
ages 13 and 10, make too much noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like everybody to be happy with each other,'' Lacy says.
``I want to know if Dereck and Montrell bother anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Small courtesies are essential to Cavile residents. They try
hard to be respectful of one another because they believe outsiders
don't respect them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They add `black' and `poor' and come up with `trash,' ''
Pollard says. ``We take pride in our families and our homes like
the people in the rich neighborhoods do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cavile, residents don't have to take care of their yards or
fix up their apartments as long as they avoid outright defacement.
Some let their dwellings slip into grimy disrepair. But others,
such as Louis T. Booker, 55, nurture their property _ which is why
Booker doesn't want kids spoiling his yardwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing in front of my place when I moved in going
on six years ago, just dirt and no grass,'' he says. ``I took my
cousin's truck and got me some good, rich field dirt. Then I put in
St. Augustine runners and some shrubs. It looks good and green
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacy has turned her tiny two-bedroom apartment into a showplace.
Plants extend branches everywhere, and their leaves partially
conceal fish tanks, bird cages, an iguana tank and a rabbit with a
bright green collar. MORE &QL;

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UNLUCKY LIVE IN PUBLIC HOUSING

<P>
   FORT WORTH: bright green collar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're here, we ought to enjoy living here,'' she said.
``Who says public housing people got to live in dirt? I did this
bit by bit over the seven years. When I moved in, I just had a
mattress and a black-and-white TV.''
</P>
<P>
   IS WORK ENCOURAGED?
</P>
<P>
   Some would say Lacy and her children have lived in their
apartment too long.
</P>
<P>
   Those who meet the stringent requirements of public housing can
stay indefinitely, if they pay rent on time and don't commit
felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average resident stays maybe three years,'' Walker says.
``If they haven't moved on in three years, then they're usually
here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Deckard never considered moving out of Cavile, ``though I could
have if I wanted to. But this is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Minimum Housing Authority rent is $50 a month, which the
unemployed can glean from welfare, child-support checks or other
income. Residents with jobs must pay 30 percent of their monthly
net salaries. Rent includes most utility costs; anyone who uses
more than a fixed ``utility allowance'' of kilowatt hours must pay
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The current FWHA annual budget for public housing is $4,675,860.
Dividing the number of units _ 1,398 _ into that results in an
annual cost of $3,344 per unit, or about $279 a month. In June, the
average rent at Cavile was $113.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who don't pay the full cost are not, apparently,
concerned. (About one-fifth do pay $279 a month or more.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is public housing, and we're part of the public,'' Lacy
says.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Holston, FWHA executive director, says regulations
actually encourage tenants to stay put and jobless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say someone moves into (Cavile), paying $50 a month on minimal
income,'' she says. ``She _ I say `she' because most of our tenants
are single mothers with children _ goes to school, gets a job, and
then her rent goes dramatically up. On the private market, if your
rent gets raised $10 or $25 a month, you get mad. Here, with the 30
percent of salary rule, it can easily increase from $50 to $200 or
more. Residents tend to think, `Why should I work? I get a job and
the Housing Authority takes the money I earn.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Walker believes that public housing tenants should have
obligations beyond paying minimal rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should have to participate in some kind of work
program,'' says Walker, who once lived in public housing. ``Even if
it's nothing more than getting out to clean up some public
property, they need to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA COTS
</P>
<P>
   Louis Booker enjoys lounging on his front steps in the evening.
He listens to the radio, sips beer and yells at kids to keep off
the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living here is all right,'' Booker muses. ``I still do some
work during the day, then come back and sit. I expect I'll live
here till death do me part. It would be better if there weren't so
many womens. Womens, you know, got to yell and argue all the time.
I wish there was a few more men.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker can wish all he wants. Cavile, like public housing in
general, is mostly populated by females. Even when there is a
live-in adult male in the picture, he usually is not listed on the
apartment lease because rents are based on combined occupant
income.
</P>
<P>
   ``The couples that live here, you can best believe, both of them
aren't on the lease,'' says Tina Dennis, a 31-year-old mother of
five. ``If my husband was on the lease, the rent would be too
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Most unofficial male live-ins do their best to stay out of
sight. Many are collectively identified as ``first-of-the-month
boyfriends,'' timing their arrival to coincide with their lovers'
government checks at the beginning of the month, and leaving a few
days or weeks later when the money runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Brooks, 52, who has lived in Cavile for more than 20
years, says young, lonely single mothers are desperate for
affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think about the times of the month that the men
show up,'' Brooks says. ``It's more important to them to be able to
say, `I have someone who kinda cares,' so they put up with that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men of Cavile show up at night, when the
administrative staff has gone home. They are hesitant to be
interviewed, worrying the housing authority might read their
comments and figure out who they are and where they are living.
</P>
<P>
   How many are there? A member of the Cavile maintenance crew
says, ``There's an extra cot in just about every apartment I go
into.''
</P>
<P>
   INTENT ON BREAKING AWAY
</P>
<P>
   The babies grow up _ often, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   One girl looks looks much younger than her 13 years. Her facial
features are soft, her limbs very thin and her body unremarkable
except for a bulging abdomen. Her child is due in early September.
(This 13-year-old and her mother will not be identified, to protect
the privacy of a minor.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happened,'' the girl says, fidgeting. Bit by bit, the
story emerges. When she was 12, her mother was sent to jail,
accused of striking her with a closed fist. Both mother and
daughter say this never happened.
</P>
<P>
   While her mother served a 90-day sentence, the girl lived with
her grandmother and met a streetwise 14-year-old who dared her to
have sex with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You scared,' and I did it to prove I wasn't,'' she
says. They had sex twice. She got pregnant; the boy, whose last
name she never knew, moved on to another girl.
</P>
<P>
   Now she weighs 96 pounds; 13 pounds is baby. She was an
eighth-grader at Morningside Middle School; now she's at New Lives,
a Fort Worth school district alternative for pregnant teens. She
hopes to finish school, and wants to be a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and daughter moved to Cavile in May. The mother says she
``can't stand'' her little girl being pregnant. Yet abortion was
never an alternative: ``Our family thinks that's like killing
someone,'' the daughter says.
</P>
<P>
   The child who is about to give birth to a child never got a
birds-and-bees talk from Mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like she was an honor roll student,'' the mother says.
``I didn't know how to tell her about sex. I thought my telling her
would be like telling her to go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 13-year-old says she had sex because of a dare,
notes she wrote at the time tell a different story. Her mother
found them while going through the pockets of her daughter's
clothes before doing a load of laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wrote she was very, very lonely, and she didn't have
nobody to talk to,'' the mother says. ``She wrote she just wanted
to be loved. I read (the notes) and I just cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Williams, 30, got an early start, too. She has 12 children
and one on the way. Williams and her enlarging brood have lived in
Cavile for 11 years. MORE &QL;

PRESIDENT'S SECRETARY APPEARS BEFORE GRAND JURY FOR FIFTH TIME
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a clear signal that the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, may be nearing the end of his criminal inquiry of
President Clinton, Betty Currie, Clinton's personal secretary,
testified on Wednesday before the grand jury here for the fifth and
final time.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie was the first witness summoned to appear last
January before the federal grand jury, which is investigating
whether Clinton attempted to cover up a relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, the 24-year-old former White House intern. On that day,
Mrs. Currie, described by colleagues as sweet-tempered and fiercely
loyal to Clinton, appeared frightened and overwhelmed when scores
of reporters and photographers confronted her with cameras and
microphones on the courthouse steps.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Mrs. Currie appeared far more composed and
clearly relieved after she concluded a seven-hour session with
prosecutors that her lawyer said would be her last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Mrs. Currie has completed her grand jury
testimony,'' said her lawyer, Lawrence Wechsler. ``We have not been
formally notified to that effect, but we do not have a date on
which to return. All I will tell you is that Mrs. Currie is happy
to have this behind her and she looks forward to returning to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie was drawn into the inquiry last January when
investigators working for Starr interviewed her at her Washington
home, just days after they received the authority from a
three-judge panel to investigate the matter. Since then, she has
emerged as one of Starr's critical witnesses, considered a friend
to Ms. Lewinsky as well as an observer of the comings and goings at
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying on Wednesday was Linda Tripp, the Pentagon
employee and former confidant of Ms. Lewinsky who surreptitiously
recorded 20 hours of her friend's discussions about her
relationship with Clinton and then turned them over to Starr's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp and Mrs. Currie literally passed each other on
Wednesday in the courthouse hallway, but they did not speak. Mrs.
Tripp arrived at the courthouse at 3:15 p.m., presumably to testify
for a sixth time. But Mrs. Currie did not finish her testimony
until 5:20 p.m., and Mrs. Tripp went home without testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp is expected to return to the courthouse on Thursday,
said her lawyer, Anthony Zaccagnini. He said he expected his client
would testify ``two or three'' more times. In addition, Secret
Service agent Larry Cockell, the head of the president's security
detail, is also expected to testify on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides serving as Clinton's gatekeepr, Mrs. Currie befriended
Ms. Lewinsky and may have knowledge about several pivotal events in
the weeks around the time that Ms. Lewinsky was under subpoena in
the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie signed in Ms. Lewinsky for a majority of her 37
visits to the White House after she stopped working there in April
1996, records show. Mrs. Currie also helped Ms. Lewinsky in her job
search in December and January. And perhaps most important, lawyers
have said that Mrs. Currie may have significant knowledge about a
White House meeting between Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky on Dec. 28,
the last day that records indicate that Ms. Lewinsky had visited
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the grand jury heard from two Secret Service
officers who one lawyer said may have knowledge about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie also knows about the circumstances surrounding the
gifts that Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton exchanged, and the efforts of
Ms. Lewinsky to return them to the White House after they had been
sought by lawyers for Mrs. Jones in a subpoena last December. In
statements given to Starr's office, Ms. Lewinsky has said she
returned the gifts after the president told her that she would not
have to turn over the gifts to the Jones legal team if they were
not in her possession.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known what Mrs. Currie has told prosecutors, who are
trying to determine whether Mrs. Currie accepted the gifts on her
own, at the request of Ms. Lewinsky or under orders from Clinton or
someone else.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, legal experts said that Starr could face
troubles if an appeals court refuses to overturn a decision by U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to compel his prosecutors to
prove they did not illegally disclose secret grand jury material.
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers familiar with the judge's ruling said that she was
extremely upset by Starr's own words, published in an interview
with Brill's Content, a new magazine that covers the news media. In
the interview, Starr said that he and a top deputy had occasionally
spoken with reporters, but on the condition that their names not be
used. But Starr adamantly denied that he or any members of his
office have leaked grand jury material to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Brentwood, Calif. on Wednesday, Ms. Lewinsky went
shopping and made plans for her 25th birthday celebration on
Thursday. She had planned to have a barbeque at her father's home
in Brentwood, but those plans were canceled on Wednesday after a
family spokeswoman, Judy Smith, became concerned that reporters
with zoom cameras would attempt to take photographs of the
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ms. Lewinsky plans on having a quiet dinner with her
mother, father, stepparents and her brother, Michael. ``For her
birthday,'' Ms. Smith said, ``she wants her life back.''

   FORT WORTH: for 11 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She thinks she might consider permanent birth control after No.
13 is born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I wanted one child, and look how I ended up,''
says Williams, who has no job and whose boyfriend, neighbors say,
recently left.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it keeps happening; ``I really don't know why,'' Williams
adds, vaguely waving at the toddlers crawling about the musty floor
in her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Williams says she comes ``from a regular family, two parents at
home.'' But many adult Cavile women, Lacy says, are the offspring
of single mothers, and the cycle can continue for generations.
</P>
<P>
   But there are those, like LaTosha, who are intent on breaking
away. The 17-year-old doesn't live in Cavile, but she spends time
at a relative's place there, and she's learned how she ``doesn't''
want her own life to turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Girls ``my age, they see their parents messed up, and they do
the same thing,'' LaTosha says, shaking her head in bewilderment.
``Having kids don't mean you are grown. You can have a child and
still act like a child yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   So LaTosha, unlike her aunt, uses birth control. She plans to go
to college, then law school, and have children only after she's
about 30 _ and married.
</P>
<P>
   GANGS UNWELCOME
</P>
<P>
   The male children at Cavile sometimes struggle with poor
self-image, preferring nicknames to given names _ Butch Dawg, Li'l
Low. They often lie to classmates and potential girlfriends about
where they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father moved out in '89,'' says one 14-year-old boy. ``Left
us alone, period. I get mad at school, 'cause if I say I live in
`the projects' people say, `You poor, and you got no daddy,' and
they're right.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they believe they won't receive respect, some of the
boys settle for eliciting fear. However, gang membership in the
infamous Crips or Bloods gangs tempts fewer than the general public
might believe. ``Whitehead'' Smith says only gang wannabes live in
Cavile apartments, with real gang members and drug dealers
preferring surrounding Stop Six streets or the less-regulated
charms of a crumbling nearby apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Fleming, 17, scoffs at the Cavile boys lured to gangs _ and
people who assume that every housing project kid wears gang colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are weak-minded over here,'' says Bo, who plans to
attend the University of Texas at Austin on a track scholarship.
``And away from here, there are people who ask me why I ain't shot
nobody. Stupid question.''
</P>
<P>
   Bo and several of his friends lounging at the Boys &AMP; Girls Club
swear they're going to be real fathers to any children they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's after marriage, and for now marriage is not even in
my head,'' Bo adds quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, boys at Cavile learn about being responsible fathers
by helping their mothers raise younger siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother wants all the kids in the house before dark,'' says
Li'l Bill, 15. ``So I go around and get 'em. I mean, we got 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Li'l Bill is Laura Williams' oldest child. He has lived in
Cavile since he was 2. Because his mother ``is stressing every
day,'' Li'l Bill spends many summer hours doing laundry and
escorting younger brothers and sisters to the Boys &AMP; Girls Club
programs he says ``help 'em live better.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get a job because I'm 15,'' L'il Bill says mournfully.
``I would in a second if I could.''
</P>
<P>
   So he'll settle for a college education and then a career in law
enforcement ``because it's good for people to feel like they're
being protected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I live in the projects,'' Li'l Bill, described as a
computer whiz, says defiantly. ``It's nothin' to be proud of, but
it's nothin' to be ashamed of, either. I won't be here forever.''
</P>
<P>
   UP AND OUT
</P>
<P>
   ``Forever'' was never meant to be part of life in public
housing. For many, it works out that way, but there are those with
plans to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first moved in here 12 years ago, I didn't intend to be
here my entire life or raise my kids here,'' Tina Dennis says.
</P>
<P>
   She has resolved to move out of Cavile and into a rental
property owned by her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a lot of things for myself,'' Dennis says. ``I want a
home, a job and I want my kids to be able to go to college. I think
these are things that I have always wanted. Sometimes it takes some
people longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacy is ``thinking'' about a move because her sons want separate
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In housing, the rule is children of the same sex got to sleep
in the same room,'' she says, sitting on her front step while the
family rabbit hops aimlessly nearby. ``But my oldest wants a dog,
and I'm tired of them fighting about who got into someone else's
space.''
</P>
<P>
   The housing authority tries to help tenants move up and out.
Each housing community offers job placement assistance, links with
Tarrant County Junior College classes and evening
``self-sufficiency'' courses that teach basics like how to make a
budget and stick to it.
</P>
<P>
   But programs for nonseniors are very poorly attended. Sometimes,
no residents sign up for the classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perhaps our greatest frustration,'' Holston says.
</P>
<P>
   To a limited extent, Walker says, the FWHA needs tenants with
jobs to stay in public housing when they could afford to move out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a certain income from rents, and people with jobs, of
course, pay more than the minimum,'' she says. ``For rent purposes,
too, we need to keep as many of the apartments filled as we can. We
have vacancies here right now. With our `One Strike and Out' policy
that says you're evicted for any felony or even being present
during a felony, we lose people that way. It can be hard to keep
the numbers up.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH A SMILE
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when Callie Pollard was part of a city delegation
meeting with President Clinton, she bragged about Fort Worth public
housing. A self-professed ``Christian lady,'' she is moved to
cursing by those who simply won't believe Cavile tenants are good
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people say just (angers) me,'' Pollard snaps. ``It
offends me deeply. All they'd have to do to know better is to come
and look.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, everybody ought to come and visit us. We'll greet you with
a smile.''

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Talk about business cycles.
 &HT;    Over the last decade, the Mexican flag carrier now known as
Aerovias de Mexico privatized, declared bankruptcy, refloated only
to have its new owners go bankrupt as well, acquired two other
major carriers, sold a major stake in one of them and watched as a
former CEO fled amid scandal.
 &HT;    Now, after a successful turnaround, executives are planning an
IPO this year to sell the government's stake in Cintra, the group
that controls Aeromexico and two other airlines. But as luck or
fate would have it, a strike launched in June by flight attendants
against Aeromexico forced the government to intervene once again to
keep the planes flying. Nothing, it seems, is easy at Aeromexico.
 &HT;    Pundits call it reprivatization. Aside from the recent takeover
to avoid a strike, the government's share in Cintra has been
growing, though the ownership structure is so complicated that even
top management does not know exactly how much the government owns.
Estimates put the stake at 45 percent, split between the Ministry
of Finance, state development bank Nafinsa and Fobaproa, the bank
bailout fund created after the peso crash.
 &HT;    The most recent transaction was Banco Mexicano's 22 percent
share. Spain's Banco Santander rescued the Mexican bank, but forced
the government to buy back its shares in the airline as part of the
deal.
 &HT;    In the early 1990s the privatization of Aeromexico was
considered one of the highlights of the Salinas administration,
celebrated in Harvard Business School case studies and World Bank
forums as the model business turnaround. But Aeromexico sank under
the weight of Mexico's economic crisis and the extravagant
purchases, such as Mexicana de Aviacion, a leading domestic
carrier, and a controlling interest in Aeroperu. With crises
mounting, high-flying chairman Gerardo de Prevoisin departed the
country in 1994 amid a torrent of accusations.
 &HT;    Soon after de Prevoisin's exile, Ernesto Martens, former
chairman of Grupo Vitro took the helm. Though he had no experience
in aviation, Martens insisted that he had logged a lot of airplane
miles and knew how to turn a company around. Martens slashed costs,
staff and air routes. Most importantly, he rescued the airline
group from failure by restructuring in a move that gave ownership
to a syndicate of banks, primarily Banco Mexicano, Bancomer,
Banamex and Serfin.
 &HT;    By the first quarter of 1996, the airline reported a profit for
the first time in several years and Martens presided over the
creation of Grupo Cintra, the holding company for three airlines:
Aeromexico, Mexicana and Aeroperu.
 &HT;    The restructuring has been successful for both Mexican airlines,
says Luis Frias, a Mexico City based aviation expert who runs his
own cargo business and praises Aeromexico and Mexicana for
management and timeliness. ``The two companies are money-makers.
They're well managed.''
 &HT;    Last year Cintra had revenues of US$2.2 billion, an increase of
6 percent over the previous year and passengers per kilometer
transported increased a tenth over the previous year. Together,
Mexicana and Aeromexico controls over two thirds of the domestic
air market and half of international traffic. The airlines have
added routes to South America and reopened routes to Europe that
were shut down in the midst of the peso crisis. Each has a
code-sharing agreement with U.S. carriers, United and Delta,
respectively. Delta has also taken a stake in Aeroperu.
 &HT;    Executives are ready to take the story to investors, in a bid to
get the airline out of government hands. ``The idea is to do an IPO
by the end of the year,'' says Cintra CFO Guillermo Turincio.
 &HT;    Even with Cintra's strong numbers, the sale of the government's
twice-owned airlines will be hard to get off the ground. The
fragmented shareholder structure _ banks, the finance ministry, the
ad hoc bailout fund and others _ will have to consolidate ownership
into a viable asset attractive to a buyer.
 &HT;    Politics and regulatory issues also stand in the way. The
bailout fund and its assets have come under scrutiny by Congress,
which also has expressed interest in Cintra's potential monopoly
power, an issue that could determine how and to whom the airlines
will be sold.
 &HT;    All these issues promise to make this year's IPO a daunting
challenge. But then, that's the nature of Mexico's troubled
airlines.

SENATORS QUIZ ENERGY SECRETARY NOMINEE ON LEWINSKY, NUCLEAR WASTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Pena) 
 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson, nominated to
become the next energy secretary, fielded questions about Monica
Lewinsky, nuclear waste and even his sleeping arrangements at the
Watergate Hotel during a Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And while some senators are threatening to hold up his
appointment because of a conflict with the Clinton administration
over nuclear waste disposal, Richardson said he is confident he
eventually will be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just a few bumps,'' Richardson said after the
hearing. ``Nothing is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, the ranking Hispanic in the Clinton administration,
is vying to replace Federico Pena, who left the $148,000-a-year
post after less than a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Committee
on Energy and Natural Resources, praised Richardson for bringing a
``refreshing enthusiasm'' for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski said he supported Richardson's nomination ``with some
reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski then led off the questioning Wednesday by asking
Richardson about his relationship with Lewinsky, the former White
House intern at the center of a grand jury investigation into an
alleged presidential affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson told the senators he agreed to interview Lewinsky for
a low-level, $30,000-a-year public relations job at the behest of
John Podesta, White House deputy chief of staff. Podesta described
her as a friend of Betty Currie, Clinton's personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't even know her name when he asked me to interview
her,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky met with Richardson and some staff members at a 7:30
a.m. appointment at Washington's Watergate Hotel. Richardson stays
at that hotel when visiting Washington and uses a suite there ``for
appointments and meetings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski then asked Richardson where he sleeps at the hotel, a
query that drew the ire of Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky. ``You want to
know where the guy sleeps?'' Ford asked.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, while noting that his chief of staff conducted the
interview, said he found Lewinsky ``impressive.'' He was struck by
her ``gregariousness'' and her ability to express herself.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's office eventually offered Lewinsky a job, which she
declined.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski also asked Richardson to provide the names of the
other people who applied for the job. And while Murkowski promised
to keep those names confidential, Ford predicted the names would be
leaked the following day.
</P>
<P>
   While the testimony about Lewinsky gained the most public
attention, nuclear waste could be Richardson's biggest stumbling
block.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, has threatened to try to block
Richardson's appointment because of the Clinton administration's
response to concerns over disposal of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, Craig complains, has collected $13
billion from utility companies with promises of having a long-term
storage facility for nuclear waste operational this year. Instead,
construction of the facility is still years away.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Congress want to construct a temporary storage site in
Nevada to handle waste now held at sites around the nation, but the
administration has opposed those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time the issue comes to a head,'' Craig said. ``I'm
sorry, Bill, it has to be you.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said a study on the viability of a long-term storage
facility would be completed by the end of the year. And he
repeatedly reminded lawmakers that if they confirmed him he could
spend his time trying to address their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., criticized Richardson and the United
Nations for their handling of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Nickles
complained about the leakage of oil out of Iraq in violation of
U.N. sanctions as well as the effort to allow Baghdad to export
more crude to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   While he may have faced some uncomfortable questions, Richardson
had the benefit of knowing he has the support of some powerful
Republican allies. Both Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., head of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, accompanied him to the
hearing and urged their colleagues to support his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was a lawmaker from New Mexico for 14 years. He left
Congress in 1997 to take over as the U.S. representative to the
United Nations. Known for his negotiating skills, he has twice been
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 50, intrigued many observers with his decision to
abandon the United Nations for the relative obscurity of the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
   He has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential contender
and a probable New Mexico gubernatorial candidate, and many have
noted the energy post could be a helpful springboard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a lawmaker from New Mexico, Richardson dealt with issues
affecting that state's national laboratories. He also represented
oil and gas producers in the San Juan Basin around the Four Corners
region.
</P>
<P>
   While in Congress he co-founded the House Renewable Energy
Caucus, which has helped promote the use of wind power as an
alternative energy source.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It will be a curtain call the likes of which Broadway
has never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Seven hundred feet high and one hundred feet wide, more than an
acre and a half of reinforced black nylon netting will be required
to enclose the perilously damaged scaffold and exterior elevator
tower at the Conde Nast Building before workers can begin to
dismantle the twisted skeletal remains.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, this giant net _ imagine it as a
VERY tall shower curtain or what might result if Christo came to
Times Square _ will be hanging from the top of the skyscraper by
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the curtain is up,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
Wednesday, ``much of the area can return to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle for sidewalk superintendents promises to be
anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began Wednesday on a specially designed, A-shaped
``outrigger,'' made of steel I-beams, that is to cantilever over
the side of the 49-story skyscraper. A square steel frame will be
suspended from the outrigger, along the length of which will hang
steel cables.
</P>
<P>
   Those cables will reach the ground, 700 feet below, and serve as
guy lines for the netting, which will be raised _ rather than
lowered _ into position, probably by winches. Then the towering
mesh curtain will be stretched taut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use the safety netting to create a kind of shower
curtain,'' said Buildings Commissioner Gaston Silva.
</P>
<P>
   The netting is not meant to support the scaffolding but to
protect the streets below. ``All along the scaffold are dangerous
objects, including objects that are flammable and explosive,'' the
mayor said, including acetylene tanks, tool boxes and even wood
planks, which could be lethal if they fell.
</P>
<P>
   What made the situation especially precarious at first, Silva
said, was that the upper scaffolding was no longer being supported
by the lower portion. Instead, it was resting on struts that are
intended only to stabilize the scaffolding; not hold it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top 25 stories of scaffolding are literally hanging from
the building,'' Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business, therefore, was to lash the
scaffolding more securely to the skyscraper. Beginning Tuesday
night, construction workers and firefighters threaded lengths of
steel cable around the lacy network of metal pipes and tied them to
sturdy perimeter columns on the side of the building itself, floor
by floor. That work was completed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The next protective step, which began Wednesday, involved the
cantilevering of steel beams every three to five floors. They are
to poke out from the building and into the scaffolding like
20-foot-long needles. Should parts of the scaffold break off, Silva
said, they would fall only a few feet before coming to rest on the
beams.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how long it will take to complete the job
of stabilizing and dismantling the crumpled scaffold and fallen
elevator tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's focus is on securing the damaged scaffold to the
building and putting in place the protective netting,'' said
Richard M. Kielar, senior vice president of Tishman Construction
Co. of New York, the construction manager of the project. ``All
parties involved are working 24 hours a day to accomplish this.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the curtain is in place, Silva said, the disassembling of
the scaffold and elevator tower might take another month.
</P>
<P>
   Workers will be lowered through the wide opening at the top of
the outrigger in large buckets at the end of two lines from the tip
of a tower crane perched atop the skyscraper. It has a
180-foot-long boom (almost the length of a city block) and can lift
26 tons (equivalent to 19 Volkswagen Beetles).
</P>
<P>
   Behind the soaring scrim, a worker in one bucket will use a
torch to cut apart the scaffold and adjoining elevator tower. A
worker in the other bucket will collect the pieces for removal.
</P>
<P>
   These pieces, as well as the debris and planking from the
scaffold, will probably be passed to other workers inside the
building and then lowered through the building itself, Silva said,
rather than along the exterior.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday morning, the red elevator tower provided a
strikingly slender counterpoint to the fat skyscraper it served. It
is not much more than a small truss, two or three feet on each
side, set on end. Two passenger elevators, known as hoists, ran up
and down its length, ferrying workers.
</P>
<P>
   A trip on this hoist may have been a routine commute for the
construction crew, but for a visitor to the job site, it was a
breathtaking journey.
</P>
<P>
   It conjured nothing so much as a ride in the gondola of a
hot-air balloon rising slowly _ and noisily _ from Times Square, or
the agonizing ascent to the top of the Parachute Jump. (Only this
was two-and-a-half times higher than the one at Coney Island.)
</P>
<P>
   The hoist would lurch sharply as the operator stopped to pick up
workers and drop them off. At those moments, it also seemed as if
the whole tower was swaying ever so slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Because the building has several setbacks, it appeared from
inside the hoist as if the tower were pulling farther and farther
away as the cab made its way into the sky, heightening the dizzying
sense of suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top of the house!'' the operator would shout on reaching the
last stop: the 48th floor, 657 feet, 6 inches above the sidewalk.
From there, workers walked along wooden planking supported by the
scaffold to get into the building.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the air seem thinner up there, but the
mid-Manhattan landscape was rendered strangely unfamiliar by the
perspective: looking down on the giant fins of 1515 Broadway, down
on the ornate pyramid of Worldwide Plaza, down on the silvery
mansard roof of 1585 Broadway.

STRUG REMAINS INSPIRING FIGURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB MIECH  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Lifetime procrastinators, disabled individuals,
grown men in airports everywhere and children -- her favorite --
won't allow Kerri Strug's valiant vault two years ago today fade
away.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA sophomore who will transfer to Stanford this fall said
matter-of-factly that she's also a home wrecker, sort of. Females
in poor relationships or bad marriages have informed her that her
gutsy leap in the Atlanta Olympics gave them the faith and
inspiration to start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd been in a bad situation, saying they had to realize
that they had to do something to make it better,'' said Strug, 20.
``They didn't know what to do, and they'd resolved to do what's
best for them because of what they saw in me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing to think that, in a couple of seconds, my
life changed and I made an impact on so many people in the world.
To me, it was my job to make that vault. No matter what the
circumstances were, I was supposed to do it. Now I realize why it
made such an impact. It was a pretty special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Peterson, Strug's San Francisco-based manager, and Strug
are almost always amazed by stories they hear of Strug's influence.
One overweight girl who shed 40 pounds turned her bedroom into a
Strug shrine, and an elderly woman attributes a life-saving daily
walking routine to Strug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, and we always walk away going, `Wow!' '' Peterson
said of the many functions she attends with Strug. ``I remember
looking up to Mary Lou Retton and the impact she made on me,''
Strug said. ``I never thought I'd be in a similar situation.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 23, 1996, the unassuming 4-foot-9, 90-pound dynamo known
as Baby in U.S. gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi's tumbling stable put
her mind over matter, and her team over herself, to etch perhaps
the most indelible moment at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu had bitten the Georgia Dome pad on her two
vaults to excite the gaining Russians at the end of the team
competition, and then Strug flubbed her 1 1/2 twisting Yurchenko.
</P>
<P>
   With only 30 seconds to attempt her second and final vault,
Strug tried standing on the pad but slipped onto her right knee.
Her left hand reached back to rub two torn ligaments in her left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a prayer and a boost of adrenaline projected
Strug full-throttle down the runway, over the apparatus and into
the soul of a nation. She landed square, heard another crack from
her left ankle and still executed a pirouette, her left knee bent
with her left foot six inches off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown at the time, the U.S. women would have still won their
first team Olympic gold medal because of average floor routines by
the last two Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Strug's 9.712 score, though, locked it up. But her aggravated
injury prevented her from competing in the individual all-around,
for which she had prepared for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it first happened, I thought it was the end of the world
because I didn't get to accomplish all the personal goals I had set
for myself,'' Strug said. ``Now, two years later, I realize I
probably accomplished a lot more and made more of an impact than if
I had won an individual medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything turns out for the best. Sometimes, you don't
realize it at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Strug is very active with half a dozen charitable organizations,
including the Special Olympics, Children's Miracle Network and
Muscular Dystrophy, and her docket is filled with
motivational-speech engagements.
</P>
<P>
   She figures she has spent six weekends in Southern California
since she moved here to attend UCLA after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Atlanta, I thought I'd go to college, compete in
gymnastics and study pre-Med,'' Strug said. ``I definitely didn't
think I'd be on an airplane every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosting ``Saturday Night Live'' in the fall of 1996 was another
windfall, and Strug displayed a keen sense of self-deprecating
humor when one skit featured a parody of her stunning vault.
</P>
<P>
   She has written ``Landing on my feet: Diary of dreams,''
detailing her life from when she left home in Tucson at 13 to train
with Karolyi in Houston up to the Olympics, and ``Heart of gold,''
a children's book.
</P>
<P>
   Her height, high-pitched voice and heart are magnets to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They relate to me,'' she said. ``I'm relaxed with them and I
have a great time. I think they can feel that and feed off that.
Kids are our future, and I think it's important that they have good
role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of problems out there. There are a lot of bumps
in the road, a lot of down times, but I tell them not to be normal.
Try to be extraordinary. They need someone to give them a push, to
say, `You can do it. You can beat the odds.' That's the best thing
I've gotten out of Atlanta, making an impact on kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   Strug is interning at ``Entertainment Tonight'' this summer.
Soon she'll pack up her 3-year-old green BMW 318i in front of the
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and zip to Stanford, her mother
Melanie's alma mater whose undergraduate population is about a
third of UCLA's claustrophobic 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   A stint helping out the Bruins' gymnastics team turned Strug
into more of a cheerleader than an assistant, an uncomfortable
position for anyone who has competed at the highest international
level.
</P>
<P>
   She might even return to the area for graduate school or to
break into the entertainment industry, public relations, marketing
or television.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for now it's time to find new goals, to move on to the
next chapter,'' Strug said. ``Atlanta seems so long ago, but in
other ways it seems like yesterday. It's odd. To me, I was just
Kerri the gymnast, and tomorrow no one would care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then overnight, everyone knew me. I didn't realize it would
last so long, but it's just kept going. It makes me feel
privileged.''

MILTON ACADEMY HEADMASTER SAYS HE'LL RESIGN IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edwin P. Fredie, the first black headmaster to lead a private
preparatory school in New England, has announced his intention to
resign as headmaster of Milton Academy, effective June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Fredie leaves with a long list of financial, academic, and
administrative achievements, including a capital campaign that in
three years raised $42.9 million for increased faculty salaries and
support, student financial aid, and substantial improvements to the
school's buildings and grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But he also is resigning amid more of what communications
director Cathleen Everett called ``the yeasty conflict'' that has
marked his tenure _ this time concerning his decision not to
reappoint the popular dean of the academy's middle school, Jill
Crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Fredie, 53, of Hingham, Mass., did not respond to a Globe
request for an interview. But Everett said Fredie's resignation was
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had completed all the tasks the trustees set out for him.
He had completed seven years as headmaster, and the average tenure
for that sort of job is less than five years,'' Everett said. ``He
was ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fund-raising, Fredie presided over six years of
balanced budgets, construction of a new athletic and convocation
center and a new observatory, renovation of the main library, and
full computerization of the academy's classrooms, offices, and
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, applications for admission increased by 15
percent, student financial aid rose from $1.7 million in 1991 to
$2.9 million in 1997-98, and persons of color accounted for 25
percent of the student body and 17 percent of the faculty, up from
roughly 22 and 12 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; H. Marshall Schwarz, president of the board of trustees, said
that because of Fredie's efforts, both the academy's ``reputation
for excellence and prospects for the future have never been
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   But some faculty members and parents said they were
neither &UR;  &LR; unhappy nor surprised to learn of Fredie's
resignation. &UR;  &LR; He has been a controversial figure at the prestigious
academy _ one of the largest independent schools in the United
States _ since he took its top job in 1991. He was non-traditional
and, as former principal of Needham (Mass.) High School, from a
public school background.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, some parents and faculty complained that his
style was ``too autocratic,'' said one parent Wednesday who is
closely involved in school affairs.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Boston Latin School, Boston University, and
Harvard Graduate School of Education, Fredie was the academy's
unanimous choice to succeed Jerome Pieh, who had served as
headmaster for 17 years. Members of the 1991 search committee
praised Fredie as ``a gifted problem solver'' who had done wonders
for Needham High School, despite serious budget constraints.
</P>
<P>
   But when his resignation was announced, ``it was a real relief
to most members of the faculty,'' said an upper school teacher who
asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Fredie's latest conflict involved Crafts, who in June completed
a five-year term as dean of the academy's middle school. When a
search committee recommended three candidates for the job, without
prioritizing them, Crafts was one of the three contenders.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Everett, Fredie decided not to reappoint
Crafts or to accept any of the committee's other recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the final interviews for the middle school job,
he also was reviewing final candidates for position of dean of
students at the upper school. He developed the opinion that middle
school management needed a different approach than what had gone on
in the past,'' Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that Fredie decided to eliminate the middle school
dean's job, shifting responsibilities so that many of those tasks
would be taken by two class deans _ Don Dregalla and Lenna Dower _
representing the seventh and eighth grade classes.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty and parents were upset by Fredie's decision, and
Everett described Crafts as ``extremely upset at not being
reappointed.'' Whether she will remain on the faculty at all ``is a
personnel matter that is still in process,'' Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   Crafts declined to comment Wednesday on her dispute with Fredie,
except to say that she will not resign. Everett insisted that
Fredie's resignation had nothing to do with the Crafts conflict,
and did not reflect discontent from the faculty. ``He initiated the
idea himself in June,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his tenure, Fredie ``intends to take some time off
to determine what his next steps will be,'' Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   A successor to Fredie has not yet been named. But Everett said a
search committee is being appointed, with hopes that the next
headmaster _ the eleventh to head the academy in its 200-year
history _ will be chosen sometime early in 1999.

 Por BARBARA BELEJACK 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO, D.F. _ Durante la ultima decada, la aerolinea bandera
mexicana, ahora llamada Aerovias de Mexico, se privatizo, se
declaro en bancarrota y fue reflotada. Pero sus nuevos duenos
tambien se fueron al barranco financiero, adquirio dos grandes
aerolineas, vendio una participacion considerable en una de ellas y
vio a un presidente ejecutivo huir en medio de un escandalo.
 &HT;    Ahora, tras un reflote exitoso, sus directivos planean una
salida a bolsa este ano con el fin de vender la participacion del
gobierno en Cintra, el grupo que controla Aeromexico y otras dos
aerolineas. Pero en un golpe de mala suerte, una huelga iniciada en
junio por los asistentes de vuelo de Aeromexico obligo al gobierno
a intervenir una vez mas.
 &HT;    Los expertos dicen que es una reprivatizacion. Ademas de la
reciente intervencion para evitar la huelga, la participacion del
gobierno en Cintra ha crecido, aunque la estructura de propiedad es
tan complicada que incluso los altos ejecutivos no saben
exactamente que porcion posee el gobierno. Algunos la calculan en
45 por ciento, dividido entre la Secretaria de Finanzas, el banco
nacional de fomento Nafinsa, y Fobaproa, el fondo de rescate
bancario creado tras la caida del peso.
 &HT;    El negocio mas reciente fue la participacion del 22 por ciento
de Banco Mexicano. Banco Santander, de Espana, rescato esta
institucion, pero obligo al gobierno a volver a comprar su
participacion en la aerolinea como parte del negocio.
 &HT;    A principios de los anos 90, la privatizacion de Aeromexico se
considero uno de los puntos mas destacados del gobierno de Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, aplaudida en la Escuela de Negocios de Harvard
y en los foros del Banco Mundial como un ejemplo modelo del
reflote. Pero Aeromexico se hundio bajo el peso de la crisis
economica y adquisiciones como la de Mexicana de Aviacion, la
principal aerolinea de vuelos nacionales, y un interes controlador
en Aeroperu. En medio de una crisis cada vez mas profunda, el
presidente Gerardo de Prevoisin huyo del pais en 1994 en medio de
un torrente de acusaciones.
 &HT;    Poco despues de la partida de Prevoisin, Ernesto Martens, ex
presidente del directorio del Grupo Vitro, tomo el control de la
direccion. Aunque no tenia experiencia en el sector de la aviacion,
Martens insistio en que habia viajado mucho por avion y en que
sabia como reflotar una empresa. Redujo costos, personal y rutas.
Mas importante aun, rescato a la aerolinea al reestructurarla en
una movida que entrego la propiedad a un sindicato bancario,
formado principalmente por Banco Mexicano, Bancomer, Banamex y
Serfin.
 &HT;    Para el primer trimestre de 1996, la aerolinea ya habia
declarado ganancias por primera vez en varios anos, y Martens
presidio la creacion del Grupo Cintra, empresa holding de las tres
aerolineas: Aeromexico, Mexicana y Aeroperu.
 &HT;    La reestructuracion fue exitosa para las dos aerolineas
mexicanas, afirma Luis Frias, experto mexicano de aviacion que
tiene su propia empresa de carga aerea y que felicita a Aeromexico
y Mexicana por sus practicas administrativas y exactitud en los
horarios de salidas y llegadas. ``Las dos empresas ganan dinero.
Estan bien administradas.''
 &HT;    En 1997 Cintra tuvo ingresos de US$2.200 millones, un alza del 6
por ciento sobre 1996, y la cantidad de pasajeros por kilometro
aumento un 10 por ciento en comparacion con el mismo periodo.
Juntas, Aeromexico y Mexicana controlan mas de dos terceras partes
del mercado de vuelos nacionales y la mitad del de vuelos
internacionales de Mexico. Las aerolineas han agregado rutas hacia
Europa, que se habian eliminado cuando la crisis del peso. Los dos
transportistas tienen acuerdos de codigo con aerolineas
estadounidenses, United y Delta, respectivamente. Delta tambien
tiene una participacion en Aeroperu.
 &HT;    ``La idea es salir a bolsa para finales de este ano,'' afirma
Guillermo Turincio, director de finanzas de Cintra.
 &HT;    Incluso con las saludables cifras de Cintra, la venta de las
aerolineas no sera cosa facil. La fragmentada estructura de
accionistas tendra que consolidar la propiedad en un activo
atrayente para compradores en potencia.
 &HT;    Los temas politicos y normativos tambien son otro obstaculo. El
fondo de rescate bancario y sus activos son objeto de una
investigacion del Congreso de Mexico, que tambien ha expresado
interes en el potencial monopolico de Cintra, un tema que podria
determinar como y a quien se venderan las aerolineas.
 &HT;    Todos estos temas prometen convertir en un gran reto una salida
a bolsa para este ano. Pero esa es la naturaleza de las abrumadas
aerolineas mexicanas.

 &HT;    MEXICO, D.F. _ Durante la ultima decada, la aerolinea bandera
mexicana, ahora llamada Aerovias de Mexico, se privatizo, se
declaro en bancarrota y fue reflotada. Pero sus nuevos duenos
tambien se fueron al barranco financiero, adquirio dos grandes
aerolineas, vendio una participacion considerable en una de ellas y
vio a un presidente ejecutivo huir en medio de un escandalo.
 &HT;    Ahora, tras un reflote exitoso, sus directivos planean una
salida a bolsa este ano con el fin de vender la participacion del
gobierno en Cintra, el grupo que controla Aeromexico y otras dos
aerolineas. Pero en un golpe de mala suerte, una huelga iniciada en
junio por los asistentes de vuelo de Aeromexico obligo al gobierno
a intervenir una vez mas.
 &HT;    Los expertos dicen que es una reprivatizacion. Ademas de la
reciente intervencion para evitar la huelga, la participacion del
gobierno en Cintra ha crecido, aunque la estructura de propiedad es
tan complicada que incluso los altos ejecutivos no saben
exactamente que porcion posee el gobierno. Algunos la calculan en
45 por ciento, dividido entre la Secretaria de Finanzas, el banco
nacional de fomento Nafinsa, y Fobaproa, el fondo de rescate
bancario creado tras la caida del peso.
 &HT;    El negocio mas reciente fue la participacion del 22 por ciento
de Banco Mexicano. Banco Santander, de Espana, rescato esta
institucion, pero obligo al gobierno a volver a comprar su
participacion en la aerolinea como parte del negocio.
 &HT;    A principios de los anos 90, la privatizacion de Aeromexico se
considero uno de los puntos mas destacados del gobierno de Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, aplaudida en la Escuela de Negocios de Harvard
y en los foros del Banco Mundial como un ejemplo modelo del
reflote. Pero Aeromexico se hundio bajo el peso de la crisis
economica y adquisiciones como la de Mexicana de Aviacion, la
principal aerolinea de vuelos nacionales, y un interes controlador
en Aeroperu. En medio de una crisis cada vez mas profunda, el
presidente Gerardo de Prevoisin huyo del pais en 1994 en medio de
un torrente de acusaciones.
 &HT;    Poco despues de la partida de Prevoisin, Ernesto Martens, ex
presidente del directorio del Grupo Vitro, tomo el control de la
direccion. Aunque no tenia experiencia en el sector de la aviacion,
Martens insistio en que habia viajado mucho por avion y en que
sabia como reflotar una empresa. Redujo costos, personal y rutas.
Mas importante aun, rescato a la aerolinea al reestructurarla en
una movida que entrego la propiedad a un sindicato bancario,
formado principalmente por Banco Mexicano, Bancomer, Banamex y
Serfin.
 &HT;    Para el primer trimestre de 1996, la aerolinea ya habia
declarado ganancias por primera vez en varios anos, y Martens
presidio la creacion del Grupo Cintra, empresa holding de las tres
aerolineas: Aeromexico, Mexicana y Aeroperu.
 &HT;    La reestructuracion fue exitosa para las dos aerolineas
mexicanas, afirma Luis Frias, experto mexicano de aviacion que
tiene su propia empresa de carga aerea y que felicita a Aeromexico
y Mexicana por sus practicas administrativas y exactitud en los
horarios de salidas y llegadas. ``Las dos empresas ganan dinero.
Estan bien administradas.''
 &HT;    En 1997 Cintra tuvo ingresos de US$2.200 millones, un alza del 6
por ciento sobre 1996, y la cantidad de pasajeros por kilometro
aumento un 10 por ciento en comparacion con el mismo periodo.
Juntas, Aeromexico y Mexicana controlan mas de dos terceras partes
del mercado de vuelos nacionales y la mitad del de vuelos
internacionales de Mexico. Las aerolineas han agregado rutas hacia
Europa, que se habian eliminado cuando la crisis del peso. Los dos
transportistas tienen acuerdos de codigo con aerolineas
estadounidenses, United y Delta, respectivamente. Delta tambien
tiene una participacion en Aeroperu.
 &HT;    ``La idea es salir a bolsa para finales de este ano,'' afirma
Guillermo Turincio, director de finanzas de Cintra.
 &HT;    Incluso con las saludables cifras de Cintra, la venta de las
aerolineas no sera cosa facil. La fragmentada estructura de
accionistas tendra que consolidar la propiedad en un activo
atrayente para compradores en potencia.
 &HT;    Los temas politicos y normativos tambien son otro obstaculo. El
fondo de rescate bancario y sus activos son objeto de una
investigacion del Congreso de Mexico, que tambien ha expresado
interes en el potencial monopolico de Cintra, un tema que podria
determinar como y a quien se venderan las aerolineas.
 &HT;    Todos estos temas prometen convertir en un gran reto una salida
a bolsa para este ano. Pero esa es la naturaleza de las abrumadas
aerolineas mexicanas.

ALBACORE MISSION YIELDS FRUSTRATION

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ Armies of longfins. Can't-miss angling. Albacore
galore.
</P>
<P>
   I'd heard the stories and read the counts out of the San Diego
landings _ 1,000-fish days the norm. I caught the fever when the
largely elusive tuna began showing up in Ventura County fish counts
by mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Plans were made, but as soon as I could get on a boat the bite
petered out and died. Trips I had reserved spots on were canceled
three times in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I could have motored down to San Diego, where 10 albacore
per rod were not uncommon. But my name was slated to grace the
manifest of a four-day boat leaving port there in mid-August, and,
by now, the albacore challenge had become something more regional
for me. I wanted to catch a longfin out of my own backyard of
Ventura, or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Albacore, you see, are the slot machines of Pacific game fishes;
no species is more of a gamble to catch. A pelagic, or open-ocean
denizen, the long-finned tuna swim constantly to find food sources
and agreeable water temperatures, so much so it's impossible to
tell where they'll strike next.
</P>
<P>
   Usually they are found from 50 to 100 miles offshore, or farther
_ a long haul, to say the least. Once schools are located, anglers
need to dedicate up to 30 hours on a party boat with little notice
ahead of time if they want to score.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, albies seldom show in Southern California. The last
significant Southland run before 1997's El Nino-driven bounty _ the
earliest run in a half-century and one of the richest seasons _ was
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   By the sounds of it, this year's run is starting up where last
year's left off, and San Diego anglers are virtually guaranteed
albacore. That just reaffirmed my mission: Catch an albacore at
home.
</P>
<P>
   So desperate had I become, I even agreed to ride on a spotter
plane to track the wily tuna out of Oxnard. But even that fell
through. Besides, what tackle do you use from a plane?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fax came across my deck _ an exploratory albacore
trip out of Santa Barbara _ and I bit. Bummer is, we got halfway to
Japan and still didn't catch a thing. 0-for-the-boat. A total skunk
for 13 anglers.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard that the best way to jinx a trip is to let a
sportswriter aboard, but this was out of my hands _ out of
anybody's hands. We went to Las Vegas and came back broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``You roll the dice,'' said Merit McCrea, skipper of the
luckless Seahawk LXV who oversaw anglers troll from sunup to 4 p.m.
before turning back at a spot some 110 miles south of port. ``Like
they say, `Heroes or zeros.' Today we were zeros.''
</P>
<P>
   You could feel the collective energy slipping away well before
the Seahawk _ at this point dubbed by some the Seaskunk _ returned
home in what amounted to an expensive, 29-hour boat ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' said fellow angler Ed Sanfilippo, who frequents
a bass-fishing tournament circuit when he's not tickling the keys
as a senior locksmith for the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power. ``It shouldn't happen with me.''
</P>
<P>
   That about sums up an experience that is difficult to explain or
accept. Every angler knows there's always a chance; they just hope
against hope it doesn't happen to them. There are few emptier
feelings... at least in the fickle realm of recreation.
</P>
<P>
   It must be difficult for party-boat captains to say with any
sincerity, ``Come fish with us again,'' after such a hapless trip _
even when they have done everything right. When they watched
diligently for meter marks on their fish finders, scoured the sea
for balls of baitfish and squinted for bird life until new wrinkles
bore into their foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   Skippers take it personally when seaweed and kelp are the only
things biting and their customers come home with empty fish sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, people feel like they got totally ripped off,''
said McCrea, who explored every spot he wanted to on the trip but
spied just five breaching bluefin tuna that teased him and
disappeared in ``hello, good-bye'' fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He warded off dockside requests for refunds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried,'' he explained. ``It could have gone the other way _
10 guys hammering the snot out of them _ and we wouldn't have
charged any more.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as it is said ad nauseam, ``That's why they call it fishing
and not catching.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a phrase I detest, but one that couldn't be more
appropriate. &QL;

 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A tidal wave of selling hit the stock of Computer
Associates International Inc. on Wednesday, after the company
announced late Tuesday that unexpected ripples from the Asian
economic crisis had dampened its sales expectations.
</P>
<P>
   On extremely heavy volume of more than 25 million shares, the
company's stock lost more than 30 percent of its market value,
closing at $39.50, down $17.50. That represented a loss of $9.56
billion for investors in the company, which is based in Islandia,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates derives only about 5 percent of its revenues
from customers in Asia, so news of Asia-related sales weakness
clearly caught Wall Street by surprise. But the reaction may have
been exacerbated because the bad news came just two months after
Charles Wang, the chairman and chief executive, and two other top
executives received a remarkable $1.1 billion stock grant that
wound up costing the company about $675 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It left a bitter taste in the mouth,'' James Mendelson,
managing director of Soundview Financial Group, in Stamford, Conn.,
said. ``Clearly, some portion of the selloff is an emotional
reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The company included the warning about its sales prospects for
the next six months in an announcement of its financial results for
the three months ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released after the market closed on Tuesday,
after which senior executives participated in a conference call
with analysts. During that call, the executives explained that many
of their big multinational customers seemed to be expecting slower
growth in their own businesses primarily because of the problems in
Asia. Those customers, who also have to deal with the year 2000
adjustments, seemed to be holding back on major software purchases,
the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts swiftly scaled back their expectations for Computer
Associates' full-year earnings by about 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That bad news swamped the good news that the company's basic
income had been slightly above expectations in the most recent
quarter. With analysts expecting earnings of 33 cents a share, the
company reported operating profits of 34 cents a share, or $194.2
million, up almost 25 percent from the $155.8 million the company
earned in the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, those respectable quarterly results were buried by the
effects of the $675 million write-off necessary to finance the
stock grants to Wang and to Sanjay Kumar, the president, and
Russell Artzt, the executive vice president. Because of the
write-off, the company reported a loss of $480.8 million, or 87
cents a share, for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation plan, approved by shareholders in 1995,
entitled the three executives to collect substantial grants of
stock as soon as the company's shares had traded above a set price,
$53.33 share, for 60 trading days _ a milestone that was reached on
May 21.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Wang was awarded 12.15 million shares, which at the
time were worth $669.8 million; Kumar received 6.075 million
shares, which were worth $334.9 million, and Artzt received 2.025
million shares, which were worth $111.6 million. The total package
was valued at $1.1 billion before taxes, but the executives
essentially returned some shares to satisfy income-tax obligations,
reducing the package to $675 million.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions on selling the shares will expire gradually over
the next seven years, so the three executives actually suffered as
much damage Wednesday as their fellow shareholders, or more. Wang,
for example, saw the value of his recent stock grant fall by more
than $200 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, an executive-compensation specialist and editor
of The Crystal Report, had been extremely critical of Wang's
generous compensation packages even before the recent stock grants
were awarded. Wednesday's news did nothing to soften his opinion,
even though the selloff reduced the current value of the stock
grants to Wang.
</P>
<P>
   ``He limped across the finish line, collected his huge stock
award, and then suddenly they have just discovered this Asia
problem,'' Crystal said. ``I think we will see lots of lawsuits.
This will be like dropping 3,000 pounds of chum into a shark
tank.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Crystal said he was surprised at how deeply the stock
declined Wednesday, and wondered aloud whether Wall Street analysts
had simply forgotten about the potential impact of the stock awards
on the company's earnings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joseph Farley, a stock analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin Jenrette,
dismissed that speculation. ``The compensation plan was well
known,'' Farley said. ``There was no surprise today from people
just finding out about the earnings impact.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may have been some lingering resentment, Mendelson
said. ``There is some bitterness being expressed,'' he said. But
Mendelson defended the company's decision to share its worries
about the future with its stockholders. ``I think it reflects their
desire to be as straight with the investment community as they can
be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the company's annual stockholders meeting scheduled for
Aug. 12, he added, ``It must have been a temptation to say, `If we
postpone the report a few weeks, we won't have to face our
shareholders until next year.' But they did not say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Farley remains wary, however. ``Is the selloff overdone? I think
we've all got about 5 percent of the information we need to answer
that question,'' he said. ``We have a company that has had a long
period of very strong revenue momentum and predictability of
earnings, and suddenly you are facing some vague, uncertain
developments and we don't really know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Associates announcement came in tandem with a
similar warning from Hewlett-Packard Co., reinforcing in several
analysts' minds the need to look more closely at how vulnerable
technology companies are to such secondary effects of the Asian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal pointed out that Institutional Shareholder Services, a
company in Bethesda, Md., that advises investors how to vote on
proxy issues, had recommended against approval of the stock-grant
plan when it was proposed in 1995. ``But it was approved by
investors anyway,'' he added. ``So I guess you could say
stockholders got their comeuppance today.''

   LOS ANGELES _ The American Sailing Association administers the
following keelboat certifications:
</P>
<P>
   Basic Keelboat Sailing: Sailors must sail a keelboat of about 20
feet in moderate wind and sea conditions in familiar waters without
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Basic Coastal Cruising: Sailors must cruise safely in local and
regional waters as both skipper and crew on an auxiliary-powered
sailboat of about 20 to 30 feet in moderate winds and sea
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   From there, sailors can test for a series of additional
certifications, including (in ascending order): Bareboat
Chartering, also known as Intermediate Coastal Cruising; Coastal
Navigation; Advanced Coastal Cruising; Celestial Navigation; and
Offshore Passagemaking.
</P>

INSURANCE TAX CUT FACES AIRING IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
 CUT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts Senate plans to debate Thursday its
version of a tax cut bill for insurers that would require
significantly more community investment by the industry than a
similar House proposal, a difference that could stall the measure
this session.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, a tougher version of legislation approved by the
House &UR;  &LR; in May, has cheered advocates for disadvantaged communities
but dismayed cost-conscious &UR;  &LR; insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bill approved Wednesday by the Senate Ways and Means
Committee, insurers headquartered in Massachusetts would be
required to invest $250 million in community investment funds in
exchange for wide-ranging tax relief. The amount, to be invested
over five years, is significantly greater &UR;  &LR; than the $150 million
called for by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said it was possible they would vote on the Senate
bill today, although it appeared unlikely a final bill would be
approved by the full Legislature before the session ends July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also contains measures designed to give
community advocates a greater say in how money is directed to
minority-owned and women-owned businesses, job creation efforts,
and affordable-housing projects in low-income areas. One provision
calls for two community representatives to sit on each of two
committees that will oversee how community investment &UR;  &LR; money is
spent. Another creates a statewide advisory committee to represent
the insurance industry before lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are quarreling over how much in-state insurers should
invest in disadvantaged communities in exchange for tax breaks that
could save the industry up to $69 million a year, according to
lawmakers. Massachusetts insurers, who pay some of the highest
taxes in the industry, have complained for years that tax burdens
make them uncompetitive against out-of-state insurers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Community advocates say profitable insurers can afford to
spend more in lower-income areas just as banks have been required
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and House measures would phase out over five
years the 14 percent tax on net &UR;  &LR; investments currently paid by life
insurers. They would also eliminate two taxes now paid by
Massachusetts property and casualty insurers _ a 0.28 percent
surtax paid on premiums sold, and a 1 percent gross investment tax
on worldwide income.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the House measure, the Senate bill contains a tax credit
that covers all insurers in Massachusetts and is designed to
encourage out-of-state insurance firms to participate in community
investment. The credit would equal 1.5 percent of the amount
insurers commit to community initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   For the $250 million community reinvestment funds, the Senate
bill requires property and casualty firms to pony up $150 million,
or twice as much as the House bill. Life insurers would provide one
third more, or $100 million. Lawmakers expect insurers to finance
community investment contributions from tax savings. Either bill
would save the industry at least $50 million and up to $69 million
a year when fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry's initial reaction to the Senate's
proposal was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to working out the differences (between the
Senate and House versions) in conference,'' said Stephen L. Brown,
chief executive of Boston-based John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Co. He was referring to the process by which lawmakers will agree
on a final, possibly compromise, bill before submitting a document
to Acting Gov. Celluci for signing &UR;  &LR;  into law.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Francis C. O'Brien, regional head of the Alliance of American
Insurers, a trade group representing property and casualty
insurers, said he was disappointed by the Senate bill. ``The
numbers are too big and we don't think it can work,'' he said,
referring to the higher community investment requirements. But
community activists hailed the Senate version. ``It's a big step
forward,'' said Thomas Callahan, head of the Massachusetts
Affordable Housing Alliance.

   (ITAL)The second-happiest day in a sailboat owner's life is the
day he buys his boat. The happiest day is the day he sells it. _
Anonymous(END ITAL
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Judy Cosgrove spent countless days looking up at
the dockside office of the California Sailing Academy near her home
in Marina del Rey. She had sailed Sunfish and Lasers at Penn State,
but there are differences between sailing a dinghy around a lake in
college and plying the Pacific in a deep-keeled sailboat. One day,
she stopped in. That was two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Cosgrove, 38, has chartered a boat or taken part in a
club sail nearly every weekend. She has gained two of the American
Sailing Association's certifications: the Basic Keelboat Standard
and the Basic Coastal Cruising Standard.
</P>
<P>
   She has also learned to race and has studied celestial
navigation, preparing her one day for the ASA's most rigorous
endorsement, the Offshore Passagemaking Standard _ the proven
ability to skipper a sailing vessel on a long sea passage, making
all navigational, mechanical and crew-welfare decisions in all
waters under all conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The most demanding club sail Cosgrove has been on was a foray to
the Channel Islands aboard a 40-foot Scandinavian-made flush-deck
racing sloop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sailed North from Marina del Rey to Paradise Cove where we
anchored for a night,'' she said. ``Then we set sail for Anacapa
(Island). We put in a night at Little Scorpion (an anchorage on
Santa Cruz Island) and another night at Smuggler's Cove and went
ashore and hiked around. It was great. It was the first time I had
every really lived aboard a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Her choice to join the academy puts her among a growing number
of sailors who choose the camaraderie and support of a sailing club
over the often lonely and expensive prospect of owning a sailboat,
which a wag once likened to standing in a bathtub filled with ice
cubes while feeding a wad of $100 bills, one bill at a time, into a
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing clubs serve as intermediaries between boatless sailors
who pay monthly dues and charter fees and boat owners willing to
lease out their boats to offset costs.
</P>
<P>
   Dues tend to be on par with what you'd pay for health club
membership and optional charter fees equivalent to a day of ski
rentals and lift tickets in the local mountains: About $150 will
charter a 30-foot sloop with full galley, inboard engine and marine
head to be used at the member's discretion for a 24-hour period.
Some clubs discount the rate for multiple-day charters.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs also arrange member day sails and live-aboard offshore
clinics, where skills like advanced spinnaker handling and
navigation are taught. Informal sails offer only bonhomie and the
chance for beginning sailors to benefit from cruising with more
experienced crew.
</P>
<P>
   The first body of knowledge for the beginning club sailor is the
ASA's Basic Keelboat Standard. It is taught mostly on the water. It
includes the points of sail, nomenclature and sail theory, how to
handle rigging and maneuvering in different conditions, safety at
sea and right-of-way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we do,'' says Rick Mosier, president of Marina
Sailing, ``is we put you on the boat with an instructor. There are
three students to a boat. You learn the parts of the boat _ the
shrouds, the sheets, all the rigging. During the lesson, one
student is at the helm, another handles the sheets and the third
observes. We have a rotation system that ensures each person gets
ample time at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   Marina Sailing, which has boats and facilities at a number of
local harbors, including Marina del Rey and Long Beach, combines
the Basic Keelboat and Basic Coastal Cruising standards into nine
lessons, which work out to be about $50 per lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Another sailing club, Offshore Islands Sailing in Oxnard's
Channel Islands Harbor, offers the option of taking the Basic
Keelboat and Basic Coastal Cruising standards as separate courses.
Students who pass the former may then sign out the club's Illusion
12s, Capri 22s and Santana 22 until they feel they're ready for the
latter. Class size is limited to two students, and _ true to its
name _ Offshore holds nearly all of its lessons in unprotected
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to give students a realistic picture,'' said club
president Steve Smith. ``We want it to be hands-on. The homework
can be done at home. We do man overboard drills out in the open
ocean, so it's much more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students find out that the hardest part of the whole thing is
finding the swimmer. We use a buoy that's about the size of a
person's head. With a foot of wind chop, the thing is disappearing
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dues, Offshore has a monthly charter minimum of $45,
which is forfeited if no boats are chartered. Offshore charges
about $100 for each of five full-day lessons for its combined Basic
Keelboat and Basic Coastal Cruising certifications.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the ASA-sanctioned courses and bareboat charters, most
clubs tend to hold racing programs. They also offer privileges to
visiting members of other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   With the common standards, a member of a Marina del Rey-based
sailing club with an Intermediate Coastal Cruising certification
could set up a charter through a sailing club in, say, Puget Sound
or San Francisco Bay, and the club would know the sailor has met
the training and experience for the given rating.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Munns of the ASA points out that all standards are minimum
standards. In some sailing waters, site-specific training may be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't start a person out lake sailing and then put him
in the Santa Barbara Channel without additional training,'' Munns
said. ``We can assess their skills, then figure out where you need
to get to.''

BRUINS SIGN CHRIS TAYLOR, BRANDON SMITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins signed two more players Wednesday, including
the younger brother of center Tim Taylor. Agreeing to terms on
one-year contracts were center Chris Taylor and defenseman Brandon
Smith. Both were unrestricted free agents and were signed in order
to add depth to the Boston roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with the signing of Peter Ferraro (Tuesday), both Chris and
Brandon have been successful at the minor league level and we
believe they are ready to take the next step into the NHL,'' said
assistant general manager Mike O'Connell. ``I think there will be a
lively competition at training camp among all of our young players,
not just the recent additions but players who were already in the
organization. Part of our success last season came from the
enthusiasm of our younger players and the coach's ability to
develop them, and we would like to see that continue this season
with other young players.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 26, has spent the last six seasons in the Islanders'
organization after being drafted as their second pick, 27th
overall, in 1990. The 6-foot, 189-pound native of Stratford,
Ontario, was second in scoring for the International Hockey
League's Utah Grizzlies last season with 28 goals and 84 points in
79 games.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Smith is a native of Hazelton, British Columbia,
and played last season in the Detroit organization. The 6-1,
196-pounder had nine goals and 36 points in 64 games with
Adirondack.

<P>
   The Lithuanian sailors who are docked here for the USS
Constitution Bicentennial Salute survived three weeks of driving
rain and tumultuous seas on a trip from the Baltic Sea to Boston
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could have prepared the 47 men and one woman aboard
the 180-foot-long Gore Agor-Ax Vetra for the stormy public
relations brouhaha into which they sailed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a move that had phones ringing, dock crews buzzing, and
Captain Lieutenant Vytautus Mogenis shaking his head. And it had
two of the best-known product and event boosters in town wishing
Wednesday _ uncharacteristically _ that nobody was calling them.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow word got out that the Lithuanians were in need of
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that information from Conventures Inc., the company
running the bicentennial festival, local PR person Sally Jackson
tried to turn the situation into a special-event splash.
</P>
<P>
   But she and her friend Dusty Rhodes, who heads Conventures, were
left all wet when the proud crew members told a translator that
they never expressed a need for supplies, and they did not want to
be part of a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, those caught in the chain of miscommunication
could not say where it all began. Or, they would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not talking Lithuania,'' said the unsinkable Rhodes. ``I
have never seen a rumor so out of control in this city. It is
nothing. It is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was hardly an international incident, but it was
something, according to those who were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew something was wrong right away,'' said Jackson, public
relations chief of Jackson &AMP; Company. ``The sailors kind of started
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Jackson who sent out a citywide SOS on behalf of the
Lithuanians, telling media outlets the sailors had arrived in town
``without adequate funding and in need of basic supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told news outlets in town to meet her at the dock in the
morning, where she would personally deliver the much-needed
rations: 10 cases of Samuel Adams beer, dozens of H.P. Hood &AMP; Co.
ice cream Hoodsies, and a boatload of Veryfine juices, all donated
by some of her very best clients. But pushing her clients' wares,
she said Wednesday, had nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   `The reason I wanted to get attention for it had to do with the
boat, not with the products,'' said Jackson, explaining that she
was hoping the publicity would prompt local residents to respond
with supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lithuanian captain told a visitor, a Lithuanian-American
who is serving as a local liaison, that the story was fishy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had called him up and asked him if he wanted some
American beer,'' said Gintaras Cepas, the liaison and translator.
``They were confused as to why the reporters were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They planned the trip. They stocked what they needed. And they
will restock at the dock like everyone else,'' said Cepas. ``I
don't know how that idea came out. They were upset. They are not
running low on food. They are not running low on fuel. They are not
running low on water. And they are certainly not running low on
beer because they brought a good stock of Lithuania beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Crockford, a Massachusetts Port Authority spokesman, said
the agency also picked up the information that the Lithuanians were
in need and made a plea to the local community for help.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Rhodes said the confusion stemmed from a
misunderstanding over the words ``want'' and ``need.'' Jackson said
a Conventures Inc. staffer misunderstood that the captain was in
``need'' of liquids. Instead, she said, he must have indicated he
``wanted'' to try some American products.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conversation with Conventures was that, in his
understanding, there was an offer for some local beer,'' Cepas
said. ``There was no conversation about food or any other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where the spin came in.''

ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA EASILY BUY WEAPONS, DESPITE U.S. CUTOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two African countries that had seemed to be on the road to peace
and the beginnings of prosperity are buying expensive weapons in
preparation for a full-scale war that many officials fear will
involve peasant armies and result in instability and another crisis
in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The buying spree by Ethiopia and Eritrea _ for helicopters and
pilots and rifles and bullets and so on _ is a setback for
President Clinton, who has tried to prevent the conflict, which has
simmered since May.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, Japan and other aid donors that had been smiling
on both countries in recent years fear that a war and heavy
military spending will seriously impede nascent economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to head off a war, the Clinton administration has
decided that it will suspend sales of weapons and war materiel to
the two countries, U.S. officials said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The action is quite unlikely, however, to keep the peace.
Ethiopia and Eritrea are having no trouble finding countries that
are willing to sell weapons, notably China, Bulgaria and Ukraine,
arms bazaars where the only question is, ``Can you pay?''
</P>
<P>
   China, long a major arms supplier in Africa, has shipped
Ethiopia rifles and ammunition, and more has been contracted for,
U.S. officials said. For the Eritreans at least nine Ukrainian
cargo planes loaded with Bulgarian-made Kalashnikov rifles,
ammunition and grenades have arrived in the last week, according to
Western officials and accounts in the Bulgarian press.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulgarian company that flew the weapons, Air Sofia, has 10
additional flights scheduled for the next few days from Burgas,
Bulgarian port, to Asmara, the Eritrean capital, aviation officials
in Turkey said Wednesday. Turkey has given permission to fly over
its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Air Sofia, which has been accused before of transporting
smuggled weapons and other goods, declined to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration is alarmed about the
prospects of war, it has not tried to stop those countries from
selling to Eritrea and Ethiopia, U.S. officials in Washington and
Europe said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not clear that the administration would have any success
if it tried to stop the shipments. ``We could at least make some
noises,'' an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The relative ease with which Eritrea and Ethiopia are able to
procure weapons reflects the sprouting of buyers' markets,
particularly in former communist countries, and an absence of
international agreements to control the spread of light weapons.
</P>
<P>
   One nonproliferation agreement, the so-called Wassenaar
Arrangement, which was concluded two years ago with U.S. support in
the Dutch city for which it is named, has proved largely
ineffective at stopping weapons transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke out in May, when
Eritrean troops marched into a small rocky area just inside
Ethiopia that both countries claim. But the feud is just as much
about economics. Last year Eritrea introduced its own currency,
leading to a punishing trade war.
</P>
<P>
   And Ethiopia retains its intense desire for a Red Sea port,
which it lost when Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia and became
independent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For years rebel Ethiopian and Eritrean armies had fought
together against the Marxist dictator of Ethiopia, Mengistu Haile
Mariam, who was overthrown in 1991. Since then both countries,
under pressure from the World Bank and other international donors,
had substantially reduced their armies and military budgets. But
now both are growing as they prepare for war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides are recruiting and training, heavily,'' a U.S.
official said, adding that most recruits are peasants, who will be
thrown into the front lines. ``Each will have to have a rifle and
at least one bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has sought to broker a peace, with senior
American officials, including Susan Rice, assistant secretary of
state for Africa, shuttling between the capitals. Last month
Clinton called the heads of both governments, with a plea to find a
peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in arms from Bulgaria, China and Ukraine ``makes a
mockery of this whole peace process,'' said Patrick Smith, editor
of a newsletter, African Confidential, in London.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA -- The first thing anyone sees upon entering the
Braves' clubhouse beneath Veterans Stadium is the baby blue lineup
card taped to the wall facing the door, which was where Andruw
Jones learned he was back in the lineup Wednesday night. But then
that fits the pattern whenever Atlanta's problem child has been
sent to his room these past two years. Bobby Cox always lets him
out the next night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered (benching him) but I didn't think it was in the
best interest of him or me right now. Or the team,'' Cox said. ``My
job is to get him going, not sit him down. That's a manager's job _
get his butt in gear and playing on the same page as everybody
else, abiding by the same rules.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after, there was still some disbelief among the Braves
that Jones had been drummed off the field the night before, after
allowing Lance Johnson's soft liner to fall at his feet. Jones was
humiliated, which was surely part of Cox's rationale. But then to
those who has witnessed Jones' ascension to the majors, humility
has never been his long suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It embarrassing,'' Jones said. ''The fans were booing and
stuff but they don't know. They weren't in my shoes. I made a
mental mistake and it cost me right there. But these things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Braves tried to find the 21-year-old some slack.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at it, the only way to learn in this game is to make
mistakes and learn from them,'' said Greg Maddux. Andruw's a young
player, he made a mistake and I bet he learns from it. We've all
been through it before _ brain cramps, memory lapses, concentration
problems _ we've all been there.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell you,'' said Andres Galarraga, ''if there's somebody
who's played hard on the field all year, it's him. He's made too
many great plays to let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some corners there is a real concern about Jones'
development. Cox has continued to fine him, for offenses ranging
from missed signals, tardiness, missing a team picture and finally
reporting late after the All-Star break due to travel difficulties
July 9. At some point, a failure to learn eventually becomes
defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to help him since he got here,'' said catcher
Eddie Perez. ``I don't know if he listens or he doesn't listen.
Whenever I say something to him, he says, ``Okay, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is worried about Jones, Perez replied immediately,
``Yeah, because if he looks bad, then we look bad. And I'm not
talking about the team. I'm talking about the Latin players.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an anticipation with Galarraga's signing that Jones
might benefit from a senior Latin presence in the clubhouse. But if
there has been a bond between the two, it has not done much for
Cox, who was just as critical of Jones Wednesday as he was the
night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never tolerated anything,'' the manager said. ``I can't
stand that. And I won't tolerate it. It's not like he's a real bad
guy or anything like that. He's not. It's just that there are
certain ways you play the game and that's the way it is. If you
don't want to do it, then go home. It's very simple to me. You
don't like the game? Quit! Leave!''
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested Jones may have missed some lessons in
baseball tradition from his rapid three-year rise through the
Braves' system, Cox bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``They were on him since the day he
signed down there. And everybody is saying, they were too easy on
him. Hey, they were on him. He didn't miss out on a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has seen the replay from Tuesday but refuses to view the
incident as anything more than a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right there,'' he said. ``I should have caught it. But
I don't know what the fans are thinking. I know when I get out
there, I'm trying to do my best and help my team. I just made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   It is what Jones does between those mistakes that keeps him out
there. The frustrations the organization endures over Jones are
matched by its anticipation of the finished player.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he learns to play the game,'' Perez said, ``he's going to
be the best ever.''

JAPANESE MINISTRY NOT AMUSED BY `COLD PIZZA' REMARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Cold pizza has become a hot topic in the race that will
decide who becomes the next prime minister of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   It started when John Neuffer, a political analyst often quoted
by the foreign news media here, described the front-runner, Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi, as having ``all the pizazz of a cold
pizza.'' Since then pizza jokes have abounded and pizza has had top
billing in the Japanese press.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry, however, fails to see the humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Neuffer's `cold pizza' is now too famous,''
said Mikie Kiyoi, director of the ministry's international press
division. ``Of course, anyone can say what they want, but to have
one country's prime ministerial candidate described as such is,
well, sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry is also questioning Neuffer's credentials and, by
extension, the foreign news media's coverage of the selection of a
new prime minister to replace Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned after
his ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a decisive setback in
Upper House elections on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those analysts on Japanese politics quoted in your paper or
other foreign papers are quite unfamiliar to us Japanese,'' Ms.
Kiyoi wrote in an e-mail message to this correspondent and to
Nicholas D. Kristof, Tokyo bureau chief of The New York Times. It
was his July 13 report on the Japanese political situation that
featured Neuffer's cold pizza comment and set off the commotion.
``Are they only known within the gaijin ghetto?'' she asked, using
the Japanese word for foreigners. ``Or am I simply ignorant?''
</P>
<P>
   Neuffer, for his part, cannot believe the furor his cold pizza
remark has unleashed. ``It was a glib comment,'' he said Wednesday,
noting that he coined the phrase in an April newsletter that went
on to praise Obuchi's homespun appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The tempest in the tomato sauce reflects a heightened
sensitivity to outside scrutiny that is pervasive here. Japan is
still smarting over the snub it received when President Clinton
failed to stop here on his recent trip to China, and the persistent
malaise in its once mighty economy and banking system is chipping
away at its self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently, especially the Gaimusho is being unusually sensitive
about how Japanese politics are portrayed in the Western press,''
said Robert Neff, the president of the Foreign Correspondents Club
of Japan, using the Japanese word for Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Neuffer is not exactly an unknown quantity to the Japanese
government, which employed him at its consular offices in New York
from 1987 to 1990. ``My title was special assistant to the consul
general, and my role was primarily speech writing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After that Neuffer moved to Tokyo, joined the Mitsui Marine
Research Institute and in 1994 began writing a newsletter on
Japanese politics called Behind the Screen.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the most irreverent observer of Japanese politics.
Makiko Tanaka, a young Liberal Democratic Party member whose
father, Kakue Tanaka, is perhaps Japan's most revered postwar prime
minister, recently described the current political race as ``a
garage sale.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems to be Neuffer's cold pizza comment that sticks in
the craw of the Foreign Ministry. ``I'm afraid that Neuffer might
be quite proud of his impact,'' said Ms. Kiyoi, noting that the
comment has now been recycled in the German magazine Der Spiegel
and many Japanese publications.
</P>
<P>
   She is also taking foreign journalists to task for relying too
often on the same commentators to explain Japanese politics.
``Also, virtually all foreign correspondents interview only a
limited number of analysts,'' she wrote in her message. ``In that
sense, there is no new face in analysts on Japanese politics just
as in Japanese politicians. Are they making a sort of inner circle
secretive to us Japanese? Seriously, John Neuffer? Who?''
</P>
<P>
   Neuffer regards that as unfair criticism. ``The stories I read
from foreign correspondents quote from a wide range of
commentators,'' he said. ``You could make a good argument that
Western correspondents tap into a broader range of commentary and
write a broader range of analysis than the Japanese media does.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Obuchi has handled the pizza matter in a more
gentlemanly manner than his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters outside his home in Tokyo on Sunday were surprised
when the door opened and one of Obuchi's assistants emerged
juggling a stack of pizza boxes, which he then distributed to the
press corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, eat them while they're warm,'' he urged.

 &HT;    On Deck: Philadelphia Phillies
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: WUPA, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Kevin Millwood (10-5, 4.30; 2-0,
1.80 lifetime vs. Phillies) vs. RHP Tyler Green (6-6, 4.71; 3-0,
3.12 lifetime vs. Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Millwood has lost three of his last four starts, dating
back to a seven-run shelling by Montreal on June 19. He may have
deserved better in his last outing, a 7-1 loss to Milwaukee and
Steve Woodard. Millwood was accountable for just three of those
runs over six innings, although three doubles and a home run were
included in the eight hits he allowed. He faced the Phillies in his
first start of the season, and although he left the game after five
innings with a 3-1 lead, he did not factor in the decision. Green
has become an Atlanta nemesis. He faced them twice in April, went
1-0, gave up two runs in 10 innings and left a shrugging Bobby Cox
saying: ``Hey, he's improved.'' Those two games were as good as
Green has had all season. He is 0-2 since the All-Star break and
was beaten 7-0 by the New York Mets in his last outing, when Mike
Piazza hit two home runs. Javy Lopez has a career .385 average
against Green.

 &HT;    Bulls' move makes Jordan exit likely
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Tim Floyd is an obscure college basketball coach with
no track record of significant success, but barring a dramatic
change of heart, he will be named today as coach of the NBA team of
the 1990s, the six-time champion Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The hire likely will jettison Michael Jordan into permanent
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, speculation has been rampant in Chicago that
Bulls general manager Jerry Krause wanted coach Phil Jackson out of
the picture so he could hire Floyd, his buddy and fishing partner
of 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   When Floyd resigned as head coach at Iowa State on Wednesday,
that scenario came one step closer to realization. The Bulls are
expected to make it official today.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, after six championships in eight years, refused a
one-year contract extension last month, leaving the door open for
Krause to nab Floyd, who complied a 243-130 college career record
with five NCAA Tournament berths.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, 44, apparently will take over the league's most
successful franchise, the team that sold out everywhere it went,
the team that played some serious basketball along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring brings forth many questions. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave Jordan, the sport's ultimate winner and
attraction? He has at least one more year of
better-than-everyone-else basketball in him, but has repeatedly
vowed to eschew a final run if Jackson is not the coach.
</P>
<P>
   And can Krause, the crumpled executive, bear the burden of being
labeled as the man who ran Jordan out of basketball?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions fuel the fire that has surrounded the Bulls
during the last year. Now it's come down to a perplexing triangle _
three men and a controversy.
</P>
<P>
   'Pink' Floyd: A casual meeting at the NCAA Final Four in 1987
turned out to be the defining moment that now thrusts Tim Floyd
into the NBA lexicon. It was then that Floyd, then head coach at
New Orleans, was introduced by UNO athletics director Ron Maestri
to Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   The two men chatted it up and immediately began a friendship
that turned into weekend fishing expeditions. As Krause grew closer
to Floyd, his relationship with Phil Jackson deteriorated. They
hardly spoke to each other on non-basketball related issues in the
last three years. And when Krause invited Floyd and his family to
his daughter's wedding two years ago and did not send Jackson an
invitation, their discord was cemented.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson finally said ``enough,'' and Krause began the
replacement search almost immediately, interviewing a group of
underwhelming candidates: Charlotte assistant coach Paul Silas,
Phoenix assistant Scott Skiles, Indiana aide Rick Carlisle,
Cleveland retread assistant Ron Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd was flown by private jet to meet with owner Jerry
Reinsdorf 10 days ago and again on Sunday. When he resigned on
Wednesday he told his Iowa State players during a 7 a.m. meeting
that he would be the Bulls' next coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of expected it, but the moment it happens, it's kind
of shocking,'' Iowa State forward Klay Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd almost pulled a Bobby Cremins in 1994, but he's not
expected to change his mind with this decision. After accepting the
Iowa State job, Floyd called a news conference at New Orleans,
where he told reporters he had decided to stay at UNO. His reason:
He said he'd rather go bass fishing in Louisiana than ice fishing
in Iowa. But when Iowa State sweetened the offer, Floyd left.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports last week that Floyd nearly backed away from
the Bulls' job because he did not want to be viewed as the man who
ran Jordan out of the game. He got over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a shock to anyone close to the scene had
Tim Floyd not been hired,'' said David Falk, Jordan's agent. ``This
was a decision that was made a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jordan said he would not play for a college coach. He
called Floyd, ``Pink,'' as in the rock group Pink Floyd. Dennis
Rodman chimed in, calling Floyd's possible hiring ``a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fun's just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The game-winner: Although he said he will not make an official
announcement until the NBA labor strife is resolved, Jordan's
basketball career seems over, at 35. In one way, that would not be
a bad thing, considering that Jordan penned an awesome ending with
the game/championship-winning baskets against Utah in June. Problem
is, he wants to play another season, but not in a rebuilding
situation.
</P>
<P>
   And to Jordan, Floyd's hire equals rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything against Tim Floyd,'' Jordan said. ``He
doesn't know the way I play, and I don't know the way he coaches. I
just don't feel like I want to start with someone who doesn't
really know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan reportedly refused a get-acquainted meeting with Floyd
last week. Now, with Floyd on the brink of the job, Jordan sounds
closer to the door than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted someone to put a foot in my butt and kick me
out,'' Jordan said. ``When I walk away, I want you all to realize I
can still lead the league in scoring. I can still lead the Chicago
Bulls to a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, in his most solemn tone: ``I've always stuck to my
guns,'' Jordan said. ``I always said I would not play without Phil
Jackson. I haven't changed that. I just haven't made an official
announcement. I won't make that until the time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tick. Tick. Tick.
</P>
<P>
   The 'mad gerbil': Despite the Bulls' success, Krause is viewed
as practically sinister in Chicago. It was Krause who hired
Jackson, who drafted Horace Grant and traded for Scottie Pippen and
embarked on a exhausting (and successful) pursuit of Croatian Toni
Kukoc. He signed the troubled, but badly needed, Rodman when Grant
signed with Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Krause also signed role players _ Ron Harper, Steve Kerr and Luc
Longley and everyone else on the Bulls' roster.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone but Jordan, that is.
</P>
<P>
   So, for all his maneuvering, the ultimate respect still, in some
ways, eludes him. To wit: A Chicago sports columnist referred to
him during the NBA Finals as a ``mad gerbil.''
</P>
<P>
   Krause knew that hiring Floyd would alienate Jordan _ and
probably Scottie Pippen, too _ but he sought his friend anyway. He
had the power because Reinsdorf has entrusted the organization to
Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will work out. Maybe Jordan will give Floyd a try and
persuade Pippen and Rodman to play, too. And maybe Krause will
remembered as the guy who saved the Bulls, not engineered the
team's demolition.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a good Floyd-Krause fish story.

GREENSPAN GIVES WALL STREET LITTLE TO CHEER ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman,
warned investors again Wednesday not to assume that the good times
on Wall Street would last forever, but said it was hard to know
when the party would end.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during an appearance before a House Banking subcommittee
if there would be a significant downturn in the stock market at
some point, Greenspan answered yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that history tells us that there will be a correction
of some significant dimension,'' Greenspan said. ``What it doesn't
help you on very much is when. And indeed, history is strewn with
periodic contractions of significant dimensions, and I have no
doubt that, human nature being what it is, that it's going to
happen again and again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's remarks appeared to contribute to the third
consecutive day of declines on Wall Street, where stocks also were
hurt by some surprisingly disappointing earnings news from two big
high-technology companies, Hewlett-Packard and Computer Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 61.28 points to 9,128.91,
bringing its decline so far for the week to 2.2 percent. Broader
market barometers also ended lower, and volume on the New York
Stock Exchange was the fourth-busiest of the year, at 739.9 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The market has continued to rise regularly to new highs this
year despite the economic crisis in Asia, the possibility of
resurgent inflation at home and warnings from some analysts that
equities are overvalued. Even with the latest declines, the Dow is
still up 15.4 percent since Dec. 31, the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of
500 stocks is up 20 percent, and the Nasdaq index is up 25.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who has argued repeatedly that stock-market values
are built on earnings expectations that will be difficult to meet,
said it was unclear whether individual investors would bail out of
the market in droves if stock prices fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the evidence of recent years is that people who have
built up 401(k)s and other forms of investment and have become
quite familiar with the stock market have been the ones who have
been buying on the declines, and indeed have turned out to be
prescient and wealthier,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question from Rep. Joseph Kennedy II, D-Mass.,
Greenspan said the big risk from a steep decline in stock prices
would lie in the degree to which investors had built up big piles
of debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger exists if there is an awful lot of debt which,
in the event of a significant stock-market contraction, then all of
a sudden becomes unserviceable,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   In his second of two days of testimony before Congress on the
outlook for the economy and monetary policy, Greenspan emphasized
that the ``most probable'' course for the economy is ``a
continuation of what is really quite a remarkable and benign
economic environment.'' He repeated, however, that if the economy
does not slow enough on its own to reduce upward pressure on wages
and prices, the central bank might have to raise interest rates.

 &HT;    Reeves, Buchanan have differing concepts of fun
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Atlanta Falcons head coach Dan Reeves said he and his
staff are ready for the opening of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   It begins today at 3 p.m., when the team holds its first session
at the practice facility in Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been excited about our offseason, but as the first day
(of training camp) gets closer, you get more butterflies in your
stomach,'' Reeves said. ``We've had a lot of work in shorts, but
you can't tell a lot from that. This is when it starts getting
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a matter of perspective, of course. Eighty players will
compete for 53 jobs in the oppressive Georgia heat.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Buchanan, who is entering his sixth season in the NFL, is a
virtual lock to make the team. He regards training camp as one dry
_ or rather very hot and sweaty _ run after another.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to be here? ``No,'' Buchanan said Wednesday, while setting
up hotel arrangements in Suwanee. ``There's nothing fun about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves plans to keep his daily practice schedule flexible. But
the Falcons are expected to practice twice Friday and Saturday, at
9 a.m. and 3 p.m. The workouts are open to the public.

 &HT;    GOP TO UNVEIL COMPROMISE ON MANAGED CARE
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR and MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an attempt to bolster patients' recourse against
their health-care insurers, House Republicans will unveil a measure
Thursday that would authorize stiff fines on managed care companies
that deny needed care and allow doctors to continue treatment while
the case is disputed in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure from Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., keeps intact
what health-care companies want most: a 1974 law that protects
insurance companies and health maintenance organizations from
punitive damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans see the measure as a way to bolster a politically
popular bill that would regulate the way managed care is
administered across the country. Graham and other key Republicans
say it would have the same effect as lawsuit seeking punitive
damage awards because it would allow a judge to impose fines of
$1,000 per day, up to $250,000, for making adverse medical
decisions in a ``bad-faith manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This tears down the legal immunity laws that HMOs have,'' said
Graham, who said Wednesday he was ``99 percent sure'' that House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., would support the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., chairman of the Gingrich-appointed
House Republican task force on health care, said he would support
Graham's proposal. ``I think it is a perfecting change,'' said
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a GOP caucus meeting about the health-care bill,
Rep. Charlie Norwood of Georgia said he would also support the
Graham proposal. Norwood's endorsement is important, because it was
his ``patient protection'' bill that brought the issue of
regulating the managed care industry to the front burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a dictator it would be different,'' said Norwood,
who has pushed for removing the liability protection granted health
management companies. ``But this really improves the external
review process for the patient, and that's what I care the most
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's proposal exposed cracks in the GOP caucus in the
contentious debate over how best to overhaul managed care. Just
Tuesday, Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., said that Republican leaders
would not support giving patients the right to sue HMOs for
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sneered at Graham's proposal, saying it was an attempt
to make it look like the GOP is being tough on managed care without
going as far as the Democratic bill, which would remove the
liability protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to treat cancer with a Band-Aid,'' said Rep.
James McDermott, D-Wash. ``Managed care is a patient that needs
radical surgery.''

 &HT;    Going to jail for the cause
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- Today, Sister Marge Eilerman learns how much
time she will spend behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Franciscan nun, a Fort Loramie native, will be
sentenced by a federal judge in Columbus, Ga., this morning.
Eilerman faces up to 16 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Her crime: damaging government property during a protest at the
School of the Americas at Ft. Benning, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The school trains Latin American soldiers, some of whom have
gone on to compile nefarious human rights records. Graduates
include former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and the leaders
of death squads in El Salvador and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Eilerman's activism has won the respect and support of her
family, many of whom still live in the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm behind her all the way,'' said her brother, Sidney
insurance agent Ralph Eilerman. ``There's no doubt in my mind that
it takes a pretty strong person to stand up and do what she's
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Eilerman grew up in Fort Loramie, leaving at the age of 20 to
join the Franciscan convent in Tiffin, Ohio. She worked in schools
across the state before spending time in Chiapas, a state in
Mexico's southern region.
</P>
<P>
   She said that during stays there in the 1970s and in 1994, she
saw the devastation government troops wreaked upon the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she attended a religious conference in Georgia and
became aware of the U.S. government's role in training foreign
soldiers. She attended her first protest at Fort Benning that week
and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   She was arrested four times during demonstrations and convicted
twice. Her latest conviction _ the one for which she'll be
sentenced today _ stems from an incident last September.
</P>
<P>
   Eilerman and fellow activists removed letters from the school's
welcome sign and painted new slogans upon it: ``School of
Assassins'' and ``School of Shame.'' They also covered the sign
with red handprints _ a mixture of paint and one demonstrator's
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the protesters _ including a Jesuit priest _ were
convicted of damaging government property in March.
</P>
<P>
   Eilerman had an earlier conviction for trespassing at the
school, which brought a six-month sentence. However, she was able
to postpone prison until this case ended.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Rowland, Eilerman's attorney, said she could get as much as
10 months today. She likely will have to report to a federal
minimum security prison within the next 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Sister Marge becoming an inmate baffles many in
Eilerman's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that she'll go to federal prison because she did
anywhere from $300 to $4,000 worth of damage, depending on who you
talk to,'' said Ralph Eilerman. ``But these (School of America
graduates) who've killed, none of them have gone to prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister, Botkins resident Edna Fullenkamp, said Eilerman's
fervor about the school has convinced the rest of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really sincerely think, and so do the rest of us, that this
is what needs to be done, that it needs to be closed down,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eilerman hopes she'll be able to serve her time in Lexington,
Ky., not far from the Appalachian church where she now works with
the poor as a missionary.
</P>
<P>
   She added that if the Georgia school isn't closed by the time
she emerges from prison, she will be prepared to risk another
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certain that the issue is one that I'll stay involved
in,'' she said. ``If it takes (more demonstrations) to continue to
bring it to the attention of the American people, I would say
yes.''

 &HT;    Mineral survey of Louisiana preserve sets off environmental
fight
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARRERO, La. _ This summer, underground explosions and loud
airboats have been disturbing the fragile ecosystem of the swamps
and marshlands in the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and
Preserve. But what's being done is perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Resources, the largest coastal landowner in
Louisiana, leased the privately owned mineral rights to the ground
beneath the park and, with a relatively new technology called 3D
seismic, surveyed the area to look for oil and gas. Their project
marks the first time the technology, which requires more equipment
and more underground explosions than the older 2D method, has been
used in a national park or preserve in the United States. But it
won't be the last. Burlington and other energy companies want to do
similar operations in Big Thicket National Preserve in Texas and
Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   How the project, which lasted two months and wrapped up
recently, affects the pristine landscape of the Jean Lafitte swamp
depends on who-- you ask.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will see airboat trails, but there are very few permanent
impacts,'' said Tom Mouchard, Burlington's senior environmental
engineer on the project. The company spent months researching how
best to do the operations without causing major damage. By next
spring it will be impossible to tell Burlington was even there, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Ehret, vice chairman of the Delta Regional Planning
Commission, the swamp's advisory board, sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just hate it,'' said Ehret, who is the founder of the park.
''I know from my 65 years of experience working in wetlands that
major destruction has been caused by oil companies doing mining.
It's terrible the way they leave a place. They leave damage that
can take 10 years to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially affected were the flotants, a unique, delicate
ecosystem of floating leaves and flowers that exists in only four
areas of the world. The equipment trampled it, Ehret said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is doing damage, there's no doubt about it,'' said David
Muth, Jean Lafitte's chief of resource management, who was
responsible for giving the project his blessing. ''Obviously, we
had some concerns, but we had intensive monitoring and planning as
it went forward. And we were pretty pleased with their cooperation.
But when you are running lots of heavy equipment across a delicate
ecosystem, well, you can't even drive a Volkswagen Bug through a
field without causing damage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the legislation establishing the nation's newer parks _ those
created in the past three decades _ Congress reserved the mineral
rights for the original private owners. That means those owners can
survey the ground beneath the parks or lease their rights to
companies wishing to survey. If minerals are found and the owners
want to drill in the park, that's legal too.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Hanna, spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, said the National Park Service is in an ''awkward
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When the subsurface rights are not conveyed to us, we can't
say no,'' she said. ''We are concerned, but we don't have the power
to prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the 3D technology provides a more complete picture than
older methods, most energy companies undoubtedly will want to
resurvey land, including areas under national parks and preserves.
And the method requires more dynamite than the older 2D way:
Burlington set off 440 explosions in Lafitte park alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ehret doesn't believe Burlington will find oil or gas under the
park, and in fact neither does the energy company. Mouchard said
they are more interested in land adjacent to the park but need
information from the park to get a complete picture of the region.
</P>
<P>
   The technology works like this: Workers drill 100-foot holes in
precise places and put five-pound explosives at the bottom.
Recording devices, also precisely placed, note the sound waves the
explosions make. Computers then use those sound waves to draw a
three-dimensional picture of the region, which can reveal whether
oil and gas are present.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between public and private is not a new one when it
comes to federally protected lands.
</P>
<P>
   There have been attempts, so far unsuccessful, by Congress in
recent years to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska
to oil drilling. In Georgia, DuPont Co. wants to put a strip mine
within half a mile of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
Environmentalists and Babbitt have denounced the plans.
</P>
<P>
   And people perceive the national parks to be under siege. More
than half of Americans believe the parks will be in worse condition
25 years from now than they are today, according to a report from
the National Parks and Preservation Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a perfect world,'' Hanna said, ``there would be no
exploration or development in parks and refuges.''

INJURY TO CHINESE GYMNAST CALLED `DEVASTATING' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Sang Lan, a 17-year-old champion Chinese
gymnast, remained in guarded condition Wednesday, doctors said,
unable to move her legs after suffering a severe spinal injury
while performing a routine warmup vault at the Goodwill Games on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sang was able to flex her elbows and extend her wrists, but she
experienced no feeling below her upper chest, according to Dr.
Vincent Leone, an orthopedic spinal surgeon who treated the gymnast
at the Nassau County Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Her spinal cord was realigned and treatment with
cortico-steroids was begun Tuesday night, Leone said. He said
treatment was expected to begin with an experimental drug in an
attempt to regenerate damaged nerves. In about two days, Sang will
undergo surgery to have her damaged vertebrae fused and to implant
metal stabilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Leone called her injury ``devastating'' and ``violent,'' and
said it was too early to give an accurate prognosis about Sang's
future. While he said that some improvement could be expected in
her upper extremities, he added, ``I really can't comment on her
lower extremities.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he believed that Sang would be able to walk
eventually, Leone said, ``You'd be surprised. I'm still going to
say unlikely, but I'm very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Her catastrophic injury again raised questions about the safety
of gymnastics, and of the vault in particular. The apparatus has
now produced three injuries that have left gymnasts paralyzed in
the past decade. Julissa Gomez, an American, broke her neck while
attempting a backward handspring on the horse in 1988, and died
from complications three years later. Adriana Duffy, who competed
for Puerto Rico, was confined to a wheelchair after a vaulting
accident in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Another catastrophic gymnastics injury was suffered by Elena
Moukina, the 1978 world all-around champion from the former Soviet
Union, who was paralyzed in 1980 after an accident during a
tumbling routine.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to Sang's injury said that there was no spotter to
catch Sang in case she lost control as she performed a rudimentary
warmup routine called a ``timer'' before Tuesday's competition.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the maneuver is a handspring in which Sang jumps
from a springboard, places her hands on the padded vaulting horse
and does a flip with the intention of landing on her feet. It is a
common warmup for more difficult maneuvers. Injuries while
performing this flip are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Conner, a gold medalist for the United States at the 1984
Summer Games who witnessed the accident as a commentator for TBS
television, said that while a spotter might have helped Sang avoid
serious injury, he did not believe it was necessary because she was
a proficient gymnast. ``There didn't appear to be a cause for
concern,'' Conner said. ``It was in warmups.''
</P>
<P>
   Sang was the 1997 Chinese national champion in the vault and
presumably had performed the warmup numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   Octavian Belu, the longtime Romanian national gymnastics coach,
said that Sang pitched too far forward, seemed indecisive about how
to break her fall and landed hard on her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a bad sound,'' Belu said. ``A crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Gymnastics officials Wednesday rushed to defend their sport,
which has come under increasing criticism because of eating
disorders and frequent injuries. Kathy Scanlan, president of USA
Gymnastics, said that thicker floor matting, padding around the
vault platform, safety-certified coaches and equipment-testing
centers had significantly increased the safety record of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was simply an accident that can occur in any kind of
sport, very, very unfortunately,'' Scanlan said. ``But it is not
the result of unsafe conditions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Conner agreed. ``I don't think this is evidence of abuse in
women's gymnastics,'' he said. ``It's not like someone made her do
this and she got hurt. It's a common routine that had a sad,
unlucky result.''
</P>
<P>
   Others pointed to spinal injuries to such professional football
players as Dennis Byrd, Mike Utley and Darryl Stingley, and to the
Boston University hockey player Travis Roy, and said that other
contact sports were more dangerous than gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In boxing, the objective is to knock someone unconscious,''
said Abie Grossfeld, a two-time Olympian who coaches gymnastics at
Southern Connecticut State University. ``They don't even count that
as an injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Leone said that the Nassau County Medical Center annually
treated about 16 to 30 victims of injuries similar to Sang's, most
of them resulting from recreational diving accidents and automobile
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of stress fractures in the lower back in
gymnastics; it's due to hyperextension,'' said Dr. Lewis Maharam,
president of the Greater New York chapter of the American College
of Sports Medicine. ``What happened in her case is very rare for a
gymnast. She was running at high speed and came down on her head.
This is just an accident. It's similar to a linebacker hitting with
his head down instead of up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The force gets transferred down the vertebrae until
it breaks out at the place of least strength. Did she have a stress
fracture there previously? If she did, did she know? Did she have
an inherent eating disorder, which you see in gymnasts frequently,
making her bones brittle?''
</P>
<P>
   Sang's parents are being flown to visit their daughter from
their home in Ningbo, China, located south of Shanghai, according
to Mike Plant, president of the Goodwill Games. Her mother works in
a leather factory and her father is a government housing worker.
</P>
<P>
   Sang was described by doctors and other officials as being very
courageous, but also frightened and frustrated at not being able to
move her legs.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at the hospital, Sang told her coach, Liu
Quinling, that she did not know how the injury happened and asked
whether she would be able to compete as a gymnast in the future,
according to Zhao Yuxin, vice president of the Chinese gymnastics
federation. Doctors said Sang did not cry until she was being
placed on a stretcher at Nassau County Coliseum to be transferred
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   China's two other female gymnasts would continue to compete in
the Goodwill Games, said Tu Mingde, secretary-general of the
Chinese Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to aspire to the highest level of sport, you have
to pay something,'' Tu said, meaning that there are risks in all
sports. ``They are going to give their best performances to show
that gymnastics is also a beautiful sport.''

FRIENDS RECALL SHEPARD'S DRIVE FOR PERFECTION _ AND HIS PRACTICAL
JOKES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When he finally got his chance to stand on the moon
and look back at Earth hanging in the blackness of space more than
a quarter-million miles away, Alan Shepard wept.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, he cried because his mission as commander of Apollo 14
was accomplished; in a few moments he would climb the ladder of the
lunar module Antares for the long journey home. He was also, as he
later said, overcome by emotion at the beauty of his home planet,
and was struck by its fragility and the realization of how easily
it could be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But the tears Shepard shed that day in 1971 were also tears of
joy.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after he made history as the first American in space,
only to have his dreams of flying again shattered by a malady in
his inner ear, Shepard had triumphed. He wasn't only flying again,
he had just spent 33 hours on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   To many who knew Shepard and worked with him, and who remembered
him after his death Tuesday in Monterey, Calif., it was that drive
and determination that was the essence of the man.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also fondly, and sadly, remembered as a mercurial
perfectionist _ warm and aloof, funny and serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Alan was doing something, he was very stern, often aloof
in the way he took care of business,'' said Jay Barbree, a veteran
television journalist who teamed up with Shepard, his fellow
Mercury astronaut Donald ``Deke'' Slayton and another journalist to
write a book called ``Moon Shot'' in the early 1990s. ``That was
his personality; he did not brook any playing around. But when he
played he was the biggest practical joker among them.''
</P>
<P>
   This contradiction was epitomized, Barbree said, when grounded
because an inner ear affliction that affects balance, Shepard ran
the astronaut office at the Johnson Space Center in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``His secretary had a picture of him hanging on the wall outside
of his door,'' Barbree said. ``It was a double-sided picture _ one
side was a smiling Alan Shepherd and on the other side was a
frowning Alan Shepard. When he came in in the morning, if he was in
a bad mood she'd flip over to the frowning side so that the
astronauts knew it was probably best to come back another time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he rarely spoke about it, Shepard's friends said losing
his flight status was a crushing blow to a man who wanted to do
nothing else. But instead of brooding about it, Shepard secretly
sought medical treatment and eventually had surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept those feelings very secret ... and he went off and had
that operation performed, which was a very delicate one and a very
unsuccessful one in many cases, by himself,'' said Chris Kraft, a
former director of the Johnson Space Center in far south Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did that with the sole purpose of being able to fly in
Apollo. I couldn't imagine why a man who had already become
probably one of the most famous aviators in history would want to
then risk his life in going to the moon, but that's what he wanted
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it had something to do with wanting to be on the edge,
like his hero, aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh, or his friend
and golf buddy, Houston heart surgery pioneer Denton Cooley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked the thought of being the first to do something that
had not been done before and he was very proud of his
opportunities,'' Cooley said. ``Of course he made himself famous by
trying to hit a golf ball off the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf was as much of a passion to Shepard in his later life as
flying was earlier, and he was a regular at charity tournaments
when he lived in the Houston area, said Cooley.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's death means that the ranks of the surviving Mercury
astronauts are dwindling. He was preceded in death by Virgil
``Gus'' Grissom, who died in a launch pad fire in the capsule of
Apollo 1, and by Slayton who died in 1993. But some of his
remaining colleagues remembered him Wednesday as a member of an
elite fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the original group who was lucky enough to be in on
the real pioneering of space, certainly for the United States,''
said fellow Mercury flier Gordon Cooper. ``He was certainly a very
capable guy, and a very capable astronaut. And of course, he was
like a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cooper, the remaining Mercury astronauts are M. Scott
Carpenter, Sen. John Glenn and Walter M. Schirra Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who knew Shepard also mentioned his intelligence,
an attribute Kraft said was high on the list of reasons he was
selected to make the first Mercury flight.
</P>
<P>
   It's an assessment shared by Glenn, D-Ohio, who became the first
astronaut to orbit the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it became obvious to all of us in that training period
that Al was an extremely intelligent ... dedicated leader whose
motivation toward accomplishing our mission was a true inspiration
to all of us,'' Glenn said at a press conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his Mercury colleagues, Shepard had a penchant for
tomfoolery, a tendency to pull practical jokes to relieve the
tension of training, Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator remembered his flight in 1962 when, shortly after
reaching orbit he reached down to get some equipment and a little
stuffed mouse floated up into zero gravity _ placed there by
Shepard in a joking reference to the TV character Jose Jimenez who
felt sorry for a mouse being sent into space in the nose cone of a
rocket.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the space program in 1974, Shepard went on to
forge a successful career as a businessman and a philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 he was named founding president of the Mercury Seven
Foundation in Titusville, Fla., an organization that raises money
for science and engineering scholarships, and which is now known as
the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation
</P>
<P>
   Howard Benedict, a former space reporter for The Associated
Press who is executive director of the foundation, said he met
Shepard and the other Mercury astronauts when they arrived at Cape
Canaveral to begin training for their mission. He was struck he
said, by Shepard's intelligence and his obvious leadership
qualities, but also by his charismatic smile.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as he got to know Shepard better, and began to
understand him, Benedict said, he also gained an understanding of
just how disappointed the astronaut was when he was grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why, Benedict said, he will never forget Shepard's
first words when he got to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finally here.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Shepard, the first American to fly in space, lifting
national spirits at a decisive moment of Cold War anxiety, and
later one of only 12 astronauts to walk on the Moon, died Tuesday
night at a hospital in Monterey, Calif. He was 74 and lived Houston
and Pebble Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The family would not disclose the cause of death, saying only
that it came after a long illness. But another former astronaut,
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said that Shepard had been suffering from
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of May 5, 1961, Shepard became an immediate
American hero. A lean, crew-cut former Navy test pilot, then 37, he
began the day lying on his back in a cramped Mercury capsule atop a
seven-story Redstone rocket filled with explosive fuel. After four
tense hours of weather and mechanical delays, he was shot into the
sky on a 15-minute flight that grazed the fringes of space, at an
altitude of 115 miles, and ended in a splashdown in the Atlantic
Ocean 302 miles downrange from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Though not much by today's standards, the brief suborbital
flight had stopped a whole country in its tracks, waiting anxiously
at radios and television sets. When the message of success came
through _ with a phrase that would enter the idiom, ``Everything is
A-OK!'' _ everyone seemed to let out a collective sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union's Yuri Gagarin may have been first man into
space, 23 days before, and have flown a full orbit, but now the
United States finally had reason to cheer. In fact, Shepard's
success is credited with giving President John F. Kennedy the
confidence to commit the nation to the goal of landing men on the
Moon by the end of the decade. He announced the goal to Congress on
May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goldin, NASA's director, said the Shepard flight was ``a
tremendous statement about tenacity, courage and brilliance,''
adding with a tone of lingering awe: ``He crawled on top of that
rocket that had never before flown into space with a person aboard
and he did it. That was an unbelievable act of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Logsdon, a political scientist at George Washington
University and author of ``The Decision to Go to the Moon,'' said,
``One can make the argument that the success of the Shepard flight
enabled the decision to go to the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., a historian and a member of the
Kennedy White House staff, recalled that the Gagarin flight and
then the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Cuba a few days later had given
``Americans a slight inferiority complex.'' Then the Shepard flight
produced ``a great exhilaration and renewed our confidence in our
capacity as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hailed Shepard as ``one of the great heroes of
modern America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the first flight, Shepard made a comeback from a
serious inner ear problem called Meuniere's syndrome that had
grounded him. And it was also a comeback flight for the space
program.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, 1971, he took off for the Moon in Apollo 14, the
first lunar mission since the near-disaster of Apollo 13 the year
before. He and Edgar Mitchell spent 33 hours on the Moon, a visit
made memorable by Shepard taking several spirited whacks at golf
balls with a makeshift 6-iron he had brought along. The balls
sailed in the low lunar gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived every golfer's dream,'' Clinton remarked. ``Taking a
6-iron and hitting the ball, in his words, `for miles and miles.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was one of the original seven Mercury astronauts chosen
in 1959 by the fledgling space agency and introduced to the nation
with great fanfare. His death leaves only four survivors: Scott
Carpenter, L. Gordon Cooper, Walter Schirra and Glenn, who at 77 is
training for a kind of farewell flight on the space shuttle in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom died in a cockpit fire during a
launching-pad training exercise in 1967. Donald ``Deke'' Slayton
died of cancer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Shepard retired from both NASA and the Navy, where he
had achieved the rank of rear admiral. Already wealthy from real
estate and other investments, he became chairman of Marathon
Construction Corp. in Houston and later founded his own business
company, Seven Fourteen Enterprises. The name recognized his two
missions, Freedom 7 and Apollo 14.

 UNDATED: Apollo 14. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. was born on Nov. 18, 1923, in East
Derry, N.H., where his father, a retired Army colonel, was in the
insurance business. Young Alan took odd jobs at a local airfield to
learn more about planes.
</P>
<P>
   His education began in a one-room country school, continued with
high school at Pinkerton Academy in nearby Derry and was completed
at the U.S. Naval Academy, where he graduated in 1944. He served
briefly in the Pacific in World War II before turning to aviation.
</P>
<P>
   His career moved along typically: flight training in Texas and
Florida and service on aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean. Then
he entered test-pilot training at Patuxent River, Md., elevating
himself into the elite of military aviation. When NASA asked 110
test pilots to volunteer to be astronauts, Shepard made the list
and was one of the seven chosen ones.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the early days in the astronaut corps, Glenn said
Wednesday: ``That group was tossed into a maelstrom of activity,
attention, travel and training in preparation for those early
Mercury flights. It became obvious to all of us very early in our
training that Al was a highly intelligent, dedicated leader whose
high motivation toward accomplishing our mission was a true
inspiration to all.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven astronauts were highly competitive, each vying to be
first to fly in space and Shepard often seeming to be the most
determined, self-confident and cockiest of the group.
</P>
<P>
   As the author Tom Wolfe wrote years later in ``The Right
Stuff,'' Shepard presented two different faces to his colleagues,
``both the Icy Commander and Smilin' Al,'' but he ``set a standard
of coolness and competence that would be hard to top.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard made no secret of his intense dislike of Wolfe's book,
particularly some of its character studies and its concentration on
some of the astronauts' after-hours pursuits. On tour promoting his
own book, ``Moon Shot,'' written with Slayton, Shepard often said,
``We wanted to call ours `The Real Stuff,' since his was just
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was among three finalists for the first flight, the
others being Grissom and Glenn. The decision was made several weeks
before the launching but was not announced until May 2. By that
time, the one chosen knew he would be only the first American in
space, not the first ever.
</P>
<P>
   American space managers had originally scheduled a piloted
Mercury launching in March, but some problems with a
chimpanzee-flown test in January troubled the engineers, who
decided the March flight would be another unmanned test.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, the Russians continued their string of space
triumphs by putting Gagarin in space for a full orbit. The
historian Dr. Walter A. McDougall, in his book ``The Heavens and
the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age,'' wrote that
``Gagarin's flight was a second Sputnik'' and when Shepard's flight
three weeks later lasted only 15 minutes on a suborbital
trajectory, ``The space gap, in the eyes of the world, had
widened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the power rivalry of the Cold War, the space race had become
a kind of moral equivalent of war, and in those early years after
the first Sputnik satellite in October 1957, the Soviet space
forces seemed to be winning hands down. The United States felt its
prestige ebbing with each Soviet launching.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Soviet press agency Tass sneered that the Freedom 7
flight ``cannot be compared with the flight of the Soviet space
ship Vostok.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougall noted that a poll taken after the Shepard flight
revealed that Western Europeans believed the Soviet Union to be
ahead in total military strength by 41 percent to 19 percent, and
in overall scientific achievement by 39 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On that May 5th morning, these things were not on Shepard's
mind. Because of the many delays, he had an unremitting urge to
urinate, but no way to get relief in his cocoon of a silver space
suit. He kept pleading with the controllers for a break. They would
not relent.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard described the experience in ``Moon Shot.'' ``You heard
me,'' he radioed to the controllers. ``I've got to pee. I've been
in here forever. The gantry is still right here, so why don't you
guys let me out of here for a quick stretch?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No way, Alan,'' Gordon Cooper replied, after a consultation
with Dr. Wernher von Braun, the rocket scientist. ``Wernher says
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Shepard suggested that he be allowed to urinate in his
suit. But that might short-circuit the medical sensors, came the
reply. ``Tell 'em to turn the power off,'' the desperate astronaut
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   So they did, and so relief finally came to Shepard, not long
before he made history.

 &HT;    Noisy truck could hold key to Rudolph case
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ An old pickup truck federal investigators
believe was stolen almost two weeks ago by Birmingham bomb suspect
Eric Robert Rudolph was driven a ''few dozen miles'' over four days
before it was abandoned in a remote Nantahala camp site, the head
of the Southeast Bomb Task Force said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Experts examined the engine and other parts trying to determine
a radius for the search for the fugitive, who may have used the
1977 Datsun truck to transport food and provisions to a hideout,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Woody Enderson appealed again Wednesday for help from
anyone who may have seen the blue truck between the night of July 9
and about noon July 13 when it was discovered. A note, believed to
have been written by Rudolph, was found inside with instructions to
return the truck to its owner, George Nordmann, 71, a health food
store owner who is an acquaintance of Rudolph's.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already have some information from witnesses that during
the time it was being driven by Eric Rudolph, the truck made a lot
of noise,'' Enderson said at a news conference. ''It is possible
that the truck may have been driven some distance out of the forest
area, and later back in again to where it was found. Again, the
truck did not run well but still may have put on as much as a few
dozen miles, so again we are asking anyone who may have seen or
heard that loud-sounding blue . . . truck, please contact us.''
</P>
<P>
   While investigators continued searching Wednesday, the widow of
the police officer killed in the Birmingham bombing, and the host
and a crew for the ``America's Most Wanted'' television show flew
into town. Rudolph is a suspect in the Jan. 29 bombing of a
Birmingham abortion clinic that killed Robert Sanderson and injured
nurse Emily Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Felecia Sanderson said Wednesday she decided to come to the
North Carolina mountains to appear on ``America's Most Wanted''
after watching news reports in which some residents said they would
help Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people called him a folk hero,'' she said before being
interviewed by the show's host, John Walsh, for a segment that will
be broadcast Saturday. ``He's a murderer. He's a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to bring in the pressure of a prime-time TV
show,'' Walsh said. ``Someone may just see Eric Rudolph.'' Rudolph
has been a subject of several previous shows.
</P>
<P>
   During a routine briefing Wednesday, Enderson confirmed the
existence of a ''number of small campsites'' in the search area,
which has been focused around Nordmann's home, the campground where
the truck was found and the Rudolph family's former home, where he
spent most of his teenage years. All are in the Nantahala Forest,
and investigators have said their search area encompasses about 30
square miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one of those sites, we found trash buried in the ground,
and Eric Rudolph's fingerprint was identified on one of the pieces
of trash,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said the print was on a food wrapper
at a site they where Rudolph is believed to have perched to watch
Nordmann's house for several days before approaching Nordmann on
July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Jack Thompson of Cherokee County, N.C., said Wednesday
that the campsites were in rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know who else would be in the woods camping out in the
wilderness other than marijuana growers,'' Thompson said. ''He may
have a radio. He's got batteries, I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   A million dollar reward is being offered for information leading
to Rudolph's arrest. The federal information hotlines are
1-800-575-9873 or 1-888-ATF-BOMB (283-2662).
</P>
<P>
   ''This remains a difficult and potentially dangerous day and
night search operation,'' Enderson said. ''We are still using every
means available, including canine, aerial and electronic methods.''

<P>
   Oxford Health Plans, the troubled company that once seemed to
hold great promise for the future of managed care, is warning
doctors that it must raise premiums and reduce the amount it pays
doctors and hospitals, if it is to make money.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to doctors on Monday, Norman Payson, Oxford's
new chief executive, outlined a series of steps the company plans
to take. Oxford is considering shrinking the size of its hospital
network and will try to more aggressively discourage members from
going out of its network.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford would not comment on its specific plans, and it remains
unclear how dramatic these changes will be. ``Its significance will
depend on the degree,'' said Bob Braddick, a benefits consultant
for William Mercer in New York. ``They have significant business
problems. They have to address these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   While the steps outlined by Payson had been expected, they are
the clearest indication to date of Oxford's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   They also come at a critical time. Many employers will soon be
deciding whether to offer Oxford to their employees next year, and
many employees will have the opportunity to switch plans this fall.
Oxford risks losing members if it raises premiums by too much or
makes its popular Freedom plan significantly less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford, once the darling of Wall Street and consumers alike,
seemed to have perfected the best of both worlds in its health
plan. The plan offered members the choice of going to any doctor at
a reasonable price. Then last October it stunned investors with the
news that it expected sizable losses. The company had
underestimated the cost of delivering care to its 2 million
members.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford has spent the last year trying to untangle the chaos that
resulted in a $291 million loss for 1997. As part of its turnaround
plan earlier this year, the company raised $710 million in capital
from private investors and brought in a new management team.
</P>
<P>
   But Payson's letter also seemed to signal that Oxford has a long
way to go before it returns to profitability. ``Oxford is still
losing significant amounts of money in its health plans,'' Payson
said. ``If we took no action, in time we would be in serious
financial difficulty again. Therefore, we must initiate measures
now to stem losses, with a target of reaching break-even within
twelve months.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which has been bludgeoned by news of the
company's losses, hit a new 52-week low Wednesday. Investors appear
to be anticipating more bad news in the coming weeks, when the
company releases its second-quarter results. It closed at $12.50,
down $1.3125.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining Oxford's strategy, Payson said that the company,
``by necessity, must raise rates.'' He said that the company had
already started to raise premiums for some employers, which are
``for the most part staying with Oxford.''
</P>
<P>
   Benefits consultants say that the rate increases so far have
varied significantly from employer to employer. Henry Moyer, a
benefits consultant at Hirschfield, Stern, Moyer &AMP; Ross, said that
while some clients' premiums haven't changed, Oxford recently
raised rates for one client by 32 percent. That client, which Moyer
would not identify, switched plans.
</P>
<P>
   And while some employers have been told to expect a premium
increase of around 10 percent, many are still waiting for Oxford to
provide exact figures. ``Everyone's waiting,'' said Barry Barnett,
a principal at Kwasha HR Solutions, a unit of
PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``There is a lot of bated breath out
there.'' In discussing the impact on doctors, Payson said Oxford's
goal ``is to change only those fees we need to and, in general, to
only affect fees modestly.'' But doctors, especially if they are
still owed money from claims they say are lost or have been
mishandled, may not react well to any sharp reduction. Consultants
say some doctors may abandon the network.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This could have a serious impact on many providers in this
area,'' said Charles Aswad, the executive vice president for the
New York State Medical Society, noting that doctors are under
pressure by many managed-care companies to accept lower
reimbursements. While he said the letter's ``general intent is
positive,'' he worried about the size of any reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Payson also indicated that Oxford's ``net hospital costs have
gone up dramatically'' in New York state, home to most of Oxford's
members, because of the recent New York Health Care Reform Act
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford ``can no longer afford to absorb these costs nor pass
them on directly or indirectly to employers, doctors or patients,''
he said, and the company would be negotiating with hospitals to
reduce those costs. He said the company would consider reducing the
size of its network or develop a preferred network.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation, which requires plans to help share the cost
of graduate medical education and uncompensated care, should have
had no impact on Oxford's costs, according to Patricia Wang, an
executive at the Greater New York Hospital Association. ``They
really should have been paying this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford also appears to be considering some changes to its
Freedom plan, which became popular precisely because it seemed to
offer substantial choice at a reasonable price. ``Our primary
initiative for our patients is to encourage them more and more to
stay in network,'' Payson explained. Oxford could raise the size of
the deductible it charges members who go outside, or reduce the
amount of their bills that it reimburses them.
</P>
<P>
   Payson also made it clear that Oxford plans to continue to move
away from certain businesses. ``We learned that Oxford cannot be
all things to all people,'' he said. ``We need assistance in the
challenging governmentally financed segments of our population,
Medicare and Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter went out as investors are growing increasingly
nervous about the company's financial results, which are expected
in mid-August. Analysts say that they expect a sizable loss. Anne
Anderson, an analyst at Atlantis Investment Co. in Parsippany,
N.J., who continues to bet that the stock will drop further,
forecast that the company would report a second-quarter loss of at
least $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the company takes the steps outlined by Payson, Oxford
has yet to prove it can offer a plan that is both popular and
profitable. According to Arun Kumar, a bond analyst with Standard &AMP;
Poor's, ``Breaking even in 12 months is not impossible, but very
difficult.''

RESEARCHERS PRODUCE MORE THAN 50 MOUSE CLONES
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists from Hawaii said Wednesday that they have made dozens
of adult mouse clones and even cloned some of those clones.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, coming after months of rumors, still stunned
biologists when they heard the details. It means, they say, that
advances in cloning are coming faster than even the most confident
scientists had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The research team took just months to churn out clones of adult
mice, following the announcement last year that the first clone of
an adult animal, Dolly the sheep, was created in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's issue of Nature, Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi, 69, a
biologist at the University of Hawaii, and his postdoctoral
student, Dr. Teruhiko Wakayama, report on the first 22 mice that
are clones, seven of which are clones of clones. They say they have
made a total of more than 50 mouse clones.
</P>
<P>
   The feat, scientists say, means that cloning an adult animal
like Dolly is not a fluke as some have suggested. And with mice,
they can study and perfect cloning in an easily available and
familiar lab animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' said Dr. Barry Zirkin, who is the head of the division
of reproductive biology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
``This is going to be Dolly multiplied by 22.''
</P>
<P>
   In cloning mice, Yanagimachi and Wakayama defied conventional
wisdom among biologists, who had long contended that mice would be
perhaps the one mammal that was impossible to clone because of
extraordinarily rapid development of the mouse embryo just after
fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Silver, a mouse geneticist and reproductive biologist at
Princeton University, described the speed at which the cloning
progressed as breathtaking. ``It's absolutely incredible,'' he
said. ``He did all this in the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   The implications of the work were clear, Silver added.
``Absolutely,'' he said, ``we're going to have cloning of humans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we follow scientific protocol,'' he added, ``it could take
5 to 10 years before in vitro fertilization clinics add human
cloning to their repertoires.'' The protocol would require that the
method first be perfected and shown to be safe in mice and then
monkeys. ``But that does not mean that somebody would not do it
without those steps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zirkin said that human cloning ``needs to be discussed,'' but he
added that the main significance of Yanagimachi's announcement lies
in the opportunities it creates for scientists to explore question
about basic reproductive biology. ``One of those questions, but
only one,'' he said, ``has to do with the cloning of humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of genetically duplicating any person or animal by
using the DNA of a single cell has captivated scientists and the
public for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But until last year, when the birth of Dolly was announced, most
scientists had given up on the idea of cloning adults, although
they generally agreed on the potential for cloning fetal cells.
Even though every cell in the body has the same genetic material,
cells of adults have reached their final state of development and
never budge from it. Heart cells do not become liver cells, lung
cells do not become brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   To clone an adult, the genetic material from one of these cells
would have to essentially go backwards in time and enter the state
it was in when sperm first fertilized egg.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, 1997, the world learned that Dr. Ian Wilmut of the
Roslin Institute and Dr. Keith Campbell of PPL Therapeutics in
Roslin, Scotland, had created Dolly by cloning from an udder cell
of a six-year-old ewe.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, critics emerged, led by Dr. Norton Zinder, a
microbiologist at Rockefeller University in New York. Zinder
questioned Wilmut's genetic evidence that Dolly was a clone.
Moreover, he pointed out, it took 400 tries to produce Dolly and no
other adult had been cloned. One success out of 400 tries is ``an
anecdote, not a result,'' Zinder said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmut responded to Zinder in two papers also published in
Thursday's issue of Nature. Wilmut's group and an independent group
that included the inventor of DNA fingerprinting, Dr. Alec Jeffries
of the University of Leicester, compared DNA from the original
piece of udder _ frozen at the Hannah Research Institute more than
100 hundred miles from the Roslin Institute _ to the DNA of the
udder cells that were frozen in a test tube at the Roslin Institute
and used to create Dolly to the DNA of Dolly. All the DNA sequences
were identical, the researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Davor Solter of the Max-Planck Institute for Immunobiology
in Freiburg, Germany, wrote in an editorial accompanying the papers
that the results ``now lay these doubts'' about Dolly ``to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zinder, in a telephone interview, said he still was not
convinced. The investigators, he said, did not prove that the chunk
of udder that they had stored at the Hannah Research Institute
really was the source of the test tube of cells used to create
Dolly. ``They didn't keep proper records,'' Zinder said. ``We don't
know what that chunk of tissue was.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinder also questioned Yanagimachi's work. ``I'm no mouse
expert, but it looks to me like it's very very shaky,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are mouse experts did not share Zinder's doubts about
the cloning.

 UNDATED: the cloning.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am convinced,'' said Dr. John Eppig, an expert in mouse
embryo development at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine.
``Definitely. There is no question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of this one is that it's incontrovertible,''
said Dr. Richard Schultz, an expert in early mouse embryo
development at the University of Pennsylvania. It is, ``a superb
experiment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his cloning experiment, begun just a year ago, Yanagimachi
used one of Wilmut's key ideas, but varied his method.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmut proposed that the secret to cloning was to put a cell
into a resting state, so that it was not dividing, before using it
to clone. He did this by starving the udder cells so they went into
a state of hibernation. Then he slipped one of those cells into a
sheep's egg whose own genetic material had been removed and gave
the egg a shot of electricity to start the development.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Yanagimachi and Wakayama started with three types
of cells that were already in a resting state: cumulus cells, which
cling to eggs like a thick smear of caviar; Sertoli cells, which
are the male equivalent of cumulus cells, and brain cells. That
experiment indicated that cumulus cells would be easiest to clone,
so the scientists homed in on them and used them exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi and his colleagues injected the cumulus cell's
genetic material into mouse eggs whose own DNA had been removed.
They waited six hours to give the egg an chance to reprogram the
cumulus cell's DNA and then chemically prodded the egg to start
dividing. The process of reprogramming remains a mystery to the
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   All of the mouse clones were female.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi and his colleagues verified with genetic tests that
their mice were indeed clones. Also, in one experiment, they used
coffee colored mice for the cumulus cells, black mice for the eggs,
and white albino mice as surrogate mothers. As predicted, the
clones were coffee colored.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the enthusiastic reception for the results of
Yanagimachi's experiment among reproductive biologists, he had
great difficulty publishing his paper. On Oct. 5, after cloning the
first four mice, he submitted a paper to the journal Science, which
rejected it without peer review, telling him it was ``not of
general interest,'' he said. Diane Dondershine, a spokeswoman for
Science, said the journal's policy is not to comment on papers that
were submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagimachi then he sent his paper to Nature, which forwarded it
to two reviewers, one of whom asked repeatedly for additional
proof. In March, the journal sent the paper to two more reviewers
before finally accepting it last month, Yanagimachi said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the scientists kept cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning has gotten so straightforward, Wakayama said in an
interview, that he has now made more than 50 clones and could clone
every day with no difficulty and turn out baby mice after the
normal 20-day gestation period.
</P>
<P>
   And lest anyone doubt that the clones exist, the scientists
carried a cage of mice to New York to show them off, including a
coffee colored adult mouse that was cloned, the clone created from
that mouse, the black mouse that provided an egg for the cloning,
and the white mouse that was the surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a venture capitalist in Hawaii is setting up a
consortium of companies and academic scientists to make the cloning
of adult animals a commercial reality within a few years. But the
investor, Laith Reynolds, the chief executive officer of Probio
America, said, ``We have no interest in cloning humans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides being the politically correct answer,'' he added, ``we
can't see any business in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists say, the opportunity is here to figure out how
cloning works, how to make it work better, and how to apply it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, noted Dr. George Seidel, a cloning expert from
Colorado State University in Fort Collins, scientists want to
understand how an egg reverses the program of a cell's DNA. Once
they figure that out, they might eventually be able to turn one
cell into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say my pancreas was being destroyed for one reason or
another,'' Seidel said. ``If there are some cells in my body that
can make a whole individual, they certainly can make a pancreas,''
he said. ``It's pretty important, pretty potent stuff from a
long-term standpoint,'' Seidel added.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question of actually cloning people.
</P>
<P>
   Human cloning, Seidel said on Wednesday, ``is clearly more
imminent.'' &QL;

JETT, FORMER KIDDER TRADER, SAYS HE IS INNOCENT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Jett, a former star bond trader at Kidder, Peabody &AMP; Co.
who was accused of manufacturing huge phantom trading profits,
angrily proclaimed his innocence Wednesday and strongly suggested
that racism had added to his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   An administrative law judge on Tuesday found him guilty of false
record-keeping in a civil case brought by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Jett, who is black, said in an interview that securities cases
similar to his had resulted in much lesser penalties. ``When all
things are equal and the only difference is color, I have to
wonder,'' he said. ``The laws that are supposed to treat all men
equally don't seem to be doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   After finding Jett guilty of false record-keeping, Carol Fox
Foelak, the judge, ordered him to repay $8.2 million in bonuses he
received at Kidder, fined him $200,000 and barred him from the
securities business.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge did not find Jett guilty of securities fraud as
the SEC had charged, ruling that he had traded phantom securities
that could not be considered real securities and therefore this
could not constitute a securities fraud. Jett said Wednesday that
he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jett was dismissed by Kidder in April 1994 after hundreds of
millions of dollars made from his bond trading were found to be
phantom profits from anomalies in the way the firm's computers
recorded trades.
</P>
<P>
   The firm sued Jett, charging that he had exploited those
anomalies to manufacture phantom profits to win himself huge
bonuses. Two of Jett's bosses were sanctioned by the SEC for
failing to supervise him properly; they drew fines and temporary
suspensions from the securities business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wonder if the message that Wall Street is sending out
is if you're a black man who goes down on his hands and knees and
says, please help me Mr. White Man, it will help you,'' Jett said.
``But if you want to be judged on merit, that is a different
matter. I have offended the status quo and I am being railroaded
off the Street,'' the Harvard- and MIT-educated trader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I shouldn't be trying to prove my innocence any more;
the arbitration panel found me innocent,'' he said, referring to an
arbitration panel before the National Association of Securities
Dealers that in 1996 rejected Kidder's case seeking $82.8 million
in fraud claims from him, though it withheld millions of dollars of
his deferred compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Jett, who is now managing money for friends and working on a
book about his experience at Kidder, argued that the judge's
repayment order at least implied that money he earned at Kidder in
excess of the $8.2 million fine was rightfully his. ``Tacit in that
request is an admission that the $3.7 million I made previously was
deservedly earned,'' he said, maintaining that this ranked him
among Wall Street's top bond traders.

   STATE LINE CITY, Ind. _ The border between Illinois and Indiana
runs right smack through the middle of this community of 200 people
in corn country.
</P>
<P>
   That means someone who phones a neighbor across the street must
pay an out-of-state toll charge. And walking across that street
means changing time zones. It is an hour later on the Indiana side
than in Illinois (although only for five months of the year, since
the Indiana side, like most of the state, does not observe daylight
time).
</P>
<P>
   The Tabor grain company, which sits along the Norfolk Southern
freight railway, straddles the state line. The office and the grain
elevator scales are on the Indiana side, but some of the storage
bins stand on the Illinois side. As a result, Tabor must pay
property taxes in both states.
</P>
<P>
   Actually the people on the Illinois side are residents not of
State Line City but, technically, of Bismarck, Ill., 10 miles
north, the town with the closest Illinois post office. But since
they can walk to the post office in State Line City, most of the
Illinoisans keep Indiana postal boxes.
</P>
<P>
   As Susan Van Pelt, the 36-year-old owner of the Country Pantry,
explained it: ``We look like one town. We consider ourselves one
town. We act like one town. But we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's confusing,'' agreed Amy Wright, 30, who tells people that
she lives in Illinois, in a little Indiana town.
</P>
<P>
   While the out-of-state telephone charge for calling a neighbor
may seem a bit much, some people here say it has a silver lining:
since most townspeople are unwilling to pay the toll charges, said
Gary Gustafson, a 42-year-old driver for a cookie company, ``we
just walk over and sit on the porch and talk, you know, face to
face; it's kind of nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Others simply stand on the porch and holler over to the next
state. That does not work so well, though, for Imogene Lewsader and
her mother, Alice Cox, who is in her 80s and does not hear well, or
walk much, as she did a few years ago. So mother and daughter, who
live together on the Indiana side, ride around in a golf cart when
they are not at home playing host to neighbors like Ms. Wright, the
Illinoisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to walk back and forth, instead of calling, it's made
us good friends,'' Ms. Wright said. ``Imogene loves to show us her
flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Children on opposite sides of the dividing line, State Line
Road, go to school in opposite directions. On the Illinois side,
the students are bused to Bismarck. The Indiana students take the
bus to Seeger.
</P>
<P>
   The big town nearby is Danville, Ill., which employs most of
State Line City's workers and is famous for some native sons: Gene
Hackman, Dick and Jerry Van Dyke, and Bobby Short.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the freight train, which roars through town several
times a day, there is not much noise in State Line City. In the
mid-1800s, the town and a sister municipality on the Illinois side,
Illiana, were considered up-and-comers. But Illiana faded away, and
State Line City, while retaining a post office, is missing from
most maps.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Lincoln spoke here on Feb. 11, 1861, rallying support
for his efforts to save the Union. His words are preserved on a
plaque on a boulder, sitting behind a baseball backstop at the town
park. ``I am under many obligations to you for your kind
reception,'' he said, ``and to Indiana for the aid which she
rendered our cause, which, I think, a just one.''
</P>
<P>
   While good feelings generally span State Line Road, divisions
did surface during the recent basketball playoffs between the
Chicago Bulls and the Indiana Pacers. After the Bulls had won,
several of the town's street signs were spray-painted with ``Bulls
Rule!'' and such.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably some kids on the Illinois side,'' surmised Bob
McLain, a middle-aged resident of the Indiana side of the street
who had rooted in vain for the Pacers.

   MICROSOFT-GLASER (Undated) Former Microsoft executive and
RealNetworks founder Rob Glaser is among the witnesses who will
testify about Microsoft today to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Analysts say he might talk about Microsoft's attempts to steal
customers by offering sweet deals on other products _ a tactic
similar to those at the heart of the antitrust complaints against
the company. RealNetworks say Glaser's testimony will be very
specific, but give no clues other than that. Microsoft has decided
not to participate.

   TANKERS-OIL (Undated) Increasingly anxious at the danger of a
winter oil spill, Gov. Gary Locke and Sen. Patty Murray are
pressing the Clinton administration to immediately require tug
escorts for oil-laden tankers entering the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
In a letter to Vice President Al Gore, Locke also urged Gore to
support the addition of rescue tugs near Neah Bay and the San Juan
Islands. The Clinton administration says it will soon announce new
tanker safety measures. But a top White House aide indicated it
would be difficult to put in a tug escort requirement by this
winter.

CAMPAIGN INVESTIGATOR URGES RENO TO NAME INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a 10-month inquiry, the departing chief of
the Justice Department's campaign finance unit has concluded in a
confidential report to Attorney General Janet Reno that she has no
alternative but to seek an independent prosecutor to investigate
political fund-raising abuses during President Clinton's
re-election campaign, government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Charles La Bella, delivered the report to Reno
last Thursday as he prepared to return to San Diego this week to
take over as interim U.S. attorney. In effect, after being chosen
by Reno to revive an investigation that she had been criticized for
neglecting, La Bella has marked his departure by challenging her to
replace him with an outside counsel.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella's report does not suggest that prosecutors are ready,
or even close, to bringing a case against any top Democrats or
administration officials, but contends only that their fund-raising
activities warrant outside investigation. And in a legal analysis,
La Bella concluded that Reno had misinterpreted the law creating an
artificially high standard to avoid invoking the independent
counsel statute, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella's conclusions, coming from a seasoned federal
prosecutor with full access to all grand jury evidence in the case,
represents a serious internal fracture within the Justice
Department. And the report seemed certain to provide Republicans
with considerable leverage to intensify their demands that Reno
step aside and let an outside prosecutor take over.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she has refused to budge in her refusal to refer the
case to outside counsel, and Wednesday. there was no indication
that Reno seemed likely to reconsider her position. Last fall, La
Bella had urged her to seek the appointment of an independent
prosecutor to investigate fund-raising telephone calls by Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore. But she rejected that recommendation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reno has said she carefully weighed the facts and the law before
determining that the appointment of an independent prosecutor was
not justified under the independent counsel law. She has defiantly
blocked the appointment even in the face of a recommendation last
fall from FBI Director Louis Freeh, who urged her to seek an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Her unwillingness to seek the appointment has exasperated
Republicans in Congress who have accused the Justice Department of
a politically motivated effort to subvert the independent counsel
law to protect upper level Democratic Party and White House
officials from searching scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The report follows a tempestuous hearing last week, in which she
faced withering questions by senators on the Judiciary Committee.
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who led Senate campaign finance
hearings last year, confronted Reno by quoting a confidential memo
that Freeh sent to Reno in November 1997. He quoted Freeh has
concluded, ``It is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation
for appointing an independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Wednesday that Reno and Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder had received the report and were
reviewing it. But they would not discuss specifics. La Bella would
not discuss the report.
</P>
<P>
   Labella's report has been guarded closely. He produced only two
copies, the officials said. He gave one copy to Reno and sent
another to the home of Freeh, an ally whose top agent on the case,
James Desarno, approved Labella's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Reno assembled several of her top advisers to discuss
the report, but they apparently reached no conclusions about how or
whether to respond. She has already named a successor to La Bella.
He is David Vicinanzo, a prosecutor from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The report casts possible new light on La Bella's decision on
leaving his job as the top campaign finance prosecutor, suggesting
that he could be stepping down in the middle of the inquiry because
he believed that the case should not be handled by the Justice
Department but by an outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the campaign finance inquiry has produced only several
low-level fund-raisers. But there has been no indication that the
inquiry was likely to move up the chain of command at the
Democratic National Committee or the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, the officials said, La Bella concluded that there
was sufficient information to warrant the appointment based on the
mandatory and discretionary provisions of the independent counsel
statute, meaning that he found enough specific information to
justify an outside investigation of high-level officials. Moreover,
he found that the Justice Department could not objectively
investigate them on its own, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was not clear whether La Bella recommended whether an
independent prosecutor should be named to investigate specific
officials although he assessed the activities of several senior
officials, including Clinton and Gore and others like Harold Ickes,
a former deputy chief of staff, who played an important role in
supervising the campaign from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggests that an independent prosecutor should
examine how the Democrats and Republicans used party funds to pay a
massive blitz of television ads that were thinly veiled election
messages for Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole.

 &HT;    Toddler dies from E.coli
 &HT;    By Virginia Anderson, Diane Lore and Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- McCall Akin, a 2-year-old vegetarian girl
hospitalized since June 15 from an infection normally associated
with eating tainted beef, died Wednesday at Scottish Rite
Children's Medical Center after contracting E. coli at a kiddie
pool at White Water park in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the only child of Andy and Marisa Akin of Atlanta, had
been in a coma for several weeks, her body drawing life from a
kidney dialysis machine and a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say she is the only child in the nation known
to have died from E. coli transmitted through a chlorinated public
pool.
</P>
<P>
   McCall had suffered a stroke and several seizures from the
disease that mostly threatens the very young, the old and those
with compromised immune systems. She was one of the youngest of the
26 children public health officials believe were infected with E.
coli at White Water in June.
</P>
<P>
   McCall Akin died in her mother's arms. ``Her mother was holding
her and rocking her and it was a very peaceful death,'' said Mark
Long, the boyfriend of one of the child's grandmothers. The parents
had kept a six-week vigil at their child's side. She had been in
the intensive care unit at Scottish Rite since being admitted in
the early morning hours of June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her parents literally lived in the hospital for six weeks,''
said Long. ``They've been amazingly strong through this. Of course,
they are very sad but they've shown no bitterness toward God and
they've shown no anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her struggle with the virulent toxin, E. coli
0157:H7, surgeons removed her colon, cleansed her failed kidneys
with dialysis, and supported her vital functions with respiratory
and other machines. Because the little girl tore at the intravenous
tubes, her arms were strapped to her hospital bed. She could not
talk or smile because of breathing and feeding tubes.
</P>
<P>
   The family was visited by numerous Atlanta ministers during
their vigil. And McCall, along with the other children suffering
from E. coli, received balloons, flowers and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, the parents prepared to lose their daughter _ but she
pulled through. Doctors could give no explanation for her sudden
recoveries, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall had been playing in the kiddie wading pool with her
mother just a few days before coming down with severe nausea and
abdominal cramps, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one solace I have is that in her short lifetime, all she
knew was love from other people and she`s essentially gone home to
God, '' he said. ``She was a gentle little girl. She was always
singing. Even if she was eating beans, she would be singing about
eating beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would have been an amazing songwriter had she stayed with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a beautiful baby girl,'' said Mark Givens, a
great-uncle. ``She was fun-loving and playful, just a precious
little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Givens said the family is pained by the irony that McCall, who
ate no meat, would die from a disease most often transmitted
through contaminated beef. ``One thing that's so amazing is that
this is a beef disease, and the one thing you think you'd be able
to shield McCall from would be that,'' Givens said.
</P>
<P>
   White Water officials said they were devastated. ``We're
heartbroken by this news,'' said Sonny Horton, general manager of
the park.
</P>
<P>
   White Water officials have been working closely with state
public health agencies to try to determine exactly how the E. coli
was spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't pinpoint the transmission. We're the link,''
said Horton, ``but we're not the source.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six children _ including Atlanta Braves shortstop Walt
Weiss's 3-year-old son, Brody, and 11-month-old son, Bo _ were
infected in the White Water outbreak in June. Seventeen of the
children were from Georgia and nine were from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials suspect a wading pool was repeatedly
contaminated by sick children, spreading the bacteria to others who
ingested the water. The infections clustered around two time
periods: June 11 and 12, and June 17 and18.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the children avoided being hospitalized, but of the
half-dozen who were admitted to local hospitals, many required two
to three weeks of intensive care, including dialysis and other
organ-support machines.
</P>
<P>
   One child remains hospitalized: a 4-year-old girl, listed in
fair condition Wednesday at Scottish Rite.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbeth Addison, the mother of a 3-year-old Louisville, Ky., boy
who was re-admitted to Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville two
weeks ago after contracting E. coli at White Water, said Wednesday
that her son, Matthew, had been back to the doctor Tuesday for
tests. Results from the tests, which included a urinalysis and
blood work, suggest his prognosis is good. Matthew had two
operations while he was in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli sickens about 20,000 Americans and kills 200 to 500 each
year. It produces a toxin that destroys red blood cells and
platelets, needed for clotting. Illness typically is marked by
cramping and diarrhea that can be bloody.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, people recover without antibiotics or other specific
treatment within five to 10 days. However, young children,
particularly those between the ages of 6 months to 5 years, seem
more vulnerable to the overpowering toxin. Young children can
quickly develop a condition called called hemolytic uremic
syndrome. Often, as in McCall's case, blood transfusions and kidney
dialysis are required. Children with the condition can also suffer
strokes, which can lead to permanent neurological damage or death.
</P>
<P>
   McCall was considered an important part of the investigation
because she was a vegetarian. That fact forced public health
officials to examine whether there could be a source of
contamination other than meat.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, E. coli is spread through food contaminated with
fecal matter, and most commonly, through ground beef. It can also
be spread through produce or unsanitary conditions, but tainted
beef is most often the culprit. By eliminating such a source,
public health workers began to focus on contamination at White
Water.
</P>
<P>
   Such a transmission is rare. This is only the second known case
of a chlorinated pool being the route of transmission. The first
case was also in Georgia, occurring in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at White Water park, which has installed a new
filtration system that monitors chlorine levels, has dropped by 30
to 40 percent since the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia does not have regulations regarding the maintenance of
public pools, but offers 20 pages of guidelines for individual
counties. Twenty-five counties, including Cobb County, do have
regulations about pools, but some experts say enforcement varies
widely across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Buchanan, spokeswoman with the Georgia Division of Public
Health, said the agency is working on developing state regulations
regarding swimming pools _ a plan that was in place before the
outbreak, but revisited with more urgency since the White Water
park contamination. Unlike South Carolina, North Carolina and
Florida, Georgia does not set state standards for public pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gathering information from other states, and talking to
other experts in the field,'' she said. ``We want to do what is
right and we want to be thorough _ developing not only standards,
but a way for them to be enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   She said public health officials, however, believe the best way
to avoid such a tragedy is for parents to use common sense: ``Sick
children should not be brought to swimming pools.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said the death will not change the course of the
current investigation, which has not yet identified the specific
source of the E. coli outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thoughts and prayers are with this family during this
terrible tragedy,'' Buchanan said. State Public Health Director
Kathleen Toomey was on vacation and could not be reached for
comment, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Slutsker, an epidemiologist with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, which has been consulting on the
case, said the agency is ``very concerned about this (outbreak),''
and plans to review the state's investigation and share the
findings with public health departments across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do the best job we can to make sure this doesn't
happen again,'' said Slutsker.

 &HT;    Beach volleyball meets Gotham state of mind
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- And here's today's report from the real Manhattan
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Surf: Store your boards, dudes. It looks like a duck pond out
there.
</P>
<P>
   Sand: Plenty of it, but don't even think about spreading out the
umbrellas and blankets. Mayor Giuliani hates vagrants and would
order an immediate sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Tanning Index: A 10. Use plenty of sunscreen, especially since
so many of you locals have that Northern big-city, cod-belly
complexion.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the southern side of Central Park, the bronzed endorsers
of swimsuits and lotions and the eternal summer set up shop
Wednesday. When the Goodwill Games came to New York, they brought
along with them the uprooted sport of beach volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if this city had an actual beach, the old folk would have
built condos on it long ago and Boca Raton would be a largely
uninhabited mosquito hatchery.
</P>
<P>
   So, they had to make one up, trucking in 982,000 pounds of
Canadian sand and spreading it thick over a skating rink. They
piped in some of that rock music, put up a net, invited in some
Californians and their foreign friends _ and just like that, there
was a little bit of paradise in the middle of an unrelenting city.
</P>
<P>
   Some expect even New Yorkers to get with the beach volleyball
plan. ``You'll see people (guys, presumably) taking their tops off
before this thing is over. They'll get into it,'' said U.S.
volleyballer Adam Johnson. Having seen various Teamsters going
shirtless in the current heat wave, this is not a real intriguing
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The men's competition opened this facility Wednesday. All seem
to agree it's a fine location, slopping over with aesthetics. The
court sits in a pleasant hollow, beyond the reach of car horns and
jackhammers. The skyscrapers of the city loom over the trees,
making this the picture postcard of the Games. Those lucky folks
atop the Trump Tower have a great view of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, very nice. We are used to having a beach behind us. But
this is another view. Very beautiful,'' said Eduardo Martinez of
Argentina. Martinez and Martin Conde had the honor of throwing out
the first victim on these courts. They disposed of the Swiss duo in
the opening match.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, as in most Goodwill venues, was sparse for the
first-ever Central Park beach bash. A couple hundred, maybe. People
were just too busy riding the Dow Jones to relax on the faux shore.
A shame, really.
</P>
<P>
   The heat _ 105 on the sand _ put the players in mind of Rio in
February. But the breeze was not of the usual tropical,
salt-scented variety. It was more like the lingering memory of a
million horse-drawn carriage rides through the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful opportunity. I've always wanted to play

place to play,'' said American Karch Kiraly, who along with Johnson
beat Canada 15-8 in the second match.

   Beach volleyball is a state of mind as much as a sport, one that
New York has 11 more days to grasp. Can't help thinking that this

happens to trip over Jimmy Hoffa in this big sandbox. &QC;

 &HT;    Bragging rights belong to Greene
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ In a sport where trash talking has been honed
to an art form, Maurice Greene proved a man uncharacteristically of
his word. Greene has boasted to anyone who'd listen that world
record-holder Donovan Bailey couldn't run with him, and he backed
it up by leaving the Canadian deep in the pack while winning the
Goodwill Games 100 meters in 9.96 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm the fastest man in the world,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest man on Tuesday night, and now three straight over
Bailey _ including last year's World Championships. Yet Bailey, who
now makes his home in east Cobb County, still owns the world record
and the belief that his Tuesday night defeat was no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey downplayed his seventh-place finish, saying he'd been
bothered by a heel injury until two weeks ago. A miserable start
out of the blocks cost him dearly. But before that, Bailey dipped
into his bag of tricks, staring down Greene and his training
partner Ato Boldon, who was second.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry with the Americans has intensified since Bailey's
record sprint in Atlanta, followed by his defeat of Michael Johnson
in their match race.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson produced the other bold statement, returning to form to
cruise through 400 meters in a meet-record 43.76 _ the year's best
time and the 12th fastest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it sounds as if the rivalry with Bailey is intensifying as
the athletes prepare for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as though I lost a friend,'' Boldon said of Bailey.
``Before all this it was cool ... It's about how you treat your
opponents. We're not going to worry about who stares down and makes
comments in Australia.'' The sprint rivalry closed out a night that
saw several outstanding performances:
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hartwig broke his American record in the pole with a
clearance of 19-8 1/2, while world record-holder Sergei Bubka
failed to clear a height in the pole vault.
</P>
<P>
   World record-holder Jonathan Edwards prevailed in the triple
jump with an effort of 57 feet, 11 inches. In doing so, he avenged
his Atlanta Olympic defeat to Kenny Harrison, who was last in 54-2
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta gold medalist Noureddine Morceli of Algeria took the
lead at the start of the bell lap from Kenya's Daniel Komen to
repeat as the mile champion.

<P>
   ATLANTA -- Bent, missing some parts, but not broken, Scott Sharp
and Buddy Lazier were the final men standing Sunday in the Indy
Racing League's version of a survival of the fittest at Dover, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Lazier said the rough ``Monster Mile'' at Dover Downs
International Speedway knocked at least two fillings loose in his
mouth. The bumpy race track dismounted the dashboard onto the lap
of Tony Stewart, who needed duct tape to re-attach it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Dover Downs estimated Sunday's crowd at close to
45,000 in the 107,000-seat facility. IRL executive director Leo
Mehl said Saturday that any crowd ``north of 25,000'' would be
acceptable to the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   The track will be a lot smoother when the IRL hits Atlanta Motor
Speedway Aug. 29 for the Atlanta Classic 500. For ticket

Warren Johnson, the number one qualifier and points leader, was on
the other. Coughlin defeated both of them, beating Kurt in the
semifinals and Warren in the finals. Legends

IRAN SUCCESSFULLY TESTS MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iran successfully tested a medium-range missile on
Wednesday, a senior administration official said on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon, with a range about about 800 miles, is capable of
hitting Israel and Saudi Arabia, altering the political and
military balance of power in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weapon would allow Iran to strike all of Israel, all of
Saudi Arabia, most of Turkey and a tip of Russia,'' said the senior
administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said a U.S. spy satellite had detected the
launch on Wednesday morning, and that intelligence analysts were
still poring over data from the launch of the missile, which they
believe Iran bought from North Korea. The officials are certain
that Iran successfully tested the medium-range missile, but could
not provide information on the location of the launch site or the
impact area except to say both were inside Iran's borders.
</P>
<P>
   A former intelligence official familiar with the spread of
weapons of mass destruction said: ``The major reaction to this is
going to be from Israel and we have to worry what action the
Israelis will take, because the Israelis clearly view the Iranians
as their main threat in the Middle East.'' Israel is the only
nuclear power in the region, and its missiles are believed capable
of striking any nation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is working on developing a nuclear warhead but is believed
to be years away from building and testing such a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Present and former intelligence officials said the missile came
from North Korea, which has vowed to continue selling its weapons
to any nation that can provide that cash-starved nation with hard
currency. The official North Korean news agency issued a statement
last month saying that ``our missile export is aimed at obtaining
foreign money we need at present.'' .
</P>
<P>
   Iran has long sought to launch a medium-range missile, and has
bought technology from Russia and China as well as North Korea.
Tehran's goal, a senior administration official said, was not to
strike its enemies but to be viewed as a political and military
force to be reckoned with in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some prestige element here,'' he said. ``We have long
thought that the Iranians believe that such a weapon would give
them a reach inside the region, and that they believe that it
serves their interests in terms of being a strong power in the
Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   The former intelligence official said that government analysts
had expected a test by Iran, although the timing of the launch was
not anticipated by the United States. He also said that the test
held political significance as well as military meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is they purchased a very small number of these
missiles, and that this is as much a political statement as
anything, and that the statement is to Israel, and that statement
is: `You are now vulnerable. You have to take us seriously.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't think the Iranians are threatening the
Saudis here. They want to co-opt the Saudis, not threaten them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Iranians have purchased technology for several ballistic
missile programs in parallel, buying Russian and Chinese technology
as well as North Korean technology, for many years. ``The important
point here is that they have very little indigenous internal
capability to make a real missile, and they've required extensive
outside technical support,'' the former intelligence official said.
``But they've been willing to spend the money. I'd guess the Rodong
would cost $10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Militarily, Iran's purchase of a handful of the missiles from
North Korea does not give Tehran a major war-fighting capability,
he said. But it proves they have passed a milestone in military
technology, ``In the long term,'' he said, ``the missile production
assistance they've gotten from Russia and China will have the
greater impact. But the Rodongs are the attention getters.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that they were certain only that the missile
test was successful, and the missile tested was similar or perhaps
identical to the Korean Rodong missile. Beyond that, they were
struggling on Wednesday night to analyze the meaning of the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that North Korea transferred Rodong missiles
to Iran,'' the senior administration official said. ``This appears
to be a Rodong missile. Now, the Iranians are trying to produce the
Rodong on their own. Whether they fired a Rodong missile themselves
or whether they assembled a missile by reverse-engineering a Rodong
_ either way, this is a North Korean missile with another name.''
</P>
<P>
   The name Iran has give the missile, he said, is the Shahab-3.
</P>
<P>
   The launch tells the world about Iran's capabilities, but not
its intentions, officials said. ``This is a demonstration of Iran's
perceived need to have the capability to threaten targets outside
the immediate Persian Gulf area,'' one official said. ``It's now
clear that they have the political commitment to seek that kind of
capability.''
</P>
<P>
   The test ``will not come as a big surprise to the Israelis,'' he
said, ``because they've been following Iran's missile program very
closely. And they know, and we know, that ability to test-fire a
missile and the ability to develop, produce and deploy a large
scale force are two very different things. It could take years for
Iran to achieve that capability and we have to do our best to
retard that.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials contend that they have had some success
in limiting Russian and Chinese military assistance to Iran. Russia
said last week it was investigating nine companies for illegally
providing weapons technology to Iran, and the United States imposed
trade restrictions on those firms.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two high-ranking Republican senators said Wednesday
that they were considering whether to try to hold up the nomination
of Bill Richardson to be energy secretary unless the Clinton
administration moved toward establishing a temporary repository for
nuclear waste from civilian power reactors.
</P>
<P>
   At a confirmation hearing held by the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, Richardson, who is currently the chief U.S.
delegate to the United Nations, was also aggressively questioned
about Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, sought
details about how Richardson had offered a job at the U.N. mission
to Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern at the center of an
investigation into her relationship with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he had interviewed Ms. Lewinsky at his suite at
the Watergate Hotel because John Podesta, the deputy chief of staff
at the White House, asked him to do so as a favor to Betty Currie,
Clinton's personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that the interview was conducted by his chief of
staff, that his executive assistant was also present and that
although the meeting took place at 7:30 a.m., it was not a
breakfast meeting. Murkowski went so far as to ask about where in
the suite the interview took place and where Richardson had slept,
but he seemed satisfied with the answers.
</P>
<P>
   But Murkowski and Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, pressed hard for a
sign that the administration would agree to build an above-ground
``interim'' storage site for spent fuel now piling up at utility
reactors around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s the Energy Department agreed to begin taking
custody of such fuel in January of this year, but because of
various delays in trying to find a suitable site, has acknowledged
that it still might be more than a decade from having an
underground repository ready.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has argued that establishment of an
above-ground repository would drain money and attention away from
the search for a long-term solution, a position that Richardson
restated Wednesday. But several members of the committee pointed
out that the courts have ruled that the department has breached
valid contracts with the utilities, and that those utilities are
now seeking damages.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that Richardson was ``the man who has been touted
around the world as a negotiator'' and that he should negotiate a
deal to open a temporary repository. But Craig said he did not want
the nomination to come to a vote without an indication that the
administration was allowing Richardson leeway on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he was considering putting a hold on the nomination,
and Murkowski said he was supporting Craig. Several other members
said it would be unfair to hold the nomination hostage over a
policy issue, but aides to Craig said after the hearing that he was
still considering the move, and hoping that negotiations with the
administration would make that unnecessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, Bill, that it happens to be you,'' Craig said,
adding, ``I don't know where I'll get with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson won a generally friendly reception from the
committee. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., spoke on his behalf, and said
that although he would prefer abolishing the department, this was
not likely to happen and Richardson was ``a good choice to keep the
department under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, a former representative from New Mexico whose
district included a major nuclear-weapons laboratory, testified on
a wide variety of issues facing the Energy Department, which is
mostly concerned with nuclear weapons and environmental cleanup of
weapons manufacture. He broke little new ground, saying he wanted
more communication with states and more efficient spending on
contractors.

BLOODY BOOTS ADD NEW TWIST TO JASPER CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A pair of bloody boots could show that a
cooperative suspect in Jasper's racial killing last month had more
to do with the dragging death than he has admitted to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   If FBI laboratory results on the boots confirm suspicions,
prosecutors may seek the death penalty for Shawn Berry, District
Attorney Guy James Gray of Jasper County said Wednesday. While
declining to elaborate, Gray said that other forensic evidence also
suggests a more active role by Berry in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   When Berry, 23, of Jasper was indicted separately from Bill
King, 23, of Jasper and Russell Brewer Jr., 31, of Sulphur Springs,
Gray said prosecutors might seek a lesser sentence for Berry in
exchange for his testimony against the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Berry is the only defendant who has made statements to
investigators, telling them that he picked up James Byrd Jr., 49,
after he saw him walking along a Jasper street. He said King later
took the wheel of his pickup and drove Byrd to a remote area east
of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Jassper, a town of 8,000 people, is about 150 miles northeast of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said the other two men beat Byrd until he was unconscious
and then chained his ankles to the bumper of the pickup.
Investigators found a trail of blood and body parts almost three
miles long.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence may show Berry did more than just watch, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday officials filed an affidavit that said the
``Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory in Washington has
informed investigators that blood had been detected on three pairs
of shoes previously seized from John William King, Shawn Allen
Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer (from) their apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   The document continued, ``It is believed that evidence as to the
suspects' feet will link the suspects to the shoes and to the
homicide of James Byrd Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said each defendant wears a different size of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier affidavit released by investigators said Berry
claimed he ran away while Byrd was being beaten and did not see him
being chained to the truck. Berry later told investigators that he
saw the beating and chaining, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   But Berry's attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn, said blood on
Berry's boots would not prove that he took part in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen any evidence that would indicate that he took
part,'' Hawthorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said there was a lot of blood at the scene and that
Berry might have stepped in some of it. The other two also might
have tracked blood into the pickup and some of it could have gotten
on Berry's shoes in the truck, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said he is not even sure investigators are testing the
right footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed me a picture of a pair of cowboy boots, but that
wasn't what Berry was wearing that night,'' Hawthorn said. He said
his client was wearing a pair of ankle-high Polo brand boots the
night of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not yet gotten lab results showing whose blood
was on the shoes, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said that if he decides to seek the death penalty for
Berry, he may ask a grand jury to re-indict all the suspects and
try them all together.
</P>
<P>
   Trying them together not only would save Jasper County money,
Gray said, but also would prevent evidence from being revealed in
one case before another defendant is tried.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said, in any case, he would seek to have Berry's trial
severed from trials of the other defendants. If Berry is tried with
the other two, it might be grounds for an appeal, he said.

SENATE PANEL REJECTS NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Fla., S.C., Ohio, Va., W.Va., Conn., Pa., Mass.,
Mich., Calif.)  (th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday
rejected President Clinton's choice for secretary of the Air Force,
dealing the administration a setback on a high-level political
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   When supporters of the nominee, Florida state Sen. Daryl Jones,
failed to muster enough votes to win endorsement, they tried to
have the committee send his nomination to the full Senate without a
recommendation. But even that effort failed on a 9-9 vote, mainly
along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the Pentagon on Wednesday could recall the last time
the Senate refused a president's nomination to head a branch of the
armed services. Not since the Democratic-controlled Senate rejected
President George Bush's choice of former Sen. John Tower to be
Defense secretary in 1989 had senators been so torn over a
presidential pick for a top Pentagon job.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Jones, an Air Force Academy graduate and former
fighter pilot, said they were troubled by discrepancies in his
statements about his flying record in the Air Force Reserve and his
business dealings. Above all, they said, they feared that he could
never surmount the controversy and become an effective leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him constantly correcting the record, modifying his
statements and pleading ignorance to rules, regulations and law,''
said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones' supporters said he was a model public servant and
military man who was victimized by a web of unproven accusations
and honest mistakes. ``We're about to vote to wreck a man's career
and life over unproven allegations,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   As Jones left the Pentagon on Wednesday, his quest to become the
first black Air Force secretary dashed, the 43-year-old lawyer said
he was ``obviously disappointed'' by the outcome, and added that
none of the objections raised against him ``made logical sense to
me.'' Jones said he would return to Florida to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In Senate hearings in the past month, former squadron mates,
including his former commander, accused Jones of lying about why he
stopped flying F-16s in an Air Force Reserve unit in Florida. Other
accusations surfaced, including that Jones pressured enlisted
airmen to buy Amway household products he sold and that he
collected $88-a-month flight pay for nearly four years after he had
taken a desk job and was no longer flying.
</P>
<P>
   Jones stoutly denied the accusations, and his supporters said at
least some of the complaints against him, especially those from his
former Reserve unit, the 93rd Fighter Squadron, resulted from
racial animosity. Jones was the first black pilot in the F-16 unit,
and some former squadron mates testified last week that some white
pilots had resented him, suspecting that he had won a spot in the
unit because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has repeatedly said he did not encounter racism in the
squadron.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's vote, in an ornate hearing room, senators
alternately defended and condemned Jones, evoking memories of the
grim day nine years ago when the same panel rejected Tower over
allegations about his private conduct and possible conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was the fear of turning Jones' nomination into ``a
national circus'' like Tower's became, Coats said, that led the
committee to refuse to report Jones' selection to the Senate floor,
even without a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the panel's chairman, was the lone
Republican of the committee's 10, to stick up for Jones. The others
did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe he can be a leader or gain the confidence of
others,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect him to be perfect, but we do expect him to be
honest,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the eight Democrats on the panel _ Sen. Robert
Byrd of West Virginia and Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia _ voiced
strong support for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daryl Jones is an American success story,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``His commitment has been to public service,'' said Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had telephoned wavering senators on behalf of Jones and
Wednesday he voiced disappointment. ``He deserved the opportunity
to be considered by the full Senate,'' Clinton said in a statement,
after meeting with Jones at the White House for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Armed
Services Committee, called on the White House to quickly nominate
someone else to fill the Air Force's top civilian job, which
oversees the service's budgets, training and recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials privately mentioned two California
Democrats as possibilities: Ron Dellums, a retired congressman, and
Jane Harman, a California congresswoman who lost the Democratic
nomination in the California governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' doomed nomination underscored the administration's
persistent problem in vetting candidates for high-level positions.
Several of Clinton's picks, ranging from Zoe Baird for attorney
general to Lani Guinier for a Justice Department position, have
become embroiled in such controversy that they either withdrew
their nominations or were abandoned by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's vote, White House and Pentagon officials
blamed each other for not properly vetting Jones. Some officials
even faulted Jones for not alerting administration officials to
potential accusations, even bogus ones, that could be used against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were aware of some problems, but did
not think they were disqualifying. But there were some unpleasant
surprises, such as fees that Jones accepted from a Florida bond
firm. The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated and
cleared Jones, but the incident troubled many senators.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration aides acknowledged a sense of false
confidence that Jones' political opponents in Florida, where he has
served in the state Legislature since 1990, would have already dug
up any serious accusations. &QL;

GYMNASTIC INJURIES HARD TO AVOID, COACHES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also GYM-GOODWILL-LAN-SANG) 
(mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of the gymnastics injury that left Sang Lan of China
paralyzed below the upper chest, gymnastics coaches agreed
Wednesday that injuries are inevitable in the sport, even in
practice and at any age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accidents happen in contact sports,'' said Tony Gahman of
North Star in Montville, N.J., president of United States of
America Elite Coaches Association, ``and gymnastics is a contact
sport because of the equipment. You're hitting a vaulting horse or
you're hitting the floor. That's contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Sang is 17. Most female gymnasts are much younger, and Gahman
said they are not injured as frequently as their elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get older,'' he said, ``you're going to find more use
injuries coming out. You do something wrong for eight years and it
will show up. If you throw a baseball the wrong way for eight
years, in time your shoulder will pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways you can get hurt,'' he added.
``Sometimes when they're warming up, the girls are nervous. But
this age is probably the safest gymnastics has ever been. Equipment
is better, mats are softer, coaching techniques and spotting
techniques are more advanced. But accidents happen. There have been
a lot of new acrobatics in the last five to seven years, but I
haven't seen accidents as a result of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Pendergast is the owner and head coach of Paragon
Gymnastics in Closter, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the lower levels of ability,'' he said, ``there are not
many problems. They are not doing enough high-impact pounding or
landing. On higher levels, we have Achilles' tendinitis, patellar
tendinitis, maybe a rolled ankle. The injuries run the gamut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think injuries are ever inevitable, but when you're at
this level of skill and in this level of competition, you pretty
much know how to bail out and not get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for injuries may be the greater physical stress
caused by the increased difficulty in routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago,'' Pendergast said, ``Cathy Rigby did
wonderful things. Now my 7-to-10-year-olds are doing more than she
did. Their compulsories on the beam are harder than what she was
doing in optionals. My 9-to-14-year-olds are doing more than Olga
Korbut did in floor exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 article in the New England Journal of Medicine discussed
the physical and emotional problems of elite female gymnasts. It
said in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Most elite gymnasts do not pass through childhood and
adolescence without injury....Repetitive stress on the developing
musculoskeletal system, which has a much higher cartilage content
than in adults, may cause an accumulation of minor physical insults
that can result in permanent injury or deformity.''

REFEREES VYING FOR 10 OPENINGS IN THE NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Basketball players are not the only
hopefuls in the FILA Summer Pro League at The Pyramid at Long Beach
State. Forty referees, who have officiated in college and/or the
CBA, are vying for five to 10 openings in the NBA. All of the 40
referees are lucky to be at The Pyramid because each was
hand-picked by the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA keeps 58 referees. Typically, only one or two move on
each year. But this season, Wally Rooney, the NBA's assistant
director of referees, expects more openings because of early
retirements and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   `It's very competitive to be an NBA ref,'' Rooney said. `More
and more people play ball in college, want to stay in basketball
and try officiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney rates officials on judgment, appearance and running
ability. This season, he will try something new by telling the
harsh truth to those who miss too many calls.
</P>
<P>
   `Every year, we kept seeing a lot of the same faces of guys who
didn't have a chance,'' Rooney said. `So now we're going to tell
them to forget dreaming of the NBA, stay with college and move on.
Why continue to dream, dream, dream, when it's not going to
happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Those dreamers were hoping to become the next Joe Crawford, Hugh
Evans or Dick Bavetta, who each make more than $200,000 per season.
First-year referees make $80,000 per year.

   GLOBETROTTERS ON TOP
</P>
<P>
   The Harlem Globetrotters (5-0) look like the only team with a
lock into the league's four-team playoffs. In the six-game regular
season, the Globetrotters are the only undefeated team.
Globetrotter players are saying that winning the summer league is
important because they want to change their image.
</P>
<P>
   `It's important for us because most people think of the
Globetrotters as a show, spinning a ball on our finger and joking
around,'' said Joseph Blair, who played at Arizona and was drafted
in 1996 by the Seattle Supersonics. `We want to show everybody that
we can actually play ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair had 22 points and 17 rebounds in the Globetrotters' 111-84
win over the International Stars. He was asked if the Globetrotters
had an advantage because they have played together this season.
</P>
<P>
   `Actually, we have a red and a blue team, and all the guys here
are split,'' he said. `There's really only one guy here that I've
played with.''
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAYOFF PICTURE
</P>
<P>
   The four playoff spots still are up for grabs with the regular
season to conclude on Friday. Slam (5-1), which features former
Long Beach State star Juaquin Hawkins and Duke standout Ricky
Price, and Hoop Mecca (5-1), which has the Lakers' Shea Seals and
Charlotte Hornets' Anthony Mason, must wait to see the results
other games.
</P>
<P>
   Four other teams are 4-1. If any of those teams lose, it is out.
If the Globetrotters finish undefeated and more than three teams
are tied with 5-1 records, then victory margin will be the
tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   HIGH SCHOOL SHOWCASE
</P>
<P>
   The league announced its rosters for Sunday's fifth annual
Southern California High School All-Star Showcase at 7:30 p.m.,
which follows the league's championship game. The area's top high
players are in the showcase, including Poly's Ricky Anderson who is
headed to Arizona and Manuel Arts' Ricky Duff headed to Long Beach
State.
</P>
<P>
   In previous showcases, UCLA's J.R. Henderson and Jelani McCoy
plus Arizona's Miles Simon have played.

   X X X

<P>
   ALSTON IS BACK
</P>
<P>
   Rafer Alston, a point guard from Fresno St. who was drafted 39th
by the Milwaukee Bucks, surprised coaches and teammates on the
Globetrotters when he did not show up to a game on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He had 11 points and 14 assists on Wednesday and was smiling
after his team's win. About missing Tuesday, he said, `I had to
catch up on some family stuff.''

GREED IS TURNING SPORTS INTO A BURLESQUE OF ABSURDITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the weird events unfolding in my midst, I oftentimes feel
as though I'm an alien somehow stumbling around in a strange
faraway planet.
</P>
<P>
   I keep going into movie houses where I keep witnessing films
with silly plots and silly actors trying to convey some silly
politically correct message that makes me feel silly for paying for
such silliness in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   I keep turning on television where I keep seeing various talking
heads giving various viewpoints on various sex scandals,
fund-raising scandals, media scandals, banking scandals, talk show
scandals, so many scandals that I become scandalized by the sure
volume of them all.
</P>
<P>
   I need to get back to the earth I remember. I need to get back
to the place where a person can have a smoke in a tavern without
getting busted for it.
</P>
<P>
   I need to get back to a simpler time when athletics was the
essence of competition, and when greed didn't turn it into a
monetary burlesque of absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   This celestial sphere of ours has turned upside down, and I'm at
the bottom struggling to emerge from the quicksand muck of the
internet, of the suffocating tax strictures, of the new world order
that has left me kicking and screaming for a return to the bad old
world when as a kid I was actually allowed to ride my bicycle
without a helmet, God forbid!
</P>
<P>
   I know I'm out of sync with the times when I'm on a Fox
television sports talk show with two other members of the media the
other day, and I'm assaulted for saying what a fool Butch Goring is
for turning down that $400,000 a year contract that was offered to
him by the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I was drowned out by the two other panelists, Randy
Youngman, an Orange County newspaper sports columnist, and Joe
McDonnell, a Los Angeles radio sports talk show host, for uttering
such a blasphemous view.
</P>
<P>
   As you might have heard, Goring felt he was being lowballed by
at least $100,000 by the Mighty Ducks, who still are paying off on
the $500,000 a year contract they gave to Pierre Page, a coach they
recently fired.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, I'm for a person making as much money as he can and
receiving fair market value income for his services.
</P>
<P>
   But, sorry, I just can't work up any sympathy for Butch Goring,
who probably earns less than $200,000 a year to coach the Utah
Grizzlies of the International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   I know too many people in these corporate downsizing days who
are unemployed and not enjoying the fruits of a robust economy. I
know too many people holding down two jobs and working 80 hours a
week just to make ends meet. I know too many people who can't
fathom making $400,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Youngman and McDonnell were loud in their praise of Goring for
sticking to his principles.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fine line between sticking to your principles and
committing self-flagellation--and Goring seems to have crossed the
line into doing the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Oh Butchie Boy really showed the Mighty Ducks he's one tough,
principled guy, didn't he! I'm just trying to figure out what all
that display of bravado got him.
</P>
<P>
   He's still stuck in the hockey outback in Utah, while a guy
named Craig Hartsburg gladly accepted approximately the same
three-year, $1.2 million contract that the Mighty Ducks had offered
Goring.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Hartsburg might not have the same storied principles of
Butch Goring, but he definitely has a lot more sense, if now not a
lot more dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Butch Goring is not alone in having a mangled sense
of perspective because of the staggering amounts of money that are
being waved about these days in American athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The classic case of a guy getting blindly caught up in this
insanity and getting burned by it was the one-time second baseman
for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Jody Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Offered a two-year, $6 million contract by the Dodgers after the
1992 season, Reed and his agent stubbornly declined it.
</P>
<P>
   His decision not only turned out to be disastrous for Reed, but
also for the Dodgers, who, rejected by Reed, went after a Montreal
second baseman named Delino DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, to acquire DeShields, Fred Claire, then the Dodger general
manager, had to give up Pedro Martinez, a most unfortunate decision
that wound up having a terrible impact on both the Dodgers and
Claire.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's total income during the next few seasons wouldn't even
add up to $1 million, and this financial genius now is out of
baseball, wondering, I'm sure, what empty thoughts blew through his
mind that year when he so blithely sniffed his nose at a $6 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the planet now rotates on a different axis.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, reportedly offered up to $86 million from the
Dodgers, got into such a terrible salary beef with the team that he
wound up being traded.
</P>
<P>
   The heavyweight champion, Evander Holyfield, scoffs disdainfully
when HBO offers him a minuscule $15 million to settle the
heavyweight title with Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   An untried collegian named J.D. Drew thought it below his
dignity to sign with the Philadelphia Phillies a year ago when they
offered him only $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and on and on, and frankly, I'm nauseated by it
all.
</P>
<P>
   But I guess Butch Goring isn't.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the guy feels he was thrown a crumb by the Mighty
Ducks, and no way was he going to let them exploit him with that
400,000 a year pittance.
</P>
<P>
   Good for him.
</P>
<P>
   And may Butch Goring have a wonderful time next season as he
tours the exotic enclaves around the glamorous IHL, while Craig
Hartsburg endures sweatshop wages working for the Mighty Ducks in
the drab NHL.

 &HT;    Doctor: Sang unlikely to walk again
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ A split second of indecision has changed Sang
Lan's life forever.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old Chinese gymnast remained paralyzed from the
chest down Wednesday after losing control of a warmup vault and
landing on her head the previous night at the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Attending physician Dr. Vincent Leone said it was unlikely she
would walk again from the ``violent injury,'' but was optimistic
she could regain function in her arms. He said it's too early to
predict, but added ``she's young and has good healing potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill officials worked with the U.S. and Chinese governments
to arrange visas and flights for her parents, while gymnastics
officials and former athletes, fearing damage to the sport's image,
emphasized its safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a difficult maneuver. It was a mistake,'' said
Peter Kormann, a 1976 Olympian and U.S. Atlanta Olympic men's
coach, who saw the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Sang, the Chinese vault champion, was injured on a common vault
called a handspring front somersault. It is essentially a handstand
into two flips. Observers thought she may have slipped while
pushing off from the pommel horse and decided to do what's called a
``timer'' vault _ just one flip. But Sang over-rotated, balled up
and tucked her head before crashing into the mat.
</P>
<P>
   Sang suffered a fracture-dislocation of the C-6, C-7 vertabrae
in the lower neck. Doctors said she can flex her elbows and extend
her wrists. She also can feel her shoulders to about the upper
chest.
</P>
<P>
   There was no spotter, who could have averted the accident,
because Sang was so proficient and the vault was so basic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very familiar with this rotation and did it a lot of
times and even she did not know how it happened,'' team leader Zhao
Yuxia said through an interpreter at the most well-attended news
conference of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao said that while Sang lay on the mat, she asked her coach if
she would be a gymnast again.
</P>
<P>
   And, the interpreter related, ``She really wished she could
stand up.''
</P>
<P>
   Leone, an orthopedic spine surgeon at Nassau County Medical
Center, has realigned Sang's spine and will stabilize and fuse the
injured area. He said an experimental drug will be used to repair
nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth such incident in gymnastics since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elena Moukina, a world all-around champion from the Soviet
Union, was paralyzed while training for the floor exercise prior to
the '80 Olympics. She appeared in a wheelchair at the 1994 Goodwill
Games in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   _ American gymnast Julissa Gomez hit her head on the horse in
1988 at a Tokyo meet. Two weeks later, her oxygen was accidentally
cut off and she went into an irreversible coma. She died three
years later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adriana Duffy, a Stanford student competing for Puerto Rico,
was paralyzed in 1989 on a vault similar to Sang's at the World
Championships in Germany. She's also in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Plant, president of the Goodwill Games, said the event has
insurance to provide for Sang's immediate needs.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding her future requirements, he said, ``We're a big
organization and we have resources and we're going to do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sang, the only child of parents who were described by Chinese
officials as ``workers,'' is a quiet junior high school student. In
her official biography, her hobby was listed as watching
television, especially comedies. Sang does not speak English, but
Leone said she understood her situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very frustrated about not being able to move,'' he said.
``She has not cried much.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Sang asked about him. ``I told her I was a gymnast
and I had hurt my back and that's why I decided to become a
doctor.'' Leone related. ``She said, `Then I'll become a doctor.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The accident comes on the heels of criticism that gymnastics
contributes to eating disorders and injuries when coaches push
teenage girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's evidence of abuse in gymnastics,'' said
Olympic gold medalist Bart Conner, who is doing Goodwill commentary
for TBS. ``The fact that she got hurt on a common vault where she
was taking no unnecessary risks, I can only chalk it up as just a
sad, unlucky attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Conner said all gymnasts have been in a precarious situation
like Sang's, but that she may have gotten caught up in the
excitement of the moment. He said, ``You're taught by your coaches
if you're in the middle of a trick, you never bail.''

 &HT;    Loroupe still loves N.Y. as she buries 10,000 field
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ ``Nice place.'' It's a phrase Tegla Loroupe
turns to over and over again. No wonder. Twice, the diminutive
Kenyan has run to victory in the New York Marathon _ including the
first time she went the distance in 1994 _ and Wednesday night
defended her Goodwill Games 10,000-meter in stylish fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Impressively, in 90-degree heat, Loroupe ran the second half of
the race three seconds faster than the first, winning in 32
minutes, 15.44 seconds. She finished half a lap ahead of runner-up
Sally Barsosio and twice lapped 5,000-meter world record-holder Bo
Jiang of China.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the track competition was contested in a makeshift
stadium about 30 miles from the bright lights and hip beat of
Manhattan. It's still New York.
</P>
<P>
   When her introduction brought a standing ovation, top U.S.
finisher Shelly Steely turned to her and cracked: ``Tegla, you have
more American fans here than anybody.'' Loroupe laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have good relations with the people here,'' Loroupe said
later. ``I can say my running in New York has given me a lot of
opportunities to be known worldwide. Because of my (marathons here)
I was able to break the world record.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Loroupe, 26, broke Ingrid Kristiansen's 13-year-old
record in the marathon, covering the Rotterdam course in a time of
2:20:47 _ particularly stunning in that she was 41 seconds off
world-best pace with only seven miles to go.
</P>
<P>
   But her performance wasn't without controversy, as she was paced
through the streets of Rotterdam by two Kenyan men. That's
generally accepted overseas, but in the United States pacing by men
can be grounds for disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rotterdam is a mixed race (men and women), and I always like
to run with the men,'' said Loroupe, six months before diagnosed
with a lower back stress fracture. ``I was able to go with them, so
I took advantage to run with them ...''
</P>
<P>
   And as Kristiansen acknowledged later, ``She still had to run
the race, even if she had rabbits (pacing her).''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kenyan, her record run set off a celebration in the
streets of Nairobi. Photos of Loroupe, petite even by running
standards at 4-foot-11, 82 pounds, surfaced on the front page of
the nation's newspapers. All the while she worried about the safety
of her parents as tribal wars raged nearby the family farm.
</P>
<P>
   While she trained in Germany before the race, her thoughts were
often of her family back in southern Kenya. Her parents, Losiwa and
Mary, are sheep farmers and tribes were stealing animals from
farmers. After Rotterdam, she helped them buy more land some 30
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so worried, and there was nothing I could do,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just win races and break records.

U.S. AND NEW YORK CLASH ON SWISS SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department and New York State Comptroller
H. Carl McCall clashed openly Wednesday at a Senate hearing over
whether New York's threatened sanctions against Switzerland were
the right way to press for reparations to Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking out in the festering, McCall argued that New York had
been forced to take foreign policy into its own hands after a
comprehensive deal to settle a large class action lawsuit against
Swiss banks fell apart in June.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has consistently opposed sanctions by New
York and other states, saying they were complicating its efforts to
handle the issue through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
   McCall accused the State Department of following the same path
of conciliation it took a decade ago when it opposed efforts by
individual states to sanction companies doing business in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen Nelson Mandela sitting in the presidential office,
and I have heard him say that without sanctions _ without visible
and painful, economic pressure from the United States _ he would
not be in that seat,'' McCall told the Senate Banking Committee at
a hearing called by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., to turn up the
heat on Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask the United States government to support our efforts to
obtain restitution for the innocent victims of one of the greatest
horrors the world has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss have been outraged by threats from New York,
California and other states to impose sanctions, and Swiss
President Flavio Cotti wrote to President Clinton this week asking
him to block the state actions. The Clinton administration has
repeatedly urged New York and other states not to impose sanctions
and Wednesday repeated a call for a ``cooling off period.'' The
sanctions, which include threats by New York City and New York
state to cut off business ties slowly with Swiss institutions, are
scheduled to begin Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions threatened by New York state and New York City
have been carefully synchronized, and unfold gradually to put more
pressure on Swiss banks _ and the Swiss government _ to reach a
so-called global settlement with Holocaust survivors and their
heirs. The settlement that was under discussion until talks broke
down last month also included a ``rough justice'' fund for
Holocaust survivors who are now destitute or who lost their assets
at the hands of the Nazis but have little evidence in hand
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   New York City First Deputy Comptroller Steven Newman said
Wednesday that if a settlement was not reached by Sept. 1, his
office would bar putting city funds into overnight investments with
Swiss banks, and will bar Swiss investment firms from underwriting
some of the city's debt transactions. He said that on Nov. 15, the
office will recommend that New York City pension funds exclude
Swiss investment managers and stop trading through Swiss
brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no agreement by July 1, 1999, he said, the office
would ask the city's pension systems, which keep $84 billion
invested around the world, to divest holdings of Swiss stock.
Currently, these funds hold about $735 million in the stock of
Swiss companies, including $136 million in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program of actions is a last resort forced upon us by the
continuing failure of the Swiss government to participate in the
negotiations,'' Newman said. ``We recognize that sanctions are a
drastic measure,'' he said, but talks have dragged on for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The argument arose during hearings that were called to debate,
for the first time, one of most potentially powerful actions the
United States could take against Switzerland: Reopening a
long-ignored 1946 agreement, called the Washington Accord, in which
the Swiss grudgingly agreed to turn over much of the Nazi gold and
other German assets it had amassed.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland never complied with the agreement, and a series of
recent historical studies have conclusively proved that the Swiss
government deliberately deceived negotiators for the Allies about
how much war booty they possessed after Germany's surrender. For
example, the Swiss returned only $58 million in gold after signing
the 1946 accord _ leaving amounts estimated at more than $400
million in Swiss hands. Most of that gold was looted from central
banks around Europe and sold to the Swiss National Bank by Germany,
in return for Swiss francs that were used to buy war materiel.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's prices, the Nazi gold left in Swiss vaults would
be worth more than $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A government-appointed Swiss historical commission concluded in
May that leaders of Switzerland's central bank knew in 1941 that
most of the gold they were buying had been looted by Nazis. But the
central bank has refused to enter negotiations over return the
stolen gold.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the negotiations have involved only Switzerland's
private banks.
</P>
<P>
   It was the central bank, however, that purchased 87 percent of
the looted gold that Germany sold to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   But even discussion about enforcing the 1946 accord is so
politically charged that the Swiss government refused to send
officials to testify at Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department opposes restarting the negotiations for the
same reason it opposes sanctions. Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary
of state for economic affairs, warned D'Amato's committee Wednesday
that reopening the 1946 agreement ``would harden positions further,
probably irrevocably in the current climate,'' in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of sanctions, he said, had already engendered
anti-Americanism in Switzerland, leading one major retailer there,
Denner, to ban four American products: sweet corn, California wine
and two brands of whiskey, Jack Daniels and Four Roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swiss people believe that no matter what they do they get
no credit,'' Eizenstat argued. ``No sovereign country reacts well
when there is a gun pointed at its head; we wouldn't either.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said that it was unlikely that the Swiss government
would agree to a ``global settlement'' of Nazi-era claims any time
soon, however, and that undercut his call for a cooling-off period.
``The historical pattern of denial and deception by the Swiss
continues,'' D'Amato insisted. ``It is time for the Swiss to stop
talking and to face the reality of the historical record that even
their own commission has established.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss government and Swiss banks refused to send
representatives to D'Amato's hearing. A statement issued by the
Swiss Embassy in Washington says that renegotiating the 1946 accord
``is out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Swiss government did not appear, a member of the Swiss
Parliament, Jean Ziegler, used the hearing to take on his own
government. ``Switzerland received much more German assets,
especially stolen gold, than it admitted,'' the Swiss lawmaker
said. ``The Swiss National Bank and the private banks should
restitute without delay and in the quickest possible manner, the
reparation sums which are still due.''

TIME HAS COME FOR JOHNSON TO JUSTIFY THE FUSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Keyshawn Johnson will be the Jets' ``go-to
receiver'' this year, coach Bill Parcells said Wednesday as camp
opened. After Johnson's two good seasons, despite a less-than-ideal
relationship with quarterback Neil O'Donnell, this could be the
kind of breakout season the Jets had in mind for Johnson when they
made him the league's top draft pick in 1996. And Johnson is
getting along with Glenn Foley, who will be throwing the football
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a conversation piece,'' Johnson said of Foley. ``We can
talk to him and let him know how our feelings are and what we think
and what we see. He listens.''
</P>
<P>
   Did that mean he did not communicate well with O'Donnell, whom
the Jets cut last month?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that Neil didn't listen,'' Johnson said. ``I
just didn't talk to him as much as I can talk to Glenn. We just
didn't have conversations. Me and Glenn have conversations off the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, O'Donnell, now a Cincinnati Bengal, was not a
chatterbox. And his apparent reluctance to have a dialogue with
Johnson presumably was affected by the fact that Johnson described
him as ``a stiff puppet'' in his book about his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, meanwhile, says that he would be foolish not to make
Johnson part of the action. ``He's a big-play guy,'' said the new
No. 1 quarterback. ``I'm going to get him the ball every chance I
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has 127 catches in two seasons, good for 1,748 yards and
13 touchdowns. Those statistics compare favorably to those of his
idol, Jerry Rice, who snared 135 passes, 18 for touchdowns, in his
first two years with San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has told Johnson in several recent private meetings
that he expects him to improve all aspects of his game, and that he
wants him to be the player the quarterback seeks out. Asked about
Foley's importance to the team, Parcells was quick to mention the
newly arrived running back Curtis Martin as well as Johnson. ``It's
not just about Glenn Foley,'' Parcells said. ``But if we can use
Curtis, if Keyshawn can be a real go-to guy like we know he can ...
''
</P>
<P>
   So, will Johnson be the man?
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to be it,'' said Parcells, who has named Wayne
Chrebet as the full-time starter at the other receiving spot.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is expanding the passing game, and not just with the
wide receivers. Martin, an outstanding runner with the Patriots, is
much more of a receiving threat than was the departed Adrian
Murrell. And Parcells now has fullback Keith Byars, one of the best
players in recent years in catching passes out of the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   The title of go-to guy was one that Johnson gave himself from
the moment the Jets made him a pro. ``I'm the same guy I was in my
rookie year,'' he said. ``It's just that I've got Parcells on my
side now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is also listening. Parcells wanted him somewhat lighter
than last year, so Johnson, 6 feet 3 inches, came in at 210 pounds,
seven pounds fewer than in 1997. Parcells has never complained
about Johnson's willingness to block, but demanded better workout
habits. ``I can be whatever he wants me to be,'' Johnson said of
his coach. ``He knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   BILL PARCELLS has put pressure on the second-year place-kicker
JOHN HALL to improve on his field-goal percentage of just over 68
percent. ``I've talked to my scouts'' about bringing in another
kicker, Parcells said. ``He's a tremendous kickoff guy, but 68.5
accuracy is not a winning performance in the NFL'' ... KYLE BRADY,
the club's top draft pick of 1995, is no longer the automatic
first-string tight end. Parcells is placing him in open competition
with FRED BAXTER ... NEIL O'DONNELL still has not returned the
$3.75 million advance on his 1998 salary. Since the Jets cut him
last month, he has earned more than $12,000 in money-market
interest. Parcells said if the money does not arrive soon that
``we'll take action.'' ... The Jets have placed defensive lineman
TERRY DAY on the non-football injury list. He hurt a knee playing
basketball. The team cut offensive lineman JAY HAGOOD, who played
in two games as a rookie last year.

DESPITE RISKS, U.S. WANTS CAMBODIANS TO VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite warnings that elections in Cambodia this
weekend will be marred by violence and anything but free and fair,
the Clinton administration says it wants to see the balloting in
that battered Southeast Asian nation carried out on time.
</P>
<P>
   The hope within the administration, which is spending $2.3
million to underwrite private groups that will monitor the
election, is that Cambodians will rise above the intimidation and
violence that have marked the election campaign and vote their
conscience on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For months the State Department has been pressed by human-rights
groups and international election monitors who say that the United
States and other foreign governments should demand a postponement
of the election, given the climate of fear that now exists among
the Cambodian government's political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration rejected the advice. If the
election has even a semblance of fairness, American officials say,
it should result in a coalition government in which Prime Minister
Hun Sen, who took sole power in a coup last year in which dozens of
his political opponents were killed, will be forced to share
authority with Cambodian leaders who enjoy far wider public
support.
</P>
<P>
   That is roughly what happened in 1993, when Cambodia held
national elections that were the culmination of a $2 billion United
Nations peacekeeping operation intended to help Cambodia rebuild
after two decades during which the nation was shattered by civil
war, the genocidal rule of the Khmer Rouge and foreign occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States played a major role during those years as the
patron of one side in the Cambodian conflict during the Vietnam War
of the early 1970s, and as a leading force behind the decade-long
isolation of Cambodia when it was occupied by Vietnam in the 1980s.
The United States was also one of the five governments that
negotiated the 1991 Cambodia peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be a perfect election, not at all,'' said
a senior administration official who is involved in Cambodian
policy. ``But we need to give Cambodian voters the chance. If Hun
Sen tries to steal the election, then we can blow the whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration arrived at a policy _ to support the election
schedule, but to make no predictions about the fairness of the
ballot and to be ready to declare it a sham _ after an extended
debate between the United States and its European allies over the
ability of the Cambodian government to carry out a fair election.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, led by the French, the former colonial power in
Cambodia, have been far more optimistic in their public statements
about the prospects for free elections.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the United States, the European Union has donated
millions of dollars directly to the government in Phnom Penh to
help pay for the balloting. The United States is providing money
solely to non-government groups and to a special United Nations
team.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent human-rights groups say that the aid money is in
danger of being wasted, and that there is every reason to believe
that the election will be a sham unless postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present political environment in Cambodia, in which
opposition parties are not able to operate freely and safely, is in
no way conducive to the holding of free, fair and credible
elections,'' Human Rights Watch Asia said in a report last month.
``There is no chance that a deeply flawed and rushed electoral
process will help Cambodian establish democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Two private groups that are being paid $700,000 by the United
States government to monitor the elections, the National Democratic
Institute and International Republican Institute, said in a
statement last week that preparations for the election were
``fundamentally flawed'' and that ``systematic and widespread
political intimidation and violence have affected the ability of
opposition parties to fairly compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the groups said that opposition politicians were
``actively participating'' in the campaign and that, despite
efforts by the government to intimidate voters, ``the outcome of
the election is not a forgone conclusion.''

CHINA'S ARMY ORDERED TO GIVE UP VAST COMMERCIAL EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ President Jiang Zemin has ordered China's
military to relinquish its sprawling, multi-billion dollar
commercial empire, saying it is the only way to combat an epidemic
of smuggling, which the army dominates.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, appearing somber in a pea-green Mao suit as he addressed
an extraordinary meeting of top military commanders on Tuesday,
called on the armed forces to regain their ``purity'' in order to
regain public confidence and to safeguard the nation's long-term
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Yet business, and smuggling, are so entrenched in the army that
truly separating it from its commerce could take years.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, coming so unexpectedly, offered scant clues
about whether Jiang has the political will or the support from
military leaders to genuinely carry out such an ambitious
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkable, perhaps, was his indirect admission of the
degree of lawlessness that exists in the army, which has been
off-limits for criticism. Never before in 49 years of Communist
Party rule has the military been so publicly questioned, suggesting
that Jiang may be serious about deep-seated change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army and armed police forces must earnestly carry out
checks on all kinds of commercial companies set up by subsidiary
units, and without exception from today must not engage in their
operation,'' Jiang said in his speech, reported by China Central
Television on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadcast, dozens of military leaders were shown
earnestly taking notes. As chairman of the Communist Party's
Central Military Commission, Jiang is China's commander in chief.
Yet the army wields wide power, and it is unlikely that Jiang would
make such a bold pronouncement without the support of top generals.
</P>
<P>
   All of the army's senior leaders attended the anti-smuggling
conference at which Jiang spoke. Seated beside him were Gen. Zhang
Wannian and Gen. Chi Haotian, who are vice chairmen of the Central
Military Commission. Generals Fu Quanyou, Yu Yongbo, Wang Ke and
Wang Ruilin also appeared in the China Central Television
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the world's military forces, China's is by far the most
entrepreneurial. The vast array of businesses it owns or partly
controls ranges from commercial airlines to pharmaceutical
companies and from vegetable growers to arms dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Army-related businesses earn billions of dollars each year,
though they are so numerous and disparate that virtually no one
inside or outside China can accurately estimate their full scope.
</P>
<P>
   Although China's military often appears to outsiders like a
stern-faced monolith, its role in money-making resembles a
hodgepodge of disparate ventures, essentially built by military
officers taking advantage of their authority in China's political
apparatus to build lucrative operations.
</P>
<P>
   The army's role in smuggling appears to have grown in tandem
with the nation's stunning economic growth over the last 20 years.
Although the true volume of goods smuggled into China cannot be
measured, officials conservatively estimate that it has reached
tens of billions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   More than $10 billion in tax revenue is lost to smuggling each
year, the New China News Agency reported. Chinese Customs,
alternatively seen as corrupt and unable to stand up to military
smugglers, confiscated just $330 million of smuggled goods in the
first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The main contraband is not drugs or illegal arms, but rather
high-end goods that face such onerous import duties that customers
are willing to pay handsomely for an army transport that escapes
scrutiny at a border.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, echoing comments he made last week at a launching of a
broad anti-smuggling campaign, said that all party and government
offices and law enforcement agencies would also be required to cut
ties with companies they own. That will be a gargantuan task.
</P>
<P>
   When any national campaign begins, there may be several
political elements at work. Yet decision-making in China remains so
opaque that it is difficult to know if the driving force behind the
anti-smuggling campaign is Jiang's desire to flex his muscles over
the military, or to buttress his reputation as a
corruption-fighter.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be financial concerns. Prime Minister Zhu Rongji
has argued that the drastic drop in tax collection must be reversed
at a time when the government is undertaking a huge spending
program to spur economic growth. &QL;

HAPPY AIKMAN LOOKS FORWARD TO TURNING COWBOYS AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
WICHITA FALLS _ Troy Aikman's face, tanned and lean, is slowly but
surely becoming a road map of his life.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That line there, that's for his mom's cancer. Just had her
one-year checkup, and she's doing great now, thanks for asking.
</P>
<P>
   This one that's just discernible across his forehead _ you'll
have to look close to see it _ that's for his brand new home, which
almost burned to the ground in March, just a month after he moved
into it. No, he won't be moving back in for another year yet.
</P>
<P>
   That one over there he earned all on his own. Remember the
cancerous mole that was removed from his back this off-season?
</P>
<P>
   And the crow's feet at his eyes, the little lines that crinkle
when he smiles _ he's doing that a lot these days, by the way _
well, blame last year's 6-10 record and You Know Who. No need to
mention any names. Time to let bygones be bygones.
</P>
<P>
   Was it only eight years ago that Aikman came striding into our
lives, a golden haired, rocket-armed savior from UCLA out of
Oklahoma? Three Super Bowls and a lifetime later, he remains the
Cowboys' single biggest hope if they are to rise from the ashes of
last season's 6-10 record, when the entire franchise crashed and
burned.
</P>
<P>
   Two resurrections in one NFL lifetime? The Cowboys are counting
on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, that is life,'' Aikman says. ``Everyone
has hurdles and obstacles they have to overcome, and that's part of
living and part of growing up. It's how you deal with it and how
you handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like my life is very blessed. A lot of times when
there have been negatives in my life, something positive has come
from it right around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is one of those people who seems to thrive on the rigors
of camp. The omnipresent heat, the discipline that's required, the
repetition, beat some players down. Not Aikman. He eats this up,
like the soft-serve frozen yogurt he is spooning from a cup as we
talk in the Midwestern University lunchroom.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of wilting, Aikman blossoms in this environment. His
classic quarterback's body is as taut and as tough as rawhide.
Despite the drain of two-a-days and practicing in the heat, there's
a spring in his step. And in his sky-blue eyes a spark _ that
unquenchable will to win _ still blazes as hot and fiery as the
first day he pulled on a Cowboys uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a realist,'' Aikman says. ``I tend to
believe that I'm generally realistic about life. But when I'm
ultimately backed up into a corner and things look their worst,
that's usually when I'm very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider him, then, very optimistic about this football team.
</P>
<P>
   The window of opportunity for an Aikman-led Cowboys team to win
another Super Bowl began inexorably inching downward from the
moment it won in Pasadena in 1992 and Aikman understands that. But
closed and latched tight? Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The window of opportunity is closing with the guys we're
accustomed to playing with and to seeing,'' Aikman concedes. ``In
fact, some of those guys we used to talk about are no longer here.
Tony Tolbert, Charles Haley, Jay Novaceck, Mark Tuinei, those guys
are gone. So sure, that window is getting smaller for guys who have
been here awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what that means is that we've got to rely on younger
players now. You look at the 49ers and the success that they've
had, and they continue to do it with a different cast of guys.
That's what we have to learn to do. That's what every organization
is striving for.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the starting over that gnaws at Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most disappointing thing about our situation is that we
allowed it to get to 6-10,'' he says. ``I don't think that should
have ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who were here for 1-15 \Rin 1989\S know how much
work went into getting us back on track, and then to sit and watch
this organization go where it went these last two years was
completely unnecessary, and that's what hurts most of all.''
</P>
<P>
   That hurt, though, is receding. What remains, Aikman believes,
is opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's harder to put the bad things that happen behind
us, but it's over,'' he says. ``Nobody cares about last year now or
that we went 6-10. Now it's what happens from this point forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope last year was just an aberration. That's why I've said
this year is such a pivotal year, just in determining where we're
at from a talent standpoint. The competitiveness we each have
inside makes us say, `We're better than that,' and I think we are.
I truly believe it. But we're going to find out this year how much
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we as good as we like to think we are, or are we entering
a period where we've got some questions? I tend to think that we're
still an awfully good football team, maybe not the most talented
team in the league, but I think if we play as a team and the way
we're capable of playing, then we can win every game we play. We
won't do that, but we could.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Aikman's belief that owner Jerry Jones, accidentally or
otherwise, uncovered a rare gem when he hired Chan Gailey as the
team's new head coach, but Troy is careful not to gush about him,
knowing there are those who might take his approval the wrong way,
considering his problems with Gailey's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan is good person, and he has a great football mind,''
Aikman says. ``I don't know how to quantify it or how big or how
small a difference he'll make. He has provided some real leadership
for this football team, provided some direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't take this wrong, but Gailey is actually promoting (gasp!)
some team discipline. Penalties in practice equal laps around the
field, even for veterans such as Daryl Johnston and Nate Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, discipline has all of a sudden taken on
this negative context,'' Aikman says, frowning. ``I'm not sure why
that is. I've always believed that discipline in one's life is
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard Chan necessarily address discipline as much as
he's addressed doing things the right way: `Here's what we expect,
and here's what I'm asking you to do.' It's a matter of everyone
being accountable, everyone being able to believe in the guy next
to him. That's what it comes down to.''
</P>
<P>
   It is amusing to Aikman that so many fans _ and media, too _
worry about whether he is happy. He really shouldn't be surprised.
As the Cowboys' quarterback and their most visible player, he is a
weather vane for the fans, who tend to gauge the Cowboys'
temperature _ hot, cold or indifferent _ by what they see on
Aikman's face.
</P>
<P>
   It is no exaggeration to say that when he's smiling, most of
Fort Worth-Dallas smiles along. That there haven't been many smiles
the past few years doesn't mean, however, that Aikman is an unhappy
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the public perception, the fans' view of my level of
happiness, isn't always accurate, not when we're struggling like we
were last year,'' Aikman says. ``But I can't just blow that off. I
can't just overlook the fact that we're not playing as well as
we're capable of playing. That's very frustrating, and I know it
shows sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But off the field, I'm very happy with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust me, it's written all over his face. (Jim Reeves is a

SHEPARD, FIRST AMERICAN IN SPACE, DIES AT AGE 74 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan B. Shepard Jr., the Mercury astronaut whose pioneering
flight into space ignited America's push to the moon, died Tuesday.
He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, who later became the fifth of only 12 men to walk on
the moon _ hitting a golf ball on the lunar surface to the delight
of Earth-bound duffers _ died at 10:30 p.m., CDT, at Community
Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey, Calif. His death
followed a lengthy illness, a spokeswoman for the facility said.
Shepard was diagnosed with leukemia 1 1/2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who are old enough to remember the first space
flights will always remember what an impression he made on us and
the world,'' said President Clinton, who led a long list of public
mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's 1961 flight aboard the cramped Freedom 7 capsule,
launched atop a Redstone rocket, was the first manned U.S. space
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``His flight was a tremendous statement about tenacity, courage
and brilliance,'' said NASA administrator Dan Goldin. ``He crawled
on top of that rocket that had never before flown into space with a
person aboard and he did it. That was an unbelievable act of
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Services for Shepard, who in recent years made his home in
Pebble Beach, Calif., were pending.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Louise; three daughters, Julie,
Laura and Alice; and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's suborbital hop on May 5, 1961, from Cape Canaveral,
Fla., lasted just 16 minutes, soared no higher than 116 miles and
no further than 302 miles into the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But it was enough to convince then-President John Kennedy 20
days later to commit the United States to reaching the moon with
human explorers within the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard became a central figure in the unfolding drama of that
Cold War space race between the United States and the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   It was in April 1959, with much fanfare, that Shepard was
selected as one of seven military test pilots for NASA's Mercury
program, a series of rocket missions intended to demonstrate that
humans not only could survive in space but perform piloting tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union had successfully launched Sputnik, the first
man-made satellite, on Oct. 4, 1957. The demonstration shook the
United States because it demonstrated long range missile capability
to go with the Soviet's new nuclear prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Within the year, President Eisenhower and Congress responded
with the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the Soviets scored first again.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, 1961, a young cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, became the
first human in space, making a single orbit of the Earth, 23 days
before Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Shepard might have beaten the Russians into space
had the Redstone rocket not required an electrical modification
before Shepard took the first flight, said Max Faget, the former
NASA engineer who guided the development of the Mercury capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make another (test) flight which held up (Shepard's)
flight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there was no mistaking the significance of
Shepard's shorter flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was based on that success of his flight that President
Kennedy decided to go to the moon, which was an astounding thing,''
recalled Faget. ``The president said we would go in the decade,
which was really only 8 1/2 years. We had a tough job.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Shepard campaigned for an opportunity to fly on another Mercury
mission, an orbital flight launched aboard the more powerful Atlas
rocket. But NASA grew eager to move ahead with its two-man Gemini
program.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was discovered that Shepard had an inner ear problem,
called Meuniere's syndrome, and he was taken off flight status.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was appointed chief of NASA's astronaut corps, an
administrative job. Biding his time, he sought corrective surgery
that won him a return to flight status in time for an Apollo moon
assignment. He was selected to command Apollo 14 and was launched
on his second trip into space Jan. 31, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The mission followed the dramatic recovery of Apollo 13, whose
astronauts limped safely back to Earth after an explosion aboard
their outbound spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard and Edgar Mitchell became the third crew to successfully
land on the moon and the fifth and sixth men to explore its surface
as they walked the hilly Fra Mauro region and collected 92 pounds
of rock samples. Before he returned, Shepard, an avid golfer,
fashioned a club and lofted a golf ball across the lunar landscape.
</P>
<P>
   After the mission Shepard resumed duties as chief astronaut, a
post he held until he retired from the space agency Aug. 1, 1974.
He retired from the Navy as well, having attained the rank of rear
admiral. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Shepard was born in East Derry, N. H., on Nov. 18, 1923. He
graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1944 and received flight
training in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Following graduation from the Navy's test pilot school, Shepard
helped evaluate a range of jet aircraft, for high altitude,
refueling and aircraft carrier landings.
</P>
<P>
   Among his many honors was the Medal of Honor for spaceflight.
</P>
<P>
   With his retirement from NASA, Shepard pursued a business career
in Houston. He became chairman of the Marathon Construction Corp.
and obtained a Coors beer distributorship in Deer Park, an
industrial city of 30,000 about 10 miles east of downtown Houston,
among other interests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he joined with his fellow Mercury astronauts to found
what is now called the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation of
Titusville, Fla., which raises funds and awards scholarships to
college students pursuing careers in science and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard moved his permanent residence from Houston to Pebble
Beach, Calif., about five years ago to devote more time to his
favorite recreation _ golf. Seven Fourteen Enterprises, the company
he founded to consolidate his business interests, remained in
Houston at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Among his Mercury colleagues, Shepard is survived by John Glenn,
a U.S. Senator who is training to participate in an October space
shuttle flight; M. Scott Carpenter; Gordon Cooper and Walter
``Wally'' Schirra.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil ``Gus'' Grisson died Jan. 27, 1967, in the Apollo 1 fire
at Cape Canaveral, Fla. Donald ``Deke'' Slayton died June 13, 1993,
at his Houston-area home of brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozen men who walked on the moon, 10 survive.

WOMEN'S GROUP PICKETS CONGRESS TO URGE DEFEAT OF ANTI-GAY BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Organization for Women picketed
Congress Wednesday to urge the defeat of two anti-gay legislative
proposals that the NOW president criticized as political gimmicks
designed to energize conservative Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   The protest rally came as the House prepared to vote on the
proposals that NOW President Patricia Ireland said would
politically damage Republicans by making them look ``very mean and
hateful.''
</P>
<P>
   One proposal sponsored by Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., would
prohibit the city of San Francisco from using federal housing funds
if the city continues to require its private contractors to provide
the same benefits to unmarried domestic partners as they provide
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal by Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., would nullify an
executive order by President Clinton that barred federal agencies
from discriminating against gays.
</P>
<P>
   To expose what she called ``a back-door attempt to slip''
anti-gay legislation though Congress, Ireland joined about 50
picketers marching in scorching heat outside a House office
building Wednesday, shouting slogans such as ``Hey, hey, ho, ho,
homophobia's got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Some picketers carried placards with such slogans as, ``I feel
fine, I don't need to be cured,'' a response to recent newspaper
advertisements sponsored by conservative groups that maintain
religion can change the sexual orientation of gays.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ireland said the Riggs and Hefley proposals
were attempts to mobilize right-wing Christians to vote in the
November elections in a year in which experts predict a lackluster
voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clearly an election-year wedge issue,'' Ireland
said, adding ``To punish cities that are forward-looking like San
Francisco is just outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why NOW was fighting for gay rights, Ireland said the
group is ``working for all women's equality _ it includes lesbian,
bisexual and transgender people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that all oppression is wrong,'' Ireland said. ``As
feminists we do often raise issues that people consider radical.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland added: ``Every woman who steps forward to claim her
rights faces the allegation that she is queer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland said 150 years ago, women who attended the women's
rights convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y., were called ``mannish,
unnatural, and spinsters.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Peter LaBarbera, president of Americans for
Truth, a conservative group that joined with 14 others to pay for
the anti-gay advertisements in major newspapers last week, said NOW
``is out of touch with American women,'' and ``obsessed with
lesbianism.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBarbera said anti-discrimination protections in civil rights
law should not be applied to homosexual behavior ``that, unlike
skin color, can be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration urged Congress to include
sexual orientation under the federal hate crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, the acting assistant attorney general for civil
rights, told the House Judiciary Committee that President Clinton
strongly supports changing the law so that the FBI can assist state
and local governments in investigating hate crimes based on sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the FBI is empowered to step in to help
investigate certain hate crimes based on race, color, religion or
national origin. But Lee said the law is deficient because it does
not cover violent hate crimes stemming from bias based on the
victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also heard testimony from Mark Bangerter of Boise,
Idaho, who said he was attacked in April and lost the sight in his
left eye after an assailant beat him, mistakenly believing he was
gay.
</P>
<P>
   Bangerter, an artist, said he had hugged a male friend goodbye
after meeting over drinks in a Boise bar, when a stranger called
him a ``faggot,'' punched him in the head, then pursued him outside
and continued to beat him, breaking bones around his eye sockets.
</P>
<P>
   Bangerter said the assailant was never caught, the Boise police
have said they have little time to investigate, and the FBI has
said it can not intervene because sexual orientation is not
included in a list of federal hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone hated gay people enough to try to kill me,'' Bangerter
said. ``The irony is that I am not gay. This happened to me because
I hugged a friend. Now I know what can and does happen to people
who are gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Traditional Values Coalition _ which claims to
represent 36,000 churches _ issued a statement calling the
administration's effort to expand the definition of a hate crime as
``nothing less than a premeditated assault on religious Americans
who oppose homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the coalition, said
pending legislation to expand the definition was ``like a bad
B-movie in which all of the enlightened folks from the Northeast
are going to set straight all those `Bible-toting zealots' from the
rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In her statement, Sheldon said Christians ``no more hate
homosexuals than they do alcoholics or chronic gamblers. We believe
the moral choices made by homosexuals are wrong and we encourage
them to change.''

 UNDATED: made history. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision by Kennedy, which contrasted with the Soviet
policy of secrecy, the launch was broadcast live on radio and
television. The capsule separated smoothly from the rocket.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes into the mission, Shepard took over manual control
from the autopilot, putting the craft through some prescribed
maneuvers. For five minutes, at maximum altitude and traveling more
than 5,000 mph, the astronaut experienced the weightlessness of
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, what a ride!'' he said later. Yet, he said, the trip was
``pleasant and relaxing,'' with no effect on his movements and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was almost flawless, and so was the splashdown in the
Atlantic. ``On the way to the carrier I felt relieved and happy,''
the astronaut said later. ``I knew I had done a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he used the expression A-OK is problematic. Years
later, a reporter asked Shepard if he had indeed said A-OK, and
where did the term come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Shorty Powers,'' he said enigmatically, referring to Col.
John ``Shorty'' Powers, who was press officer to the first
astronauts. It was Powers who had passed on the quote to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Everything did seem to come up A-OK. Three days later, Shepard
and his wife, the former Louise Brewer, were entertained by the
Kennedys at the White House, then whisked to New York for a
ticker-tape parade in the old Lindbergh tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, space, military and budget officials were
meeting to draw up recommendations for taking bold new steps to
catch up with and surpass Soviet space achievements. A memorandum,
handed to Kennedy the day of Shepard's White House visit,
concluded, ``Of all the programs planned, perhaps the greatest
unsurpassed prestige will accrue to the nation which first sends a
man to the moon and returns him safely to Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 25, Kennedy told Congress, ``This nation should commit
itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing
a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth. No single
space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or
more important for the long-range exploration of space. And none
will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Logsdon of George Washington University said it was doubtful
that Kennedy would have issued such a challenge, if the Shepard
flight had failed.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner celebrating the 30th anniversary of the flight,
Glenn said: ``Al's flight and my flight _ it was almost like we
turned a corner. There was a feeling we were coming back. There was
a great outpouring of public spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard called it ``just the first baby step, aiming for bigger
and better things.'' His words would be echoed eight years later by
Neil Armstrong as he stepped on the Moon with the declaration,
``One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard almost did not make it to the Moon himself. Before he
could train for a second space flight in the Gemini Project, he
developed inner-ear problems. Thomas Stafford, a retired astronaut,
recalled Wednesday that he and Shepard had been chosen for the
first Gemini mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge blow in his life,'' Stafford said of the medical
problems that grounded Shepard. ``He was anxious to get back into
space, to ride again.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for nearly a decade, Shepard was firmly rooted to NASA
managerial jobs, mainly directing the astronaut corps. Stafford
recalled him as a natural leader, who operated ``with more stick
than carrot and would lay down the law, saying here's how it's
going to be, guys.''
</P>
<P>
   After surgery to correct the ear problem in 1968, Shepard was
cleared to fly again and was assigned to what turned out to be the
third lunar landing. Although his first flight had been only 15
minutes, the Apollo 14 journey to the Moon added 216 hours to his
log book and rounded out an astronaut career that also included a
Congressional Space Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, he still had time for work promoting the
space program and had joined the other surviving Mercury
astronauts, and Betty Grissom, the widow of Gus Grissom, in
founding the Mercury Seven Foundation, based in Titusville, Fla.,
near Cape Canaveral. The foundation raises money for scholarships
for science and engineering students in college. He was its
president and chairman until last October.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife of 53 years, survivors include two daughters,
Laura Snyder and Juliana Coleman Jenkins, and six grandchildren.
Funeral arrangements are pending. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ As you watch the gorgeous new production of ``Twelfth
Night'' at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, you may find your emotions
tested in ways never intended by Shakespeare, Nicholas Hytner (the
man who directed it) or Lincoln Center Theater (which staged the
play as its own contribution to the theatrical portion of Lincoln
Center Festival '98).
</P>
<P>
   The Hytner production charms, maddens, surprises and
disappoints. You have to keep adjusting to it as if it were the
signal of a riveting but wandering FM broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelfth Night'' is scheduled to run through Aug. 30, while the
festival ends Sunday afternoon with the final performances of two
other theatrical productions: ``F(AT)ust: Version 3.0,'' presented
by the Barcelona company La Fura dels Baus, at the New York State
Theater, and ``The Street of Crocodiles,'' a production of the
Theatre de Complicite, at the John Jay College Theater. Complicite
is the British company that was represented at the 1996 festival by
its epic staging of ``The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol.''
</P>
<P>
   Already come and gone: ``Village'' and ``Adam Resurrected,''
presented by the Gesher Theater of Israel, founded in 1991 by a
group of Russian emigres headed by Yevgeny Arye, the artistic
director. At first, they performed only in Russian, but now present
each production alternately in Russian and Hebrew with the same
actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``F(AT)ust'' opened too late for inclusion in this consideration
of the festival's theatrical entries, but it is clear that this
year's installment has provided a stunning, if accidental (and far
from comprehensive) overview of the differences between theater in
this country and abroad. It is not a question of money _ mostly
private here, often subsidized abroad _ or of technical facilities,
but of the nature of the audiences for whom these theaters present
their works.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen the offerings in this year's festival might
well suspect that America is a theatrical disaster area, not
because the festival entries from abroad were so uniformly fine
(they weren't), but because they showed us how narrow and limited
are our expectations of theater. When audiences aren't open and
adventurous, you can hardly expect producers, writers, directors
and actors to be.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences get what they want; another way of saying they get
what they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel they flock to the Gesher, which is offering some
startling alternatives to the more conventional works by other
local troupes. La Fura dels Baus, whose latest production is
described as ``Faust in Cyberspace,'' promises to be alternative
theater with a vengeance. Since its founding in 1983, Theatre de
Complicite has put on more than 25 productions and played in more
than 180 cities in 41 countries on 4 continents.
</P>
<P>
   The company doesn't deal in pap. Yet its productions of the
Ionesco classic ``The Chairs,'' co-produced with the Royal Court
Theater, and ``The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol'' were popular as
well as critical successes in London. The New York critics adored
``The Chairs,'' but the public was somewhat less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, filmmaker to the world, we are in the merciless
siege of entertainment _ movie, television and even Web. Yet we
have no resident theatrical troupes of national repute. Our
audiences seem to have grown lazy _ undemanding _ on a diet of junk
food.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways ``Twelfth Night'' is a typical Lincoln Center
Theater production. It has been done with care. Hytner has a
reputation as a heavy-hitting director in both commercial and
subsidized theaters. Among his credits: the Lincoln Center Theater
revival of ``Carousel'' (a near-duplicate of the earlier version he
staged in London), Alan Bennett's ``Madness of George III'' (both
on stage and on film) and ``Miss Saigon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelfth Night'' is a delight if you don't demand perfection.
That is, if you can be as charmed by the earnest intentions of
so-called name actors, who are not quite ready for their star
roles, as by the seriously substantial performances in smaller
roles, performed by character actors who are at ease with what they
are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Hytner's staging of the play beguiles the eye and the ear, much
in the manner of the uncontrolled substance apparently being smoked
by the bored, lovesick Duke Orsino and his attendants in the first
scene. The setting is an Illyria that, as designed by Bob Crowley,
has the serene, watery beauty of an idealized Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the time of day, whatever the weather, life in Illyria
is one long, lazy afternoon, scored by exotic music (by Jeanine
Tesori) that plays on even when the musicians have left
centerstage. Affairs of the heart, not disputed borders, are the
concern in this enchanted land.
</P>
<P>
   Orsino is obsessed by his desire for Olivia, a beautiful
countess who will have none of him. Instead, she falls in love with
Cesario, the duke's comely young emissary, who is actually the
shipwrecked Viola disguised as a man and who herself is in love
with Orsino.
</P>
<P>
   He, meanwhile, is beginning to feel increasingly warm feelings
for the beardless Cesario, though convinced he is still pining for
Olivia. You don't have to worry, of course. Sebastian, Viola's twin
brother presumed lost in the same wreck that stranded her, is also
wandering around Illyria. He is the means by which Shakespeare
straightens out the confusions resulting from cross-dressing and
mistaken identities.
</P>
<P>
   Looking on, seeing absolutely nothing except his own heady
future, is Malvolio, Olivia's pompous steward, one of the most
deliriously funny creations in all of Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Malvolio is a great character but not a major one, being the
focal point of the play's subplot involving Sir Toby Belch,
Olivia's uncle; Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Sir Toby's faint-hearted
drinking companion, and Maria, Olivia's bossy maid. Yet because of
the splendid, richly comic performances by Philip Bosco (Malvolio),
Brian Murray (Sir Toby) and Max Wright (Sir Andrew), this ``Twelfth
Night'' is turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate practical joke by which Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and
Maria convince Malvolio that Olivia loves him madly becomes the
activating center of the play. The production's high point: the
so-called ``letter scene'' in which Malvolio takes their bait as
the three conspirators spy on him, scarcely able to contain their
nearly apoplectic pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   In a properly balanced ``Twelfth Night,'' Malvolio's cruel
humiliation merely supplements the succession of darkly romantic
minuets being so persistently danced at cross-purposes by Viola
(Helen Hunt), Olivia (Kyra Sedgwick) and Orsino (Paul Rudd). Here,
the raucous, knockabout comedy is the entire show.
</P>
<P>
   The three younger actors haven't the vocal technique, the stage
presence or the innate personas that would give character to some
of the loveliest, wittiest romantic language in the canon.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, who was in Hytner's most recent film, ``The Object of My
Affection,'' is a well-muscled Orsino when stripped to his thong
for swimming in an Illyrian pool. Yet he has a tendency to bark his
lines like someone of smallish stature who is always on the
defensive, trying desperately to convince the bigger guys that he
is as tough as they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sedgwick is a beautiful, shimmering actress with an
attractively husky voice and the hint of a real stage talent.
Unfortunately, her scenes with Ms. Hunt seem to run out of interest
and wind long before the language stops flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunt is an immensely appealing actress on the screen (where
she won an Oscar this year for ``As Good as It Gets'') and on
television (two Emmys for her work in the sitcom ``Mad About
You''). She has fine, chiseled features of classical purity. Even
more important, she possesses a forthright, humorous intelligence,
though it doesn't yet register on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One day she might be an ideal Viola, but will she ever get the
necessary experience? Would she even want to? She is working very
hard in ``Twelfth Night'' but, as you watch her, you might think
she was trying to run under water: every movement is painfully
deliberate, carefully executed, without a moment's spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Lincoln Center made two attempts to start a repertory
company. Both failed. Some people blamed the critics for being too
harsh too soon, for not giving the nascent companies time to find
their identities. Possibly. But in the way that audiences get the
theater they deserve, repertory companies are responsible for the
reviews they receive. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I missed seeing the Gesher Theater when it brought ``Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern Are Dead'' to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in
1992, the year after its founding in Israel by Mr. Arye. The New
York Times review called that production ``refreshing'' and
``swift-paced'' and credited Arye with finding ``new relevance'' in
the play itself. Since then, the company has taken in non-Russian
Israeli actors, adopted its bilingual Russian-Hebrew performing
policy and, it is now astonishingly evident, become a troupe of
ensemble performers of singular talents and dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Peter Brook's International Center of Theater Research
in Paris and the Theatre de Complicite, which is based in London.
The Gesher can stand with them on the basis of the two productions
presented here. In a little more than eight years, the company has
developed the team work usually found in much older companies,
while it still takes the kinds of risks favored by the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Village,'' by Joshua Sobol, is a big, somewhat overstuffed
Israeli ``Our Town,'' which follows the fortunes of 20 characters,
including a turkey and a goat that talk, from the years before the
state's foundation in 1948 until the war that followed. Some of the
play's conceits are not of the first freshness, but they were
performed with such disarming humor, intelligence and conviction
that the audience was held for its nearly three-hour running time.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe's star, at least on this tour: a skinny, intense,
subversively powerful young actor named Israel (Sasha) Demidov, who
played the idiot-savant narrator in ``Village'' and the seemingly
civilized, casually vicious concentration commandant in ``Adam
Resurrected.'' He was superb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Village'' is easy to like. ``Adam Resurrected'' puts the
audience on edge. Written by Alexander Chervinsky and based on
Yoram Kaniuk's novel, this is an exuberantly impressionistic play
set in the exhausted, addled brain of Adam Stein. He is a German
Jew, a star-clown in prewar Berlin where he owned his own circus,
who is now fighting his way back to sanity in an Israeli hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The play swings abruptly, sometimes wildly through time,
embracing Adam's prewar fame and life with his wife and small
daughter, his postwar guilt and spiritual lethargy and his
hallucinatory concentration camp experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by the commandant to be his performing ``dog,'' Adam also
performs for the prisoners to distract their attention as they go
into the gas chambers. He saves himself and his daughter, but he
can't save his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The production at Lincoln Center was played in a circus tent in
Damrosch Park. The ``stage'' was the circus ring, bisected by
ominous railroad tracks, above which were a trapeze and a
tightrope, all used in various ingenious ways in the course of the
performance. The production was full of echoes of the work of other
people, everybody from Brecht and Fellini to Kander and Ebb, but it
also had its own vigorous, original life. Under the disciplined
direction of Arye, the performance was sometimes breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam Resurrected'' isn't the conventional theater of
narrative, but a theater of ideas and feelings that are expressed
as eloquently through imagery as in words. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is the Theatre de Complicite's production of ``The
Street of Crocodiles,'' subtitled ``A Dance of the Mind.'' The text
is based on stories by Bruno Schulz, the Polish Jewish writer who,
in 1942, was murdered by a Nazi officer in Drohobycz, the
provincial town where Schulz was born and lived most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol,'' the piece is described
as having been ``devised by the company from an adaptation by Simon
McBurney and Mark Wheatley,'' meaning that everyone involved was
invited to collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   If you have ever read any of Schulz's stories, you might suspect
they would be impossible to stage. They are the sometimes
fantastic, minutely detailed autobiographical reports from an
almost pathologically reclusive man.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz seems to have lived inside a tumultuous mind that he
protected as if it were a secret sanctuary. A strangely uncertain
place it was, a land where objects and people change shapes and
identities like dream figures. Nothing is quite what it was a
moment ago.
</P>
<P>
   Supplementing elements from the stories with events from
Schulz's own life (including his death), ``The Street of
Crocodiles'' creates an impressionistic panorama of what it might
be like to inhabit Schulz's Kafka-like world. Visions, personal
memories, nightmares and the contents of books all have the same
reality. It isn't easy following ``The Street of Crocodiles,'' even
after reading the synopsis in the program. This is theater to be
experienced as if it were a piece of music.
</P>
<P>
   It is not my favorite kind of theater. For all of its emphasis
on imagery and stagecraft, it seems a very literary kind of
theater, not only because its roots are often literary, but also
because of the volume of interpretation it inevitably prompts. Yet,
when it is staged _ you might say choreographed _ by a director of
McBurney's skills, and when it is played by a company as thoroughly
drilled as these actors, the effects can be magically liberating.
Bravo.

<P>
   Oxford Health Plans, the troubled company that once seemed to
hold great promise for the future of managed care, is warning
doctors that it must raise premiums and reduce the amount it pays
doctors and hospitals, if it is to make money.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to doctors on Monday, Norman Payson, Oxford's
new chief executive, outlined a series of steps the company plans
to take. Oxford is considering shrinking the size of its hospital
network and will try to more aggressively discourage members from
going out of its network.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford would not comment on its specific plans, and it remains
unclear how dramatic these changes will be. ``Its significance will
depend on the degree,'' said Bob Braddick, a benefits consultant
for William Mercer in New York. ``They have significant business
problems. They have to address these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   While the steps outlined by Payson had been expected, they are
the clearest indication to date of Oxford's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   They also come at a critical time. Many employers will soon be
deciding whether to offer Oxford to their employees next year, and
many employees will have the opportunity to switch plans this fall.
Oxford risks losing members if it raises premiums by too much or
makes its popular Freedom plan significantly less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford, once the darling of Wall Street and consumers alike,
seemed to have perfected the best of both worlds in its health
plan. The plan offered members the choice of going to any doctor at
a reasonable price. Then last October it stunned investors with the
news that it expected sizable losses. The company had
underestimated the cost of delivering care to its 2 million
members.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford has spent the last year trying to untangle the chaos that
resulted in a $291 million loss for 1997. As part of its turnaround
plan earlier this year, the company raised $710 million in capital
from private investors and brought in a new management team.
</P>
<P>
   But Payson's letter also seemed to signal that Oxford has a long
way to go before it returns to profitability. ``Oxford is still
losing significant amounts of money in its health plans,'' Payson
said. ``If we took no action, in time we would be in serious
financial difficulty again. Therefore, we must initiate measures
now to stem losses, with a target of reaching break-even within
twelve months.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which has been bludgeoned by news of the
company's losses, hit a new 52-week low Wednesday. Investors appear
to be anticipating more bad news in the coming weeks, when the
company releases its second-quarter results. It closed at $12.50,
down $1.3125.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining Oxford's strategy, Payson said that the company,
``by necessity, must raise rates.'' He said that the company had
already started to raise premiums for some employers, which are
``for the most part staying with Oxford.''
</P>
<P>
   Benefits consultants say that the rate increases so far have
varied significantly from employer to employer. Henry Moyer, a
benefits consultant at Hirschfield, Stern, Moyer &AMP; Ross, said that
while some clients' premiums haven't changed, Oxford recently
raised rates for one client by 32 percent. That client, which Moyer
would not identify, switched plans.
</P>
<P>
   And while some employers have been told to expect a premium
increase of around 10 percent, many are still waiting for Oxford to
provide exact figures. ``Everyone's waiting,'' said Barry Barnett,
a principal at Kwasha HR Solutions, a unit of Price Waterhouse
Coopers. ``There is a lot of bated breath out there.'' In
discussing the impact on doctors, Payson said Oxford's goal ``is to
change only those fees we need to and, in general, to only affect
fees modestly.'' But doctors, especially if they are still owed
money from claims they say are lost or have been mishandled, may
not react well to any sharp reduction. Consultants say some doctors
may abandon the network.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This could have a serious impact on many providers in this
area,'' said Charles Aswad, the executive vice president for the
New York State Medical Society, noting that doctors are under
pressure by many managed-care companies to accept lower
reimbursements. While he said the letter's ``general intent is
positive,'' he worried about the size of any reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Payson also indicated that Oxford's ``net hospital costs have
gone up dramatically'' in New York state, home to most of Oxford's
members, because of the recent New York Health Care Reform Act
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford ``can no longer afford to absorb these costs nor pass
them on directly or indirectly to employers, doctors or patients,''
he said, and the company would be negotiating with hospitals to
reduce those costs. He said the company would consider reducing the
size of its network or develop a preferred network.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation, which requires plans to help share the cost
of graduate medical education and uncompensated care, should have
had no impact on Oxford's costs, according to Patricia Wang, an
executive at the Greater New York Hospital Association. ``They
really should have been paying this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford also appears to be considering some changes to its
Freedom plan, which became popular precisely because it seemed to
offer substantial choice at a reasonable price. ``Our primary
initiative for our patients is to encourage them more and more to
stay in network,'' Payson explained. Oxford could raise the size of
the deductible it charges members who go outside, or reduce the
amount of their bills that it reimburses them.
</P>
<P>
   Payson also made it clear that Oxford plans to continue to move
away from certain businesses. ``We learned that Oxford cannot be
all things to all people,'' he said. ``We need assistance in the
challenging governmentally financed segments of our population,
Medicare and Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter went out as investors are growing increasingly
nervous about the company's financial results, which are expected
in mid-August. Analysts say that they expect a sizable loss. Anne
Anderson, an analyst at Atlantis Investment Co. in Parsippany,
N.J., who continues to bet that the stock will drop further,
forecast that the company would report a second-quarter loss of at
least $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the company takes the steps outlined by Payson, Oxford
has yet to prove it can offer a plan that is both popular and
profitable. According to Arun Kumar, a bond analyst with Standard &AMP;
Poor's, ``Breaking even in 12 months is not impossible, but very
difficult.''

ALAN SHEPARD, FIRST AMERICAN IN SPACE, DIES AT 74

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Shepard, the first American to fly in space, lifting
national spirits at a decisive moment of Cold War anxiety, and
later one of only 12 astronauts to walk on the Moon, died Tuesday
night at a hospital in Monterey, Calif. He was 74 and lived Houston
and Pebble Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The family would not disclose the cause of death, saying only
that it came after a long illness. But another former astronaut,
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said that Shepard had been suffering from
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of May 5, 1961, Shepard became an immediate
American hero. A lean, crew-cut former Navy test pilot, then 37, he
began the day lying on his back in a cramped Mercury capsule atop a
seven-story Redstone rocket filled with explosive fuel. After four
tense hours of weather and mechanical delays, he was shot into the
sky on a 15-minute flight that grazed the fringes of space, at an
altitude of 115 miles, and ended in a splashdown in the Atlantic
Ocean 302 miles downrange from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Though not much by today's standards, the brief suborbital
flight had stopped a whole country in its tracks, waiting anxiously
at radios and television sets. When the message of success came
through _ with a phrase that would enter the idiom, ``Everything is
A-OK!'' _ everyone seemed to let out a collective sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union's Yuri Gagarin may have been first man into
space, 23 days before, and have flown a full orbit, but now the
United States finally had reason to cheer. In fact, Shepard's
success is credited with giving President John F. Kennedy the
confidence to commit the nation to the goal of landing men on the
Moon by the end of the decade. He announced the goal to Congress on
May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goldin, NASA's director, said the Shepard flight was ``a
tremendous statement about tenacity, courage and brilliance,''
adding with a tone of lingering awe: ``He crawled on top of that
rocket that had never before flown into space with a person aboard
and he did it. That was an unbelievable act of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Logsdon, a political scientist at George Washington
University and author of ``The Decision to Go to the Moon,'' said,
``One can make the argument that the success of the Shepard flight
enabled the decision to go to the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., a historian and a member of the
Kennedy White House staff, recalled that the Gagarin flight and
then the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Cuba a few days later had given
``Americans a slight inferiority complex.'' Then the Shepard flight
produced ``a great exhilaration and renewed our confidence in our
capacity as a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hailed Shepard as ``one of the great heroes of
modern America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the first flight, Shepard made a comeback from a
serious inner ear problem called Meuniere's syndrome that had
grounded him. And it was also a comeback flight for the space
program.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, 1971, he took off for the Moon in Apollo 14, the
first lunar mission since the near-disaster of Apollo 13 the year
before. He and Edgar Mitchell spent 33 hours on the Moon, a visit
made memorable by Shepard taking several spirited whacks at golf
balls with a makeshift 6-iron he had brought along. The balls
sailed in the low lunar gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived every golfer's dream,'' Clinton remarked. ``Taking a
6-iron and hitting the ball, in his words, `for miles and miles.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was one of the original seven Mercury astronauts chosen
in 1959 by the fledgling space agency and introduced to the nation
with great fanfare. His death leaves only four survivors: Scott
Carpenter, L. Gordon Cooper, Walter Schirra and Glenn, who at 77 is
training for a kind of farewell flight on the space shuttle in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom died in a cockpit fire during a
launching-pad training exercise in 1967. Donald ``Deke'' Slayton
died of cancer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Shepard retired from both NASA and the Navy, where he
had achieved the rank of rear admiral. Already wealthy from real
estate and other investments, he became chairman of Marathon
Construction Corp. in Houston and later founded his own business
company, Seven Fourteen Enterprises. The name recognized his two
missions, Freedom 7 and Apollo 14.

   Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. was born on Nov. 18, 1923, in East
Derry, N.H., where his father, a retired Army colonel, was in the
insurance business. Young Alan took odd jobs at a local airfield to
learn more about planes.
</P>
<P>
   His education began in a one-room country school, continued with
high school at Pinkerton Academy in nearby Derry and was completed
at the U.S. Naval Academy, where he graduated in 1944. He served
briefly in the Pacific in World War II before turning to aviation.
</P>
<P>
   His career moved along typically: flight training in Texas and
Florida and service on aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean. Then
he entered test-pilot training at Patuxent River, Md., elevating
himself into the elite of military aviation. When NASA asked 110
test pilots to volunteer to be astronauts, Shepard made the list
and was one of the seven chosen ones.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the early days in the astronaut corps, Glenn said
Wednesday: ``That group was tossed into a maelstrom of activity,
attention, travel and training in preparation for those early
Mercury flights. It became obvious to all of us very early in our
training that Al was a highly intelligent, dedicated leader whose
high motivation toward accomplishing our mission was a true
inspiration to all.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven astronauts were highly competitive, each vying to be
first to fly in space and Shepard often seeming to be the most
determined, self-confident and cockiest of the group.
</P>
<P>
   As the author Tom Wolfe wrote years later in ``The Right
Stuff,'' Shepard presented two different faces to his colleagues,
``both the Icy Commander and Smilin' Al,'' but he ``set a standard
of coolness and competence that would be hard to top.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard made no secret of his intense dislike of Wolfe's book,
particularly some of its character studies and its concentration on
some of the astronauts' after-hours pursuits. On tour promoting his
own book, ``Moon Shot,'' written with Slayton, Shepard often said,
``We wanted to call ours `The Real Stuff,' since his was just
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was among three finalists for the first flight, the
others being Grissom and Glenn. The decision was made several weeks
before the launching but was not announced until May 2. By that
time, the one chosen knew he would be only the first American in
space, not the first ever.
</P>
<P>
   American space managers had originally scheduled a piloted
Mercury launching in March, but some problems with a
chimpanzee-flown test in January troubled the engineers, who
decided the March flight would be another unmanned test.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, the Russians continued their string of space
triumphs by putting Gagarin in space for a full orbit. The
historian Dr. Walter A. McDougall, in his book ``The Heavens and
the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age,'' wrote that
``Gagarin's flight was a second Sputnik'' and when Shepard's flight
three weeks later lasted only 15 minutes on a suborbital
trajectory, ``The space gap, in the eyes of the world, had
widened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the power rivalry of the Cold War, the space race had become
a kind of moral equivalent of war, and in those early years after
the first Sputnik satellite in October 1957, the Soviet space
forces seemed to be winning hands down. The United States felt its
prestige ebbing with each Soviet launching.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Soviet press agency Tass sneered that the Freedom 7
flight ``cannot be compared with the flight of the Soviet space
ship Vostok.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougall noted that a poll taken after the Shepard flight
revealed that Western Europeans believed the Soviet Union to be
ahead in total military strength by 41 percent to 19 percent, and
in overall scientific achievement by 39 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On that May 5th morning, these things were not on Shepard's
mind. Because of the many delays, he had an unremitting urge to
urinate, but no way to get relief in his cocoon of a silver space
suit. He kept pleading with the controllers for a break. They would
not relent.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard described the experience in ``Moon Shot.'' ``You heard
me,'' he radioed to the controllers. ``I've got to pee. I've been
in here forever. The gantry is still right here, so why don't you
guys let me out of here for a quick stretch?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No way, Alan,'' Gordon Cooper replied, after a consultation
with Dr. Wernher von Braun, the rocket scientist. ``Wernher says
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Shepard suggested that he be allowed to urinate in his
suit. But that might short-circuit the medical sensors, came the
reply. ``Tell 'em to turn the power off,'' the desperate astronaut
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   So they did, and so relief finally came to Shepard, not long
before he made history.

 UNDATED: made history. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision by Kennedy, which contrasted with the Soviet
policy of secrecy, the launch was broadcast live on radio and
television. The capsule separated smoothly from the rocket.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes into the mission, Shepard took over manual control
from the autopilot, putting the craft through some prescribed
maneuvers. For five minutes, at maximum altitude and traveling more
than 5,000 mph, the astronaut experienced the weightlessness of
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, what a ride!'' he said later. Yet, he said, the trip was
``pleasant and relaxing,'' with no effect on his movements and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was almost flawless, and so was the splashdown in the
Atlantic. ``On the way to the carrier I felt relieved and happy,''
the astronaut said later. ``I knew I had done a pretty good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he used the expression A-OK is problematic. Years
later, a reporter asked Shepard if he had indeed said A-OK, and
where did the term come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Shorty Powers,'' he said enigmatically, referring to Col.
John ``Shorty'' Powers, who was press officer to the first
astronauts. It was Powers who had passed on the quote to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Everything did seem to come up A-OK. Three days later, Shepard
and his wife, the former Louise Brewer, were entertained by the
Kennedys at the White House, then whisked to New York for a
ticker-tape parade in the old Lindbergh tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, space, military and budget officials were
meeting to draw up recommendations for taking bold new steps to
catch up with and surpass Soviet space achievements. A memorandum,
handed to Kennedy the day of Shepard's White House visit,
concluded, ``Of all the programs planned, perhaps the greatest
unsurpassed prestige will accrue to the nation which first sends a
man to the moon and returns him safely to Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 25, Kennedy told Congress, ``This nation should commit
itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing
a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth. No single
space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or
more important for the long-range exploration of space. And none
will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Logsdon of George Washington University said it was doubtful
that Kennedy would have issued such a challenge, if the Shepard
flight had failed.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner celebrating the 30th anniversary of the flight,
Glenn said: ``Al's flight and my flight _ it was almost like we
turned a corner. There was a feeling we were coming back. There was
a great outpouring of public spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard called it ``just the first baby step, aiming for bigger
and better things.'' His words would be echoed eight years later by
Neil Armstrong as he stepped on the Moon with the declaration,
``One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard almost did not make it to the Moon himself. Before he
could train for a second space flight in the Gemini Project, he
developed inner-ear problems. Thomas Stafford, a retired astronaut,
recalled Wednesday that he and Shepard had been chosen for the
first Gemini mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge blow in his life,'' Stafford said of the medical
problems that grounded Shepard. ``He was anxious to get back into
space, to ride again.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for nearly a decade, Shepard was firmly rooted to NASA
managerial jobs, mainly directing the astronaut corps. Stafford
recalled him as a natural leader, who operated ``with more stick
than carrot and would lay down the law, saying here's how it's
going to be, guys.''
</P>
<P>
   After surgery to correct the ear problem in 1968, Shepard was
cleared to fly again and was assigned to what turned out to be the
third lunar landing. Although his first flight had been only 15
minutes, the Apollo 14 journey to the Moon added 216 hours to his
log book and rounded out an astronaut career that also included a
Congressional Space Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, he still had time for work promoting the
space program and had joined the other surviving Mercury
astronauts, and Betty Grissom, the widow of Gus Grissom, in
founding the Mercury Seven Foundation, based in Titusville, Fla.,
near Cape Canaveral. The foundation raises money for scholarships
for science and engineering students in college. He was its
president and chairman until last October.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife of 53 years, survivors include two daughters,
Laura Snyder and Juliana Coleman Jenkins, and six grandchildren.
Funeral arrangements are pending. &QL;

BRITAIN WEIGHTS DUTCH TRIAL IN LOCKERBIE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By YOUSSEF M., IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain signaled its willingness Wednesday to consider
the Netherlands as the site of a trial for two Libyan suspects in
the bombing of Pan Am flight 103, which killed 270 people a decade
ago in an explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Britain and the United States had been adamant in
their insistence that the two Libyans, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and
Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, should stand trial either in a Scottish or
American court. Libya has consistently denied any involvement in
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States announced on Tuesday that it would consider a
trial in the Netherlands. And Prime Minister Tony Blair told
parliament Wednesday, ``It has been our wish that the trial take
place in Scotland or the U.S., and I reject claims that there
should be any difficulty about a fair trial in Scotland.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``As the result of no progress having being made,
however, we are prepared to look at alternative ways of giving
families the justice they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the British prime minister and the Foreign and
Commonwealth office here Wednesday confirmed that Blair and
President Clinton had indeed discussed the idea ``several times''
in the last few weeks and that negotiations were under way with the
Dutch government on how to bring it about. But British officials
said talks were in a preliminary stage and faced complicated legal
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, a Foreign Office official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the primary motivation behind the move is that too
much time has gone by without a resolution of the case and that
Britain's priority is to bring the suspects to justice, partly to
satisfy relatives of British passengers on board the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here and in the Netherlands said the legal aspects of
such a trial are still to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   A Dutch Foreign Ministry official who insisted on anonymity said
if the trial were to take place, it would happen in an ad hoc
court, in a courtroom rented or used for the purpose, and would be
conducted not under Dutch law but under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Libya would agree to that. British
officials said they would insist that the trial be conducted by
Scottish judges under Scottish law and not by an international
panel of judges.

US COURT BACKS JURY IN LOBBYING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a decision that underscores a federal push to
criminalize cozy ties between legislators and lobbyists on Beacon
Hill, a federal appeals court has upheld the conviction of a former
legislator who accepted free rounds of golf, fancy dinners, and a
trip to the Super Bowl from the chief lobbyist for one of the
state's premier insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 61-page decision issued Wednesday, the US Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit found that a jury was correct to
convict former House Insurance Committee Chairman Francis H.
Woodward in the fall of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected Woodward's claim that John Hancock lobbyist
F. William Sawyer had picked up the tab, totaling more than $7,000,
because he and Woodward were friends &UR;  &LR; _ not to buy influence with
the leader of the committee directly responsible for insurance
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that Woodward accepted the gratuities as part of
an effort to influence him and deprive taxpayers of his ``honest
services.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodward's official actions, for the most part, conformed with
the way Sawyer and Hancock wanted the recipient of their gratuities
to conduct himself,'' according to the decision by a three-judge
panel. ``The jury could have inferred what the deal was _ that the
gratuities would continue as long as he voted favorably to
Hancock's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, the court wrote, was wrong to argue ``that the
formation of a friendship between a lobbyist and a legislator
somehow insulates both from prosecution ...''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court decision further validates what has been a
controversial legal strategy by federal prosecutors: transforming
violations of state ethics laws into criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the &UR;  &LR; two judges who sentenced Woodward and Sawyer
publicly questioned the prosecution. One wondered why the US
attorney's office was spending its resources on a case ``of
hospitality where you don't have a quid pro quo,'' while the other
called the prosecution ``a threat to liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is likely to further chill the once-warm relations
between lobbyists and legislators, first highlighted in a 1993
Globe Spotlight Team series. The series sparked an FBI
investigation that led to the resignation of former House speaker
Charles Flaherty after he pleaded guilty to a tax charge, and it
also spawned a ban on gifts from lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, Woodward was convicted of four charges,
including mail and wire fraud, resulting from a November 1990
golfing trip/insurance conference in Florida. But he was acquitted
of 21 other charges stemming from events that occurred after
Woodward was deposed as House chairman in January 1991, when the
jury presumably found Sawyer's largesse was not tied to Woodward's
office.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, Woodward was sentenced to six months in a
federal halfway house and fined $5,000. Two months earlier, Sawyer
had escaped jail by pleading guilty to a single charge of paying
$183 for golf games with legislators at a Cape Cod course.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer had been convicted in March 1995 of 28 corruption
charges, but a federal appeals court overturned the convictions the
following May. The court ruled that the trial judge should have
instructed jurors that in order to convict Sawyer they had to find
that he intended to corrupt legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a retrial, Sawyer was allowed to plead guilty to a
single count of mail fraud in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also rejected Woodward's claim that he never
intended to break the law, pointing out that he had deliberately
omitted the meals, golf games, and trips from financial disclosure
forms.

CONSTRUCTION MISHAP CONTINUES TO PARALYZE TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tuesday's collapse of an elevator tower at a Times
Square construction site continued to disrupt the routine of
midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, as dozens of local shops remained
shuttered, hundreds of police officers directed traffic away from
blocked-off streets and multitudes of tourists and workers
marveled, muttered _ and adapted.
</P>
<P>
   For now, adaptation will continue to be the requisite approach
to life in the epicenter of New York City, city officials say. They
said the shops and streets will remain closed at least for the rest
of the week, while construction workers draw a 700-by-100-foot
curtain around the broken scaffolding that runs up the northern
side of the Conde Nast building, on Broadway and 42nd and 43rd
Streets. The curtain, made of reinforced nylon, will allow workers
to take apart the scaffolding under safe conditions, a process that
could take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called on the developer, the Durst
Organization, and the general contractor, Tishman Construction
Corp. _ whose controlling families have been financial supporters
of his past political campaigns _ to compensate in some way the
many businesses that were forced to close because of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very, very useful to a few of the businesses that
might be particularly strapped for cash over the next three to four
days if some reasonable sum of money were made available,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident's many legal implications were largely left for
another day, while its social implications were more in evidence.
Police officers, tourists, workers and residents found themselves
grappling with the abrupt change visited upon one of the busiest
corners of the world. The west side of Broadway was open to
pedestrian while the east side was closed; those wanting to walk
north on Avenue of the Americas were sent to Fifth Avenue or Eighth
Avenue; and drivers wanting to go across town unimpeded hadn't a
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Many tourists found the emptiness of a barricaded Times Square
rather exhilarating; ``This is actually cool,'' said Lisa Winton,
of Omaha, Neb., as she waited for tickets to a Broadway matinee.
But the momentary charm of upheaval had waned for many locals; one
inconvenienced man stomped down 42nd Street, screaming epithets
that might have constituted a felony in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   During lunchtime at the epicenter of it all _ Broadway and 44th
Street _ a clearly agitated police lieutenant screamed at gawkers
to move along. ``The answer is no!'' he shouted. ``Goodbye! Keep
moving! It's dangerous to stay here!'' An elderly tourist responded
by steadying her camera and snapping his photograph.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, the zany moments there loomed the sobering sight
of the half-completed Conde Nast building, its crumpled scaffolding
gleaming in the hot sun like the broken pieces to some gargantuan
Erector set.
</P>
<P>
   A ghostly quiet along Avenue of the Americas between 42nd and
43rd Street whispered of the emotional and financial costs yet
tallied. The only vehicles to be seen were squad cars, fire
engines, and a blue-orange-and-white bus labeled ``Interagency
Command Center.'' All nine stores on the west side of the street _
Pronto Pasta, Olympic Photo and Electronic, City Jeans, the Hop Won
Express restaurant _ were dark. Closed as well was the business,
around the corner on 43rd Street, that had paid the greatest price:
the Woodstock Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 8:30 Tuesday morning _ just as the helter-skelter
pace of Times Square began to quicken _ a spine of steel broke away
from some scaffolding alongside the Conde Nast building and pierced
the hotel's roof, sending tons of metal and debris through the
floors below. Twelve residents were injured, and one crushed to
death: Thereza Feliconio, 85, whose style of dress and zest for
life belied the fact that she lived in subsidized residence for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, a hunt for beds for the Woodstock's 274 tenants
began at the Times Square Hotel and ended, for some, at Bellevue
Hospital at 1 a.m. Another 150 people who either live in the area
or rented hotel rooms relied on the American Red Cross to help them
find shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The developer, Douglas Durst, explained Wednesday that he had to
research his insurance coverage before offering assistance. Now, he
said, he and the contractor, Dan Tishman, were prepared to extend
some help to the displaced and inconvenienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told by our insurance company that we cannot negotiate
directly with anyone who may have a claim,'' Durst said. ``We were
advised that anything we do outside our insurance can jeopardize
our policy. We obviously don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger question was, Why did such an accident happen? One
day after what Buildings Commissioner Gaston Silva described as
``the most serious and dramatic construction failure of this
decade,'' builders and city and federal inspectors were trying to
determine the cause of the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the accident is particularly puzzling given
the solid reputations of the Durst and Tishman companies, and they
continued to describe two previous accidents at the construction
site _ the collapse of a crane onto another building in January,
and the death of a worker crushed under an elevator cab last month
_ as unrelated flukes in a generally dangerous business.
</P>
<P>
   Durst said he now believes that there was a serious problem with
the scaffolding that was designed and built by a subcontractor,
Universal Builders Supply of Mount Vernon, N.Y.

<P>
   ABOARD THE REGINA MAERSK _ After more than a century as the
dominant seaport on the East Coast, New York Harbor has seen a lot
of ships come and go _ but never anything quite like this one, the
vanguard of a new fleet of cargo ``superships,'' with a hull as
long as the Chrysler Building is tall.
</P>
<P>
   In the first visit to the United States by a cargo ship this
big, with its horns blasting louder than a jet's roar, the Regina
Maersk Wednesday made a celebratory pause in the shadow of the
Statue of Liberty, as fountains of water sprayed from a fireboat,
and a fleet of tugs, pleasure craft, police boats and helicopters
flitted about.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival was carefully choreographed, because the purpose of
the visit by the giant Danish vessel was only partly to unload 492
truck-size containers of toys, Christmas decorations, furniture and
clothing at Port Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   According to its owner, Maersk Inc., it was also here to send a
strong message to New York and New Jersey, which share the $20
billion-a-year bounty from harbor commerce, and to harbor officials
and politicians at several other ports along the Eastern seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   The message delivered by the ship, which had to lower its radio
mast to slip under the 151-foot-high arc of the Bayonne Bridge
connecting New Jersey with Staten Island, was that the vessels that
will ply major global trade routes from now on are going to be
very, very big, and that any port that wants to dominate maritime
commerce in the 21st century has to be sure its channels are deep
enough and its docks modern enough to accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   The Regina Maersk, 1,043 feet long, is the first of a new
generation of enormous cargo vessels that marine analysts say
should soon transform marine trade into something resembling the
modern airport system, with hubs served by the largest ships and
spokes reached by smaller craft.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the bistate
agency that manages harbor trade, is engaged in an intense
competition with about half a dozen other harbors to become the hub
for the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   For New York Harbor, in particular, which has notoriously
narrow, shallow channels leading to its main cargo docks in Port
Newark and Port Elizabeth, N.J., the arrival of the ship Wednesday
intensified the pressure on officials to obtain adequate federal
money to deepen major channels.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest task is to blast the shelf of bedrock underlying
the Kill Van Kull, the narrowest, shallowest bottleneck in the
harbor _ which also happens to be the gateway to the New Jersey
piers. Even after nearly a decade of dredging and blasting, the
channel is still only 40 feet deep on an average low tide.
</P>
<P>
   When fully loaded, the Regina Maersk and a growing fleet of
similarly sized vessels ride more than 47 feet deep in the water.
Even on a high tide, negotiating the tight turns into Newark Bay on
a ship that deep and long could be a navigator's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, to be sure there were no mistakes, the ship had
two seasoned New York Harbor pilots quietly instructing the Danish
helmsman on every tweak of the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   A digital meter indicating how much water lay beneath the keel
displayed a string of nerve-racking numbers, showing the gap
between the ship and harbor bottom often at less than 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Regina Maersk was launched two years ago by Maersk Line, the
largest container shipping company in the world, as the first in a
fleet of more than a dozen ships, some even a bit larger, that are
designed to haul enormous loads of consumer goods from Asia to
Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   The previous generation of large container ships could carry
about 4,000 truck-size containers in their holds and lashed on
deck. The Regina Maersk carries 6,000 of the aluminum boxes, which
have become the standard means of shipping almost all manufactured
goods around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials and representatives of harbor
businesses and unions stared up at the slab-sided blue craft from
two charter boats that circled like herding dogs around a stray
bull, and many said the message sent by Maersk was received loud
and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is here today,'' Lillian Borrone, the director of
port operations for the Port Authority, said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Port Authority was prepared to spend its 35 percent
share of the $623 million cost of deepening the harbor channels and
to press Congress and the Clinton administration to provide the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   So far, $35 million has been authorized by Congress to spend in
the 1999 fiscal year on deepening the major channels in the harbor,
said Peter Shugert, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers,
the federal agency responsible for keeping major navigation
channels clear.
</P>
<P>
   But the pace of the project has frustrated shippers. Last May,
Maersk and another large shipping line, Sea-Land Service, announced
that they might move their main cargo-handling operations from New
York Harbor to another East Coast port because of high rent and
long-standing delays in dredging shipping channels.
</P>
<P>
   The two shipping companies handled about a fourth of the 1.4
million containers of cargo that flowed through New York Harbor
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Borrone said that if the port lost the two companies, other
shipping companies could decide to shift as well, resulting in a
drop in container traffic of as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is also scheduled to visit several competing ports _
Halifax, Nova Scotia; Norfolk, Va., and Charleston, S.C. _
essentially representing a gantlet thrown down by Maersk,
challenging each port to see which handles the ship best.
</P>
<P>
   The new fleet of giant ships like the Regina Maersk had not been
expected to be needed for trade in North America until after 2000,
but the economic crisis in Asia has produced a surplus of thousands
of empty containers here, which normally would have flowed steadily
back to Asia filled with raw materials to turn into finished
products.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Regina Maersk, after unloading goods here, will take on some
export cargo, but will also haul stacks of the empty containers
back to the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   After the flurry of formalities near lower Manhattan, the ship
returned to business, heading for the Kill Van Kull and the wharfs
beyond. On the bridge, 14 stories above the water, two Danish
captains watched banks of instruments and surveyed the scene ahead
with the sagging piers of Bayonne, N.J., and Staten Island closing
in on both sides, making the sprawling harbor look cramped.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Henrik Solmer, who has taken dozens of ships into New York
Harbor but was not on duty Wednesday, said that most American
harbors _ unlike those in Asia and Europe _ are difficult to
navigate. ``The only place we don't see any problem is Long Beach,
Calif., and Tacoma, Wash.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Harbor pilots, who flanked the helmsman and
captain, said that despite the ship's bulk, they had a relatively
easy task Wednesday. The view ahead was unobstructed because the
stacks of containers on the foredeck were low; the ship had only a
fifth of a full load.
</P>
<P>
   Also with the light load, it rode only 36 feet down in the
water, providing ample breathing room in the shoal passage.
</P>
<P>
   The meter reading the distance from hull to bottom registered an
unremarkable four meters, then 4.5, then 4.7.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many of the Danish officers and Robert Moore, the
New York pilot for the final leg inside the Kill Van Kull, were now
intently focused on every tiny vibration of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the officers and Moore were now smoking steady streams
of cigarettes, and ashtrays quickly filled.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere were the quarters tighter than directly beneath the
Bayonne Bridge. As the ship moved at a fast walking pace beneath
the span, which was crowded with evening-rush traffic, several
officers scurried to the open deck above to see just how close a
fit it would be.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke from the funnel blossomed around the busy roadway, a
mere five feet above the tallest part of the ship. ``I could have
reached up and touched it,'' one officer said.

NEUTRAL EXPERTS STUDYING BREAST IMPLANT DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After 16 years of litigation and scientific
controversy over the safety of silicone breast implants, a panel of
independent experts Wednesday began its own inquiry into the
dispute, which pits researchers who say there is no link between
implants and disease against tens of thousands of women who say the
devices made them sick.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-member panel, which includes immunologists,
toxicologists, surgeons and oncologists, has been convened by the
prestigious Institute of Medicine at the request of the National
Institutes of Health. It met publicly for the first time Wednesday,
as part of a three-day session that will include testimony from
government and industry scientists, and the women themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came just two weeks after Dow Corning Corp., an
implant manufacturer, agreed _ without admitting wrongdoing _ to
pay $3.2 billion to 170,000 women who assert they have been
injured. Dow Corning scientists said they welcomed the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will be a fruitful discussion of the science,''
said Dr. Robert Meeks, the company's chief toxicologist. ``It is
going to give not only the scientists but also the women with
implants a chance to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   While more than a dozen major epidemiologic studies have failed
to demonstrate the link between implants and established diseases,
including cancer and autoimmune disorders, many experts say the
safety questions are far from settled.
</P>
<P>
   There is much that scientists do not know, including the role
played by genetics and whether there is an as-yet undefined
disorder that plagues the women. And there are the women
themselves, many of whom have turned up sick in doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my patients report symptoms,'' said Dr. Lu-Jean Feng,
a surgeon at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in Cleveland who has removed
implants from 842 patients in seven years. Dr. Feng, who testified
Wednesday, is studying why implants rupture. Although her work does
not address whether they cause disease, she said of her patients:
``The majority of their implants hurt; 71 percent had pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hearing room at the Georgetown University Medical
Center, Wednesday's meeting seemed like any scientific conference,
with a parade of researchers offering up details of their work. The
research ran the gamut, from Dr. Feng's work to studies that
examined whether tumors in mice that had been injected with
silicone had any relevance to humans (Dow Corning researchers say
they do not).
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway, however, the day was a bonafide media event, as
reporters interviewed the dozens of women who came to ``show
support for our silicone sisters,'' in the words of Lorraine Keegin
of Cocoa Beach, Fla. Many of the women will speak Friday, when the
panel takes public testimony again; Thursday's session will be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Keegin, who like the others wore a purple ribbon on her
lapel, said she developed lupus, an autoimmune disease, and
symptoms similar to those of multiple sclerosis, as a result of
implants she received in 1985. ``What I did to enhance my
appearance has taken my appearance and my life away,'' Mrs. Keegin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Keegin is one of 650,000 to one million American women who
received silicone breast implants during the 1970s and 1980s. The
legal disputes, which she is a party to, started soon afterward,
with patients complaining of silicone leaks that they said had
damaged their health.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration, responding to the
public outcry, demanded that silicone implants be removed from the
market; today, they are available only for experimental purposes to
mastectomy patients who want them for reconstructive surgery. Two
companies, McGhan Medical Corp., a subsidiary of Inamed Corp., and
Mentor Corp., both of Santa Barbara, Calif., are hoping to gain FDA
approval to market the implants once again.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a welcome change, said Dr. Garry Brody, a plastic
surgeon at the University of Southern California. Brody has studied
3,000 women with implants and has found that they are 30 percent
less likely than other women to develop breast cancer _ a finding
that leads him to maintain that implants are safer than the breast
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most studied product that I'm aware of,'' said
Brody, whose work was financed, in part, by Dow Corning. ``All of
the evidence suggests that it is safe. When can we reassure the
public?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question is not likely to come until one year
from now, when the Institute, an arm of the National Academy of
Sciences, releases its report. In the meantime, research into the
safety of breast implants continues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Frederick
Miller, reported Wednesday that he found unusual genetic
alterations in 12 women with implants who all developed a rare
variant of the autoimmune disease myositis. The finding suggests
that in some women, exposure to silicone may trigger genes that
predispose them to that disease.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting research on silicone implants in a climate that is
infused with legal charges and countercharges has not been easy,
said Dr. Louise Brinton, chief of the environmental epidemiology
branch of the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brinton is supervising a vast study of more than 13,000
women who have had implants, in some cases as long as 20 or 30
years ago. She said she has been peppered by Freedom of Information
Act requests from implant manufacturers, and has been subjected to
allegations that she is in collusion with lawyers for the
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a total mistruth,'' she said. ``This study is complex
enough as it is; to have to deal with these assaults on a daily
basis is very disturbing.'' &QL;

IRAN SUCCESSFULLY TESTS MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, re-editing throughout) (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
 By TIM WEINER  
(sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iran successfully tested a medium-range missile on
Wednesday, a senior administration official said on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon, with a range of about 800 miles, is capable of
hitting Israel and Saudi Arabia, and of altering the political and
military balance of power in the Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weapon would allow Iran to strike all of Israel, all of
Saudi Arabia, most of Turkey and a tip of Russia,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said a U.S. spy satellite had detected the test
on Wednesday morning, and that intelligence experts were still
poring over data from the launching of the missile, which they
believe Iran bought from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The officials are certain that Iran successfully tested the
medium-range missile, but could not provide immediate information
on the location of the launching site or the area where it landed
except to say both were inside Iran's borders.
</P>
<P>
   A former intelligence official familiar with the spread of such
weapons said: ``The major reaction to this is going to be from
Israel and we have to worry what action the Israelis will take,
because the Israelis clearly view the Iranians as their main threat
in the Middle East.'' Israel is the only nuclear power in the
region, and its missiles are believed to be capable of striking any
nation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is working on developing a nuclear warhead but is believed
to be years away from building and testing such a weapon. But the
United States is not certain of the size or sophistication of its
programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The test on Wednesday comes as the United States and Iran have
been making cautious overtures toward improving relations, after a
long chill. Just last month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
praised President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate who took office last
summer and who has confronted considerable resistance from
religious and other conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Albright, in a speech devoted to steps for improving
relations, also called on Iran to show evidence that it was not
trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian test tells the world about Iran's abilities, but not
its intentions, officials said. ``This is a demonstration of Iran's
perceived need to have the capability to threaten targets outside
the immediate Persian Gulf area,'' one official said. ``It's now
clear that they have the political commitment to seek that kind of
capability.''
</P>
<P>
   The test ``will not come as a big surprise to the Israelis,'' he
said, ``because they've been following Iran's missile program very
closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they know, and we know, that ability to test-fire a
missile and the ability to develop, produce and deploy a
large-scale force are two very different things. It could take
years for Iran to achieve that capability and we have to do our
best to retard that.''
</P>
<P>
   Present and former intelligence officials said the missile came
from North Korea, which has vowed to continue selling its weapons
to any nation that can provide that cash-starved regime with hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The official North Korean news agency issued a statement last
month saying that ``our missile export is aimed at obtaining
foreign money we need at present.'' U.S. intelligence officials say
millions of dollars that Iran has paid North Korean is invested in
more missile production rather than in civilian needs.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has long sought to launch a medium-range missile, and has
bought technology from Russian and China as well as North Korea.
Tehran's foremost goal, a senior administration official said, is
not to strike its enemies but to be seen as a political and
military force to be reckoned with in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some prestige element here,'' he said. ``We have long
thought that the Iranians believe that such a weapon would give
them a reach inside the region, and that they believe that it
serves their interests in terms of being a strong power in the
Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies have worked for years to track the
development of Iran's weapons programs, and have traced shipments
of technology from Russia, China and North Korea as well as
attempting to learn what local military and technological
capability Iran had developed.
</P>
<P>
   The former intelligence official said that government experts
had expected a test by Iran, although the launch was not expected
so soon. He also said that the test held political significance as
well as military meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is they purchased a very small number of these
missiles, and that this is as much a political statement as
anything, and that the statement is to Israel, and that statement
is: `You are now vulnerable. You have to take us seriously.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he doubted that the Iranians meant to be belligerent
toward the Saudis, saying ``They want to co-opt the Saudis, not
threaten them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Iranians have purchased technology for several ballistic
missile programs in parallel, buying Russian and Chinese technology
as well as North Korean technology, for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important point here is that they have very little
indigenous internal capability to make a real missile, and they've
required extensive outside technical support,'' this former
official said. ``But they've been willing to spend the money. I'd
guess the Rodong would cost $10 million,'' referring to the North
Korean missile.
</P>
<P>
   Militarily, Iran's purchase of a handful of the missiles from
North Korea does not give Tehran a major war-fighting ability, he
said. But it proves the Iranians have passed a milestone in
military technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term,'' he said, ``the missile production
assistance they've gotten from Russia and China will have the
greater impact. But the Rodongs are the attention-getters.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran has a well-established Scud missile program dating back to
the war with Iraq of the 1980s. That war, a U.S. intelligence
analyst said on Wednesday, ``gave them the experience of using
missiles as a weapon of terror, both at receiving and delivering
terror.''
</P>
<P>
   In that war both nations attacked their opponent's major cities
with short range missiles and Tehran was all but evacuated at
times. Iraq's missile capacity has been the subject of a seven-year
U.N. effort to eradicate weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that they were certain only that Wednesday's
missile test was successful, and the missile tested was similar or
perhaps identical to the Korean Rodong missile. Beyond that, they
were struggling on Wednesday night to analyze the meaning of the
test. ``Whether they fired a Rodong missile themselves or whether
they assembled a missile by reverse-engineering a Rodong _ either
way, this is a North Korean missile with another name.'' said the
senior official.
</P>
<P>
   The name Iran has give the missile, he said, is the Shahab-3.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials contend that they have had some success
in limiting Russian and Chinese military assistance to Iran. Russia
said last week it was investigating nine companies for illegally
providing weapons technology to Iran, and the United States imposed
trade restrictions on those firms.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   A Company of Her Own  
   
 By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Ann Winblad is the best-known female venture capitalist in Silicon
Valley _ and not just because she's Bill Gates ex-girlfriend.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  She's renowned as a successful and witty software advocate
who has become something of an unofficial _ and unusual _
spokeswoman for her industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although soundbite-savvy Winblad can be found on the speakers'
roster at nearly every high-tech forum in the country, she holds
herself aloof from the rest of the chummy venture capital world.
</P>
<P>
   Her firm Hummer Winblad has offices in San Francisco's South
Park _ 30 miles away from VC row at Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad said she keeps her distance partly out of fear of
alerting competitors to the nature of her deals and partly because
she eschews the herd mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eagles don't flock,'' Winblad explained. ``As Buffy the
Vampire Slayer says, `Does the word `duh' mean anything to you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Winblad is unique among high-tech financiers because her firm
invests only in software startups _ excluding other lucrative
segments of the industry, such as computer hardware, chips and
networking.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet exploded, software was a hard sell in a
Silicon Valley that worshipped hardware makers such as Apple
Computer and Silicon Graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software was the Rodney Dangerfield of the computer industry _
it got no respect,'' Winblad said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, software is a hot field and Winblad is enjoying
her time in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   She travels so much that some office-mates say they rarely see
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann who?'' asked Neil Weintraut, a venture capitalist who
shares office space with Hummer Winblad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann is so active in industry activities that she is rarely in
the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Winblad says her job as a professional speaker is secondary to
her prime mission of ``finding, funding and building'' startups
into bigger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad founded her first $35 million fund with former NBA star
John Hummer in 1991 _ and it earned a 50 percent return on the
money it initially invested.
</P>
<P>
   In total, Hummer Winblad has collected about $200 million from
pension funds and institutional investors and distributed the money
to nearly 50 startups.
</P>
<P>
   Hummer Winblad's top picks have included Berkeley Systems, the
makers of After Dark screensavers that was sold to CUC
International for $13.8 million last year, and Arbor Software, a
Sunnyvale database software firm that has doubled in market value
since it went public in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Hummer Winblad also nurtured the growth of Wind River Systems,
an Alameda firm whose stock has soared eight-fold to $36.38
yesterday from a opening of price in 1993 of $4.22, adjusted for
stock splits.
</P>
<P>
   Even if success and attitude didn't set Winblad apart, she would
stand out as a women and Midwesterner among the mostly male,
East-coast-bred venture capitalist crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad, 47, was raised in Farmington, Minn., _ a small town
with one stoplight.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of six children, she had an entrepreneurial flair at
an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad's sister Patty Jorgensen recalls that while she and her
siblings would draw pictures, Ann would sell their drawings to the
neighborhood parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember she'd be making Barbie doll clothes and selling
them and I'd beg for one,'' Jorgensen said. ``She said, `No, I'm
selling them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Winblad went to a Minnesota women's college but took all her
classes at the all-male campus nearby. She majored in business and
mathematics _ but also fell in love with computers.
</P>
<P>
   During school, she wrote computer programs for male classmates
in exchange for their girlfriends typing her papers.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation she looked for a job where she could work with
computers and landed at the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis as
a computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank was too slow-paced for Winblad.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1975 she convinced three programmer colleagues from the
bank to quit and start their own company building accounting
software.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, Open Systems, was successful enough that Winblad and
her partners sold it for $15 million in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad took her share of the money and high-tailed it to
Silicon Valley, where she worked as a consultant and started dating
Microsoft founder and CEO Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Although she and Gates were an item for three years, Winblad's
friends say she never tried to profit from the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann's success has nothing to do with Bill,'' said Seattle
consultant Jonathan Lazarus, a longtime friend of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't supply capital for her. He doesn't make contacts for
her. She doesn't depend on him for introductions, references or
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gates-Winblad duo was apparently a merger of workaholics.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has described one of his favorite trips with Winblad when
they spent a week holed up in Santa Barbara watching videos about
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched movies for hours even when it was sunny outside,''
Gates told Wired magazine in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our fun discoveries was a series of brilliant lectures
Richard Feynman gave on physics which Ann subsequently made
available to high school students.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Winblad doesn't like to talk about her
relationship with the nation's richest man, although the two are
still good friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to a lot of big dogs in this industry,'' Winblad says,
changing the subject when the topic arises.
</P>
<P>
   Gates is now married and has a daughter. Winblad has no
children, but spoils her two dogs _ both Samoyeds, or Siberian sled
dogs _ and the children of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's great with my kids, they call her Auntie Ann,'' said
longtime friend Heidi Roizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really gets far more down and dirty with my kids than you
would expect and she's a little bit Auntie Mame-ish with giving
presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Roizen, a Silicon Valley consultant, said Winblad treats her
entrepreneurs the same way: She likes to rumble with them and
shower them with money.
</P>
<P>
   When Roizen was CEO of T/ Maker, she said Winblad helped her
make a pivotal decision that turned the company around _ to get out
of the word processing software market.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't walk in one day and say, `You're going to divest
this product line,''' Roizen said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Winblad, who was a director and major investor in the
company, waited for Roizen to suggest the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once the cat was out of the bag, she really pushed me on
it,'' Roizen recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very tough but I grew a lot under her mentoring.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Banks to Offer Online Brokerage Services  
   
 By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Wells Fargo and BankAmerica are about to unveil major new online
discount brokerage services in an effort to retain current
customers and lure new ones.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After six months of quietly testing WellsTrade with a tiny
fraction of its 470,000 online banking customers, Wells will begin
widely promoting its new online product in early August. For a
$29.95 commission, customers can buy up to 1,000 shares of most
U.S. stocks.
</P>
<P>
   They will also be able to trade about 1,000 mutual funds as well
as trade stock options, get company news from PR Wire, tap Zacks
equity research and get quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have long offered investment services to their wealthiest
customers, or ``high net worth'' individuals, as they are known in
the trade. But Wells Fargo and other banks are keen on providing a
much broader spectrum of products so more customers will be content
keeping all their assets under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Wells plans to offer a variety of products to all customers
rather than keep them in separate ``silos,'' said Dennis Mooradian,
executive vice president of the Private Client Services division.
</P>
<P>
   That means offering online brokerage accounts to those with a
balance as small as $1,000, providing more comprehensive asset
management accounts to those with $10,000 and offering the services
of affiliated money managers &UR;  &LR; to those who have $100,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The product lines continue to blur as financial services
companies compete to provide one-stop shopping to their clients,''
said John Payne, an analyst with the Boston research firm Cerulli
Associates. ``Banks and investment firms increasingly are targeting
the same customers.''
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica plans to unveil its own online investment services
in September. With one ID and one password, BofA home banking
customers will be able not only to check balances and pay bills 24
hours a day but transfer funds to IRA and other investment
accounts. They will be able to buy and sell all domestic stocks and
about 1,000 mutual funds plus receive financial news and quotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online investment market is growing at a phenomenal pace,
and we think many of the 29 million households served by
BankAmerica and NationsBank will be interested,'' said BankAmerica
Interactive Banking Division Vice President Cynthia Kopec.
</P>
<P>
   The investment services subsidiary of BofA has yet to set
commissions. But Kopec said they will be ``in the Schwab ballpark''
of $29.95 per trade.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab Corp., the largest discount broker, does not seem
overly concerned by the onslaught of competition from banks,
including BofA, which owned Schwab from 1983 to 1987. Since the
beginning of the year, Schwab's online accounts have increased by a
third to 1.8 million and online customer assets shot from $80
billion to $128 billion, or 30 percent of Schwab's total.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab does not plan to lower trading commissions, said
spokesman Tom Taggart. But it does plan to provide enhanced online
features. For example, later this year Schwab is expected to offer
its customers investment research reports from other firms such as
Credit Suisse First Boston and Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Wells and BofA are hardly alone in invading the online brokerage
arena. Last October, Citigroup announced a service with commissions
as low as $19.95 per trade.
</P>
<P>
   Several other banks have forged alliances with brokerages. Last
year, Fleet Financial bought Quick &AMP; Reilly and offers its
SureTrade online service. Mellon Bank bought Pacific Brokerage
Services and Toronto Dominion bought Jack White.
</P>
<P>
   BancOne of Ohio recently teamed up with Palo Alto discount
brokerage ETrade to offer online stock trading to its customers.
First Chicago NBD offers a similar product from DLJ Direct's
discount brokerage services.
</P>
<P>
   Currently none of the top 10 online brokerages are operated by
banks, according to Cerulli Associates. But Payne sees that
changing soon.
</P>
<P>
   Partnering with banks also should bolster the revenues of online
brokerages and provide them a bit of stability. As a sign of the
industry's volatility, ETrade shares yesterday skidded $3.25 to
$28.75 on news that the second-largest online broker expects to
lose money in the next &UR;  &LR; few quarters as it spends heavily on
marketing. Meanwhile, Ameritrade shot up $8 to $45 on news that its
will be featured on America Online's personal finance site.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   New version of Intel's Celeron will arrive next month  
   
 By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
When the Edsel flopped, Ford Motor Co. dumped the name.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp., however, is sticking with Celeron, even though
reviewers panned the computer chip after it debuted in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara-based chip-maker will deliver a new version of
Celeron next month in another stab at the sub-$1,000 personal
computer market. The August arrival will put the new chips out
several months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like an impressive product,'' said Nathan
Brookwood, principal microprocessor analyst with Dataquest, a San
Jose market research firm. ``Will the initial images of Celeron as
a somewhat weak product linger and affect this one? That is a key
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Celeron marked Intel's entry into the market for PCs costing
less than $1,000, but critics said that it was a stripped-down
product that didn't deliver the speed PC users need.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that Celeron lacked Level-2 cache, a small but
vital memory feature that lets the PC easily access frequently used
information. Without the cache, the computer lagged.
</P>
<P>
   In the new versions, Intel has added the cache. The new Celerons
will also have faster clock speeds, of 300 megahertz and 330 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   Intel never actually admitted any error with the original
Celeron. Last week, when the company announced its quarterly
earnings, officials claimed that Celeron accounted for 5 percent of
Intel's shipments, and that it was one of the quickest selling
products in the company's 30-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is the world's largest chipmaker, producing the brains for
more than 80 percent of PCs sold today. But rivals AMD and National
Semiconductor dealt a blow to Intel by pioneering chips for
sub-$1,000 PCs, which consumers have been snapping up over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, Intel announced a $24 million investment in Evans
&AMP; Sutherland, a Utah-based maker of graphics hardware. The deal
gives Intel an 8 percent nonvoting stake in the company, with
options to go to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The investment is Intel's latest push into the graphics market.
``The goal is to make high-end graphics as widely available to
workstation users as possible,'' said Intel spokesman Robert
Manetta.

 300 Lawyers Tackle UCC, the Ten Commandments of Business   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The law will try to catch up with the software business tomorrow,
when 300 lawyers begin a week-long debate about revising the
Uniform Commercial Code.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The UCC is the Ten Commandments of business. When contract
disputes arise, judges open the UCC to find who shalt or shalt not.
</P>
<P>
   Revising the fine print of this tome sounds boring. But the
proposals governing software licenses, under the heading UCC
2B,have provoked a huge legal brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups want 2B to include warranties. The industry
would rather it not. Database firms want legal protections akin to
copyrights. Movie studios want to be left out. Corporate software
buyers and financial lessors each have axes to grind.
</P>
<P>
   What fascinates me is the realization that for years, the
software industry has, in essence, been making up the rules as it
goes along.
</P>
<P>
   These rules are the licensing agreements inside software boxes,
and rarely do they cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But when disputes do arise _ say, a corporation sues a supplier
_ no one's been able to point to chapter or verse in the UCC to
check if the license conforms to the law.
</P>
<P>
   The keeper of the sacred code is the National Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, a group of 300 lawyers
appointed by the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting that opens tomorrow in Cleveland is another step in
the process of drafting a model 2B code, which the state
legislatures will, eventually, write into law.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got the time and the frequent-flyer miles, jet to
Cleveland and join in the hair-splitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is open to all,'' said Napa attorney Carol Kunze.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can do like me, and visit Kunze's Web site  &LR; (www.Sof &LR; 
 &LR; twareIndustry.org/issues/guide &LR; ) _ and pray that all these legal
Johnny-come-latelys don't screw up an industry that works.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Cramer vs. Kramer: &LR;  Jim Cramer is the feisty co-founder of
TheStreet.com, a Web-based financial news service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kramer is the pugnacious CEO of CBS MarketWatch.com, a
rival outfit in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In their battle for eyeballs, the East Coast Cramer struck a
blow today. He announced that a team of editorial commandos have
parachuted into TheStreet's San Francisco office, to join bureau
chief Cory Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The new Street people are: Kevin Kelleher, formerly of Wired
News; Suzanne Galante, an ex-C/Net scribe; Marcy Burstiner, a
veteran San Francisco business reporter; Medora Lee, an import from
Reuters in London; and Jeff Hoffman, a free-lancer.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his command bunker on Wall Street, Cramer took a
friendly jab at his West Coast rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell that other Kramer he's on the wrong coast,'' Cramer said.
``If they're going to cover the street, last time I looked it was
Wall, not Montgomery.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, San Francisco's Kramer replied. CBS
MarketWatch already has offices in New York, Washington, D.C., Los
Angeles and soon it will be in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think being based in New York City actually distorts
reality,'' Kramer said. ``You have to be there, no question, and we
are. But you have to keep a clear head and stay in touch with the
new reality, and it's easier to do that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the home-boy added, ``What does that guy know? He can't
even spell his own name.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Word games? &LR;  Netscape says the beta version of its new browser
just tries to simplify Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   But online columnist Dave Winer says Netscape is trying to
hijack domain names like his,  &LR; www.scripting.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The fuss revolves around a feature in Communicator 4.5 that lets
people type in plain words, like United Airlines, instead of URLs
like www.ual.com.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape calls this ``Smart Browsing.'' Product manager Ken
Hickman said Netscape is imitating America Online, where users can
type in a keyword, like money or news, and be taken to a financial
or news page _ without having to plow through a search engine or
remember a URL.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape didn't do this just to be nice. It plans to sell key
words one day. Say a cruise line bought ``Caribbean Contest.'' Web
surfers who typed the words into their Netscape browser would be
taken to the ship's home page.
</P>
<P>
   Winer praised this notion in a May 30 column. But that was
before Netscape shipped the 4.5 beta, and he typed in
``scripting,'' and was taken, not to his Web page, but to a list of
scripting resources compiled by Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Now he insists that Netscape's Smart Browser should take people
directly to his registered domain.
</P>
<P>
   But Netscape's new browser has the legal smarts to tell a
generic word, like scripting, from a trademark like Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Generics can be domain names. But they lack the legal
protections of trademarks. So Netscape thinks it can do anything
with generics _ even sell them as a key word.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned 'cause this could get interesting. Netscape could
decide tomorrow to sell ``news'' as a key word _ miffing online
powerhouse C/Net, which use news.com as its domain name.
</P>

ROBERT YOUNG, 91, ACTOR KNOWN FOR WHOLESOME TV IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (inserts new graf after 4th graf to mention Young was alcoholic and
attended AA meetings during `Father'; deletes now-repetitive AA
reference from 20th graf)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Wash.)  (bl) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Robert Young, an actor who created solid, wholesome,
common-sense characters on television in ``Father Knows Best'' and
``Marcus Welby, M.D.'' while privately battling some personal
demons, died Tuesday night at his home in Westlake Village, a Los
Angeles suburb. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   After a prolific career as a dependable film actor during
Hollywood's golden age in the 1930s and '40s, he went on to even
greater success in the two long-running television shows that were
among the most popular of their respective decades.
</P>
<P>
   Young's television roles were built on integrity, clarity and
kindness. Although ``Father Knows Best,'' which Young originated on
NBC radio in 1949, was a classically wholesome and idealized
portrait of family life in the Midwest, circa the 1950s and early
'60s, Young insisted that the character he played, Jim Anderson,
should be more realistic than other sitcom dads, who were often
dimwitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be the father, but not a boob,'' he told a
producer friend during the process of developing the radio show. He
and the show's creators sought to portray ``what we thought would
be representative of a middle-class American family, if there was
such a thing,'' Young once recalled. ``There probably isn't, but
that was what we were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's portrayal of a strong and humorous father with no
serious problems was all the more remarkable because he was
privately battling personal demons, including alcoholism. He
attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings during the making of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour show had its television debut in 1954. The
program, in which Jim Anderson, his wife, Margaret, played by Jane
Wyatt _ Young was the only member of the radio cast who made the
transition to television _ had three children, was not particularly
successful, and CBS canceled it in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   But so many viewers demanded that it be reinstated, and urged
that it move from 10 p.m. to an earlier time slot so that the whole
family could watch, that NBC picked it up the following season and
showed it at 8:30, initially on Wednesdays. The show prospered on
NBC and then back at CBS. In its 1959-60 season, its last with
original episodes, ``Father Knows Best'' had its most successful
year, ranking sixth among all television shows. Successful reruns
followed on CBS and ABC until 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Young ``never had any problems about being a prima donna,''
Billy Gray, who played the son, Bud, on the show said Wednesday.
``He was very generous as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Father Knows Best'' ceased production, Young said he had
tired of the role and wanted to move on. Like ``Seinfeld,'' it was
one of the rare cases in the history of television when production
of a series ceased at the peak of its popularity. Young himself
always defended the program but seemed fully aware of its
white-bread style and shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Adding subplots about illness or drugs or serious problems, he
once said, ``would have been like taking a beautiful painting and
obliterating it with black paint _ and that really would have
turned the audience off.'' He added, ``We never intended the series
to be more than a weekly half-hour of fun and entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief semi-retirement, which Young said he loathed _
``When anyone says `retire,' I say `retire to what?''' he once said
_ he was cast in 1969 as Marcus Welby, a Santa Monica general
practitioner who involved himself in the lives of his patients.
</P>
<P>
   Former NBC chairman Grant Tinker, who in 1969 was a television
executive at Universal Studios (which produced ``Marcus Welby,
M.D.''), recalled in an interview that Ralph Bellamy was set to
play the role. ``Robert Young suddenly appeared and was sitting in
my office,'' Tinker said. ``Someone had gotten him the pilot
script. His opening words to me were, `I want to be Marcus
Welby.''' Young got the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very sympathetic quality to Young as an actor,''
Tinker said. ``You can easily confuse him with a kindly doctor. He
was also a guy who had a backbone. He was very determined.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour show, with James Brolin as his youthful medical
sidekick, had its premiere on Sept. 23, 1969, and was an instant
success. It became the biggest hit in the history of the ABC
network up to that time. Part of its initial success was that the
competition was weak because CBS and NBC opposed it with news
documentary programs. But viewers clearly adored the show and
remained faithful to it against stronger competition in later
years. The show's last telecast was in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show itself, unlike ``Father Knows Best,'' dealt
with serious problems like autism, blindness, LSD side effects,
drug addiction and leukemia, Marcus Welby himself was something of
a fantasy doctor who took a deeply personal approach to all of his
patients. He treated not only physical ailments but the fears and
family issues of each person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's understanding and dedicated,'' Young once said of Marcus
Welby. ``These are words that for some reason have fallen into
disuse. I knew from the start that I had to come back and play this
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who won two Emmys for ``Father Knows Best,'' won a third
for ``Welby.'' He was also held in esteem by medical groups.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the characters he played and his public image, Young was
a complex and, in many ways, troubled figure.
</P>
<P>
   He was married to the same woman for more than 60 years. Young
was 17, and in high school, when he met Elizabeth Louise Henderson,
who was 14. They married in 1933. She died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Young is survived by their four daughters, Betty Lou Gleason,
Carol Proffitt, Barbara Beebe and Kathy Young. He also had six
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But his life was sometimes difficult. He had a history of
alcoholism and depression. In 1991, at 83, he tried to commit
suicide by running a hose from his car's exhaust pipe to the
interior of the vehicle. The attempt failed because the battery was
dead and the car wouldn't start.
</P>
<P>
   Young later admitted that he had been drinking when he asked his
wife to enter into a suicide pact with him and then tried to take
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the son of an Irish immigrant building manufacturer, was
born in Chicago on Feb. 22, 1907, the fourth of five children. The
family moved to Seattle and then Los Angeles when he was a boy.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Young wanted to be an actor. He took part in
high school dramatics and, after graduation, studied and acted at
night at the Pasadena Community Playhouse. He worked part-time as,
among other jobs, a drugstore clerk and loan collector.
</P>
<P>
   His theater work and good looks stirred Hollywood's interest in
1931, and a screen test brought his first role in ``The Black
Camel,'' a Charlie Chan mystery. Signed by MGM, Young soon appeared
in an extraordinary number of films in the early 1930s _ in the
course of four years he appeared in 24 pictures, playing serious
roles in many of them.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in such films as ``The Sin of Madelon Claudet''
(with Helen Hayes), ``Hell Divers,'' ``Strange Interlude,''
``Tugboat Annie,'' ``The House of Rothschild'' and ``Today We
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Young forged a career not so much as a top movie star,
in the vein of Clark Gable or Gary Cooper, but as a dependable
actor whom audiences enjoyed watching. His co-stars included Greta
Garbo, Joan Crawford, Myrna Loy, Katharine Hepburn, Greer Garson,
Norma Shearer and Jean Harlow.
</P>
<P>
   Among his most noted pictures at MGM were ``Three Comrades'' and
``The Shining Hour'' (both made in 1938), ``Northwest Passage''
(1940) and two 1942 features, ``Joe Smith, American'' and ``Journey
for Margaret,'' in which he played a war correspondent who
befriends a British orphan. The film made Margaret O'Brien, who
played the orphan, a star.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most memorable performance was in RKO's 1945 love
story ``The Enchanted Cottage,'' in which young played a
battle-scarred war veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics said Young's later films were some of his best,
including ``Claudia'' (1943), ``Those Endearing Young Charms''
(1945), ``Crossfire'' (1947), ``Sitting Pretty'' (1948) and
``Goodbye, My Fancy'' (1951).
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a plodder,'' Young once said. ``My career never had any
great peaks. But producers and directors knew I was reliable. So
when they couldn't really get the big stars, they'd say, `Let's get
Bob.' As a result I always kept working, each time a little
higher.''

William Hermanek, with some of his 1,800 beauties. There's an
indescribable quality that radiates from old tools. You sense it in
the hand-worn patina of rosewood knobs and grips, the chiaroscuro
of glinting brass levers under darkened steel. But they are mute
until you touch them. Then they won't shut up. Pick up an old tool,
and you almost hear the ticking hours of its long working life.
Such tools can be time machines, portals to a yesteryear farther
away than the moon. (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo) *LITE

SPANISH DIGITAL TV SERVICES TO MERGE AFTER COSTLY FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Spain's two digital satellite television
services, one backed by Grupo Prisa, the nation's largest private
media company, and the other by the government, have announced
plans to merge, moving to end a yearlong bare-knuckles battle that
spilled into national politics.
</P>
<P>
   The two services _ Canal Satelite, owned by Grupo Prisa's
Sogecable unit, and Via Digital, owned by Telefonica, the former
state telecommunications company _ did not disclose the terms of
their agreement in a brief statement on Tuesday, but pledged to
conclude the deal by Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marks a truce to a bitter battle for Spain's
nascent market for digital television, which offers additional
channels and pay-per-view movies.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 subscribers have signed up with Canal Satelite
since January 1997. Via Digital, the government-backed competitor,
reported nearly 300,000 subscribers since it started last
September.
</P>
<P>
   The two rivals have sharply cut prices to attract subscribers,
and company officials said the services had each lost about $92
million last year but had expected to break even, on their own, by
the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts predicted that Jesus de Polanco, the
Grupo Prisa chairman, whose satellite television service has rights
to Spanish professional soccer matches and movies, would call the
shots in the new single provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very surprised if it wasn't going to be run by the
Soge-cable side,'' said Neil Blackley, an analyst with Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. in London.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
late in 1996 helped organize a satellite television consortium,
including the newly privatized Telefonica and the state-owned
broadcaster Television Espanola, to compete with Polanco's planned
service.
</P>
<P>
   The battle immediately took on a political dimension. Grupo
Prisa's newspaper, radio and television holdings, including the
biggest paper in Spain, El Pais, had grown considerably in size and
influence under the previous Socialist administration.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, parliament approved a law that essentially
outlawed Canal Satelite's transmission technology. The company
appealed to the European Commission and won the right to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, a Madrid court investigated charges of financial
improprieties at Grupo Prisa's Soge-cable and for a time Polanco
was prohibited from leaving Spain without court permission.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was later shelved for lack of evidence, and
the presiding judge in the case has been suspended from duty while
the Supreme Court investigates Soge-cable's accusations of official
breach of duty during the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Arias Salgado, Spain's minister of development, said
Wednesday that the agreement between the competitors should benefit
the subscribers, but he added, ``The government does not take an
official position on the preliminary accord because it's a free
market and business agreements are made freely.''

MAN IDENTIFIED AS RAPIST ADMITS N.H. ASSAULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding; attn.: Ireland, Netherlands)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an emotional transatlantic telephone interview Wednesday
night, a man who identified himself as convicted Nashua, N.H.
rapist and fugitive Steven Gordon confessed to the Globe that he
raped three women in New Hampshire in the past 2 1/2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it,'' he said. ``I did it ... I need to take
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he was staying at a Christian youth hostel in
Amsterdam and had felt unable to control his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't about sex,'' he said. ``I just feel myself doing it,
and then afterwards ...'' His voice trailed off.
</P>
<P>
   Police have named Gordon, a Massachusetts native, as a suspect
in the rape and beating of two Irish women in Hampton Beach, N.H.
last Saturday, and were investigating him in connection with the
July 7 rape of a Nashua realty agent in Mancheste, N.Hr.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Globe had no way of independently verifying that
the man on the phone was Gordon, he did know information that has
not been made public, including the name of the realty agent who
was raped.
</P>
<P>
   For his victims, Gordon had these words: ``I'm really sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon allegedly raped the realty agent at gunpoint while she
was showing him a property. The victim said the rapist told her he
picked her out of a glossy booklet that included her photograph
next to her property listings.
</P>
<P>
   In the phone conversation Wednesday, Gordon confirmed that he
picked the woman out of the booklet, and he felt bad about the rape
because ``she was a really nice lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe talked to Gordon from the Boston-area home of a close
relative, who asked not to be identified. A harried and sleepy
Gordon said he was hiding at the youth hostel, afraid to turn
himself in because ``they will kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lost in Europe,'' he said. He spoke for about 20 minutes
and did not seem to want to end the conversation. He said he
originally planned to flee to Israel, but probably will not now.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the phone conversation, a worker at the youth
hostel said Gordon left about 1 a.m. Amsterdam time, saying he was
going to surrender to local police. He had not done so as this
story was being prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 28, was paroled and placed on probation 13 months ago
from New Hampshire State Prison after serving 3 1/2 years for the
1992 rape of a teacher at New Hampshire Technical College, where he
once attended school. He was released after a judge deferred the
balance of his sentence and ordered him to attend a treatment
program for sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, Gordon said he did have counseling and met
with a probation officer weekly, but was not forthcoming with his
counselor about his own concerns about his mental state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to go to counseling,'' he said. But ``I didn't tell
them everything. I was afraid to tell them. I was afraid they would
tell my probation officer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gordon's relative, the latest allegations have caused
heartbreak and concern. They say he is a young man whose childhood
was filled with the trauma of mental illness and the death of his
father when he was a year old.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, if they are going to catch him, I hope he takes
his life,'' the relative said, tears streaming down her face.
</P>
<P>
   She said Gordon has relied on the antidepressant Lithium and
other medications to stabilize his moods since he was 12 years old.
Gordon also said he was hospitalized in a Massachusetts mental ward
for children.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a doctor suggested that Gordon begin taking another
antidepressant, Zoloft, to help him cope with anxiety, one of his
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   The relative showed off a stone cup that Gordon painted with
bright colors as a youth. ``He's very artistic,'' she said, her
hands running along the cup.
</P>
<P>
   When he got depressed as a youth, before he was on medication,
the relative said Gordon would withdraw. When his mood elevated, he
was quick to get angry, she said: ``He gets very easily agitated.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gordon and his relatives agreed that his latest problems
started when he was fired from a factory job about three weeks ago
and could no longer afford his medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he was monitoring news accounts of the rapes and the
police search for him on the Internet, and had read the Globe's
article on the rapes on the newspaper's Website.
</P>
<P>
   He said he used a pellet gun to commit the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to news reports, he said, he did not order the two
Irish women at gunpoint into his rental car. According to his
version of the story, the women voluntarily got into his car after
asking for a ride to a nearby party. They had been drinking and
dozed off, he said; he then drove to a cemetery where he pulled out
the pellet gun and raped them.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to escape from the cemetery, Gordon crashed the car
into a headstone, panicked, and ran away. He later contacted a
friend to drive him to Logan International Airport in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   There, he plunked down $413 for a ticket to Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for a motive, Gordon said only, ``I snapped and I did
all these things that didn't make sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed sympathy for the judge who commuted his
sentence in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge is going to take heat for this,'' he said.

HOUSE PANEL WITHDRAWS BILL FOR $12 BILLION TO HELP IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, La., Calif.)  (th) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Republicans in disarray, a House panel
Wednesday withdrew from its agenda a foreign spending bill that
would have provided money for the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The move, by the Appropriations Committee, could delay until the
end of September the replenishing of the fund's reserves, which
financial crises in Asia and Russia have depleted.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told reporters Wednesday that an
infusion of American money to the fund was imperative and that in
the end he expected that the House would approve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are sufficient votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But until then, the Clinton administration said, the House was
putting American farmers and other workers in danger because
worldwide demand for their exports was falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see new evidence every week that the crisis in Asia poses a
threat to the American economy,'' said Howard Schloss, a spokesman
for Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that a
delay could be risky, especially if Congress were out of town. ``If
a crisis were to arise it would be very difficult to address
expeditiously,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is planning a monthlong recess beginning Aug. 7 and
plans to adjourn in early October so that lawmakers can campaign
full time.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already approved the administration's request for
$18 billion for the fund. The House appeared last week to have been
set on the same course, especially after Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas,
who is the majority leader and a strong foe of the IMF, conceded
that supporters probably had the votes.
</P>
<P>
   But his apparent acquiescence riled House conservatives, and on
Monday, Armey reversed himself, vowing a floor fight to block the
$18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   His reversal is a symptom of the struggle for leadership of the
House between Armey and Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., who is
chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Both men want to be
speaker in the event that Newt Gingrich vacates the job to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Armey and Livingston are locked in a fierce ideological battle
behind the scenes for the support of individual House Republicans.
Both are raising money from members and funneling it to the
election campaigns of others. And both are trying to be responsive
to the political needs of each member.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's strength lies in his kinship with the most conservative
members, those who coincidentally most strongly oppose U.S.
involvement in the IMF. Livingston, who supports giving money to
the fund, has been building alliances with businesses, many of
which are nervous that the Asian economic turmoil could soon reach
home.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's committee had been set Wednesday to approve the
$12.6 billion foreign-spending bill for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1. The Foreign Operations Subcommittee had approved $3.4
billion for the fund, with the expectation that the full $18
billion would be added when the bill reached the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of Armey's change of heart, Livingston and Gingrich
agreed late Tuesday to drop the entire foreign operations bill for
now, and the Appropriations Committee did not bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who support the fund were irked that action was
delayed, but were nonetheless amused that the Republicans were so
publicly divided.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the top Democrat on the Foreign
Operations Subcommittee, said Armey was acting like a whirling
dervish, but said she expected the money to be approved
eventually. &QL;

   GAITHERSBURG, Md. _ This was what he missed the most, politicos
and everyday people sitting around a place like Faye's Family
Restaurant here, exchanging views, debating the issues of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the happiest I've been in three and a half years,''
William Donald Schaefer said after excusing himself from a table
that included the Montgomery County executive, the mayor of
Gaithersburg and other local officials. ``It's just as if I never
left.''
</P>
<P>
   As mayor of Baltimore for 16 years through 1987 and then
governor of Maryland for eight years before term limits forced him
to retire, Schaefer defined an era of politics for his focus on
economic development and the incessant boosterism of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   He was brash, unpredictable, often audacious. Funny hats were
his trademark but not his only way to make a point. He once
responded to criticism from a taxpayer by writing a letter, saying,
``I'm glad you have recovered from your lobotomy.'' To promote the
opening of the National Aquarium in Baltimore in 1981, he put on an
old-fashioned swimsuit and jumped into the seal pool, clutching a
rubber duck.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement lowered his volume and profile, confining him to the
quiet of college classrooms, where he taught government, and an
office at a Baltimore law firm, where he served as a consultant. He
never figured to enter public life again.
</P>
<P>
   Then Louis Goldstein, the state comptroller for 40 years, died
of a heart attack on July 3. The filing deadline for entering the
November election to succeed him was three days away. Schaefer, 76,
saw a rubber duck in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're in politics, it never gets out of your blood,'' he
said as the lunchtime crowd in Faye's swelled to several dozen,
including people who just wanted to shake his hand and welcome him
back. ``As a true politician, you never lose it. And if you think
I'm not going to wear my little hats and do things, just remember,
what you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer's decision to seek the state's third-highest office has
already given this year's election campaign in Maryland a jolt of
energy that could reap big dividends for the state Democratic
party.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Goldstein's death, in-fighting had begun dividing
party loyalties, leaving Parris Glendening one of the few incumbent
governors seeking re-election in jeopardy. In 1994, Glendening
prevailed by winning only three of the state's voting districts _
Baltimore City, Prince George's County and Montgomery Country _ and
in recent weeks leaders of two of them have broken with him.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, who succeeded Schaefer, and the
Prince George's county executive, Wayne Curry, have endorsed
Glendening's chief rival in the Democratic primary, Eileen
Rehrmann, the Harford county executive.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening is expected to survive the primary, but the general
election could be difficult. His likely Republican opponent, Ellen
Sauerbrey, was defeated by fewer than 6,000 votes four years ago
and has campaigned hard this year in the three districts she lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could help stimulate some turnout,'' Eric Uslander, a
professor of political science at the University of Maryland, said
of Schaefer's potential benefit to the Democrats. ``There really
isn't anyone else who has his presence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After Goldstein died, 11 other Democrats and seven Republicans
filed to run for comptroller, who is the state tax collector. After
Schaefer confirmed he was in the race to stay, five Democrats,
including Michael Barnes, a former congressman whom Glendening
appointed to serve out Goldstein's term, and one Republican dropped
out.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat who stayed in is Joan Pratt, 46, the comptroller of
Baltimore since 1995. She bristles at the notion that Schaefer's
decision to run for office again might be fueled by his boredom
with retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for a new generation,'' Ms. Pratt said. ``Maryland
needs leadership that thinks differently from someone who has been
in public service for 35 years.''
</P>
<P>
   She also raised an issue that might concern some voters, that a
politician with such a strong personality as Schaefer's might not
be satisfied playing a secondary role to a governor with whom he
has occasionally differed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the lines could be blurred. After Schaefer agreed to
take questions here Wednesday from reporters representing community
newspapers, they asked about Montgomery County's pension plan and a
proposed highway linking Montgomery and Prince George's County,
concerns better suited for a governor to address, not a
comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer said he was sensitive to his relationship with
Glendening and the perception that, if elected as comptroller, he
would wiggle his way into policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have my job; he has his,'' Schaefer said. ``He does the
policy work. I do income tax and revenue estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as comptroller, who also serves with the governor and state
treasurer on the Board of Public Works, he would have considerable
influence over important financial decisions that affect localities
throughout Maryland. The board approves all contracts involving the
state, and one negative vote can veto a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who helped steer Maryland to a top bond rating for
the last 25 years, was a notorious stickler for detail. His
objections often saved the state millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The former comptroller ran his office so well that after Barnes
declined the interim appointment, Glendening felt comfortable
enough to promote Goldstein's deputy, Robert Swann, who agreed to
serve through the election.
</P>
<P>
   That was fine with Schaefer, who had no interest on an interim
basis even if it meant that he could run as an incumbent. He said
he wanted to spend time traveling around the state, schmoozing with
local officials to reacquaint himself with topical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, he has no intention of making wholesale
changes in the comptroller's office, saying, ``I'm not going to fix
something that's not broken. The dumbest thing in the world is to
get rid of career employees who know their business.''
</P>
<P>
   A smooth-working comptroller's office would not only serve the
state well, but also Schaefer. As he noted here Wednesday, it would
give him more time to wear funny hats, visit places like Faye's and
schmooze.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some voters may wonder whether Schaefer can temper his
exuberance in such close proximity to power he held for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the 800-pound gorilla,'' Uslander said. ``Nobody really
knows to what extent he will try to shape state policy. He says
there is only one governor, but he was such a powerful force that
it might be tough to hold him to that.''

JUDGE RULES SPEECH BY KING IS THE PUBLIC'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a setback for the family of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., a federal judge ruled Wednesday that his famous
``I have a dream'' speech belongs to the public, and that CBS has
not been guilty of copyright infringement by reproducing it for a
documentary series.
</P>
<P>
   King's speech on Aug. 28, 1963, before some 200,000 people at a
civil rights rally in front of the Lincoln Memorial ``was made
available to members of the public at large without regard to who
they were or what they proposed to do with it,'' Judge William C.
O'Kelley ruled in federal district court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, O'Kelley held, the civil rights leader in effect gave his
words to history in a way that a playwright, say, does not
surrender his words just because his work is performed before huge
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Beck, the Atlanta lawyer who represents the estate of
King, said Wednesday night, ``We are studying the opinion and
likely will appeal.'' If there is an appeal, it would be heard by
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, a lawyer for CBS, called the ruling ``a
significant victory for the public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion makes plain that in circumstances in which a
public figure speaks in the most public way on matters of enormous
significance, that the speech is not the private property of anyone
but the property of all,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Heyward, the CBS president who is vacationing in France,
issued a statement that said: ``We took on this case to protect the
public's right to know about major events of historical
significance. This decision means that Dr. King's landmark speech
is truly in the public domain, where it belongs. It is not just CBS
News but the American public that won today.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, CBS signed a contract with the Arts and Entertainment
Network to produce a series titled ``The 20th Century With Mike
Wallace.'' One segment contained film coverage of the speech and
included some 60 percent of the words.
</P>
<P>
   King's speech, in which he envisioned a United States no longer
torn by racial hatred, has been widely recognized as one of the
most important events in recent American history.

MAN IDENTIFIED AS RAPIST ADMITS N.H. ASSAULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding; attn.: Ireland, Netherlands)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an emotional transatlantic telephone interview Wednesday
night, a man who identified himself as convicted Nashua, N.H.
rapist and fugitive Steven Gordon confessed to the Globe that he
raped three women in New Hampshire in the past 2 1/2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it,'' he said. ``I did it ... I need to take
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he was staying at a Christian youth hostel in
Amsterdam and had felt unable to control his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't about sex,'' he said. ``I just feel myself doing it,
and then afterwards ...'' His voice trailed off.
</P>
<P>
   Police have named Gordon, a Massachusetts native, as a suspect
in the rape and beating of two Irish women in Hampton Beach, N.H.
last Saturday, and were investigating him in connection with the
July 7 rape of a Nashua realty agent in Mancheste, N.Hr.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Globe had no way of independently verifying that
the man on the phone was Gordon, he did know information that has
not been made public, including the name of the realty agent who
was raped.
</P>
<P>
   For his victims, Gordon had these words: ``I'm really sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon allegedly raped the realty agent at gunpoint while she
was showing him a property. The victim said the rapist told her he
picked her out of a glossy booklet that included her photograph
next to her property listings.
</P>
<P>
   In the phone conversation Wednesday, Gordon confirmed that he
picked the woman out of the booklet, and he felt bad about the rape
because ``she was a really nice lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe talked to Gordon from the Boston-area home of a close
relative, who asked not to be identified. A harried and sleepy
Gordon said he was hiding at the youth hostel, afraid to turn
himself in because ``they will kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lost in Europe,'' he said. He spoke for about 20 minutes
and did not seem to want to end the conversation. He said he
originally planned to flee to Israel, but probably will not now.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the phone conversation, a worker at the youth
hostel said Gordon left about 1 a.m. Amsterdam time, saying he was
going to surrender to local police. He had not done so as this
story was being prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 28, was paroled and placed on probation 13 months ago
from New Hampshire State Prison after serving 3 1/2 years for the
1992 rape of a teacher at New Hampshire Technical College, where he
once attended school. He was released after a judge deferred the
balance of his sentence and ordered him to attend a treatment
program for sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, Gordon said he did have counseling and met
with a probation officer weekly, but was not forthcoming with his
counselor about his own concerns about his mental state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to go to counseling,'' he said. But ``I didn't tell
them everything. I was afraid to tell them. I was afraid they would
tell my probation officer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gordon's relative, the latest allegations have caused
heartbreak and concern. They say he is a young man whose childhood
was filled with the trauma of mental illness and the death of his
father when he was a year old.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, if they are going to catch him, I hope he takes
his life,'' the relative said, tears streaming down her face.
</P>
<P>
   She said Gordon has relied on the antidepressant Lithium and
other medications to stabilize his moods since he was 12 years old.
Gordon also said he was hospitalized in a Massachusetts mental ward
for children.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a doctor suggested that Gordon begin taking another
antidepressant, Zoloft, to help him cope with anxiety, one of his
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   The relative showed off a stone cup that Gordon painted with
bright colors as a youth. ``He's very artistic,'' she said, her
hands running along the cup.
</P>
<P>
   When he got depressed as a youth, before he was on medication,
the relative said Gordon would withdraw. When his mood elevated, he
was quick to get angry, she said: ``He gets very easily agitated.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gordon and his relatives agreed that his latest problems
started when he was fired from a factory job about three weeks ago
and could no longer afford his medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he was monitoring news accounts of the rapes and the
police search for him on the Internet, and had read the Globe's
article on the rapes on the newspaper's Website.
</P>
<P>
   He said he used a pellet gun to commit the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to news reports, he said, he did not order the two
Irish women at gunpoint into his rental car. According to his
version of the story, the women voluntarily got into his car after
asking for a ride to a nearby party. They had been drinking and
dozed off, he said; he then drove to a cemetery where he pulled out
the pellet gun and raped them.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to escape from the cemetery, Gordon crashed the car
into a headstone, panicked, and ran away. He later contacted a
friend to drive him to Logan International Airport in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   There, he plunked down $413 for a ticket to Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for a motive, Gordon said only, ``I snapped and I did
all these things that didn't make sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed sympathy for the judge who commuted his
sentence in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge is going to take heat for this,'' he said.

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When William Gould IV left his prestigious perch as
a professor at the Stanford University Law School four years ago to
head the National Labor Relations Board, he was confident that as
one of the United States' foremost authorities on labor law, he
could restore the board's luster.
</P>
<P>
   But Gould recently left Washington, a bitter figure, frustrated
that he had accomplished far less than he had hoped, and widely
accused of having politicized the board and antagonized Congress as
well as his fellow board members.
</P>
<P>
   Gould originally said he hoped he would be remembered for
pushing the board back toward the center after its rightward swing
in the Reagan-Bush years. But he is more likely to be remembered
for warring with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, 62, insists that many congressional Republicans have
improperly pressured and even bullied his theoretically independent
agency. But many Republican lawmakers assert that he invited such
meddling by pushing the board leftward and by doing something rare
for the chairman of a quasijudicial agency: speaking out on pending
legislation and often clashing with Republican positions.
</P>
<P>
   The labor board, which has five members, plays the highly
sensitive role of referee in the nation's labor disputes, blowing
the whistle when managers or unions break the rules in organizing
drives or contract disputes. Republican presidents usually appoint
board members who tilt toward management, while Democratic
presidents typically name members who lean toward labor.
</P>
<P>
   Gould's pro-labor tilt has irked many Republicans, and their
anger has been stoked further by his outspokenness and his refusal
to bend to Congress' demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just an unabashedly enthusiastic supporter of the labor
movement,'' said Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., who heads the House
Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations. ``He is just so
enthusiastic about it that he has unfortunately avoided neutrality.
It's just antithetical to his nature. I'd give him an `A' for
enthusiasm and an `F' for judicial discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in his office, Gould suggested that it was
Congress that deserved the ``F'' for discretion, accusing it of
``rank interference'' with the board's independence. He had an aide
pull out a dozen letters in which members of Congress went to bat
for their corporate friends, for instance pressuring the board to
take one company's settlement offer more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a dispute with a neighbor,'' Gould said, ``and
your neighbor has a powerful friend who is a judge and the neighbor
is able to lobby the judge who is deciding the case, I think most
of us think this smacks of societies that we would call autocratic
or authoritarian or third-worldish.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould, who said he was returning to California even though his
term does not end until Aug. 27, seemed eager to fire some final
rounds in his war with Congress. Point by point, he castigated
Congress for meddling in the board's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans repeatedly fought the board's aggressive
policy of seeking to reduce delays by seeking emergency injunctions
against companies for actions like illegally dismissing pro-union
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress barred the board from adopting a proposed rule that
would have sped the unionization of fast-food restaurants. (The
rule said a bargaining unit should generally consist of workers at
a single restaurant rather than a group of restaurants in a chain.)
And Congress cut the board's budget by 2 percent in 1995 and froze
its budget for the last two years, forcing the board to reduce its
staff and thus increasing delays in processing cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House Republicans who are the driving force behind the
board's budget cuts want to render us ineffective,'' Gould said.
``There isn't any doubt that Congress is trying to punish the board
because the board stands behind a statute that gives workers the
opportunity to help shape their own employment relationship,'' a
reference to the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 that set
rules for collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, who frequently mentions the fact that one of his
great-grandfathers was a slave in the old South, ridiculed
Republicans' assertions that he is a tool of the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in anyone's pocket,'' he said. ``I am my own man, and
I march to my own drummer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould's allies say he was no more pro-labor than past Democratic
chairmen, asserting that he was a victim of the heightened partisan
sniping that has characterized Washington in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans scoff at Gould when he suggests that
he is a neutral umpire. They say he has thrown any pretense of
neutrality overboard by endorsing or opposing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked a Republican-sponsored bill that would let companies
set up management-chosen committees of employees that would discuss
working conditions. And he opposed the California referendum, voted
down in June, that would have barred unions from spending members'
dues on politics without the members' permission.
</P>
<P>
   Some business advocates welcomed Gould's outspokenness because
it made him a lightning rod and fueled Republican efforts to
hamstring the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speaking out gave people who are concerned about the
board's agenda an easy handle to criticize the board,'' said Randel
Johnson, vice president for labor policy at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. ``One might say you can get more done as a bureaucrat by
keeping quiet and pursuing your agenda, rather than bragging about
what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although even some Democratic allies called Gould unwise for
speaking out on pending legislation, he asserted, ``It is my
obligation to speak out.'' He added: ``If I as chairman, with my
experience in this arena as a law professor, lawyer and arbitrator,
am not competent to speak out, who in the world is? What is the
alternative? It's to bow down submissively and allow others to win
the day on these critical issues that affect my agency and the
National Labor Relations Act, about which I care so deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould is frustrated about another part of his legacy: The board
has not issued decisions in many important cases where he is eager
to leave an imprint. He asserted that several board members
evidently wanted to delay issuing decisions until after his term
ended, in hopes that his position would no longer command a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of very big cases pending that we should have
dealt with years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members, who insisted on anonymity, asserted that
they were not dragging their feet, explaining that they were bogged
down with hundreds of cases and that they were focusing on the
decisions they thought most important, not necessarily the ones
Gould deemed important. Former board members as well as several
labor lawyers said Gould's forceful personality had alienated other
board members, often making it hard for him to forge a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have repeatedly attacked Gould for having delayed
long-awaited decisions to spell out the rights of union members not
to have their dues spent on politics. But Gould insisted that other
members, not he, were holding up those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some board members simply will not act on certain cases,'' he
said. ``I'm concerned because of my legacy. Indolence and
indecision are being used to thwart the issuance of leading cases,
which include my policy ideas.''

ZAMORA DECLINES TO TESTIFY
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
By Robert Tharp
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ A dramatic day of testimony in David
Graham's capital murder trial began early Wednesday, when Graham's
former fiancee refused to testify, and ended with defense attorneys
resting without calling any witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from his chair immediately after prosecutors dismissed
their last witness at 2:15 p.m., the former Air Force Academy
cadet's lead attorney stood up, approached the jury box and told
jurors that he rested on Graham's ``presumption of innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the absence of defense witnesses, Houston attorney
Dan Cogdell said he believes that prosecutors did not prove over
six days of testimony that Graham is guilty of killing 16-year-old
Adrianne Jones. Cogdell also said he considered calling Graham to
testify but decided that resting was a ``safer decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I believed they had proven their case beyond a reasonable
doubt, I would have put on a defense. ... The way to keep the jury
focused on the weaknesses of the state's case is to rest right
behind them. That's where the emphasis should be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors called 27 witnesses in the trial, which began July
15. They built a case against the 20-year-old Mansfield High School
graduate that they say is supported by witness testimony, physical
evidence and a confession that Graham typed.
</P>
<P>
   After both sides rested, Tarrant County District Judge Don
Leonard told the jury of seven men and five women to return at 1
p.m. Thursday to hear closing arguments. Attorneys for each side
will have one hour to wrap up their arguments. Prosecutors will
speak first, followed by the defense, then a prosecution rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Before closing arguments, both sides will meet with Leonard to
determine the range of charges that jurors can consider. Graham is
charged with capital murder, but the jurors could be allowed to
consider lesser charges of murder or aggravated kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Murder can be considered a capital offense when it is committed
during the commission of another crime. Prosecutors are seeking a
capital murder conviction for Graham because they contend that
Jones was killed while she was being kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell, who argued that Graham was not present at any point
when Jones was lured from her home and was beaten and shot along a
road in Grand Prairie, Texas, said Wednesday that he has not
decided whether to request that jurors be allowed to consider any
charge less than capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Mike Parrish said he will ask
Leonard to instruct jurors to consider only capital murder, which
would carry an automatic punishment of life in prison. Prosecutors
previously decided not to seek the death penalty. For a murder
conviction, jurors could consider punishment ranging from probation
to 99 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's `not guilty' or `capital murder,' '' Parrish
said. ``I don't think there's any in-between.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution witnesses included testimony that Graham told police
where to find the gun used to kill Jones. Graham said it was hidden
in the attic of his father's Mansfield home, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony, a medical investigator told jurors that
Graham's former fiancee, Diane Zamora, was not physically capable
of inflicting wounds found on Jones' neck. Zamora's left hand was
still recovering from surgery at the time, the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   And Graham's 4 1/2-page written confession was read in court,
detailing how he and Zamora plotted and carried out Jones' slaying.
</P>
<P>
   But Cogdell has argued that prosecutors have no physical
evidence linking Graham to the crime scene and that Graham is
guilty only of trying to cover up for Zamora, who he says killed
Jones in a jealous rage because she believed that Graham had had
sex with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said he thinks defense attorneys rested because they
were concerned that prosecutors would present ``more bad news''
from damaging testimony in the rebuttal phase of the trial. Parrish
said the rebuttal stage would have included the introduction of
Zamora's written confession and more testimony from Air Force
investigators who questioned Graham before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said he had hoped to question Zamora about discrepancies
between her oral and written statements. Zamora appeared in the
courtroom Wednesday morning outside the jury's presence, but
Leonard ruled that Zamora has a constitutional right protecting her
from testifying.
</P>
<P>
   The last witness of the trial, a high school friend of Graham,
testified that Graham and Zamora visited his Burleson house before
dawn the morning after Jones was killed. John Green said that the
two washed up in a bathroom and that Graham asked for extra
clothing. Before leaving, Graham swore him to secrecy, and the
encounter was never again mentioned, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also read a jailhouse letter from Graham to Green
stating that whether he killed Jones was ``beside the point'' and
that Graham felt he did not deserve punishment because he thought
God would forgive him. He also wrote that thinking about sins was
just as bad as committing them and that prosecutors would be
``harshly judged'' for passing judgment on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an evil occurs on Earth it cannot be justified,'' he
wrote. ``Throwing me, Diane or whoever away for life won't bring
back Adrianne Jones. It'll only destroy two more families.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth lawyer and trial analyst Bill Lane said Cogdell's
decision not to present defense witnesses is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that when you are a lawyer, you don't know what
you are going to do until the state rests,'' he said. ``This is a
case that largely depends on final arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Cogdell's decision not to have Graham testify
may have been the right one. At her capital murder trial, Zamora
took the witness stand, and the jury didn't believe her testimony,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has a way of repeating itself,'' he said. ``When Diane
Zamora took the stand in her trial, it erased any doubt in the
jury's mind that she was innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors are unlikely to forget the main points of the prosecution
case, Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the jury goes in to deliberate, they are going to
remember three things. One, that a 16-year-old girl was murdered in
Grand Prairie, Texas. Two, that David Graham confessed. Three, that
the murder weapon was found in his attic.''

U.S. BREAKS WORLD RECORD IN 4X400 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Michael Johnson still has not broken the world
record in the quarter mile, but he again helped lower the world
record Wednesday in the 4x400-meter relay on the final, gripping
night of track and field at the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Joyner-Kersee provided a stirring finish to her storied
career by winning the heptathlon. Joyner-Kersee ran well enough in
the 800 meters, the final event, to hold off the Americans Dedee
Nathan and Kelly Blair-LaBounty in the final scoring.
</P>
<P>
   In the 4x400, Jerome Young, Antonio Pettigrew, Tyree Washington
and Johnson ran a searing 2 minutes 54.20 seconds to break the
previous record of 2:54.29 set by the United States at the 1993
world championships. The four will share a total of $120,000 in
prize and bonus money.
</P>
<P>
   Young led off with a split of 44.4 seconds, then handed the
baton to Pettigrew, who delivered a split of 43.2 seconds. At that
point, the race was decided. The only question was whether the
Americans would break the world record.
</P>
<P>
   They would, as Washington ran a 43.5 leg and Johnson, the
rejuvenated Olympic champion, sprinted around the track in an
anchor leg of 43.1 seconds. Johnson also ran the anchor leg on the
previous record relay with teammates Andrew Valmon, Quincy Watts
and Butch Reynolds in 1993 in Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Poland set a national record by nearly two seconds in finishing
second Wednesday night in 2:58 and Jamaica was third in 2:58.33.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of dropped batons and fumbled expectations, the
U.S. men's 4x100-meter relay team also won a major competition
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After being humbled by Canada at the 1996 Summer Olympics and
failing even to make the final of the 1997 world championships, the
American team of Jon Drummond, Tim Harden, Dennis Mitchell and
Maurice Greene prevailed over Canada and Donovan Bailey, winning
convincingly in 37.90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a half-second off the world record of 37.40 run by the
Americans at the 1992 Summer Olympics and the 1993 world
championships, but Wednesday night it was enough simply to win.
Drummond made up a little ground on the opening leg, then Tim
Harden ran a second leg that was vastly improved over the
baton-juggling leg he ran at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   While Canada's Glenroy Gilbert and Bruny Surin struggled on the
baton exchange in the final curve, Harden passed smoothly to
Mitchell, who slingshot the Americans into the lead. He gave
Maurice Greene, the world champion at 100 meters, a comfortable
lead on the anchor leg.
</P>
<P>
   Greene had won the Goodwill Games 100 meters on Tuesday night
and he was not going to be caught Wednesday night, not even by
Bailey, the world record-holder. Bailey had finished seventh in
Tuesday's 100 meters, getting caught in the blocks and shutting
down after 80 meters. Wednesday night, Bailey pulled within a
stride of Greene but he could not sustain the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This relay means one thing _ a new beginning for the U.S.
men's 4x100-meter relay team,'' said Mitchell, who ran on both
world-record squads.
</P>
<P>
   Canada was second Wednesday night in 38.23 and Cuba third in
39.34. This was the first significant victory by the Americans
since the 1994 Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones, the world's top 100-meter runner, did not compete
in the women's 4x100-meter relay, but Carlette Guidry took the
baton in second place and ran down Pauline Davis of the Bahamas on
the anchor leg to give the United States a victory in 42.06
seconds. She was joined on the victory podium by teammates Cheryl
Taplin, Chryste Gaines and Angie Vaughn. The Bahamas was second in
42.19 seconds and Russia third in 42.62.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 5,000 meters, Bob Kennedy of the United States went
to the front early and hung with the lead pack until the final lap
when Luke Kipkosgei of Kenya and Khalid Boulami of Morocco broke
into a furious sprint down the homestretch. Kipkosgei had one final
surge left and he won in 13:20.27, while Boulami finished second in
13:20.66. Tom Nyariki of Kenya was third in 13:23.34. Kennedy was
fourth in 13:27.51. &QL;

BULLS ARE EXPECTED TO NAME FLOYD AS THEIR NEXT COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Skedded earlier as BKO-FLOYD-RESIGN.) 
(th) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls' front office has dared to dangle an exit sign
in front of Michael Jordan by forcing him to decide whether he
wants to take his cues from a former college coach in the Corn Belt
whose only previous link to the National Basketball Association was
his fishing trips with the Bulls' vice president, Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Krause's fishing buddy, Tim Floyd, who resigned as head coach at
Iowa State on Wednesday, is expected to be named as the Bulls'
successor to Coach Phil Jackson on Thursday, according to officials
with the team and with the league.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd arrived in Chicago on Wednesday and will walk into this
job with the knowledge that he, along with the team's president,
Jerry Reinsdorf, and Krause, could be recognized as the men who
pushed Jordan toward a decision to leave the Bulls after six NBA
championships.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to Jordan now. In the past, he made it clear that he
only wanted to play for Jackson, who guided the Bulls to a sixth
NBA championship in June and then quickly left what had become a
hostile environment because of his strained relationship with
Krause. Jordan was at a Chicago country club Wednesday and was not
available for comment. Reinsdorf declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the Bulls' search for a coach, Jordan expressed
his uneasiness with the prospect of Floyd _ whose name began
surfacing two years ago as Jackson's potential replacement _
becoming the Bulls' coach. With a playful jab, Jordan had jokingly
referred to Floyd as Pink, as in the rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play for him is like starting over, and that's what I don't
want to do,'' Jordan said last week. ``I just don't feel that I
want to start over with someone who doesn't really know me and know
the way I play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, Jordan had said he would not make a
decision about his future until the NBA's lockout ended. Jordan's
agent, David Falk, said there were factors that go beyond Floyd
that would determine the future course for his client: does Scottie
Pippen leave as a free agent? Will Dennis Rodman be re-signed?
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Michael Jordan can determine the balance in his own mind
about the comfort level he has that the pieces are in place to win
a championship,'' Falk said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
``The coach is clearly one factor. I'm not certain it is the only
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doubt that Jordan will call it a career because he is still
viewed as the best player in the game. But Falk is quick to remind
one that Jordan retired once before, in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of athletes don't have the courage to leave because they
define themselves so much in athletic terms,'' Falk said. ``Michael
is different than that. He's a businessman and has a broad range of
interests to keep him busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Michael could work with any coach. But the issue is
whether, at this point in his career, he wants to invest the time
it would take to develop a comfort level.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's decision to leave was the first sign that the Bulls'
dynasty was in danger of being dismantled. But there have been
blatant hints that a plan to revamp the Bulls has been in place for
two years. Those who have worked closely with Krause over the years
have a sense that he has been itching to show that he can rebuild
the Bulls and maintain the team's greatness without Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Now Krause may get his chance if Jordan decides he cannot play
for Floyd. Entering with no NBA coaching experience, the
44-year-old Floyd will not be a power threat to Krause. After four
years at Iowa State, Floyd was 81-47 and took the Cyclones to three
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments. Last season,
a Floyd team finished under .500 for the first time, going 12-18.
</P>
<P>
   During the lockout, Jordan was prohibited from talking with
Reinsdorf and Krause about the coaching candidates, a list that
included NBA assistants Scott Skiles, Paul Silas, Ron Rothstein and
Rick Carlisle. But it was understood by most that Floyd had the job
if he wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been more of a shock if Tim Floyd had not been
hired,'' Falk said. ``I think Michael has a close relationship with
Jerry Reinsdorf. But clearly, they made a decision a year ago,
during the playoffs, that there was the likelihood that they would
disband. That's when they started making plans for life after
Michael and Phil.'' &QL;

ONE APPEAL LEFT AS U.S. JUSTICE REFUSES TO DELAY SEX-SHOP LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's crusade to curb the
adult-entertainment industry took a giant step forward Wednesday
when a U.S. Supreme Court justice granted the city permission to
start enforcing zoning laws that ban sex shops and strip clubs
almost everywhere except industrial zones.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg rejected a last-minute request by
the sex shops for a stay late in the afternoon, without issuing any
written order or opinion. Earlier in the day, a panel of three
judges of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also turned down a
request for a stay.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the two decisions cleared the way for them
to finally begin enforcing the 3-year-old zoning laws, which
prohibit sexually oriented businesses within 500 feet of
residential areas, schools, day care centers, houses of worship or
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this point forward we have a green light to proceed,''
said Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Giuliani. ``We will start
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the sex shops immediately filed a second request for
a stay, this time with Justice John Paul Stevens, who they said
would decide Thursday whether to honor it. The first request had to
go to Ginsburg because she handles cases from the 2nd Circuit, said
Herald Price Fahringer, a lawyer representing 107
adult-entertainment businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But federal law allows the sex shops to appeal to one more
justice before giving up, Fahringer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't lost hope,'' he said. ``Justice Stevens is probably
the one member of that court who is more sympathetic to First
Amendment concerns than any of the other justices.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials would not reveal when enforcement would actually
begin, saying inspections of sex shops and strip clubs would be
more successful if they were kept secret. But while Giuliani said
Wednesday morning that he would wait a few days before starting
enforcement, Ms. Roche said in the early evening _ after Ginsburg's
ruling _ that there would not necessarily be a delay, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Under the zoning laws, which affect 146 of the city's 164
adult-entertainment businesses, the city has to send inspectors to
sex shops and strip clubs before seeking court orders to close
them. Many of the businesses have been preparing for a crackdown in
recent days, posting instructions for employees to follow if
inspectors show up and, in some cases, posting Fahringer's
telephone number.
</P>

<P>
   The operators of several dance clubs near Times Square said
Wednesday night that they were trying to comply with the law by
requiring dancers who had performed nude to wear bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   At a video store called the Palace, at Eighth Avenue and 47th
Street, a man was glimpsed pulling videocassette boxes from
shelves. A sign in the window said: ``Closed 07-19-98 for
renovation until further notice. This video store not a adult store
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   At a theater called Show Follies Theater, on Seventh Avenue near
48th Street, a hand-lettered sign in the window was equally blunt.
``Classic movies only,'' it read, and added, ``No XXX movies.''
</P>
<P>
   But while some owners of adult-entertainment businesses had
visions of inspectors padlocking their stores and clubs
immediately, Giuliani said Wednesday that they should not expect
anything so dramatic. He said inspectors would be looking not only
for violations of the zoning law, but for violations of other city
statutes, like liquor laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law does not allow the city to just go in and close down
places on day one,'' Giuliani said. ``It requires a certain amount
of evidence and observations to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This is going to take place over a two- to
three-month period, not in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoning restrictions took effect in 1995, and businesses had
a year to comply. They have been fighting it ever since, but the
city has won victory after victory in state and federal courts.
Although lawyers for the sex shops and their customers were still
plotting strategies Wednesday, they sounded more pessimistic than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had always hoped that the Supreme Court would be
sympathetic to our concerns,'' Fahringer said of Ginsburg's
decision.

D'AMATO PROPOSES CUT IN SOME ATM FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato
said Wednesday night that he planned to attach a proposal to cut
automated-teller fees to a bill that would overhaul the nation's
bankruptcy code.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would prevent banks from double-charging customers who
use money machines at banks that are not their own. Most customers
who use money machines at banks that are not their own are charged
$1.50 on top of the $1 they are already charged for processing of
the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, R-N.Y., receives campaign contributions from the
banking industry, but in this election year, he has taken pains to
cast himself as pro-consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The bill eliminating the ATM fees has put him out of favor with
banks. But by attaching it to the bankruptcy bill, which the banks
and credit-card industries support, D'Amato may reduce opposition
to the bankruptcy bill and still emerge as pro-consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want a vote on business interests, let's have a vote on
my consumer proposal,'' D'Amato said with a chuckle in an interview
Wednesday night. Of the banks, he said: ``You will still be
entitled to your profit.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates were skeptical of linking ATM fees and
bankruptcy. Gary Klein, the staff lawyer for the National Consumer
Law Center, said it would not be a reasonable tradeoff for
consumers. ``The two issues are not related,'' he said. ``The
people who benefit from ATMs are not the same people who are having
financial problems and are stuck in the bankruptcy system.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the banks oppose the cutting of the ATM fee _ it would
reduce their annual intake from teller machines to $1 billion from
$3 billion _ D'Amato has not brought that proposal through his own
committee. He said Wednesday night that he would offer it instead
as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill, which has stalled in the
Senate despite a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign by banks and
credit-card companies to overhaul the nation's bankruptcy laws.
</P>

<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said late Tuesday that he was
postponing consideration of the bill until Congress returned in
September from its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said the bill was being delayed because of
other pressing legislation, particularly on spending bills, health
care and credit unions, not because of any problems with the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay will shorten considerably the time that the Senate
can discuss the complex bill and reach agreement with the House
version, narrowing the bill's chances of passage before Congress
adjourns for good in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer you wait on a bill of this magnitude and
controversy, the more difficult it will be to enact into law,''
Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., one of the bill's co-authors, said in
an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, inspired by the ever-climbing number of personal
bankruptcies, would make it harder for people to file for
protection from their creditors, especially if they appear to have
the ability to repay their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Debate was set to begin on the Senate floor Friday, until Lott
unexpectedly said it would probably not come up until September.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the credit-card industry, which has pumped
millions of dollars into lobbying and advertising campaigns in
favor of the overhaul, said their optimism was undiminished by
Lott's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got strong assurances that the legislation will come
before the Senate very early after Congress returns in September,''
said William Binzel, a spokesman for Mastercard International.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is vehemently opposed by groups representing
consumers, women, senior citizens and others who say it would
unfairly oppress people who are already destitute. They see the
postponement as a signal that the bill is in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over till it's over,'' said Mary Rouleau, chief
lobbyist for the Consumer Federation of America, which opposes the
bill. ``It will not sail through. Thank God, the Senate is starting
to read the fine print on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin, for one, said he had ``very mixed feelings'' about his
own bill and wanted to change it to add restrictions on the
credit-card companies. Many opponents of the bill say the banking
and credit industries make credit too easily available and
effectively lure consumers deeper into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School who has
worked against the bill, said the measure presented lawmakers with
a ``lose-lose'' proposition just before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you vote against it, you lose campaign contributions from
the banks,'' Ms. Warren said. ``But if you vote for it, you let
your opponent point out to voters that you just socked it to
consumers.''

L.A. COUNTY TOP EMPLOYER   IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, STUDY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles County, The Boeing Co. and The Walt
Disney Co. are among the largest employers in Southern California,
which has a healthy mix of public agencies and diverse businesses,
according to a study by the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The study of employers with 5,000 or more employees, released
Wednesday, shows the ``diversity and stability'' of the economies
in Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties, said Jack Kyser, the agency's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single employer is Los Angeles County, with 86,616
employees, according to the report. It was also the No. 1 employer
in 1996, when the LAEDC last issued the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Among businesses, the top employer is The Boeing Co. with 33,700
workers, displacing 1996's largest business, Bank of America, which
ranked 12 overall this year at 22,144.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find the overall number of employers in the area has stayed
the same,'' Kyser said. ``It's just the roster of players has
changed rather dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, many companies that appeared near the top of the
last report _ Rockwell International, McDonnell Douglas, First
Interstate Bancorp, Great Western Financial, Hughes Markets and FHP
International _ have since been part of the mergers and
acquisitions that have changed the local economy and are not on the
latest list.
</P>
<P>
   The report, conducted every two or three years, is used by city
and county governments and by companies considering a move into the
area and seeking a quick picture of the local economy, Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, it's obvious the next report will have new faces. Bank
of America parent BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank agreed earlier
this year to merge. Once the deal is complete, the BankAmerica name
will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   And Washington Mutual is ranked 53rd overall on this year's
list, one place behind H.F. Ahmanson &AMP; Co. Once Washington Mutual
completes its purchase of Ahmanson later this year, the combined
company will have 12,102, putting it 27th overall.
</P>
<P>
   Among industries, grocers and retailers dominate the list.
</P>
<P>
   Ralphs Grocery Co., which controls the Ralphs, Food 4 Less and
Hughes Family Markets chains, is the third largest business with
25,523 employees. Safeway Inc., which employs 20,459 people at its
Vons and Pavilions chains, is the seventh largest business in
Southern California. And at 10,600 employees, Stater Bros. Markets
is ranked at 32.
</P>
<P>
   Among retailers, Sears, Roebuck and Co. ranked 14th with 20,150
employees; Dayton-Hudson Corp., the parent of Target and Mervyns
department stores, was No. 18 with 15,953 workers; Robinsons-May
ranked 22nd with 15,000 employees; and Wal-Mart's 14,011 employees
pushed it to No. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said that Wal-Mart's firm place in the list _ it was also
in the 1996 list, when it was 27th with 12,273 employees _ is also
surprising to many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``(People) just don't recognize that Wal-Mart is very
aggressively moving into this market,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the Bentonville, Ark.-based discount department store
chain has a store in Valencia north of Los Angeles and just opened
its first urban store in suburban Panorama City. In addition, Simi
Valley, northwest of Los Angeles,
</P>
<P>
   has approved a shopping center slated to include a Wal-Mart.

TRIAL FIGURES SPECULATE ON APPEARANCE BY BRAWLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ There was testimony Wednesday at the Tawana
Brawley defamation trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the real story was outside the courtroom, where the trial's
participants engaged in a frenzy of speculation about one question:
Will Ms. Brawley appear as a witness on Thursday, after a decade of
refusing to testify?
</P>
<P>
   In the yes camp: Stephen Jackson, the lawyer who said he would
call Ms. Brawley on behalf of his client, C. Vernon Mason, one of
the three Brawley advisers fighting the damages phase of the suit.
``I fully expect for her to be available to testify tomorrow,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the no camp: Steven Pagones, the plaintiff, who has waged a
10-year battle to prove that the allegation that he assaulted Ms.
Brawley was a hoax. ``Why,'' he asked, ``would she travel to New
York to commit perjury?''
</P>
<P>
   In the maybe camp: Michael Hardy, the lawyer for the Rev. Al
Sharpton. ``I don't know if she's coming,'' he said, looking
miserable with uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation about the young woman who has always been the
silent figure at the center of the case began on Tuesday when the
judge, S. Barrett Hickman, reversed an earlier decision and said
Jackson could call Ms. Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   But the conjecturing grew fevered Wednesday, as Alton Maddox
Jr., who has been the closest adviser to the Brawley family for
many years, did everything but declare that Ms. Brawley would be
absent. ``The only thing I can say,'' Maddox said, ``is, if I said
Tawana was coming tomorrow, she would be here. But I'm not saying
that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Maddox's aides worked his way into a knot of reporters
with a wad of bills, asserting that he was willing to take bets
that the young woman would be a no-show. Maddox said, ``Whatever
happens tomorrow has nothing to do with Alton Maddox.''
</P>
<P>
   The guessing about Ms. Brawley was far more than a courthouse
parlor game. Instead, it showed the pressure that has mounted on
the defense since the July 13 verdict by a civil jury in state
Supreme Court here declaring that each of the advisers had defamed
Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox appeared to be undermining Mason's strategy in part
because of the damage it could do to the defense in the inevitable
long aftermath of the case. In the past, the advisers have said Ms.
Brawley could not cooperate with prosecutors who were hostile to
her. That assertion could be difficult to make if she spurned an
invitation from Mason to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Mason has made public comments since the jury verdict that
seemed to distance him from the other advisers. He has noted that
he was only found to have defamed Pagones once, while Maddox was
found liable on two counts and Sharpton on seven counts. His
lawyer, Jackson, has said Ms. Brawley would testify that she was
assaulted and that she described the attack to her advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy suggested at the defense table Wednesday that a new battle
over Ms. Brawley could not be good for any of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   But Maddox was the player who was watched most carefully
Wednesday. Ms. Brawley, now 26, has said in the past that she views
Maddox as something of a permanent lawyer for her even though he
was suspended from law practice for refusing to cooperate in an
investigation of his handling of the Brawley case.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox turned 53 this week and a rally in support of him is
planned in New York City on Thursday night. In the past, Ms.
Brawley has attended some similar events.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox has been sharply protective of Ms. Brawley over the
years, and people who know him say it is unlikely that he would
acquiesce in the decision to subject her to new legal entanglements
by calling her as a witness on behalf of Mason.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maddox said that he had spoken to Ms. Brawley's stepfather,
Ralph King, Wednesday. Neither he nor King had spoken to Ms.
Brawley in several days, he said, and neither knew her plans.
</P>
<P>
   But Maddox stopped short of saying that he doubted Jackson's
statements Wednesday that Jackson had established contact with Ms.
Brawley's family and was working out the logistics of her
appearance here. ``Maybe Jackson has a pipeline,'' Maddox said.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors have not been included in the to-and-fro over Ms.
Brawley. On Wednesday they heard Mason testify that he bore no ill
will toward Pagones when he said in 1989 that Pagones had
kidnapped, raped and sodomized Ms. Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed likely that the jurors had an inkling of the topic
being debated every time they turned their backs. At one point from
the bench, Hickman told the lawyers to be ready to continue on with
the case on Thursday, ``no matter who comes and who doesn't.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Business was off 95 percent at Hotaling's News Agency
on Wednesday _ not surprising, considering that the store in
midtown Manhattan, which sells hundreds of foreign and out-of-town
newspapers, was reduced to a cart outside a freight door on 41st
Street near the Avenue of the Americas. The store's real entrance,
on 42nd Street, was closed, along with most of the streets around
Times Square and the businesses that line them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty depressing,'' said store owner Arthur Hotaling.
But, he added, he hoped his losses would be covered by insurance he
carries that is supposed to pay for business disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who was going to pay _ and how _ were the main questions
among the hundreds of businesses that were closed by city officials
after a construction elevator on the Conde Nast building collapsed
on 43rd Street on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A few of these businesses were large. The Millennium Broadway at
44th Street said it was losing a quarter of a million dollars a day
because almost half of its 627 rooms, the ones facing 43rd Street,
were unusable. Many other businesses, however, were restaurants,
shops and small concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most affected were the street vendors _ with their
coffee carts, hot dog stands, and falafel grills _ who usually dot
the area's street corners.
</P>
<P>
   The office building at 1500 Broadway at 43rd Street contained 65
businesses, with about 1,000 employees, all of whom were barred
from the building Wednesday, said Gretchen Dykstra, president of
the Times Square Business Improvement District. Her group counted
10 restaurants that were closed in the district, as well as two
theaters, a nightclub and the district's own sanitation facility.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani strongly urged that money to help small
businesses be provided immediately by the owner of the Conde Nast
building, the Durst Organization, and its contractor, Tishman
Construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very, very useful to a few of the businesses that
particularly might be strapped for cash over the next three or four
days if some reasonable sum of money were made available,'' the
mayor said at a press conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fund should be used for businesses that did not have
insurance or could not wait for the courts to decide liability for
the collapse, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them may be in a critical position,'' he said. ``If
they can't derive some revenue in the next three to four days, then
a lawsuit two years from now and a big claim two years from now may
not be worth as much as it seems to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than establish a fund for the businesses, however, the
building's owner and contractor said their insurer, Liberty Mutual
Group, had set up an expedited process to handle ``loss of
business'' claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those losses of business are yet to be determined, and at this
point, from a legal point of view, we are not allowed to interfere
with that process,'' said Richard Kielar, a senior vice president
of Tishman.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor and the owner are working with the mayor's office
``to seek feasible methods to deal with the personal emergency
problems that may have occurred to individuals and businesses,''
said Douglas Durst, president of the Durst Organization. They have
set up a fund to help individuals with emergency living expenses,
although the size of that fund and other details were not announced
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's comments clearly placed Durst and Tishman on the
spot, since he seemed to be assuming that they _ or their insurance
company _ were responsible for the losses to other businesses in
the area. But the issue may not be that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Each insurance policy is different, and what is ultimately
covered will depend both on the details of the policy and the
investigation into the cause of the collapse, said Dave Dasgupta, a
spokesman for the Insurance Service Office, which collects
statistics for property-casualty insurance companies. If the
individual businesses have ``business disruption'' insurance, they
will put in claims to their own insurers, who in turn would try to
collect from Liberty Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance companies might argue that the government action
of closing the streets, and not the actual building collapse,
caused the losses to businesses in the area, said Stephen Scammell
of Towers Perrin, an insurance consulting firm. Many insurance
policies do not cover losses caused by government activities, he
added, so business owners counting on their own ``business
disruption'' insurance may be out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really messy,'' Scammell said. ``But it will make a
lot of lawyers happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on previous street shutdowns, lawsuits are likely to be
filed. After the facade of 540 Madison Ave. crumbled last year,
prompting the city to close the street for weeks, several merchants
jointly filed a lawsuit against the building's owner. That case is
scheduled for trial in September, said their lawyer, Kenneth
Ashman, adding that his clients lost millions of dollars because of
the closure.
</P>
<P>
   But for many businesses in Times Square, the current disruptions
caused by the street closures were far less serious _ but annoying.
At the Chase Manhattan branch at 43rd Street and Broadway, for
example, two of the four automated teller machines were closed at
the request of police, because they were too close to windows
facing Times Square, a spokesman for the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   Other business owners fear the worst is yet to come. Henry
Kallan, who owns the now-closed Casablanca Hotel on 43rd Street,
said he's losing $10,000 to $15,000 a day. Even after he reopens
the hotel, he said, ``the recovery will take time and we will
realize more losses.''

A CHAT WITH TORRE DID WONDERS FOR KNOBLAUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirteen days ago, Chuck Knoblauch ducked his head
into manager Joe Torre's office immediately after the Yankees beat
Tampa Bay and asked to meet with him the next afternoon. Torre
replied cheerfully: How about now? And for about half an hour they
chatted _ about expectations, about playing for a new team _ each
man feeling afterward that he had a better sense of the other.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Knoblauch had a better awareness of his value to the
team, despite his diminished batting average and occasional
throwing trouble. Torre and others on the team think he has been
more relaxed in the days since his meeting, and the proof may be in
run production: Including his three-run homer in Wednesday's 13-2
thrashing of Detroit _ his 10th home run of the season _ Knoblauch
has six homers and 15 runs batted in since the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez pitched six innings in the hot and humid
conditions, before 49,029 at Yankee Stadium, to improve to 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (71-25), who broke stride in their record-breaking
pace by losing four of five games through last weekend, apparently
are back on track, winning three straight _ their 10th streak of
three or more victories this season.
</P>
<P>
   Having played 14 consecutive days following the All-Star break,
through a four-city trip and a Monday doubleheader that lasted more
than nine hours, the Yankees funneled out of the clubhouse
Wednesday, ecstatic that they do not have to play Thursday. ``I'm
tired, man,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, wearing a golf shirt and sweat pants after the game,
almost looked refreshed as he spoke. He had returned from the
All-Star break in an excellent frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two at-bats on July 9, Knoblauch hit the ball hard
and had no hits to show for it. Later in the game, Knoblauch struck
out twice and nearly flubbed an easy throw.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Knoblauch slugged a crucial three-run homer to
help spark a successful comeback, and it was that night _ with his
.258 batting average some 46 points below what his career mark was
at the start of the season _ when he spoke with Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just needed to talk to somebody,'' Torre said. ``You know,
it takes a little time when you get to a new ball club, and you
expect a lot out of yourself. I know he was very unhappy with his
production up to that point _ he was a .300 hitter who wasn't
hitting .300. Players like that are sometimes tougher on themselves
than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre could draw on his own experience. Before the 1969 season,
he had been traded from Atlanta to St. Louis for Orlando Cepeda, a
popular and productive player. ``You put a lot of pressure on
yourself,'' Torre said. ``It's stupid to do, but you don't know
that when you're in that body and you're trying to impress
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre did not detail exactly what he told Knoblauch. But Torre,
whose expertise is in easing pressure on players, probably told
Knoblauch something along these lines: You have a good on-base
percentage, you set the tone for the attack with your approach at
the plate, you're a Gold Glove second baseman whose temporary
throwing problems haven't manifested themselves in defeat, and the
team is wildly successful. Go have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch has been more aggressive at the plate, hitting the
ball harder and more consistently, and he has played his best
defense of the season since his meeting with Torre. ``From at-bat
to at-bat, better swings, more solid contact, line drives,''
Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the All-Star break, Knoblauch sometimes would botch easy
throws _ hard throws presented no trouble _ but he appears to have
moved beyond the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch said that he did not come to the Yankees consciously
looking to establish himself. ``Maybe subconsciously, my body
really wasn't allowing me to relax,'' Knoblauch said. ``Maybe
that's in the back of your mind, day to day, maybe there one day,
not there the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch scored three runs Wednesday and has scored 71 runs in
all, putting him on a pace to score 121 this season, or more than
he has scored in all but one of his first seven seasons in the
majors. He has 47 RBIs, and at his current rate would drive in 74,
a career high. Knoblauch has never hit more than 13 home runs in a
single season, averaging six, but already this year he is one of
seven Yankees with 10 or more home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Getting more from Knoblauch, Torre said, ``is more of a concern
to him than it is to me _ or anyone he plays with.''

ZODIAC KILLER GETS LIFE TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the day he was arrested and accused of being the
Zodiac killer more than two years ago, Heriberto Seda, a loner
obsessed with guns and religion, declared repeatedly that God had
already forgiven him.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, at his sentencing in state Supreme Court in Queens
for three murders and one attempted murder, Seda, 30, again invoked
the divinity, saying only God knew the truth. Justice Robert
Hanophy responded by sentencing Seda to the maximum possible, life
in prison, and threw in his own religious allusion.
</P>
<P>
   Urging Seda to seek out the prison chaplain, Hanophy added,
``The first thing you should say to him is: `Bless me, Father, for
I have sinned''' _ a reference to the first words that a Roman
Catholic says to a priest during confession.
</P>
<P>
   Seda must serve at least 83 years and four months before he is
eligible for parole. As court officers led him out of the
courtroom, he turned to look at his mother, Carmen Gladys Alvarado,
who rose from her third-row seat, waved faintly and murmured,
``Bye, Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   After a six-week trial, Seda was convicted last month of being
the Zodiac killer, a murderer who vowed in taunting letters to the
police and news organizations to kill one person for each of the 12
signs of the Zodiac during two crime sprees in the early 1990s. He
eluded the police for six years but was caught after shooting his
half-sister and engaging dozens of police officers in a wild
shootout at his apartment in East New York, Brooklyn, in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   No trial date has been set in the four other shootings he is
accused of committing.
</P>
<P>
   In asking for mercy for Seda, his lawyers described him as a
``troubled young man'' who needs psychological counseling.
Prosecutors called him a cold-blooded killer who stalked only the
most vulnerable people _ the elderly, the mentally ill and people
compromised by drugs or alcohol _ and they argued that he should
never be free again.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hanophy agreed with the prosecutors. ``You are a
very angry young man,'' he told him. ``And you have forfeited your
life. You will die in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   As he stood before the judge Wednesday, Seda offered a subdued
and rambling statement that referred repeatedly to God. He said the
prosecutors' depiction of him as an unfeeling predator was wrong.
``Nobody really knows me,'' he said. ``I have changed and no matter
what happens, God is always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cardona, one of two jurors who returned to hear the
judge's sentencing decision, said she found Seda's comments
disturbing. ``He might have felt some remorse at one point, but he
really didn't show it,'' she said. ``This was sad for all the
parties involved.''

   Kathleen Heller, the sister of John Diacone, a 46-year-old
mental patient who was killed by the Zodiac killer in 1993, flew in
from Colleyville, Texas, to ask for a life sentence for Seda.
Choking back tears, she told the judge that her brother became an
easy target because the mental health system had failed him.
</P>
<P>
   Diacone had wandered away from Pilgrim State Psychiatric
Hospital on Long Island when he was shot to death outside Highland
Park in Ridgewood, Queens. In an indirect reference to religious
absolution, she said that life in prison for Seda would at least
``ensure that justice in the secular case is served.''
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for leniency, David Bart, one of Seda's lawyers, said
that Seda was a borderline schizophrenic who lived an almost
hermitlike existence and resorted to violence because he suffered
from chronic paranoia. Seda's lawyers have said often that they
considered using an insanity defense but could not find experts who
would declare him legally insane.

COLUMN: TAKING ON STEINBRENNER`S YANKEE MATH  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Call it extortion if you want to; you wouldn't be the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, just as the Yankees were about to embark on an
11-game road trip, George Steinbrenner III set a price for what it
would take to get him to start talking about not talking about
moving the team from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the three million,'' he said to a reporter, referring not
to money but attendance, ``and then we'll talk about the Bronx
after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, did the math. With
the team already projected to draw 2.83 million fans to Yankee
Stadium for the season, it would take less than $2 million for the
city itself to buy enough seats to meet Steinbrenner's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fraction of what the interest on building a new
stadium on the West Side would cost,'' Ferrer pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   But no one in City Hall took to the idea. Instead, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani mocked the borough president, accusing Ferrer of being
``sucker punched.'' The city was not going to get into the business
of buying baseball tickets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so this columnist stepped into the breach. Since shelling
out for all 170,000 tickets was a bit beyond her, she settled for
five.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, on Tuesday evening, when David Cone took the mound against
the Detroit Tigers, she and Ferrer and Ferrer's press secretary and
his so-called body man and her own body man _ well, really just her
husband _ were happily ensconced in what is commonly known as the
nosebleed section, eating hot dogs. Seated in front of them was a
group of commercial soap salesmen from Staten Island well started
on their way to what would become, by about the fifth inning, an
impressive state of inebriation. To the left was a group from
Manhattan celebrating a birthday, complete with pink frosted cake.
</P>
<P>
   On the long escalator ride up to the top of the stadium, Ferrer
was asked about the Yankees' must-have figure of three million. Did
he really think that if the city bought up the outstanding 169,995
seats, Steinbrenner would be placated?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most of this, it's Kabuki theater,'' Ferrer replied.
``It's symbolic. He says, `Three million fans' _ English
translation: `Give me 200 luxury boxes.' You've just got to have
the magic decoder ring with this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But still, Ferrer reaffirmed his commitment to his bulk-purchase
plan. Though City Hall was not willing to play along, he said he
had received many phone calls from corporations eager to buy
tickets and donate them to city schoolchildren. He said he was
still busy working to raise the money independently of the mayor,
even if Steinbrenner's challenge was, as he intimated, just a
bluff: ``He made an offer; I accepted. Let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, which the Yankees obligingly won, 5-1,
Ferrer defended the stadium against its various detractors. He
pointed to a tier where, he claimed, more luxury boxes could be
added. He dismissed concerns over parking and access, saying they
were simple problems to solve. For years, he has been pushing for a
new Metro-North station that, by his accounting, would draw an
additional 3,000 fans to every Yankee game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one house that Ruth built, and this is it,'' he
observed as evening set over the Bronx and the players moved,
antlike, in the artificial glare below. ``Demolishing the stadium
is about as unthinkable as taking down the Empire State Building or
the Statue of Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxing poetic about the Bronx landmark, Ferrer even warmed to
his less-than-ideal seat in Box 636. ``You're up in the nosebleeds,
you can still see the field,'' he said. ``It's like you are
suspended in air. The Mets would kill for a stadium like this.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the borough president went unhonored among
the fans screaming for beer and throwing peanuts, even though, with
his button-down shirt and red-and-gold-striped tie, he was far and
away the best-dressed man in the upper tier.
</P>
<P>
   But in the third inning, just after Derek Jeter had stolen
second, one of the soap salesmen made the connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better keep these Yankees in the Bronx, brother,'' he
said. A few minutes later, he turned to Ferrer with no less passion
and asked, ``You're the borough president, can you get the beer guy
over here?''

TOUGH SCHEDULE AND HIGH EXPECTATIONS WILL TEST GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John Elway announced in June that he was returning for
another season with the Denver Broncos, it did not immediately
delight New York Giants coach Jim Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish John had retired,'' a smiling Fassel said of Elway.
``We have to play the Broncos this year. And then I realized that
Brett Favre wouldn't be retiring from the Packers and Steve Young
wouldn't be retiring from the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play them. What's one more Hall of Fame quarterback on the
schedule?''
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants prepare to open training camp at the State
University of New York's Albany campus on Saturday, the prospects
of the 1998 team are invariably bound to an onerous schedule that
includes both of last season's Super Bowl teams, the
division-winning Kansas City Chiefs and a ``Monday Night Football''
match at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the Giants' penance for winning the National Football
Conference East last season. It will be a brave, new and demanding
world for them.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the Giants were 10-5-1, their opponents
compiled the worst aggregate record (86-103-4) in the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   But Fassel, whose rejuvenation of the Giants won him the 1997
coach of the year award, has begun to use the team's imposing
schedule as a motivational tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told our players that people around the league are still
probably trying to make up their minds about us,'' Fassel said. ``A
year ago, people didn't think we could win at all. Now the bar has
been raised and I'm sure people are watching to see how we respond.
It's another thing we have to prove, and that doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel has spent most of the off season telling his charges that
last year's achievements were a beginning, but no longer good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, they were learning how to listen, learning how to
win,'' Fassel said. ``At training camp this year, I expect
everything _ the efficiency, the understanding of the finer points
and the consistency of effort _ to start off at a much higher
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a no-excuse operation from Day 1.''
</P>
<P>
   So, except for a joke here or there, don't expect Fassel to make
much of the Giants' exacting schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the general manager, Ernie Accorsi, and his
predecessor, George Young, Fassel enters what could be a
breakthrough year with every starter from last year's team
returning.
</P>
<P>
   For other teams, training camp is often a competitive
environment where jobs are won and lost. For the Giants, who have
at most two or three starting jobs unresolved, the emphasis will be
on instruction and improvement.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, no one epitomizes the team mission better than
quarterback Danny Kanell. Kanell was 7-2-1 as a starter in 1997 and
widely praised for his ability to avoid game-breaking mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   But can Kanell raise his game and rev up the offense, something
that is essential if the Giants expect to compete at the next
level?
</P>
<P>
   As Fassel said, ``There's no doubt we have to score more
points.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kanell knows what that means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make better decisions,'' he said. ``That will let me
throw more accurately to the right receiver. I have to see the
whole field better, lead the offense better, interpret the game
plan better. I've spent most of the off season trying to make sure
I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, 24, has also added a few pounds to his 6-foot-3-inch
frame, thanks to his regular attendance at Giants Stadium during
the winter conditioning and weight program.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell should have far more targets to choose from since wide
receiver Ike Hilliard, last year's No. 1 draft pick, appears on
schedule in his recovery from neck surgery. Hilliard went down in
the team's second game, three games before Kanell took over for
Dave Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell and Hilliard have spent hours working on their timing in
the passing game during practices at Giants Stadium since March.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Hilliard in the starting lineup as camp opens will be
the veteran Chris Calloway, the team leader in receiving for the
last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Amani Toomer has impressed the coaching staff with his work
ethic in the off season and has a chance for an expanded role. The
rookie wide receivers Joe Jurevicius and Brian Alford _ as well as
the undersize duo of David Patten and Omar Douglas _ should provide
depth.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few positions as yet unresolved is at running back.
Tiki Barber is the designated starter, but the Giants signed the
free agent Gary Brown, who rushed for 945 yards with the San Diego
Chargers last year, to compete for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mix is Tyrone Wheatley, who could win the job with
a great camp or end up as the Giants' latest No. 1 pick to falter.
</P>
<P>
   At strongside linebacker, Corey Miller has irked Fassel with
some absences at off-season team gatherings and has all but lost
his job to Marcus Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Al Pupunu will get every chance to turn the tight end
spot into a productive pass-catching position, and the Giants will
get inventive as they try to get the rookie safety Shaun Williams
onto the field in regular and nickel defense packages.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Giants' schedule, the secondary _ a team strength _
will have to get even better as it faces some of the league's best
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a determined team,'' Fassel said of his Giants.
``They'll need to be.''

WATER POLO: U.S. COMES UP EMPTY IN THE POOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Italy, Russia, Spain)  (lb)

   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ Wolf Wigo made the most of a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play in an international
tournament near home, but the United States still finished without
a medal Wednesday night at the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Wigo scored two goals and dished out three assists in the United
States' 8-7 loss to Italy in the bronze-medal game before 1,200 at
the Nassau County Swimming and Diving Center. Leonardo Sottani
scored the winning goal with 18 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   In the championship match, Russia, the defender, won the gold
medal by beating Spain, 11-5.
</P>
<P>
   Wigo, who grew up on New York City's Upper West Side and
attended the Bronx High School of Science, was one of only two on
the national team who were not natives of California. He tied for
the team-high in goals with five in the tournament in front of his
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the 25-year-old veteran of the seventh-place 1996 Olympic
team was not feeling sentimental afterward. He had one goal
disallowed against Italy when the referee ruled that the entire
ball had not cleared the goal line. And a teammate, Brad
Schumacher, appeared to have tied the game with a goal as time
expired, but an official penalized Schumacher for pushing off,
ending the match.
</P>
<P>
   After Wigo's goal was waved off, coach John Vargas said, ``He
was playing harder and harder and smarter. Anybody else, that might
have hurt them the rest of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italians marked Wigo with more care in the fourth quarter,
so Wigo became a playmaker. He had two assists, the second to Kyle
Kopp to tie the game at 7-7 with one minute three seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Wigo has degenerative discs in his back and he said playing four
games in five days was an added strain. But he plans to stay in the
sport until the 2000 Olympics, continuing a routine of waking at
4:15 a.m. in his adopted city of San Francisco to trade stocks and
then training at night.
</P>
<P>
   `'I'm sure I can do it,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: THE FIRESTORM COMETH

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 23:
</P>
<P>
   Charles La Bella, who has been leading the Justice Department's
campaign finance investigation, has now advised Attorney General
Janet Reno that under both the mandatory and discretionary
provisions of the Independent Counsel Act she must appoint an
outside prosecutor to take over his inquiry. The other important
figure of this investigation, FBI Director Louis Freeh, has already
recommended an independent counsel. Reno can give her usual
runaround about being hard-headed, but she cannot hide from the
meaning of this development.
</P>
<P>
   The two people in the American government who know most about
this case _ the lead prosecutor and the top investigator _ are
convinced that the trail of potentially illegal money leads so
clearly toward the White House that Reno cannot, under federal law,
be allowed to supervise the investigation of her own boss. When it
comes to campaign law, this is the most serious moment since
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the judgments of rebel subordinates or hot-headed
junior staff members. Freeh, a former federal judge, has been if
anything too loyal to Reno during the nine long months that she has
ignored his advice. La Bella was hand-picked by Reno on the basis
of experience and skill to run this investigation. Either she has
to come forward and make the impossible argument that they are
incompetent or bow to the law's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Reno may grumble about leaks of supposedly confidential advice.
But the fact is that the American people need to know that two top
law enforcement officers believe the attorney general is derelict.
Moreover, Freeh and La Bella are right to separate themselves from
Reno, because if her attempt to protect presidential fund-raising
from investigation continues, it will go down as a blot against
Justice every bit as enduring as J. Edgar Hoover's privacy abuses.
Firestorm is an overused word in Congress, but if Reno does not
make the appointment, the Republican Senate leadership ought to
ignite one _ today.

 49ers PRESIDENT CARMEN POLICY QUITS IN FEUD FALLOUT  
 (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feuds in the National Football League are as common as
touchdowns. But the bitter battle between San Francisco 49ers owner
Eddie DeBartolo and team president Carmen Policy, friends for about
30 years, ended in Policy's resignation Wednesday, concluding one
of the most successful football duos of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Policy finally made official what has been speculated about for
months, that he was leaving the 49ers because of a strained
relationship with DeBartolo. He will be replaced on an interim
basis by Larry Thrailkill, chief operating officer. The current
team vice presidents Dwight Clark and Bill Duffy will be
responsible for day-to-day operations and report to Thrailkill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepping aside is very difficult, it's awkward, but it's not
impossible,'' Policy said during a news conference Wednesday in
Burlingame, Calif. ``I'm looking forward to the opportunities ahead
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of club executives throughout the NFL speculated that
Policy may become part of a potential ownership bid involving
billionaire banker Al Lerner, who is considering purchasing the new
Cleveland Browns expansion team, which begins play in 1999. Those
same people say Policy would be given 6 to 8 percent ownership and
would run the daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   Such agreements are rare in the NFL but not unheard of. The
former New Orleans general manager, the late Jim Finks, owned 3
percent of the Saints, and the former general manager and coach of
the Miami Dolphins, Don Shula, owned about 12 percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between Policy and DeBartolo began in December when the
49ers' owner was told by the U.S. attorney's office in New Orleans
that he could be indicted because of a gambling fraud case. Eight
months have passed without any charges being filed, but the case
remains open. Because of the investigation, Debartolo's sister,
Denise DeBartolo York, who owns 45 percent of the 49ers, has
controlled the team.
</P>
<P>
   Debartolo feels Policy has been trying to gain control of the
49ers in his absence, something Policy strongly denies.
</P>
<P>
   Many NFL team executives believe Policy's resignation means that
DeBartolo no longer fears being indicted and therefore wants
control of the team again. Since DeBartolo no longer trusts Policy,
he wanted Policy gone from the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a deep freeze between the two men since the Super
Bowl, the last time they spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been defrosted during the past whatever number of
months,'' Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   Since being named executive vice-president and legal council in
1989, his teams have had a .771 winning percentage, won seven
division titles, made eight playoff appearances and captured two
Super Bowl titles. He later became the club president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmen leaves our organization with my best personal wishes,''
DeBartolo said in a lukewarm statement. ``He has been an integral
part of the 49ers' success since we named him president in 1991.''

   U.S. Women Meet, Greet, Set to Compete &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women will assume soccer's center stage next summer when the
United States will play host to the third Women's World Cup. Unlike
the American men, who finished 32nd and last in France this summer,
the American women are the favorites to become world champions for
the second time.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games in the New York area this week include
women's soccer for the first time. The U.S. team took the
opportunity to be in the area this week to to promote next year's
World Cup on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of coach Tony DiCicco and his assistants,
Lauren Gregg and Jay Hoffman, the Americans held their first
practice Wednesday at Giants Stadium, in East Rutherford, N.J.,
which will play host to the opening ceremony and first game next
June 19.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey welcomed the team and told
about 1,000 young female players in the crowd that she expected the
Women's World Cup games at Giants Stadium to attract crowds similar
to the sellouts for the men's tournament in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games will be a good test for the Americans because
the other three teams in the tournament _ China, Norway and Denmark
_ are also world powers. The Norwegians were the winners of the
last World Cup, in 1995 in Sweden, and the only team the Americans
have lost to this year.
</P>
<P>
   China will play Norway at noon and the United States will face
Denmark in the evening on Saturday. The winners will meet for the
gold medal Monday night after the third-place game. All four games
will be played at Mitchel Field in Uniondale, N.Y., which is near
the Nassau Coliseum.

   O'Brien Missed Chance to Beat Record &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dan O'Brien could have been disappointed. While he set a
Goodwill Games record of 8,755 points Monday night in his first
decathlon since winning in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, he ran slowly
in the concluding 1,500 meters and wasted a strong chance to break
his world record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I disappointed?'' he said Wednesday. ``I was disappointed
in my discus throw and shot-put more than the 1,500. My emphasis
all year has been to get my field events sound. I haven't run
enough races and done enough pace work, so my 400 and 1,500 were
lacking. I was fortunate to make it through this meet.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's future decathlon plans are unsure. ``I'm going to do
some pole vaults and hurdles this summer,'' he said, ``but we'll
have to see about my next decathlon. Maybe less is better.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and Marion Jones, who won the Goodwill 100 and 200
meters for women, attended a news conference in Manhattan on
Wednesday to announce a new fitness program for America's 10
million children in grades four through six.
</P>
<P>
   Another guest was Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al
Gore. The program, called Fit Kids, was created by the United
States Conference of Mayors in conjunction with the U.S. Olympic
Committee and USA Track and Field.

CORBETT MONICA, 68, COMEDIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Corbett Monica, the durable comedian whose gentle jokes went
down so well for so long that he spent more than 40 years touring
as the opening act for Frank Sinatra and other big name singers,
died Wednesday at his home in North Miami, Fla. He was 68 and best
recalled by television audiences as Joey Bishop's best friend on
the 1960s' ``Joey Bishop Show.''
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He may not have been the funniest man who ever came down the
pike, but in a career that included 18 appearances on ``The Ed
Sullivan Show,'' frequent guest host stints for Johnny Carson and a
leading role in Woody Allen's 1984 movie, ``Broadway Danny Rose,''
Monica got his share of laughs.
</P>
<P>
   To say that he and his humor traveled well would be something of
an understatement. Over the years he appeared in Las Vegas,
Atlantic City, N.J., Miami and elsewhere with the likes of Paul
Anka, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis Jr., Lena Horne, Dean Martin, Lisa
Minnelli and Jerry Vale, and made something of a late-life career
touring with Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Monica appeared with Frank Sinatra so often he
became a virtual member of the Rat Pack, a comedian who could be
counted on to lace his material with Sinatra jokes and who never
failed to include the singer's favorite, the one about the time
Monica got on a bus at O'Hare Airport in Chicago and asked the
driver, ``Do you go to the Loop?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the driver replied, ``I go beep-beep.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Bishop was a Sinatra sidekick, Monica became
something of a sidekick's sidekick, spending two situation comedy
seasons, from 1963 to 1965, as Larry Corbett, Bishop's friend and
manager on ``The Joey Bishop Show.''
</P>
<P>
   If Monica never made it to the first ranks of American comedy it
may have been because as a comedian he had something of a deprived
childhood. A native of New York, he was born in neither Brooklyn
nor the Bronx or even on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, but in
the comfortable East 70s of Manhattan, of all places.
</P>
<P>
   If that had not been enough to give him a comedic inferiority
complex, when he was 13 his family moved to St. Louis, a city not
renowned as a springboard for comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he had enough natural talent and enough comedic
inclination that he almost immediately gravitated to show business,
becoming first a dance instructor and then a budding drummer before
taking full advantage of St. Louis' most appealing natural
resource: When he was 17, Monica, apparently no great shakes as a
student, began doing stand-up comedy at the wide-open city's
numerous strip joints and other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he entered the Army, Monica had been married,
divorced and developed enough material that he was assigned to
entertain at USO clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It was during an Army assignment in Washington state in the
early 1950s that he met a self-styled Seattle showgirl named Helen
Stover, who recalled Wednesday that she had been attracted to
Monica by his infectious personality and the fact that they had
both been dance instructors.
</P>
<P>
   The couple were married in 1954, and after two more years
working in St. Louis clubs and making tours of the Midwest, Monica
brought his family to New York, settling first in Manhattan and
later in Englewood, N.J., as he worked his way up from suburban
clubs to big-time gigs at the Copacabana and the Latin Quarter and
made his first television appearances.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By the time the 20-year marriage, which produced five children,
ended in an amicable divorce, Monica had milked it for everything
it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   A man who shunned risque material, Monica became known for his
family-based humor, noting, for example, that he and his wife were
trying to get their son to learn a trade, ``so we can know what
kind of work he's out of.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Monica's digs were never vicious or hurtful to his
family. He might tell an audience, for example, that his wife was
such an inept cook that ``she louses up Corn Flakes,'' but she
would be mollified by the knowledge that she was not only an
accomplished cook but one who wrote recipes and scheduled meals for
a diet cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   After a sojourn in Beverly Hills, Calif., during his years on
the ``Joey Bishop Show,'' Monica, who was a member of the eclectic
cast, along with Jacqueline Bisset, Jim Brown and Joseph Cotton, of
the 1970 movie ``The Grasshopper,'' returned to Englewood.
</P>
<P>
   As he became a certified old-timer of comedy, Monica found
regular duty as a stand-in for Freddy Roman's ``Catskills on
Broadway,'' and later starred in the show's Atlantic City
production.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Miami a decade ago, Monica continued touring
with singers, especially with Lawrence and Ms. Gorme. The aging
audiences may have heard some of Monica's jokes before, but their
inevitable laughter was a reminder that they had liked him and his
humor the first time, too.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Barbara Ortwein; a son from his
early marriage, George, of Bothell, Wash.; two other sons, Corbett
Jr. of San Marcos, Calif., and Tony, of Deer Park, N.Y.; three
daughters, Julie of Upper Montclair, N.J., Nanette D'Aquila of
Burbank, Calif., and Elena Monica of Miami Beach; a brother, Lenny
Geiger of Los Angeles, 6 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren.

 &HT;    Glavine, `Cat' rip Phillies
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ They laid out a full table Wednesday night:
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine got his 14th win, matching his entire 1997 total.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga had another two-homer game, his sixth twin-HR
night in 38 games.
</P>
<P>
   Slumping Michael Tucker poked a double and a triple.
</P>
<P>
   It was the year's highest output in a 14-2 win over the
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   And Mark Wohlers climbed out of his foxhole to throw a 1-2-3
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   What Chicago Cubs?
</P>
<P>
   The Braves emerged from two days of abuse from the Cubs and
body-slammed Philadelphia, opening their nine-game trip with their
biggest offensive night of the year. The first three men in the
order scored six times by the second inning, and after rookie
Carlton Loewer coughed up a three-run homer to Galarraga before he
had retired his fourth batter, it was as good as over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't hit him that hard in the first inning,'' said
manager Bobby Cox. ``A lot of ground balls that just happened to be
in the right spot and then Galarraga hit that home run. That was
big.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves first baseman had gone a week without a homer, with
just three hits in his previous 21 at-bats, before he reached
Loewer with a three-run shot in the second. He the hit a solo shot
off Jerry Spradlin in the fifth to make it 12-2, both homers flying
the wall in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hit by pitches 16 times already and I think I opened
(his stance) a little bit so I could get out of the way,'' said
Galarraga, his season HR total at 32. ``I figured that out so in
batting practice, I tried to spray the ball to right field to
forget about it and that helped out out.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, who was 14-7 in 33 starts last year, won his 14th in 21
starts and struck out 10, matching his season high. He retired the
first 11 men he faced, was hurt only by a two-run Rico Brogna homer
and was left to wonder what had gone so wrong year ago is going so
much better now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying not to get caught up in any of that stuff,''
Glavine said. ''My last three times out, I've felt real good about
how I'm throwing the ball and I'm just trying to take advantage of
it. Obviously tonight, the offense made it real easy.''

 &HT;    Guillen hopes to stay on with Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Ozzie Guillen made his 25th start of the season
at shortstop Wednesday night, though he went to some length to
disclaim the appearance incentive in his contract. There is none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only have one incentive,'' he said, ``and that's a ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen's ring mantra. It was the topic his first day with the
Braves and remains moreso now, as the NL East becomes an
increasingly foregone conclusion. But the 13-year veteran dropped a
hint Wednesday that Braves management has not openly considered.
Guillen likes it here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stay here,'' he said. ``I want to end my career
here. I want to play for a couple more years with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have both Guillen and Rafael Belliard under one-year
contracts and though Belliard, on the 60-day disabled list with a
torn left quadricep, has been able to resume most physical
activity, he has become nothing more than a Guillen/Walt Weiss
insurance policy. At 34, Guillen is two years younger than
Belliard, gives little in the field and has a 20-point higher
career batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen will continue to get extensive playing time this trip,
while Bobby Cox guards Weiss' sore left quadricep. Asked if Weiss
can play off the bench, Cox said, ``He's available to win the game,
sure. To get him well would take the whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Walter for the long stretch,'' Guillen said. ``We all
know he's been playing hurt, on a real bad leg. That's what I'm
here for. That's the reason they signed me. And when he's healthy,
he'll be back in.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, when Guillen was hit in the left big toe by
Kerry Wood Tuesday night, it maked the first time since 1990 he had
been struck by a pitch. Over his entire career and over 6,100
at-bats, Guillen has only been hit by pitches seven times. Andres
Galarraga has already been hit 16 times this season alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I'm an easy out,'' Guillen explained. ``Why are they
going to hit me? That's a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Marking time
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wohlers has essentially stopped talking about Mark Wohlers.
Asked if he had considered returning to the minor leagues to work
on his control, he replied, ``No comment.'' Asked if he had spoken
with general manager John Schuerholz about the club's plans,
Wohlers replied, ``Ask John.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers has understandably been a target of extensive media
coverage and it has not worn well on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about it because I don't want to dwell on
my past,'' Wohlers said. ``I want to move forward.''
