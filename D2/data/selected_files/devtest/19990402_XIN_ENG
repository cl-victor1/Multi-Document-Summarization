<HEADLINE> Ugandan Banc Closed for Mismanagement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda, central bank
of the east African country, Thursday declared that it has closed
the Greenland Bank Limited (GBL) for its mismanagement and huge
inside lending.
</P>
<P>
This decision was announced here by the central bank governor,
Charles Kikonyogo, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that from the day of closure, the commercial bank will
stop all its business affairs and operations with the public and
depositors.
</P>
<P>
The governor assured the depositors in the bank that the
central bank will protect their interests.
</P>
<P>
The financial conditions of the Greenland Bank have been
deteriorating over the past months and this closure is to stop the
bank from continuing to slide into the bottomless pit, he added.
</P>
<P>
As of the 41-billion-shilling (41 million U.S. dollars) loans
of the bank, 55 percent went to the companies connected with the
bank or its shareholders, the governor explained, adding that the
bank lost one billion shillings (one million dollars) due to
mismanagement over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
The Greenland Bank has hit headlines here not only because it
was warned from time to time due to its mismanagement, but because
it is the bank through which President Yoweri Museveni's brother
Salim Saleh, former senior presidential advisor on defense and
security, bought 49 percent shares in Uganda Commercial Bank
fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
Salim Saleh was forced to resign after this scandal surfaced
late last year and sparked public rage at the rampant corruption
and irregularities in the country's privatization process.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Adjourns As Requested by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Parliament has adjourned
prematurely following a formal request by the government to be
given more time to study the censure motions against Vice
President Specioza Kazibwe contained in the parliamentary select
committee report.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Speaker Francis Ayume Thursday
after Prime Minister Kintu Musoke had submitted the request, Radio
Uganda reported in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The request said that the government should study the
recommendations contained in the report thoroughly because they
concern the Vice President Kazibwe and her two junior ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament has been in a hot debate on the fate of the vice
 president who is also the Minister of Agriculture, Animal
Industry and Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued after investigations by the committee,
accuses Kazibwe and her two ministers of failing to supervise the
construction of the 15 valley dams which resulted in a loss of 3.4
billion shillings (3.4 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
A censure motion was drafted following the report and it was
backed by most MPs.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe protested her innocence, arguing that the plans for the
valley dam construction had been conceived much earlier before she
was given the ministerial seat.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe's case has been the biggest since the Parliament
embarked on exposing corruption among senior government officials.
So far two ministers have been censured.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament's unprecedented determination to weed corruption
resulted from both the ruling elite's willingness to promote
economic development and pressure from donor countries.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries, mostly European, demanded the Ugandan
government to effectively check corruption before they could
release any more donations into the country' coffers. One third of
Uganda's government spending comes from donations.

NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Thursday said he will soon appoint a vice-president, breaking the
14-month silence on the vacant seat of vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on arrival
from a tour of Namibia and Malawi, Moi said the decision to fill
the number two post, which has remained vacant since last January,
has been goaded by the anxiety of kenyans over the absence of a
vice president.
</P>
<P>
The head of state also dismissed as unnecessary fears that
Kenya is at risk should he die in office before appointing a

<HEADLINE> NATO Senior Official Visits Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 1 (Xinhua) -- General Ruppert Smith, deputy
supreme allied commander of Europe, Thursday visited Romania for a
few hours, as part of a tour of countries neighboring the Kosovo
conflict in order to assess the way how they have backed the NATO
efforts.
</P>
<P>
He had an interview at the Cotroceni Palace with presidential
military aide Dorin Marian. General Smith had met earlier Romanian
Defense Minister Victor Babiuc, general Constantin Degeratu, Chief
of Staff of the Romanian Army, and Elena Zamfirescu, Romanian
Foreign Ministry state secretary.
</P>
<P>
General Smith's visit to Romania was part of the constant
dialogue between Romania and the North-Atlantic Alliance, which
has grown more intense with the beginning of the crisis in Kosovo,
Dorin Marian said, adding that there were permanent contacts now
between Romanian political and military decision makers and the
NATO Headquarters,
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of general Smith's visit, the presidential
aide added, was to inform, at the highest level, about the actions
unfolded by the NATO as part of the Resolute Force Operation and
to give assurances that the Alliance most sincerely appreciated
Romania's clear and steady stand.
</P>
<P>
General Smith told the press that during his visit to Romania
he was able to listen to the Romanian authorities' views on Kosovo
issues. He appreciated both the Romanian President's declarations
and the Parliament's Statement, which, he said, clearly set forth
the Romanian state's stand, consistent with Romania's pro-NATO
option.

<P>
BONN April 1 (Xinhua)--The European Troika Foreign Ministers
with their counterparts from 8 Southeast European countries
Thursday after a meeting appealed closest cooperation between the
states and organizations involved to supply urgent aid for Kosovo
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, in German town of Petersberg, on humanitarian
issues and stability in Balkan region was held between European
Troika and Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia of
Federal Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Top goal of the meeting was to coordinate measures to stabilize
the region and improve the situation of Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) commissar for humanitarian issues Emma
Bonino, the United Nations (UN) refugee commissar Sadako Ogata,
and officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) took part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers said the refugees' needs for food, medical
equipment, equipment for camps and means for transportation should
be met immediately. They called on the NATO to contribute to
humanitarian aid by making available helicopters to transport
refugees and supplies.
</P>
<P>
In the EU presidency statement distributed after the meeting,
the European Troika said that EU would continue its efforts to
help stabilizing the region "in all possible ways".
</P>
<P>
The European Troika stands for Austria, Germany and Finland,
which are respectively the former, present and next rotating
president of EU.
</P>
<P>
A regular airlift will be established to bring supplies to the
refugees, and the European Commission Kosovo Crisis Team will be
reinforced to deal with the refugee issues, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told the press
conference after the meeting, that the EU will "directly and
quickly" help the countries neighboring Yugoslavia to deal with
tens of thousands of refugees that flood in.
</P>
<P>
Fischer stressed that the emergent measure of the EU is to
provide Albania and Macedonia with payments aid, while refugees
have made extraordinary burdens to the two countries and direct
aid of food and medical equipment is hard to organize.

MAPUTO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi said here Thursday that the Chinese-sponsored projects in
agriculture and pharmaceutics are suitable for the need of
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said this while meeting with Zhang Delin, Party
Secretary of the Chongqing Municipality of China, who is leading a
delegation of the Chinese city on a field trip in the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
Despite fast development, Mozambique is still a poor country
and most of its people are still facing the problems of food,
clothes and medicine shortage, the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation projects initiated by Chongqing in agriculture
and pharmaceutics will help Mozambique in alleviating food
shortage and fighting against various diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other projects such as ship building and repairing, and radio
making are also necessary for the Mozambican markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the entrepreneurs from both nations
will invest jointly in the business orientated for the markets in
Mozambique and the southern Africa region.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said that he hopes Chongqing and one of
 Mozambican cities can become sister cities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, which arrived in Maputo on March 25,
spent one week in capital Maputo, central province of Sofala and
northern province of Nampula to assess the conditions for
investment and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In Sofala, Chongqing and the Mozambican side signed a
memorandum on comprehensive development in agriculture and
forestry.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese city is willing to bring new technologies in
growing rice, corn and vegetables to Mozambique to help promote
local economic development and improve the living standards of the
Mozambican people, Zhang said.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has
provided a grant of one million Canadian dollars (about 663,000
U.S. dollars) to the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation, an agency
dedicated to the Burundi peace process.
</P>
<P>
The fund has been channelled through the Canadian International

<HEADLINE> SADC Troops to Withdraw from Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The bulk of the 1,200
peacekeeping troops of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) in Lesotho are to be withdrawn, South African national
television reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Minister Joe Modise said Thursday that
most of the troops would be moved out now that the situation in
Lesotho was stable. But he said a small contingent of instructors
would remain in Lesotho until the country's defense force has been
completely rebuilt and able to function.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Botswana sent their troops to the tiny
mountain kingdom last September to quell an unrest following the
country's general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Modise said a phased withdrawal would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Botswana said earlier this week that it would pull out its 378
soldiers by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Botswana Defense Force colonel Jimmi Masisi, the acting
commanding officer of the SADC operation, said both South African
and Botswanan troops would be withdrawn, leaving only a small
force in Lesotho to monitor the run-up to the elections next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Basotho National Party (BNP), a major opposition
party in Lesotho, has welcomed Botswana's plan to pull out troops
and encouraged South Africa to follow suit.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Statehood Under Consultation: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Thursday the Palestinians are still consulting with friendly
countries on the possible declaration of a Palestinian state on
May 4.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of declaring the Palestinian state is still a point
of discussion with Palestinians' friends and brothers," Arafat
said after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the
Sinai resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in the Red Sea resort town earlier in the day to
brief Mubarak on his tour of Europe and the U.S.. The tour was
intended to drum up support for the Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has hinted declaration of a state on May 4 when the
five-year interim self-rule period envisaged in the Oslo Accord
signed with Israel in 1993 expires.
</P>
<P>
Several countries have reportedly advised Arafat to postpone
the declaration to a later date to avoid complicating the already
troubled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's political advisor Osman el-Baz, who attended the
meeting, told reporters that Egypt supports whatever the
Palestinians decide on the issue of declaring a state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to put the issue before the 125-member
Palestinian Central Council at the end of April to make a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Central Council is an intermediate body between
the Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive Committee and the
Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader is in Egypt as part of a world tour,
which will also take him to Japan, China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to
take tough actions against the Palestinian possible step,
including annexation of parts of the West Bank still under
Israel's control.

KAMPALA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said here Thursday that the incidence of AIDS has decreased from
30 percent to 12 percent among pregnant women over the past 10
years in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
This decrease was attributed to the open sensitization policy
by the Ugandan government.
</P>
<P>
Museveni pointed out that to further combat HIV/AIDS, the real
solution now lies in the reactivation and modernization of a
comprehensive family code.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the strengthening of the clan system in
order to handle the problem of orphans, who constitute nearly 10
percent of the total population and are looked after by their
relatives according to the clan system.
</P>
<P>
He said this when meeting with visiting U.S. senior advisor on
HIV/AIDS at the White House, Sandy Thurman, who led a 20-strong
U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
Thurman said that Uganda has set a good example in the world in
 combating AIDS. She also praised the country's achievement in
this field.

Symptoms of the disease look like that of cold, the statement
said, but it warn that children affected with the strange disease
should never be treated as cold suffers, as the normal injection
of cold medicine might speed up the process of paralyzation.
</P>
<P>
Calls for aid have been sent to the international society, the
statement said, adding that the number of children affected with
the disease is growing.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The operation of the
Uganda's Greenland Bank branch in Tanzania was suspended Thursday
and its administration has been taken over by Tanzania's central
bank.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Tanzania (BoT), said in a statement that the action
was taken after the Bank of Uganda informed it that Greenland Bank
(Uganda) Limited will now be closed down on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Considering the potential effect that the closure may have on
the operations of Greenland Bank (T) Limited, the BoT has taken
over the administration of Greenland Bank effective on the same
day, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"While under the administration of the Bank of Tanzania, all
operations of Greenland Bank (T) Limited shall cease until further
notice," it said.
</P>
<P>
On December 6 last year, the Bank of Uganda took over the
administration of Greenland Bank (Uganda) Limited. Following that
action the BoT said it has been closely watching over the
operations of Greenland Bank (Tanzania) Limited which has been
operating normally.
</P>
<P>
One client, Conrad Dunstan, said he is surprised to see the
bank suspended when he went to draw his money. He said Greenland's
suspension will affect many people who are prepared to spend the
Easter festival.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Dolly the sheep, the first mammal
cloned from an adult cell, has been mum again with the birth of
three lambs, its creators announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both Dolly and her three new children, two males and one
female, were doing well, the Roslin Institute in Scotland said.
</P>
<P>
The three lambs, born on March 24, was Dolly's second
pregnancy. Her first lamb, Bonnie, was born last April after Dolly
was mated with a Welsh mountain ram called David, who is also the
father of the three new lambs.
</P>
<P>
Dolly was born in July 1996 at the Roslin Institute after
scientists inserted a cell from a ewe's udder into an egg after
removing the egg's DNA.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have believed that it is important to breed from
cloned animals to check for any unexpected changes in their
offspring.
</P>
<P>
"The birth of Bonnie almost exactly 12 months ago confirmed
that despite Dolly's unusual origins she is able to breed normally
and produce healthy offspring," said Dr Harry Griffin, the
assistant director of the institute, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The birth of these three lambs is further demonstration of
this," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S., NATO Confirm Capture of U.S. Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and NATO officials
confirmed Thursday that three American soldiers were captured near
the Yugoslav-Macedonia border following a skirmish with Yugoslav
troops.
</P>
<P>
Capt. John Clearwater, spokesman for the U.S. Army's 1st
Infantry Division in Germany, said that the three U.S. soldiers
from his unit, who had lost contact for several hours after being
attacked by unknown troops, "are alive and well and appear
healthy."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Television showed the three American soldiers,
saying that they were captured within the border of Yugoslavia
when on a reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen the pictures on television, we don't like it," said
U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the command of NATO forces. "We're
still investigating where the incident occurred," Clark told a
press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
NATO and U.S. officials said earlier that the three came under
fire and surrendered shortly before losing radio contact about
three miles inside Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana alleged that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would be
held "personally responsible" for the safety of the three American
soldiers. This message, he added, has already been sent to
Yugoslavia through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Yugoslavia, severely defying the air
bombing of U.S.-led NATO forces for more than a week, has shot
down dozens of NATO missiles and airplanes, including an advanced
F-117A stealth fighter Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Measures on Jerusalem Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua)-- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Thursday sharply criticized a Israeli decision on
closing Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem, saying it was
nothing but aggressive measures against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Gaza, the PNA said "the Israeli
decision was a challenge to international legitimacy," stressing
that "Jerusalem forms a red line that can not be overridden," the
Voice of Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israel decided to close three Palestinian offices,
including the office of the Palestinian News Agency, in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But Faisal Husseini, minister of the Jerusalem Affairs of the
PNA, pointed out on the same day that no matter what happens, the
Orient House, the de facto office of the PNA, and other offices in
East Jerusalem will function as usual and remain open to the
public.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken apparently due to the increased
palestinian political and diplomatic activities in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Last week, foreign diplomats in Jerusalem were invited to a
meeting in the Orient House to be briefed on the current situation
in the Mideast peace process despite Israel's strong objections.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, diplomats of the European Union (EU) member states
in Jerusalem were once more invited to the Orient House and the
Palestinian officials expressed their gratitude for the EU's
support for their right of self-determination in declaring an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has threatened to declared an independent state on May
4 when the five-year interim Palestinian self-rule expires
according to the 1993 Oslo Accord. The EU supports the
Palestinians' right on the statehood.
</P>
<P>
The EU also rejects Israel's claim that Jerusalem is its
eternal capital, saying the fate of Jerusalem should be settled in
the final status talks in line with the Oslo Accord.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks, which have yet to start, should have
begun by May in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Basis for Agreement Reached in N.Irish Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Thursday that Northern Ireland's talks on disarmament were
adjourned to April 13 but politicians had reached a "basis for
agreement."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with the Irish Taoiseach
Bertie Ahern at Hillsborough Castle after three days of talks,
Blair said both governments were convinced they would get full
agreement from all parties in favor of a "declaration" setting out
a timescale for establishing the Northern Ireland Assembly's
executive and the decommissioning of weapons.
</P>
<P>
"There is no turning back on the road to peace," he said,
adding the latest agreement was another "huge and significant
milestone."
</P>
<P>
Blair described the three-day talks as being about dialogue and
leaving the past behind.
</P>
<P>
"One year on we can be proud to say it is clear that all of the
parties are wedded to the Good Friday Agreement."
</P>
<P>
He also said the adjournment was now a "short pause for
reflection."
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would publish a declaration which
would allow the institutions in the agreement, the ruling
executive, the North-South Council, the cross-border bodies and
the British-Irish Council to be put in place within the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock sprang from the refusal of the Ulster Unionists to
allow Sinn Fein to take up its seats in the Northern Ireland
Assembly executive without a start to IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams expressed disappointment that
the deadline of setting up the provincial executive had been
missed.

vulnerable groups, the IGC said.

LUANDA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Organization for
Migration decided Thursday to close its office in Luanda, capital
of Angola, for sheer financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
Mario Tavolla, representative of the migration organization to
Luanda, said that the deficit-ridden organization was forced to
make the decision after it received no response from the
international society for its Angolan aid call.
</P>
<P>
Tavolla said that leaders of the organization toured the
southern African country recently and decided that its office in
South Africa will cover its affairs in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Though the office in Luanda is closed, the representative said,
the organization will continue its current programs and will
develop new programs in the future.
</P>
<P>
International Organization for Migration was established in
1951, aimed at facilitating the legal migration of people across
the world, offering necessary help to refugees and displaced. The
organization entered Angola in 1997 to help repatriate the war
refugees.

<P>
ANKARA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Air Force Commander Ilhan
Kilic said on Thursday Greece has opened its air space to Turkish
cargo planes carrying humanitarian aid to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia News Agency quoted Kilic as saying in the central

It was the first time that Greece opened its air space to
Turkish cargo planes, he said, adding "our planes brought 36
tonnes of food and medicine of Red Crescent to Albania."
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any difficulty in transportation of aid to
Tirana," said the commander, adding that as long as the Red
Crescent wishes, the Turkish cargo planes will continue to
transport humanitarian aid and Greece doesn't cause any difficulty
regarding this issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey's Red Crescent has also sent 11 trucks of
humanitarian aid to Albania and Macedonia, where tens of thousands
of Kosovo Albanian refugees have poured in since the North

<HEADLINE> China Holds Dinosaur Exhibition in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese dinosaur museum is
holding a unique dinosaur exhibition in Johannesburg, South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
On display are eight complete dinosaur fossil skeletons and
about 90 pieces of fossil specimens of dinosaurs and other
animals.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is the first ever of its kind in South Africa
and is expected to attract quite a lot of visitors, said Hilary
Bruce, director of Museum Africa, where the display is being held.
</P>
<P>
All the articles are from Zigong Dinosaur Museum of Sichuan,
China, the biggest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The fossils of the dinosaurs on display, which lived in the
middle of the Jurassic Period, are rare in other parts of the
world, according to Peng Guangzhao, deputy director of the Zigong
Dinosaur Museum.
</P>
<P>
At an opening ceremony Thursday afternoon, Chairman of South
Africa's National Arts Council, John Kani, said the exhibition has
special significance to Africans as Africans did not record their
history in writing. Such exhibitions, therefore, can be very
informative and educational, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which is part of the Sino-South African
cultural exchange program, will run until July 1.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria '99, First FIFA Competition in Sub-Saharan Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The 10th World Youth Championship (
WYC) will be held from April 3 to 24 in Nigeria and this is the
first time that a FIFA (Federation of International Football
Association) competition has been hosted by a country in Sub-
Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U-20 WYC tagged Nigeria '99 is also the first time for
Nigeria to host such an international football championship in
which 24 teams all over the world will participate.
</P>
<P>
Nigerians were originally scheduled to run the 1995 event, but
medical considerations made it necessary to alter the venue that
year with Qatar springing in to fill the gap at short notice.
</P>
<P>
Although the local organizing committee of Nigeria has no
experience of running a major event of this calibre with worldwide
interest, they are very active in their efforts to make sure
things run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has also made funds available for
bringing facilities in eight venues in the most populous African
country up to the required level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the host country of Nigeria must be counted among
the favourites who will compete for the coveted WYC trophy for
1999.
</P>
<P>
Their best achievement so far was winning the Olympic Football
tournament in 1996 by the national A team called "Super Eagles"
which have also performed well at continental level and on their
appearances in the World Cup finals rounds in 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the U-20 category, no African team has ever made it right to
the top, but Nigeria reached the final in 1989 and Ghana also took
silver in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Of the eight U-17 world championships held so far, African
teams have won on four occasions, that is, Nigeria in 1985 and
1993 and Ghana in 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The countries which top the list are Brazil and Argentina with
three wins each at the WYC, and Argentina, champions in 1995 in
Qatar and 1997 in Malaysia will be going for a record of three
titles in a row.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacles to further South American success will come
from Europe in the form of 1981 champions Germany and double
winners Portugal (1989 and 1991) as well as from Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Asian teams will be hoping to improve on past performances,
and this time their contingent includes a newcomer to the
competition in the shape of Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Defends Policy Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) Javier Solana Thursday defended the
19-nation alliance's aggression policy in Yugoslavia, saying
NATO's cause "is a just one."
</P>
<P>
Solana told reporters here that NATO tried to achieve political
goals through negotiations, but Yugoslav leader rejected the
Rambouillet agreement. NATO heads had time and again repeated as
such recently.
</P>
<P>
"He left the alliance no other option but to start military
operations," the NATO chief said, indicating the West could not
find any other way to deal with the Kosovo crisis, but only war
against Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader. NATO has always
said it is not at war with the Yugoslav people but their leader.
</P>
<P>
"NATO will stop only when he stops," Solana told reporters at
the Brussels-based NATO headquarters when he and NATO Supreme
Commander Wesley Clark were briefing assessment on NATO attacks in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has begun a difficult operation. But we believe that it
is the right thing to do, and that it is our duty to do whatever
we can to stop the killing in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's chief said the ring is closing around the
Yugoslav armed forces. "The impact of our air campaign will be
increasingly cumulative. This is an effective operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana also defended NATO's bombing in Kosovo which some
observers hold has created humanitarian disaster after a crowd of
refugees fled into neighboring countries. "There is only one
person responsible for all of the refugees now flowing into the
neighboring countries, and that is Milosevic."
</P>
<P>
"Every refugee testifies that Milosevic's soldiers drove them
from their homes, not NATO bombs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO leader of the aggression forces in Yugoslavia also
warned the Yugoslav leader that as NATO pressure increases, "he
will be forced to stop his aggression."
</P>
<P>
The NATO air attack operation in Yugoslavia entered into the
eighth day Thursday, but it did not make much progress because of
the strong defensive system of Yugoslav forces and what NATO
termed as unfavorable weather. Therefore, Solana said the NATO
attack "is not a situation that can be resolved in 24 or 48
hours." "We will be successful but we need stamina and
determination," he added.

<HEADLINE> ADB Loan Important for Promotion of Pak Trade, Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The approval of a 300 million
U.S. dollar loan by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to Pakistan
is an important stride towards liberalizing import and freer trade
in the country, ADB sources here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ADB announced Wednesday that it had cleared a 300 million
dollar loan to Pakistan to support the country's trade, export
promotion and industry program.
</P>
<P>
The first tranche of 200 million dollars of the ADB loan
approved Wednesday was disbursed on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the ADB resident mission here said the loan for
trade, export promotion and industry will lessen chronic trade and
industry distortions in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The trade, export promotion and industry program will
rationalize tariffs, remove non-tariff barriers and give exporters
better excess to imported inputs and finance at market prices, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan will also modernize export policies and improve
the administration, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
This would slash Pakistan's dependence on import substitution
and lay the foundation for export promotion by placing domestic
players on an equal footing with foreign competitors, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The program will also support the implementation of the new
investment policy and the privatization of public manufacturing
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the medium-term economic reform program supported
by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the ADB.

<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Dalian Wanda
and last season's runners-up Shanghai Shenhua kept unbeaten in the
new season as both were held draws on Thursday in the third round
of the Chinese soccer league.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, four-time champion of the five-year league, drew with
Shenzhen Ping'an 1-1 in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, collecting
just two points from two draws and one loss and wandering at the
10th place in the 14-team standings.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua got its third ties of the season when the team was held
a goalless draw by Shandong Luneng in Jinan, Shandong Province to
stay in the middle of the standings.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Guo'an and Sichuan Quanxing is sharing the top place of
the league with seven points as Guo'an defeated Wuhan Heart K 1-0
in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and Quanxing beat Qingdao Hainiu 2-0 at
home in Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Fushun, who returned to the top level of the Chinese
soccer after two-year spell in the second division, stepped down

a 1-1 draw with Shenyang Haishi in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The fourth place went to Guangzhou Songri, who beat Chongqing

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Hospital Shows Wounded Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Ivan Tanasijevic, 14, lies in the
intensive care unit of the Clinical Center of Serbia in central
Belgrade, with catheters in his mouth and nostrils and a
ventilator beside him.
</P>
<P>
Ivan, a Bosnian refugee, was admitted to the Clinical Center of
Serbia in a comma with a fractured scull, brain hemorrhage. He was
hit by bricks and debris after his house collapsed in NATO
bombardment Wednesday in Loznitsa, said Vlada Vostic, a doctor
with the center's neurology department.
</P>
<P>
Losnitsa, located near the Serbian border with Bosnia, is 150
kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Ivan was one of the seven civilians severely wounded in NATO
bombings on Yugoslavia, which entered its ninth day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dobrica Vukojicic, a 46-year-old farmer, was wounded Wednesday
when NATO launched air raids on Kraljevo, a city 160 kilometers
south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Dejan Lukic, 13, was also wounded in Loznitsa. His whole right
leg was bondaged. A catheter was attached to his urethra.
</P>
<P>
Besides physiological damage, the civilian population were
under severe psychological pressure.
</P>
<P>
Boris Grubichic, 18, jumped from the top floor of the
McDonald's in central Belgrade on March 24, the first night of
NATO's bombing campaign. He died in the clinical center in the
previous day, the head nurse told about a dozen foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
With news that NATO was planning to bomb government agencies,
doctors, nurses and patients were under increasing panic, as an
army headquarters is only across the street from the department of
neurology and another clinic is only about 100 meters from the
Interior Ministry, Vostic said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the patients, including those with cancer, have gone
home, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to understand that you can establish a new world
order or help someone by bombing," Vostic said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Spending Posts Strong Growth in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Americans' spending on goods
and services jumped a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in February,
after a 0.4 percent rise in January, the Commerce Department said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Personal income also showed a robust growth at a seasonally
adjusted 0.5 percent in February following a 0.6 percent gain in
January. As Americans' spending outpaced income in February, the
nation's savings rate was dragged into the negative territory
again.
</P>
<P>
Both figures were expected by analysts and illustrate the
strength of the U.S. economy during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Income growth has been supported by rising wages, up 0.7
percent in February. Demand for labor is strong, with the nation's
unemployment rate hovering near a 29-year low.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting that, the Labor Department reported Thursday that
first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell by 6,000 to
289,000 last week. The claims have kept under 300,000 for nine
weeks in a row, a stretch unprecedented since 1973.
</P>
<P>
Americans' spending, however, has been supported by more than
job income. They're spending some of their stock market gains and
tapping into their home equity through refinancing.
</P>
<P>
That's produced the lowest personal savings rate -- savings as
a percentage of after-tax income -- since the 1930s. It was minus
0.2 percent in February, the fifth month in six at or below zero.
</P>
<P>
In addition to wages, other income categories increasing were
business owners' income, transfer payments such as Social
Security, interest and dividends and rental income. Farmers'
income, however, fell.
</P>
<P>
Spending was led by a 2.9 percent jump in purchases of durable
goods, big-ticket items expected to last three or more years. Much
of that was for autos. Spending rose 0.6 percent for nondurable
goods such as food and fuel and 0.3 percent for services.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of economic vigor, the Commerce Department
reported separately that construction spending jumped a
much-stronger-than-expected 2.2 percent in February, the largest
increase in eight months and the fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
Construction spending was led by a 4.7 percent surge in
government projects, reflecting a 10.4 percent increase for
highways and streets.
</P>
<P>
Commercial construction increased 3.9 percent, with gains in
industrial projects, office buildings and retail stores.
Residential construction rose 0.8 percent, including a 1.5 percent
advance for single-family homes.

<HEADLINE> Russian Warships' Entrance to Mediterranean Will </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here on Thursday the passage of Russian warships
through Turkish straits to the Mediterranean Sea or the Adriatic
Sea would recover the morale of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit told reporters that the deployment of the Russian
warships to the region might also embolden Belgrade to kill
ethnic Albanians in the warring Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Russian warships would be carrying
out "reconnaissance tasks" in the war zone "because of the
ongoing situation in Yugoslavia," which has been under air attacks
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization since March 24 for its
refusal to sign a peace deal with the separatist Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has given the green light to a Russian
naval squadron to pass through the Canakkale and Bosphorus
Straits linking the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea between
April 3 and 8.
</P>
<P>
The Russian embassy in Ankara has presented two requests for
the passage of eight Russian warships through its straits.
</P>
<P>
The fleet will include a missile carrier, anti-submarine
frigates and other escort vessels from the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The passage of foreign warships through the Turkish straits
is overseen by the 1936 Treaty of Montreux.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Black Sea littoral states can sail
their ships through the straits if they inform the Turkish
authorities of their intentions at least eight days in advance.

WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton pledged
Thursday that the United States will do everything in its power to
gain the return of three Army soldiers captured near the
Yugoslav-Macedonia border.
</P>

Yugoslav President Slobodan "Milosevic should make no mistake:
We will hold him and his government responsible for their safety

Virginia State of the country.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Clinton spoke, Yugoslav state-controlled
television announced that the three soldiers would face criminal
proceedings before a military court on Friday.

The television showed the American soldiers, saying that they

reconnaissance mission on Wednesday night.

"There was absolutely no basis for them to be taken," Clinton
said. "There is no basis for them to be held. There is certainly
no basis for them to be tried."

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili Muluzi
inaugurated the first national television station in the country
in Blantyre Thursday, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi described the launching of the television station as a
landmark for his government's efforts to promote freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
"We made sure that this project comes to pass in order to
promote freedom of expression in the couVtry" of over 10 million
people, he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi witnessed the
inauguration. He advised the Malawians to use television as a
tool for development, not as a platform to promote violence and
immorality.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi noted that he would make sure professional ethics are
followed at the state-run station, saying that "this will never be
allowed to be a chewgum of immorality and violence."
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, there are some 40,000 TV sets in the
southern African country, which means that the newly-launched
television station will have some 250,000 viewers.

Territories, will cover 2.2 square kilometres of tundra, ice cap
and rock, frozen coast, about four times as big as France.
</P>
<P>
That vast expanse is populated by only 25,000 people--85
percent of them Inuit. They are scattered throughout the
territory's 28 communities, which are linked almost exclusively by
air.
</P>
<P>
Nunavut, or "our land" in the language of the Inuit, was born
out of a 1992 land claim agreement, the result of more than 20
years of negotiations under which the Inuit agreed to give up any
future aboriginal rights to their traditional land in return for a
government for their own territory.
</P>
<P>
The formation of Nunavut is the first redrawing of the Canadian
map since the entry of Newfoundland-- which is celebrating its
50th anniversary the same day. Nunavut has been become the
country's third territory in addition to 10 provinces.
</P>
<P>
The territory's new premier, Paul Okalik, was officially sworn
Thursday in Iqaluit, the Nunavut Capital, becoming the first Inuk
premier in Canadian history. he was elected to the job by the
19-member legislature earlier this month. Okalik 34, is an Inuk
(singular for Inuit). He graduated from the University of Ottawa
law school in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the creation of the new territory
Thursday, Canadian Prime Premier Jean Chretien said:"through the
creation of Nunavut, Canada is showing the World, once again, how
we joyfully embrace our many peoples and cultures."

<HEADLINE> Kenya President to Name Vice-president Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Thursday said that he will soon appoint a vice-president, breaking
his 14-month silence on the vacant seat of vice-presidency.
</P>
<P>
"I will soon name a vice president so that we can see if your
grumbling and fears will end," Moi said. "But even if I appoint a
vice-president, the number of pans of maize meal you cook in your
homes will not increase."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on arrival
from a tour of Namibia and Malawi, Moi said his decision to fill
the number two post, which has remained vacant since last January,
has been goaded by the anxiety of Kenyans over the absence of a
vice president.
</P>
<P>
The head of state also dismissed as unnecessary worries that
Kenya is at risk should he die in office before appointing a
deputy.
</P>
<P>
The absence of a vice president has become the hottest issue in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan leading newspapers have been carrying front-page news
stories entitled as "Give Us A VP!", "17 MPs Say No to An Extra
Moi Term" and the like.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan opposition parties have indicted Moi for failing to
appoint a vice-president as stipulated by the current
constitution.
</P>
<P>
A legislator from the opposition party, Ford-Kenya, has
submitted a motion of a censure of Moi to Kenyan National Assembly
(Parliament) ahead of its April 6 reopening after the adjournment
since last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties alleged that Moi's non-compliance with
the constitution affected negatively on the constitutional review
process.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that there was no constitutional basis for Moi
to stay in office beyond the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
They opposed any attempt to change the current constitution to
allow Moi to serve an extra term.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan political observers believed that Moi's promise to name
a vice- president is meant to appease the debate.
</P>
<P>
In his previous 1992-1997 term, he appointed a weak figure from
Masai tribe as his deputy.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Government Regulates Commuter Taxis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Transport Licensing Board
will regulate all matatus (commuter taxis) operating in the
country and matatu touts will no longer be allowed to mill around
terminuses, a local source said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Francis ole Sompisha, head of the board, said that city and
local councils across the country will manage all bus and matatu
terminuses and device a method of getting revenue for improving
and maintaining the terminus facilities.
</P>
<P>
Matatu and bus owners will be free from now on to hire drivers
and conductors of their choice and give them badges obtained from
the Registrar of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Sompisha said that these were some of the new measures
announced Thursday to end the reign of self-appointed syndicates
controlling the matatu business, adding that his board has assumed
sole authority to allot routes to matatus and buses.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that these measures to be taken by his board are
to ensure safety and to harmonize the country's transport as the
matatu operators are often ignorant of the traffic rules and cause
many road accidents by speeding or stopping at wrong places.
</P>
<P>
The move requires that drivers and conductors must have
identification badges issued by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
and they must apply for licenses to operate public service
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The official said his board had consulted Philemon Abong'o,
Police Commissioner of Kenya, over the implementation of the new
system. He said no driver or conductor would be allowed to
operate without a license.
</P>
<P>
The Transport Licensing Board, established in 1957, consists of
a chairman appointed by the state president, and eight other
members appointed by the minister for transport to represent each
province.

The car was riddled with bullets and the passenger window
shattered, said Kaunda's son. The gunmen then sped off.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice President Meets ROK Parliamentarians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao
met with a parliamentary delegation from the Republic of Korea (
ROK) here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, comprised of parliamentarians from three major
ROK political parties, is here at the invitation of the
International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Hu said that Sino-ROK relations in various fields have seen
many achievements since the two countries forged diplomatic ties,
and the leaders of the two countries have decided to establish a
cooperative partnership oriented towards the next century. China
is ready to work together with the ROK to build a mutually
beneficial, healthy and stable bilateral relationship, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said that increasing
exchanges between the CPC and major ROK parties will be
significant for the growth of Sino-ROK cooperative ties. He also
expressed the belief that bilateral relations will be reinforced
through joint efforts of statesmen and frank exchanges between the
political parties of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lee Sei Kee, head of the delegation, told Hu that the ROK's
major political parties share a common understanding in promoting
ROK-China relations, though they have differences in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The growth of ROK-China ties will benefit peace and stability
in Asia during a complex international situation, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the delegation hopes to increase mutual
understanding and trust through its present China tour and
contribute to the development of bilateral ties.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Yugoslavia said Thursday that three captured U.S. soldiers
will face a military court today, posing a new challenge to the
United States. President Clinton issued a strong warning that he
will hold President Slobodan Milosevic responsible if the three
Americans are harmed or mistreated.
</P>
<P>
-- Ten days into the allied bombing campaign over Yugoslavia,
stakes are growing for Clinton. The resolute president, who has
few options and many risks, is up late and up early on the line
with aides getting the latest news on Kosovo and enlisting help
from foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Allied forces today destroyed a bridge over the Danube River
in Serbia and attacked a Serbian mechanized column that had been
involved in purges in Kosovo, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- Western officials are discussing a plan under which NATO
troops would escort ethnic Albanians back into Kosovo after
Serbian forces there have been routed by bombing, and would set up
a self-governing enclave under allied protection, a senior NATO
diplomat said today.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Finger-pointing begins at the Pentagon over criticism of the
Kosovo bombing. Army and Marine officers grumble that the Air
Force oversold air power, and Air Force officers say the air
campaign is too limited in scope and size.
</P>
<P>
-- Manufacturing continued to recover in March, as a key index
posted its third consecutive monthly increase. Several auto makers
had record March sales amid robust demand for pricey trucks,
prompting analysts to boost 1999 estimates. DaimlerChrysler
reported strong Chrysler sales.

<HEADLINE> China Reinsurance Company Aims For World's Top Ten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Dai Fengju, general manager of the
China Reinsurance Company (China Re), said here today that the
company expects to elbow into the world's top ten within ten years.
</P>
<P>
Dai made the remark at an ongoing nationwide conference on
reinsurance. China Re plans to develop into a modern insurance
company based on international standards, he added.
</P>
<P>
China Re grew out of the Reinsurance Company under the
People's Insurance Corporation of China (PICC) which was disbanded
in October 1998, and its subsidiaries, including life insurance,
property insurance and reinsurance companies, have all become
state-owned independent insurers.
</P>
<P>
This March, China Re was established with registered capital of
three billion yuan, including 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that China Re is scheduled to set up subsidiaries in
both Shanghai and Shenzhen within the year, and begins preparatory
work for the establishment of representative offices in Hong Kong
and Macao.

<HEADLINE> Japan's 152 Local Assemblies Oppose Guideline Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan's 152 local assemblies have
adopted resolutions opposing a set of bills aimed at implementing
the revised Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines, a survey
released Friday said.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News said the survey, conducted by a group opposed to the
bills, showed that as of Thursday, one prefectural assembly and
151 municipal assemblies in 30 of Japan's 47 prefectures expressed
opposition to the bills or misgivings about them.
</P>
<P>
The bills are currently being deliberated in the Diet (
parliament), with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) eager
to get them enacted.
</P>
<P>
Shizuoka Prefectural Assembly said in its resolution that the
guidelines would have a significant impact on inhabitants' lives
and economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 10,000-strong union of private university teachers
in Tokyo issued a statement Friday expressing opposition to the
bills.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the guidelines could draw Japan into wars, and that
they will effectively change the current Japan-U.S. security
treaty for the worse, the union urged the Japanese central
government scrap the bills,
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Japan and the United States updated the defense
guidelines which would allow Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to
provide rear-area logistical support to U.S. forces and to conduct
search and rescue operations during emergencies in unspecified "
areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
The bills also affect Japanese local governments by requiring
them to allow U.S. forces to use ports and airports under their
control and to accept injured at local hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Dog Is Wet-Nurse To Five Lion Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Five newborn lion cubs in the
north China city of Shijiazhuang are being wet-nursed by a dog
because their mother has insufficient milk.
</P>
<P>
The dog was chosen from among some 20 candidates before the
mother lion in the city's zoo gave the birth on Thursday,
according to zookeeper Wang Wanhua.
</P>
<P>
"The dog lost her own baby just three days ago, maybe that's
the reason why she looks rather maternal to the lion cubs," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
The six-year old mother lion, "Xinxin." is unable to produce
enough milk even though she has given birth to eleven other cubs.
But those cubs were fed with artificial food and became ill
because of weak immune systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
The zookeepers, who decided dog milk would be suitable for lion
cubs, started to look for a wet-nurse dog through the local media
soon after "Xinxin" became pregnant. More than 20 people responded
recommending their dogs, before one was finally selected.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Falls to 29-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The nationwide unemployment
rate in the United States dropped to a new 29-year low of 4.2
percent in March despite continued job losses in manufacturing and
sluggish job growth elsewhere, the Labor Department reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted rate, based on a survey of households,
fell from 4.4 percent in February and was the lowest since
February 1970, when the rate was also 4.2 percent
</P>
<P>
However, a separate survey showed employers added just 46,000
jobs in March to their payrolls, in contrast to 297,000 jobs in
February and 217,000 in January. It was the smallest number since
jobs declined in January 1996 when a blizzard struck the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers, many hit hard by the global economic slump that
began in Asia near two years ago, cut 35,000 jobs last month,
bringing the decline for the past year to 381,000.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, losses have been most severe at factories
making industrial machinery, apparel and electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Construction hiring fell by a seasonally adjusted 47,000 jobs
in March after the actual gain in jobs fell short of the normal
advance for the start of spring.
</P>
<P>
Mining, which includes oil-drilling, lost 7,000 jobs in March,
bringing losses over the past year to 55,000. Agricultural
services and real estate also recorded declines.
</P>
<P>
However, robust employment growth continued in engineering and
management services, health care, educational services and
amusement and recreation. There also were gains in computer and
data processing and finance and insurance.
</P>
<P>
By demographic group, the jobless rate for Hispanics fell from
6.7 percent in February to 5.8 percent, the lowest on record since
the Labor Department began calculating a separate rate for the
group in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The rate fell from 3.8 percent to 3.6 percent for whites, from
8.3 percent to 8.1 percent for blacks and from 3.7 percent to 3.2
percent for men. It rose from 3.8 percent to 3.9 percent for women
and from 14.1 percent to 14.3 percent for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
The rate for adults who dropped out of high school fell from
7.5 percent to 6.1 percent. For high school graduates it was
unchanged at 3.4 percent and, for college graduates, unchanged at
1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings for non-farm, non-supervisory workers
rose 3 cents in March to 13.09 U.S. dollars. They're up 3.6
percent from a year earlier. The average workweek declined by a
tenth of an hour to 34.5 hours.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs officers
seized a huge batch of pirated Video Compact Discs (VCDs)
estimated at a value of about one million HK dollars (about 128,
200 U.S. dollars) in a latest operation, government sources said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a two-week-long investigation, Customs officers raided an
optical disc packaging and storage center on Thursday night,
capturing 60,000 pirated VCDs and arresting four suspects.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department said Friday
that the department would continue to take vigorous enforcement
action against piracy activities including those involving retail
shops on the street during Easter and the traditional Tomb
Sweeping holidays, which start Friday and end next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The on-going anti-piracy operations demonstrate our
determination in combating piracy activities and preserving the
good image of Hong Kong," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Since the operation, code-named "Thunderbolt", started in mid-
March this year, Hong Kong Customs officers have raided 207 shops,
seized 800,000 pirated optical discs, worth 17 million HK dollars
(about 2.2 million U.S. dollars) and arrested 124 suspects.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Further Open Its Telecom Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China will further open its
telecommunications market by conducting an experimental
introduction of foreign funds into the telecom operations of the
Pudong New Area in Shanghai, said Wu Jichuan, minister of
Information Industry (MII), at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Posts and Telecommunications Administrative Bureau
signed an agreement with AT&AMP;T on March 31 to jointly handle
telecom services in Pudong, making AT&AMP;T the first foreign company
to enter this sector in China.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be submitted to the State Council for
approval and will become effective nine months after the approval,
said Wu, who called this a "breakthrough" on the way to opening up
the country's telecom sector.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the MII will intensify management of the
domestic market to help national telecom enterprises upgrade their
competitive position in the world market, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country currently has about 2,900
telecom service companies, including China Telecom and China
Unicom, and many Internet service providers (ISP) and Internet
content providers (ICP).
</P>
<P>
Wu also encouraged China's telecom sector to accelerate the
absorption of advanced foreign techniques, and improve China's own
technology.
</P>
<P>
China's telecom industry began manufacturing program-controlled
switchboards for telephones in 1982, and their products now occupy
98 percent of the domestic market, and are also exported.

<HEADLINE> International Volunteers Plant Trees in Xiandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIANDU (Zhejiang), April 2 (Xinhua) -- The members of the `99
China International Young Volunteers Camp today added beauty to
the landscape by planting trees in Xiandu in east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day camp, the fourth of its kind ever held in China,
focuses on environmental protection and cultural exchange, with
young volunteers from a number of countries, including Japan,
Britain, Australia, the Republic of Korea and Canada attending the
camp along with Chinese youth.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 campers worked hard digging holes, carrying soil
and planting two-meter-high cypresses. "I never imagined that I
would have the opportunity to plant trees in Xiandu," said Marcela
Kraemerova, from the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Marcela, the youngest camper among the foreign volunteers, also
said she was very happy to do some work for environmental
protection in Xiandu.
</P>
<P>
Gavin Starks from Scotland did his planting quickly. "This is
easier than I did before," said Starks, who has been to other work
camps both in Scotland and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In the days to come, the campers will repair roads and provide
many kinds of voluntary services to the local communities, and
conduct exchanges with the local students.
</P>
<P>
The International Young Volunteers Camp was started by
youngsters from Germany and France in the 1920s as part of an
effort to rehabilitate farms and pastures destroyed during the
First World War.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides on Friday described the government's position on the
Yugoslav crisis as "balanced, taking into consideration Cyprus'
interests".
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides made the remarks when he was briefing Cyprus' party
leaders or representatives on the government position regarding
the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
House (Parliament) President Spyros Kyprianou had announced
that Cyprus would organize an all party rally on Saturday to
condemn the continuing air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Later Friday, the House plenary is expected to approve a
petition condemning the bombings in Yugoslavia and calling for a
political settlement to the problem.
</P>
<P>
But the Government Spokesman Costas Serezis on Friday told the
reporters that the government will not participate in the all
party rally, and at the same time it is not trying to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister explained to the party representatives
that Cyprus must take into consideration its European Union (EU)
accession course.
</P>
<P>
The NATO started the air strikes on March 24 after
West-brokered peace talks between the Belgrade government and the
separatist ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province collapsed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Antarctic Expedition Returns to Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese ship Xuelong (Snow
Dragon) docked at the port of Shanghai today, marking the
successful conclusion of its scientific expedition to the South
Pole.
</P>
<P>
The Xuelong departed Shanghai on November 5 last year,
embarking on China's 15th expedition to the Antarctic continent
since the first expedition was mounted in 1984. The Xuelong sailed
20,326 nautical miles over a period of 149 days to reach its
destination.
</P>
<P>
Members of the expedition conducted scientific research and
environmental protection activities, including the collection of
more than 200 tons of waste and rubbish which were shipping back
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Significant progress was made toward the realization of
research goals outlined in China's 1996-2000 Guidelines for
Antarctic Research. The team's studies of the Antarctic ice cover
not only will provide a deeper understanding of the laws of global
climate changes, but will also greatly enhance the ability to
predict future changes.
</P>
<P>
The team of explorers traveled 1,100 kilometers toward the
polar ice cap, reaching the pole's highest point, and drilled rich
and varied ice samples.
</P>
<P>
The team also went to Grove Mountains where they found four
meteorites and a place to anchor their ship on the southeastern
portion of the pole.
</P>
<P>
An airport currently being built jointly by China, Russia, and
Australia in the ice-covered region is well under way, and is
scheduled to be completed at the beginning of the next century.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- It is China's basic foreign policy
to develop friendly cooperative ties with other developing nations,
President Jiang Zemin said here today while meeting with Yemeni
Vice President Abdo Rabo Mansour Hadi.
</P>
<P>
This is because China itself is a developing country, Jiang
said, adding that his country is ready to promote 21st-century
oriented friendship and cooperation with Yemen in accord with the
five principles of peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that friendly contacts between the two peoples have
a long history, adding that since the establishment of diplomatic
ties between the two nations 40 years ago, bilateral friendship
and cooperation have always maintained good momentum.
</P>
<P>
China firmly stands by the reunification of Yemen and
appreciates Yemen's adherence to the "one China" policy, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the two countries have also conducted fruitful
cooperation in the economic and trade sectors, and expressed his
belief that such cooperation will be furthered and deepened
through concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
China is pleased that the situation is stable in Yemen, which
has solved border issues with its neighboring nations by peaceful
means, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Hadi said bilateral friendly cooperative ties have enjoyed
continuous promotion during the past four decades, and his
government and people thank China for its unselfish assistance to
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
China, as an important and influential nation within the U.N.
Security Council, is a significant force for maintaining world
peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hadi said Yemen appreciates China's support for the Middle East
peace process and voiced the hope that China will play its due
role in this process.
</P>
<P>
He conveyed greetings from President Ali Abdullah Saleh to
Jiang, who asked that his best wishes be returned to Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Hadi, who arrived here Wednesday for an official visit as guest
of his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao, conferred with Hu on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Beijing, Hadi will travel to Shanghai and
Shenzhen.

BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's third army commander
Major General Sommai Vichavorn confirmed on Friday that nine Thai
villagers have been killed near the border with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted Thai border officials as saying the
killings took place in an area notorious as a drugs transit route
used by ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
The nine men were captured by an unidentified Myanmar group
before they were killed. Their bodies were found in the Fang
district of Chiang Mai province in northern Thailand, about three
kilometers from the border. It was unknown when the killing took
place.
</P>
<P>
Sommai said the killings were a serious infringement of Thai
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"I is a serious action. The military is checking how it
happened, who they are and why they were in Thailand," he told
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's First Bank Withdraws from Ticket Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The First Bank of Nigeria, official
banker of the 10th World Youth Championship (WYC), has withdrawn
from the agreement to sell tickets of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The bank pulled out of the earlier arrangement on Thursday
evening because of the incompetence of the Local Organizing
Committee (LOC) which had not delivered the tickets for sale less
than 48 hours to kick off the championship tagged Nigeria '99.
</P>
<P>
In a news release, the bank said that the LOC was supposed to
have delivered the tickets to its head office since January 31 for
ware-housing and subsequent distribution to agents accredited by
the LOC in all the designated eight venues.
</P>
<P>
The tickets, as at 5 p.m. on April 1, have not been delivered,
thus negating all the arrangements made by the bank to mobilize
resources in readiness for the distribution, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The LOC has also not provided the bank with a list of its
accredited agents to whom distribution should be made in various
zones, it added.
</P>
<P>
Given the above scenario, the release said, the First Bank of
Nigeria has not been placed in a position to render the necessary
logistical support for effective distribution of the gate tickets.
</P>
<P>
This development has left anxious Nigerians and indeed, those
of the participating countries in a quandary, local newspapers
said Friday.

SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Project Hope has received
more than 100 million yuan in donations from some five million
Shanghai residents over the past five year, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
The donations have funded the establishment of 520 schools

Among these unselfish donors, Fu Ying, a retired worker

personal savings to the project, saying that "education is very
important for the younger generation, and they need money more
than an old lady like me."
</P>
<P>
Most impressive is the fact that hundreds of donors refused to
disclose their names. One such, under the pseudonym "Happy Man,"
donated a total of 48,000 yuan over the past four years, which has
helped 70 dropouts to resume their schooling.

FUZHOU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Today is China's Tomb Sweeping
Festival, and the ashes of 80 deceased people of the city of
Fuzhou in east China were scattered into the sea by their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
This activity, sponsored by the city's bureau of civil affairs,
was the third such in Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wenji, 74, accompanied by his wife, scattered the ashes of

"I hope my mother has eternal life in the sea," he said.

ceremony for the first time in 1997, there were only a few people
willing to scatter the ashes of their relatives into sea.

While only four people's ashes were scattered into sea in 1997,
the number soared to 66 in 1998 when the event was held for the
second time.

<HEADLINE> China Standardizes Overseas-Listed Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China has adopted eleven new
regulations to standardize the operations of the 43 overseas-
listed companies in order to better protect the interests of
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
These regulations, jointly formulated by the State Economic and
Trade Commission (SETC) and the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), are designated to solve existing problems in
the operations of overseas-listed companies.
</P>
<P>
These follow the five measures CSRC Chairman Zhou Zhengqing
pledged to international investors in London in February.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations require the boards and management of
overseas-listed companies to increase transparency by establishing
and perfecting information-disclosure mechanisms. CSRC has also
drafted a set of rules on information disclosure for these
overseas-listed companies.
</P>
<P>
These rules prohibit government shareholders and their
representatives from bypassing boards of directors and interfering
in the operations of the companies. The rules also require the
separation of operating institutions of the companies from their
holding institutions.
</P>
<P>
The rules also call for further restructuring the companies,
rationalizing decision-making procedures, clarifying
responsibilities of directors, stabilizing senior management,
establishing and perfecting a system of external directors and
independent directors, reinforcing the role of supervisory
committees, adding incentives for senior executives, and
intensifying company reform.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the challenges of a knowledge-based economy,
the companies are also required to make full use of external
consultation sources. The regulations also stipulate that for
major investment projects, the companies should solicit
professional opinions from external consultants to serve as an
important basis for board decisions.
</P>
<P>
Shao Ning, director-general of the Department of Enterprises
Reform under the SETC, noted that defects in standardizing
operations of listed companies has aroused doubts about the
effectiveness of measures taken by China to restructure state-
owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that overseas-listed companies are already
under the strict regulations of international law, and are
therefore seen by the government as vanguards in the country's
drive to adopt international business practices.
</P>
<P>
A CSRC official said that the regulatory institution will adopt
further measures to accelerate upgrading the operations of listed
companies to international standards.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Appoint New CIS Executive Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) on Friday agreed to the appointment of
Yury Yarov, a close aide of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, as
executive secretary of the 12-nation grouping.
</P>
<P>
The CIS heads of state reached the agreement at a regular
summit meeting of the CIS, which opened here Thursday, the Itar-
Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yarov, who had been deputy chief of Yeltsin's office since 1996,
was appointed as Yeltsin's representative to the upper house of
the Russian parliament on December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky was sacked by Yeltsin on March 5. Yeltsin accused
him of "exceeding the limits of his authority as executive
secretary and failing to implement instructions by the chairman of
the CIS Council."
</P>
<P>
His removal, a unilateral move by Yeltsin, reportedly angered
fellow CIS heads of state.
</P>
<P>
The CIS leaders discussed internal affairs of the group and the
crisis in Yugoslavia and adopted a manifest on the future
development of the CIS, which is comprised of all the republics of
the former Soviet Union except the three Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the summit, Yeltsin said the CIS played an active
role in safeguarding the sovereignty of its member states and
urged the group to prepare for the changing world situation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Russia will step up the equal and mutually
beneficial integration process with other CIS members in order to
strengthen relations among the CIS states.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Meeting Calls for More Transparency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Policy makers from East Asian
countries ended a meeting organized by the World Bank here Friday
after adopting a statement calling for more transparency in the
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Financial transactions needed greater transparency through
improved reporting, accounting and auditing, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Attendants agreed that East Asian countries should speed up
restructuring with an expansion of domestic demand so as to ensure
the region's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the necessity of lowering interest rates to
bolster the recovery which they said was starting to emerge in
several nations.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting was aimed at presenting data gathered
from an extensive survey of more than 4,000 small- and
medium-sized firms in the region so that initiatives and viable
policy solutions would be drawn and developed for sustainable
economic growth in the future.
</P>
<P>
The survey results, as well as discussions and exchanged
information in the meeting, would help policy makers in the
countries realize and determine financial status of small- and
medium-sized enterprises in a wide rage of industries, both in
their own country and neighboring trading nations, according to
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also reached the conclusion that stimulation of
domestic demand was not enough to spur recovery and that speedier
restructuring of banks and other financial institutions was vital
to corporate recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Companies must overcome remaining major constraints if
recovery is to be speeded up and sustained," said a World Bank
analysis of the survey.
</P>
<P>
"These results provide another important lesson in that an
expansion of demand alone is not enough to revive the corporate
sector. Corporate restructuring to enhance competitiveness is also
required and those companies carrying it out will be the first to
experience recovery," the analysis said.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Challenge U.S. Over Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada is using the North American
Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to challenge the United States over a
proposed North Dakota law that would restrict exports of Canadian
agricultural products into the country.
</P>
<P>
The challenge was officially launched Thursday as the United
States issued a long list of complaints about its world trade
partners, including Canada.
</P>
<P>
North Dakota is considering a bill that would require all
imports of farm products and livestock to be certified free of
certain chemicals. The law is scheduled to come into effect on
July 1, 2000. But the state is not blocking shipments from other
American states.
</P>
<P>
At stake is a "significant proportion of our grain shipments to
the United states," said a Canadian senior official with the
department of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Much of western Canada's grain exports to the United States are
shipped through North Dakota on two main railway lines, he said.
Grain shipments to the United States are expected to total up to
two million tons this crop year.
</P>
<P>
Cattle and hog shipments would also be threatened if the law
goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
North Dakota's technical requirements for certification would
add a huge testing burden on Canadian grain producers and subject
them to restrictions with no scientific basis, added Leslie
Swartman, spokeswoman for Canadian International Trade Minister
Sergio Marchi.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that this new law violates NAFTA, particularly
the national treatment provisions," International Trade Minister
Sergio Marchi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. administration is responsible for ensuring that the
actions of its states conform to NAFTA. We are asking them to help
ensure that this legislation is not signed into law," added the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He officially requested consultations under NAFTA. If
consultations fall through, the dispute could go to a binding
settlement panel for resolution.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed new law would prohibit a wide range of Canadian
agricultural products from entering North Dakota without the
necessary scientific justification required by NAFTA and by
domestic U.S. regulations said Canadian Agriculture and Agri-Food
Minister Lyle Vanclief.
</P>
<P>
"There is no scientific basis for this, and we will vigorously
defend the rights of Canadian exporters of agricultural goods,"
added the minister in the same statement.

JERUSALEM -- Britain has partially lifted a 12-year-long ban on
the entry of Israeli nuclear scientists into the country.
</P>

Under an agreement, reached two months ago, Israeli nuclear
scientists who want to visit Britain for "private" purpose must
declare that they will observe the terms of the International
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (INNPT), local daily Ha'aretz
reported Friday. Israeli nuclear scientists have been barred from
attending professional conferences or visiting research
institutions in Britain ever since Israeli agents nabbed nuclear

<HEADLINE> Purges Reported in Rwanda's Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan parliament is
reportedly undergoing serious purges with some law-makers
expelled, and others summoned to resign, the Rwanda News Agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The parties so far affected include the Republican Democratic
Party (MDR) , the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Liberal Party,
the news agency quoted well-informed sources in the capital Kigali
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nothing has been disclosed about the representatives of five
other political parties forming the current transitional assembly
set up in December 1994 and comprised of 70 members.
</P>
<P>
What is so far known is that one member of parliament from the
Rwandan Patriotic Front, billionaire Valens Kajeguhakwa, resigned
on his will while three of his colleagues were asked to resign,
and did so.
</P>
<P>
Two law-makers from the Liberal Party have also resigned, but
many more could be expelled by the forum of political parties that
has taken the role of a ''censure'' organ, examining the
performance and conduct of parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
It is said that in a special convention held in Kibungo, east
of the capital Kigali, late last month, the Republican Democratic
Party executive committee sacked four of its parliamentarians the
forum of political parties had earlier asked to resign.
</P>
<P>
The four have been charged with crimes ranging from high
treason, and active collaboration with the armed Hutu insurgents,
to fostering the "Hutu Power" ideology, which is blamed for
inciting ethnic hatred among Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
They had been given fifteen days to leave on their free will or
 otherwise be sacked by their own political formations.
</P>
<P>
It is said that two other law-makers of the Republican
Democratic Party are under close examination and might be expelled
from their party because of their ''doubtful conduct'' as well.
</P>
<P>
In expelling the parliamentarians, the Democratic Party claimed
that they are hard-liners and are not supportive of the current
reforms within the party to suit for the policy of national unity
and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts believe that this party which stands accused
of hammering in the hearts of Rwandans ethnic hate, and inciting
the Hutus to kill Tutsis since 1959, is trying to redeem its
tarnished image in vain.

<P>
LAGOS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Coca Cola Nigeria Limited has
announced a 1.15 million Nairas (about 12,800 U.S. Dollars)
incentive package for the national youth team of Flying Eagles if

</P>
<P>
Seni Adetu, regional marketing manager of the company,

</P>
<P>
Adetu said the financial package was part of the company's
contribution to encourage the players and demonstrate Coca Cola's
commitment to the development of football in the West African
country.
</P>
<P>
"This is also in furtherance of Coca Cola's commitment to
seeing the Flying Eagles win the U-20 WYC trophy," Adetu was
quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Minister on Sino-US Trade Relations(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng said in an article
that appeared on Friday that equality and mutual benefits should
be the principle on Sino-US economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 20th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-
U.S. diplomatic relations and the signing of the Sino-US Trade
Agreement. In the past 20 years, economic and trade relations have
become a major part of Sino-US relations, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. are the world's largest developing nation
and its largest developed nation, and compliment each other in
their economies. The trade and economic cooperation potential is
huge, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
General Customs Administration figures show a bilateral trade
volume approaching 55 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, more than 22
times the figure for 1979 when China and the United States forged
full diplomatic relations. From 1979 to 1998, bilateral trade was
worth 364.5 billion U.S dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. figures show bilateral trade volume growing 35 times over
the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
China's modernization drive has provided many opportunities for
U.S. technology exports and its inexpensive labor-intensive
products have helped meet U.S. market demand after the United
States stopped or reduced its production of middle and lower level
consumer goods, the minister said.
</P>

Meanwhile, as China sped up its economic reforms US investments
grew annually. By the end of 1998 26,600 U.S.-funded projects had
been established worth 46.3 billion US dollars, with actual
spending at 21.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United States is China's number one foreign investor,
certainly in terms of contractual agreements, and was the first to
invest in the automobile, computer and life insurance sectors.
American companies also have a significant market share in China's
chemical products, telecommunications equipment and fast food
outlets.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that as the U.S. companies profited from these
investments they also boosted China's economy.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China and the United States have exchanged
ideas on trade, investment, finance, customs, technological
standards and certification, foreign economic arbitration and E-
business, which has led to cooperation in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister noted that despite such opportunities a
certain amount of friction has crept into bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential to take measures that enhance the benefits
while avoiding the problems and friction in Sino-US economic
cooperation." Shi stressed, adding that trade is of vital
importance to the steady and healthy growth of bilateral
cooperation."

The most-favored nation trade status issue has blocked trade
and economic cooperation for a long time, he said. Although the
United States is using the term normal trade relations, it has not
changed its annual assessment procedures and bilateral trade
remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that related U.S. departments will take the reality
and interests and wishes of the people of both countries into
consideration and will cancel the annual assessments to settle the
status issue once and for all and lay a foundation for the long-
term, steady development of bilateral trade and economic
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States are conducting negotiations on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Because the WTO
is an international body with generally recognized principles,
China's request to join the organization fully demonstrates its
confidence and determination to undertake international
obligations, he said. And China's entry would benefit China and
other nations as well.
</P>
<P>
"To doubt China's commitment to reforms and opening up to the
outside world and leaving a major trading partner like China
outside the WTO for a long time is totally abnormal," Shi
emphasized. "As a major signatory nation of WTO, the United States
should have common sense, be conscious of the righteousness of
this, and honor its promise and play an active role in China's
entry into the WTO."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister's
Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra said here Friday that there was
a possibility for Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh
to visit China to take forward the bilateral dialogue process.
</P>
<P>
"There is also a possibility of Jaswant Singh visiting China or
holding talks with Chinese leaders at the Asian Regional Forum
meeting at Singapore in June if the talks of the Joint Working
group are fruitful," he told newsmen here.
</P>
<P>
India and China would hold the next meeting of their Joint
Working group (JWG) by the end of the month or by early May to
discuss the border problem between the two countries and other
issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month the two countries had resumed official level
dialogue for the first time since India conducted nuclear tests in
May last year.
</P>
<P>
Jaswant Singh met Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan on the
sidelines of the annual meeting of the Asian Regional Forum last
July.
</P>
<P>
The JWG meeting was taking place in the backdrop of positive
signals emerging from both countries on bringing back on track
bilateral ties, Brajesh said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Indo-Pakistan relations, he said that the foreign
secretaries of India and Pakistan would meet in New Delhi in May
to resume talks on peace and security including
confidence-building measures and the Jammu and Kashmir issue as
part of the composite dialogue process. Official level talks on
six other issues between the two countries including Siachen,
Tulbul Navigation project would be discussed in Islamabad next
month. The whole process was expected to be completed by May, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to prospects of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
India, he said for this a more conducive atmosphere was needed.
With sanctions imposed against India in the aftermath of its
nuclear tests still in place, would he like to undertake the visit
under such conditions? Brajesh asked.
</P>
<P>
On the Kosovo crisis, he said that India was in close touch
with the non-aligned countries to forge a coordinated position on
the issue. India has severely criticized the NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia, contending that it was in clear violation of
the U.N. Charter.

Experience shows that taking advantage of the trade issue in
domestic politics, or taking unilateral measures, are of no help
in solving problems, but instead have a negative impacts on the
development of trade and even bilateral relations between China
and the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only after non-trade factors are removed, and only after the
two countries assume an active and practical attitude to resolve
existing problems, can Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations
embark on a mature, healthy and stable road.
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States should be able to take a
constructive and cooperative attitude toward bilateral economic
and trade relations," Shi said. "They should not conceal problems
when development is going smoothly, nor lose overall perspective
when problems arise. In this way, the potential for development
and cooperation in bilateral economic and trade relations will be
brought into full play."
</P>
<P>
China's sustained economic development and huge potential
market provide enormous room for the development of bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of China's reform and opening-up drive, the
country will open its market wider to other countries. According
to China's long-term economic and social development plan, its
economy will maintain a fairly high growth rate in the coming
decade.

The opening of these areas to overseas investors will provide
huge investment and trade opportunities to companies from the
United States as well as other countries. China is increasingly
becoming a major market where foreign capital, services, and
commodities compete with one another, the minister predicted.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China will import 1.5 trillion U.S.
dollars worth of equipment, technology and products during the
seven years from 1999 to 2005. And China welcomes U.S. companies
to take an active part in competing in the Chinese market on a
equal basis, he said..
</P>
<P>
"We believe that as long as both nations stick to the
principle of equality, mutual benefit, mutual trust and
concessions, taking the overall situation and common development
into consideration, and make concerted efforts to forge a
relationship geared to the 21st century to meet the wishes and
needs of both peoples, Sino-U.S. economic and trade will certainly
gain a new momentum, and will also contribute to the stability and

As long as this policy continues, the Sino-U.S. trade imbalance
will be hard to change, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of different economic structures and levels of
development, the complementary pattern and present status of Sino-
U.S. trade is likely to persist for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
However, bilateral trade, which has continued to grow, has
brought great benefits to the economic development of both nations.
So the two sides should face this reality and regard the trade
imbalance objectively and comprehensively from a long-term point
of view, and not politicize the problem, said Shi.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the trade imbalance with the
U.S., and has made huge efforts to solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to create a comfortable environment for
imports from other nations, including the Unites States. We hope
the U.S. will also relax its export restrictions, and return to
governmental trade and investment promotion plans for projects
such as the Trade Administration and Overseas Private Investment
Corporation, and preferential loans from its Import-Export Bank.
These measures will improve the compatibility of U.S. businesses
in the Chinese market.

The United States has greatest number of multinational
corporations in the world. China, benefiting from its cheap labor,
large market, and preferential policies for foreign investment,
has become the world's second-largest target nation for direct
overseas investment, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies, in terms of both number and performance, are
among the most successful investing in China, and a large
proportion of U.S. multinationals have Chinese branches selling
products, with many of their products occupying a large share of
the market and reaping remarkable benefits.
</P>
<P>
However, these kinds of sales do not appear in the statistics
as U.S. exports to China.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the objective causes mentioned above, the Sino-U.S.
trade imbalance also resulted from subjective reasons on the U.S.
side.
</P>
<P>
"We regret to see that while complaining about its trade
deficit with China, and instead of positively taking efficient
initiatives to promote its exports, the U.S. side has made harsh,
even discriminating restrictions against hi-tech exports to China,
" he said. "This has left U.S. businesses out of opportunities to
export to China."
</P>
<P>
The recent flap over the so-called China theft of U.S. nuclear
technology inside the United States fully demonstrates that the
United States' China policy is influenced by Cold War thinking, he
said.

<P>
Over the past few years, trade imbalance has become the focal
point of Sino-U.S. trade relations. A trade surplus does exist for
China in bilateral commodity trade, he said. However, there is a
large gap between the statistics of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The original cause for this trade imbalance is rather complex,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Transit trade accounts for a large proportion of Sino-U.S.
trade, and a large amount of these commodities are moved via third
parties, and goods from China gain 30 to 40 percent in added value
at the third ports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, processed goods made up a large portion of China's
exports to the United States, and U.S. businesses have established
quite a few processing projects in the Chinese mainland, including
the manufacturing of shoes and toys. An overwhelming majority of
these goods are sold in the U.S., and the Chinese only receive
comparatively low processing fees, Shi explained.
</P>
<P>
Objectively speaking, most of the commodities China exports to
the U.S. are consumer goods, many kinds of which are labor-
intensive, low value-added goods no longer produced in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that importing these products from China
poses no competitive threat to the U.S. industry. At the same time,
these China-imported consumer goods, usually cheap and of high
quality, will help the U.S. control inflation and benefit U.S.
consumers.
</P>
<P>
"So why not do the business that is win-win?" Shi asked.  (

<HEADLINE> Macao to Stop Selling Leaded Gasoline in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Leaded gasoline will not be
available in Macao in May this year as a result of the ban on
selling leaded gas in neighboring Hong Kong beginning from April 1.
</P>
<P>
Macao mainly imports leaded gasoline from Hong Kong, and the
ban will make gas dealers in Hong Kong transport their remaining
stock to Macao. It is estimated that the stock will be sold up in
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
By that time, gas stations in Macao will supply a new kind of
fuel to vehicles which consume leaded fuel. The substitute is
produced by means of mixing a special type of additive with normal
lead-free gasoline. The mixture is said to be cheaper than leaded
gas.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1995, the Macao government issued a decree
requiring that newly imported or registered vehicles be equipped
with devices using lead-free fuel. However, more than 60 percent
of vehicles in Macao are still driven by leaded fuel.

<HEADLINE> Six Neolithic Ceramic Statues Discovered in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Romanian museum experts have
discovered six small ceramic statues that belonged to the Cucuteni
culture, which existed during the Neolithic period from 2,000-700
B.C., and was indigenous to Romania's northeastern area,
</P>
<P>
The Rompres news agency reported Friday that experts of
Bukovina's National Museum made the archaeological discovery in
the village of Mihoveni, near the northern city of Suceava.
</P>
<P>
The six small statues are zoomorphic idols that represent a
''species of horned cattle.'' Experts say the area where they were
found may have been a special site dedicated to the performance of
rituals to a bull totem or deity, a figure that is culturally
significant and symbolic to agricultural communities.
</P>
<P>
The experts believe the small statues have a special
archaeological value and the area where they were discovered could
be considered as ''one of the most important prehistoric
settlements in the territory of northern Moldova.''

<HEADLINE> Forum to Mark 50th Anniversary of Women's Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A forum marking the 50th
anniversary of the establishment of the All-China Women's
Federation (ACWF) was held today in the Great Hall of the People
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, vice-president of the ACWF, reviewed the
achievements made by her federation in safeguarding women's rights
and interests in the past 50 years, and noted that the ACWF has
experienced great social changes along with the People's Republic
of China.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the Communist Party's leadership is a
correct political orientation of the women's federation, and
tradition confirms that only by adhering to the Party's leadership
and guidance in women's development can the federation really
represent and safeguard women's fundamental interests.
</P>
<P>
She said the ACWF has always centered its work on economic
development, and noted the only way to realize women's
emancipation under the socialist system is to boost the social
productive forces.
</P>
<P>
"Amid the market competition nowadays, women's education and
cultivation are essential to their rights and opportunities to
seek equal participation and development," she said, adding that
there is still a long way to go in maintaining women's legitimate
rights and interests in the primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, honorary president of the ACWF, urged those engaged
in women's development to earnestly study Marxism, Leninism, Mao
Zedong Thought, and especially Deng Xiaoping Theory, and direct
the work accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The forum was presided over by Peng Peiyun, a vice-chairwoman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
To conclude the event, she asked women's federations at all
levels to emphasize theoretical study, political awareness and
healthy ethics, and work hard to improve the work of women's
development.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Wounded In S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) militia was wounded in south Lebanon overnight
by a roadside bomb, the Voice of the People radio reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the militia had admitted the casualty, adding
that the explosion occurred on the Biyida-Shamua road just outside
the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its fighters
detonated the roadside bomb when a SLA patrol was heading toward
its position in the central sector of the border enclave.
</P>
<P>
The blast raised to 12 the number of the militiamen wounded in
south Lebanon since the start of this year. Only one militiaman
was killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces and
its allies SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control over On-line Information on Rare Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China's cultural officials are to
closely check websites which provide information on its
archeological finds, rare relics and its listed World Heritage
sites following a spate of smuggling cases by gangs of
international thieves.
</P>
<P>
 A large number of antiques and relics have been secretly
excavated and removed after thieves found out the exact location
of important archeological sites from websites. They have then
been sold to dealers abroad.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) is
responsible for keeping a watch on the type of information
released and now intends to prevent classified documents and
ongoing archaeological studies from being publicized on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
SACH officials plan to purge all items from China's cultural
heritage websites that could expose important relics to security
threats.
</P>
<P>
The administration is also preparing a uniform standard for
nationwide information databases on cultural relics, which will be
introduced by all museums and relevant organizations.
</P>
<P>
China's first official cultural heritage website was set up by
the SACH earlier this year and more than 60 museums have opened
their own sites with many others planning to follow.

countries including China is related to diseases amongst elderly
persons.

<HEADLINE> Developed World Cannot Impose Wishes on Others: EC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 2 (Xinhua) -- European Commission Vice
President Sir Leon Brittan said here Friday the developed world
cannot today impose its wishes on the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The future negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
will only be acceptable if the benefits are widely shared,
Brittan told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Brittan is currently in Malaysia as part of his visit to Asian
countries which include Indonesia, India and Pakistan, for the
next round of WTO trade negotiations - the Millennium Round, which
will begin in November in Seattle, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said the interest of Malaysia and other countries in
the region could be strongly represented in the coming WTO
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It is best, to put on the table, the interests of these
countries that need to be negotiated, unless it is felt that
everything is all right," he said
</P>
<P>
The developing world has nothing to fear if it has its own
agenda to be put on the table because "you have the obligation not
to accept what you don't want to do", Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that a comprehensive round of multilateral trade
negotiations is necessary in the current economic climate, to
stimulate growth and to reduce the risk of protectionism.
</P>
<P>
The official said that if the WTO members want the rules to be
changed then they should be ready to discuss it at the
organization.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A fire broke out in a high court
of Chandigarh city, 238 km northwest of New Delhi, Friday and
destroyed court stationery and records of a large number of old
cases.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that the fire was brought under
control by 14 fire tenders of Chandigarh fire service, Indian Air
Force and those of neighboring towns.
</P>
<P>
The fire in Chandigarh, the capital shared by both Punjab and
Haryana States, originated in the records room and spread to the
stationery stores nearby in the early hours of the day. Since the
records room was tucked away behind the office buildings, the fire
tenders had difficulty reaching the spot. An earth mover was thus
to have been called in to break the side walls so that the hoses
could reach the fire.
</P>
<P>
High court officials declined to give any details of the losses
and the cause of the fire was yet to be known.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A dredging project to clean the
bottom of Dianchi Lake, China's sixth largest freshwater lake near
Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, has been completed ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The 250-million-yuan (30 million U.S. dollars) project has
resulted in the removal of 4.2 million cubic meters of silt on a 2.
8-square-kilometer area. With the completion of the project, the
water quality of the lake will be greatly improved, according to a
State Environmental Protection Administration official.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the pollutants cleaned from the bottom of the
lake include 7,990 tons of phosphorus, 39,600 tons of nitrogen,
and more than 5,000 tons of heavy metals. The water storage
capacity of the lake has also been increased by 4.2 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
The lake is on a high plateau and plays a key role in the
ecology of Kunming, but it has been seriously polluted by
industrial and urban waste.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Chinese government listed Dianchi as one of the
key parts of the "three rivers and three lakes" project that
covers the Liaohe, Huaihe, and Haihe rivers and Taihu, Chaohu, and
Dianchi lakes.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government has sped up the cleaning work on
Dianchi to finish it in time for the World Horticulture Exposition,
which starts early in May.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A Red Cross Sudanese worker and
three government officials accompanying a team of the
International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) in southern Sudan were
killed by the Sudanese rebels, said an ICRC release available here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said four Sudanese accompanied an ICRC team on a mission
near the southern Sudanese town of Bentiu on February 18 and
inadvertently strayed into the territory held by the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) . Two ICRC expatriates and the
four Sudanese were captured.
</P>
<P>
The release said the two expatriates were released on March 12,
but the four Sudanese were still detained by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
After more than one month and despite its immediate and
sustained efforts, the ICRC was unable to secure the release of
the four men.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that during the visit to Geneva by John
Garang, chairman of the Sudanese rebel movement, on March 22, ICRC
President Cornelio Sommaruga privately urged Garang to set free
the detained persons without delay.
</P>
<P>
"The ICRC is shocked and appalled at the news of the death of
the four Sudanese, in particular that of a Red Crescent worker,
and the SPLA cannot but be held accountable for their death," said
the release.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC demanded a full inquiry to shed light on the events
and the full cooperation of the rebel movement in repatriating
the bodies to allow for a decent burial, the release concluded.

<HEADLINE> Internet Set for Explosive Growth in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua)-- The Internet is witnessing
explosive growth in China, with highly-educated young people
accounting for the bulk of the surfers, according to the result of
a recent survey released today.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair, a Beijing-based consultation company, launched a
nationwide survey to find out the readiness of Chinese people to
take up the latest information technology.
</P>
<P>
The survey, under guidance of the Ministry of Information
Industry, found that 71.2 percent of non-Internet-surfers are very
interested in getting acquainted with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
It also discovered that 85.6 percent of surfers are seeking
information on science, technology, and political and social
matters, while 70.8 percent of those questioned log on to the net
to send and receive e-mails.
</P>
<P>
The major means of learning about the Internet is through
actual surfing on the net and 52.9 percent of surfers claim the
magazine "Computer World" is the most helpful and influential
media source for their familiarity with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the majority of those questioned, whether
they are surfers or not, have acquired basic knowledge and know-
how about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
However, the surfers said that the real age of e-commerce will
arrive in about two to three years.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 66.3 percent of surfers have computers at
home and that an average surfer stays on the net for five hours
and 16 minutes a week.
</P>
<P>
However, the surfers complained about the slow speed of logging
on to the net. In addition, 71.6 percent of the non-net-surfers
cite the arbitrary cost as the major obstacle that prevents them
from logging on.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out in September-December last year but
recently China has substantially dropped its Internet charges.
</P>
<P>
The Sinclair company received 10,408 effective replies to their
questionnaires, which were handed out nationwide through the
Internet and traditional newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
More than 85 percent of those surveyed are aged below 35 years
of age, and over 77 percent of them have received a college
education.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Friday re- appointed George Saitoti as the country's Vice
President, putting an end to speculations and protest from both
the opposition and the Kenyan public as a whole over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Before the appointment, Saitoti had served as Minister of
Planning and National Development since 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old professor was Vice-President and Finance
Minister in Moi's last presidential term between 1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival from a four-day tour to Namibia and Malawi
Thursday, Moi announced that he would name a vice-president soon
to fill the number-two post, which remained vacant since last
January.
</P>
<P>
The long-time vacancy of the post had aroused concern from the
Kenyan public. Kenya's major newspapers recently had carried front
page stories entitled "Give Us a VP" , "17 MPs Say No to An Extra
Moi Term" and the like.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's opposition parties have indicted Moi for failing to
appoint a vice-president as stipulated by the current
constitution.
</P>
<P>
A legislator from the opposition Ford-Kenya has submitted a
motion of censure of Moi to Kenyan National Assembly (parliament)
ahead of its April 6 reopening after the adjournment since last
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parities alleged that Moi's non-compliance with
the constitution affected negatively on the constitutional review
process.
</P>
<P>
They also argued there was no constitutional basis for Moi to
stay in office beyond the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
They opposed any attempt to change the current constitution to
allow Moi to serve an extra term.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believe Moi's appointment of a
vice-president is meant to appease the debate.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Lifting of Embargo on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has said the
economic embargo on Cuba should be lifted so that economy of the
Caribbean country could pick up.
</P>
<P>
Shamim Khan, deputy minister for industry and commerce, said
Thursday Tanzania's relationship with Cuba has been healthy for a
long time but the troubled economy of both countries has hampered
the carrying out of crucial agreements on various development
issues.
</P>
<P>
Khan made the remarks at a signing ceremony for bilateral
cooperation in education and health sectors in Dar es Salaam
Thursday, the independent newspaper Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was also attended by Cuba's Deputy Minister for
Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation, Noemi Benitez.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an agreement to meet every six months
instead of two years as was the case before.
</P>
<P>
Khan expressed hopes that international sanctions imposed on
the island economy decades ago could be over soon.
</P>
<P>
She said with the lifting of international embargo on Cuba and
Tanzania' s success in economic reform, programs of cooperation in
various areas of development would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Cuban deputy minister said her country is quite
comfortable with Tanzania's foreign policy on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Cuban's economy has been receding since the fall of the Eastern
Bloc in the early 90s, she said, adding that currently new
economic programs have been drafted to meet global economic
demands.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the two countries met last time in 1997 in
Havana, Cuba. The Cuban deputy minister also invited Khan,
Minister of Science, Technology and Higher Education and the
Minister of Health to visit her country.

recognize and acknowledge themselves," she noted.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's State Firms Getting Help by Stock Listing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- For the debt-ridden state sector
in China's Liaoning Province, which was once a key industrial base,
getting listed on the stock exchange has proved to be a good way
to get out of their financial mess.
</P>
<P>
The listed companies have provided a good example for poorly-
run state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the province, as only one of
the 49 listed companies is expecting losses for 1998, while 45
percent of the large and medium-sized SOEs are losing money in
Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
These companies have become a force for restoring Liaoning to
its former glory, said Su Yong, chairman of the Provincial
Securities Regulatory Commission. Liaoning had a tenth of China's
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Of the province's 49 listed companies, 46 are considered large
or medium-sized.
</P>
<P>
There are good reasons for the good results with the listed
companies. To get listed, an enterprise has to restructure itself
first, get rid of debt and non-performing assets and establish a
modern enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has selected companies in industries with good
prospects for public listing. Almost half are in the machinery,
metallurgical, electronic, and petrochemical sectors, the four
pillars of Liaoning's economy.

The state sector needs more funds for technical renovation and
product mix adjustment, and funds from the securities market are

listed companies have agent banks and get privileged treatment in

several billion yuan into the listed companies for key technical
renovations and infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that the public listing also puts the
companies under the closer scrutiny of investors and securities
regulators and encourages the companies to adjust to the market
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We have to answer to the shareholders after listing on the
securities market and we may lose our jobs if the company can not
report favorable results. This pressures me to rack my brains to
run the company," said Lin Yi, vice-president of Liaoning's Jindi
Group.
</P>
<P>
Public listing also led to acquisitions and mergers. Liaotong
Petrochemicals, for example, became China's top fertilizer
producer by acquiring 95.7 percent of the stock of a provincial
natural gas producer, which had been mired in more than two
billion yuan in debt but got out of its financial difficulties
after the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ketian, vice-governor of Liaoning, said that the province
will continue to list state-owned companies and promote assets
relocation of listed companies in order to revitalize the state
sector.
</P>
<P>
"We are also pushing for large securities companies in Liaoning
with the aim of reinvigorating the industrial base," he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Suspends Ban on Israeli Nuclear Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain has partially lifted a
12-year-long ban on the entry of Israeli nuclear scientists into
the country.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement, reached two months ago, Israeli nuclear
scientists who want to visit Britain for "private" purpose must
declare that they will observe the terms of the International
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (INNPT), local daily Ha'aretz
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli nuclear scientists have been barred from attending
professional conferences or visiting research institutions in
Britain ever since Israeli agents nabbed nuclear whistle-blower
Mordechai Vanunu in Rome in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The ban was applied to nuclear scientists and those working in
associated fields, such as the development of biological and
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from Israel's research institutions, such as the
Weizman Institute, the Nuclear Research Centers at Dimona, Nahal
Sorek and Raphael and the Israel Armament Development Authority
were under the ban.
</P>
<P>
Britain imposed the ban under its commitment to the INNPT,
which Israel has not signed, the daily quoted Simon Pease, the
deputy head of mission of the British Embassy in Tel Aviv as
saying.
</P>
<P>
And the 1986 Vanunu episode made it clear that Israel was a
nuclear state.
</P>
<P>
Britain adopted the tough attitude towards Israeli scientists
after Vanunu gave an interview to the London Sunday Times in
October 1986, in which Vanunu divulged the existence of Israel's
nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Israeli agents enticed Vanunu to leave Britain and
travel to Italy, where he was abducted, brought forcibly back
to Israel and sentenced to 18 years in prison.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic won two points in a
psychological war with NATO on Thursday, by presenting the picture
of three captured American soldiers on television and receiving
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova before cameras in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
-- In the United States, the images of the three American
soldiers captured by Serb forces have increased pressure on
Washington for sending ground troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Liberation, Albanian President Rexhep
Mejdani said that his country is ready to receive NATO ground
troops for an eventual intervention in Kosovo. Albania, the
poorest country in Europe, is submerged by a huge influx of Kosovo
refugees, who continued to flow in on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO put up an intact determination on Thursday in its war
with Yugoslavia, despite the capture of three GI's by Serb forces.
The U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said that NATO does not
have the intention to change direction, while U.S. President Bill
Clinton held Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic "personally
responsible" for the safety of the three American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
-- The moderate Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova met with
Milosevic on Thursday in Belgrade and the two men promised to seek
an end to the conflict in Kosovo through "political means."
Meanwhile, Pope John Paul II has appealed for a truce during the
Easter.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 130,000 Kosovo Albanians have fled their homes
within one week, said the High Commissioner of the United Nations
for Refugees. The situation of the refugees in Albania, Macedonia
and Montenegro is becoming precarious and causing great concern.
</P>
<P>
-- While doubts are increasing about the effectiveness of
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, NATO is intensifying its bombings there.
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said on Thursday that the
bombings would go on for weeks rather than days.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Files Antique Buildings in Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has started to make
an inventory of all the old buildings throughout the country and
store the information in a computer network.
</P>
<P>
Donatus Kamamba, director of the Department of Antiquities,
said here Thursday that the exercise will help collect and
computerize all the information on old buildings currently in
paper files and scattered.
</P>
<P>
He said experts are visiting all the old buildings in the
country and recording their conditions, the Daily Mail newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Once the task that started in January this year is completed,
Kamamba said, the information synthesized will facilitate the
identification of old buildings located in various parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We should be able to get information on any old buildings in
the country, like its owner, age and current condition and make
them easily available,"he said.
</P>
<P>
Kamamba said the job will take long and is likely to be
finished next year because the department lacks computers and
financial support needed to speed up the exercise.
</P>
<P>
"If we had the computers and the financial support, this job
would have taken as short as three months to complete," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Antiquities is empowered by Tanzania's
Antiquities Act of 1964 to take care of all the old buildings in
the country which are deemed to have historical, archaeological or
any other extraordinary importance.

<HEADLINE> North China Urban Air Quality Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The air quality of many cities in
north China was better this week compared with the previous week,
according to the latest report released by the China Environmental
Monitoring Center today.
</P>
<P>
With the coming of spring, many northern cities have stopped
burning coal for heating and decreased the release of pollutants
into the air.
</P>
<P>
However, Beijing endured heavy fog during the week and because
of slow wind speeds had an unfavorable environment for dispersing
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou, Guilin, Beihai, Zhanjiang, Haikou, Ningbo, Shenzhen and
Xiamen enjoyed excellent air quality from March 26 to April 1,
while 21 cities including Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Dalian
and Nanjing reported good air quality.
</P>
<P>
Twelve cities including Tianjin, Changchun, Xining, Shenyang,
Kunming and Xi'an reported slight air pollution during the period.
Beijing, Taiyuan and Yinchuan reported medium air pollution, and
Lanzhou and Hohhot suffered from serious pollution.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Humanitarian Aid Flown to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua)-- An Israeli plane loaded with
medical and humanitarian aid for Kosovo refugees left Ben Gurion
International Airport Friday morning for Albania.
</P>
<P>
This ten-tonne aid shipment, including medicines, blankets and
tents, was finally taken off after being delayed Wednesday due to
problems with overfly permission from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), which is still carrying out airstrikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told the Israeli delegation at
the airport that the Israeli government is worried about the
situation in Kosovo and the Kosovo crisis could only be solved
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was headed by Science Minister Silvan Shalon
and Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Eitan Ben-Eliyahu. The Plane
is expected back in Israel Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The decision to sent out the airlift was taken at the special
cabinet meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government officials have different opinions towards the
Kosovo issue. Sharon has repeatedly said that Kosovo crisis
could end through peaceful means, urging the parties concerned
to return to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday night that
he supports the NATO's military action against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials and several other Israeli historians
have expressed their reservations of taking stands against the
Serbs in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav people had saved many lives of the Jews during the
World War II, and Israel should never forget this, they said.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Offers Business Training to Private Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Specialist business training
courses for private firms who have been granted import and export
licenses are to be sponsored by China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jie, director of the MOFTEC's Department of Policy and
Development, said that the training is designed to familiarize the
firms with the country's foreign trade policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
The courses will include background information on foreign
trade, customs, taxation, foreign exchange and finance.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that private Chinese firms have been
able to trade on equal terms with state-owned or collective
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A national conference focusing on commerce and economics held
in December last year outlined the nation's trade goals for 1999
and called for an all-out effort to increase exports.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, private businesses actually
increased textile exports for the first 10 months of last year by
some 400 percent. As a result observers believe that private
business in China will emerge as a new growth point.
</P>
<P>
However, they note that such firms will face stiff competition
when entering the international market for the first time.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Provide Aid to Kosovars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A charity group of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) will send a delegation to Albania and
Macedonia on Saturday to provide financial and material aid to
Kosovan refugees, the Gulf News daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will buy food, clothing, blankets and other
items from the Macedonian markets to provide thousands of Kosovan
refugees who have fled alleged massacres committed by Serbian
forces, Ahmed Youssuf, executive manager of the Ajman-based Human
Appeal International (HAI), was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to buy items for the 250,000 dirhams (about
68,300 U.S. dollars) we have already raised during the first
few days of the countrywide fund-raising campaign we launched to
help the people of Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a province of the Serbia Republic of Yugoslavia,
where most of the residents are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Youssuf added that the delegation will also try to gather
information about the needs of the Albanian refugees in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"Our delegation will prepare a detailed report about the
number of refugees and their needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Youssuf said that HAI had launched a UAE wide
campaign to collect money and other donations to be sent to
the Albanians who have poured out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said HAI will also organize other humanitarian campaigns
in the Gulf region "to raise as much money as possible to
bring relief to refugees in the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
The UAE last week expressed its support for NATO's on-going
air strikes against Yugoslavia, saying it was the only option
left to end the tragedy in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Japan Offers Medical Help to Flood-Stricken Areas in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan is to donate 897 million yen
worth of immunization equipment to seven Chinese provinces that
were severely hit by floods last year and lost a lot of their own
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The equipment will be used to ensure the health of children in
the flood-stricken areas along the Yangtze River valley and the
Songhua River valley.
</P>
<P>
These are the highlights of the "Expanded Program on
Immunization Plan" signed here today by Long Yongtu, chief
negotiator of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, and Sakutaro Tanino, Japanese ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
The devastating floods last year caused great damage to medical
supplies and immunization equipment.
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement is only a third of the aid program
promised by Japan since March 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the announcement, the "Dike Improvement Project on the
Yangtze River" stipulates that Japan will provide 1.46 billion yen
worth of steel piling and construction equipment, which will be
used to reinforce dikes along the Yangtze River and to prevent
seepage.
</P>
<P>
To carry out the "Grain Production Increase Aid Project",
involving a 1.32 billion yen government aid, Japan will assist six
provinces including Yunnan, Guizhou and Shaanxi, to buy farming
machinery, fertilizers, chemicals and vehicles to help local
farmers improve agricultural development and food production.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been involved in China's immunization work by
providing vaccines and laboratory equipment valued at more than
900 million yen.

<HEADLINE> Strong Performance Seen in Cyprus' Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Market took
market players by surprise with a forceful upward trend during the
first quarter of 1999, a weekly market review said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The review, issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), said even those who cited prospects
for 1999 based on the most optimistic scenarios, would not have
expected such a strong market performance.
</P>
<P>
Total volume of transactions hit 348.9 million pounds (697.8
million U.S. dollars), surpassing the total for the whole year of
1998 which stood at 348.1 million pounds (696.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The average daily volume of transactions for the period rose to
5.8 million pounds (11.6 million dollars) as compared to that of
1998 which was 1.4 million pounds (2.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The market rally was triggered by an announcement of the
Cyprus Popular Bank in January of its intention to acquire three
insurance companies belonging to the Schacolas Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
Spectacular gains by the three insurance titles dragged
several other titles into a frenzy ascent.
</P>
<P>
Later on, an announcement by the Bank of Cyprus in January of
its "Centenary Gift" to shareholders brought afresh a wave of
euphoria among investors.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share Index closed at 509 points on January 29,
exhibiting a capital appreciation of 12.1 percent from year end.
</P>
<P>
January volume of transactions also shot up at unprecedented
levels, reaching 79.6 million Cyprus pounds (159.2 million
dollars), thus by far exceeded 1998's highest level recorded in
April, 45.6 million pounds (91.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The "buying-mania" which hit the stock market assumed epidemic
proportions in February.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share Index reached the 600-point level covering
ground of 100 points within just 14 trading days, while it took
almost three years for the market to regain the all-time high
record of 522 points.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share Index closed at 585.6 points on February 26.
</P>
<P>
The market sustained an overall rising course in March.
</P>
<P>
The news of a stock split by Popular Bank further boosted
investor psychology, and as a result the market witnessed a new
all-time high of 626.1 points on March 23.
</P>
<P>
However, the ongoing NATO strikes in Yugoslavia seemed to
negatively impinge on market psychology.
</P>
<P>
The market was on a gradual descending trend since the strikes
were launched on March 24, with the CISCO All-Share Index closing
at 582.9 points on March 31.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urges Unified Education System in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Ministry of East African
and Regional Cooperation has called for the harmonization of
education in the east African region, including similar curricula
and certification.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary Samuel Ambuka said the move would help
attain a state of singularity in the region's economic management
and social organization, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ambuka noted Thursday that Kenya's 8-4-4 education system,
which means eight years of primary school, four years of high
school and four years of

university, was different from the 7-4-2-3 structure in both
Uganda and Tanzania, which made regional integration difficult.
</P>
<P>
"It brings in the problems of differences in the basic skills
and knowledge a student ought to have to acquire at the various
levels of education, and the question of assessment of points and
credits in the three countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the three east African nations set up joint
teams to study curricula, examination and certification of
primary, secondary and college education as a basis for
harmonization of curricula and certification.
</P>
<P>
On Kenya's 8-4-4 curricula, Ambuka admitted that it emphasized
a wide range of subjects at the expense of in-depth analysis.

MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Friday issued an order to suspend Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov
while he is under investigation for alleged abuse of power in
connection with a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
As Skuratov's conduct had been the subject of an inquiry by the
justice department, said Yeltsin, he had written to the Federation
Council, or the upper house of parliament, for the second time
this year, to request his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
On February 2, Yeltsin proposed to sack Skuratov after
receiving his resignation on "health reason." But the council, by
constitution the only body with the power to dismiss Skuratov,
rejected the proposal by a 142-6 vote.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov said before the voting that his on-going corruption
and bribery probes annoyed some ex-officials and financial
oligarchs, who were eager for his stepping down.

<HEADLINE> China: World's Fourth Largest Gold Consumer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China used 191.6 tons of gold
last year, making it the world's fourth largest gold market,
according to the World Gold Council (WGC).
</P>
<P>
India, the United States and Saudi Arabia are the top three
gold customers, with 815 tons, 428.4 tons, and 208.4 tons
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Although China used 22.2 tons less than in 1997 as a result of
the Asian financial crisis, some WGC officials believe that there
is still great potential.
</P>
<P>
Per capita consumption on the Chinese mainland was only 0.2
grams of gold a year, compared with 9 grams in Hong Kong and
Taiwan, according to the president of the council's Far East
region.
</P>
<P>
Consumption could be further stimulated since the Chinese
government is opening the gold market and loosening controls.
</P>
<P>
Last year's 172.8 tons of gold production made China the fifth
biggest gold producer in the world, after South Africa, the U.S.,
Australia and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The country has some 340 licensed processors and wholesalers
and about 10,000 retailers in the gold business.

<HEADLINE> Sihanoukville's Toxic Waste Shipped back to Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Sihanoukville's illegally
dumped mercury-laden waste was forced Friday to temporarily ship
back to its original producing place, Taiwan, as the U.S. withdrew
permission for it to be shipped to California.
</P>
<P>
Three thousand tons toxic waste, illegally dumped on a hill 15
km from Sihanoukville town in early last December, was shipped
from the Taiwanese company Formosa Plastics Corp. and caused a
panic in the seaside town after it was discovered.
</P>
<P>
Illnesses and at least two deaths have been reported, but no
direct link to the waste has been established.
</P>
<P>
The ship carrying the waste left Sihanoukville Port Friday
morning to Taiwan. Three thousand tons of toxic waste plus 2000
tons of top-soil taken from the toxic waste hilltop were
repackaged into 18,000 oil barrels which were stored in more than
350 containers.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, government officials presided over a ceremony
closing the dump site and declaring the area safe.
</P>
<P>
As the containers were being loaded, however, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) withdrew its earlier
approval fro the waste to be stored in the state of California.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the EPA had independent test results that
show higher levels mercury than the studies submitted in
Safty-Kleen's storage application. Safty-kleen is a U.S.-based
company who contracted to dispose of the waste in California.
</P>
<P>
The waste was also protested by California communities and
environmental activists in the U.S..

<HEADLINE> China Must Reform Investment, Financing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China's current investment and
financing system continues to feature characteristics of a planned
economy and may result in high financial risks if allowed to
remain unchanged, according to a senior official in charge of the
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
State-owned and loss-making enterprises continue to enjoy
advantages in terms of access to funding.
</P>
<P>
Increased Government allocations would simply increase the flow
of funding to state-owned enterprises and result in an even
greater waste of resources, according to Yi Gang, deputy secretary-
general of the State Council's Monetary Policy Commission.
</P>
<P>
Yi proposed radical reform of the system in line with laws
governing of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should narrow its area of investment for
state-owned enterprises and focus on expanding the investment area
and channels available to the non-public sector. He added that
businesses in the latter sector should be allowed to invest in
areas dominated by the government, including infrastructure and
public projects.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses should be allowed to enter sectors
monopolized by state-owned enterprises in order to create rational
competition. This in turn would lead to the demise of loss-making
state-owned enterprises and ensure sustainable national economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Yi, who also serves as deputy director of the Monetary Policy
Department of the People's Bank of China, called for creating a
financing environment in which all enterprises are equally treated
regardless of ownership type.
</P>
<P>
Government intervention in capital market must be halted and
stock market listings for enterprise must be decided by the market
rather than the government, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also cited the need for improving the financing service
system to meet the needs of small- to medium-sized enterprises.
This in turn would facilitate the establishment of floating
interest rates on loans to related enterprises, as well as the
establishment of insurance funds for additional loans, according
to Yi.
</P>
<P>
He said the process to commercialize state-owned banks should
be accelerated in order to ensure banks improve management and
services and grant profit-oriented loans.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Freezing Aid To Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has denied that
it had frozen aid to Zimbabwe on the basis of bad human rights
record and alleged disregard of the rule of law, the daily Herald
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here in the Zimbabwean capital
Thursday, the U.S. Embassy said instead, the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID) director was currently in
Washington, calling for the extension of U.S. assistance to
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, USAID Director Rose Marie Depp is
currently in Washington presenting a comprehensive program
strategy to U.S. government officials that clearly calls for an
extension, not suspension, of U.S. assistance to Zimbabwe," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, any such decision would have been conveyed by the
embassy promptly to the Zimbabwean government through customary
diplomatic channels; in this case it was not, because U.S.
government aid has not been suspended and the newspaper account
that suggests such is unequivocally false," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an unnamed government official from Washington, The
Financial Gazette, Zimbabwe's weekly paper, alleged that the U.S.
had frozen all outstanding aid to Zimbabwe worth about 120 million
U.S. dollars.

<P>
As the first player off the bench, Mashburn made his first two

</P>
<P>
Laettner, who missed the season's first 22 games due to a

quarter and did not return.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Laettner averaged 8.5 points and 4.3 rebounds

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Providing 40 Billion Yuan in Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The China Industrial and
Commercial Bank (CICB) announced today that it will provide 40
billion yuan in housing loans this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Vice-president Xie Duyang says that 25 billion yuan
of that will be used for individual buyers and the rest for
housing development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank has put the housing loans under special
management to ensure that it will not be misused.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, nearly 9 percent of the bank's new loans went for
housing credit, with 10.2 billion yuan for individual credit.
</P>
<P>
Xie says that individual credit has become a major business of
CICB and a concerted effort has been made in the past few years to
establish better control, organization, technology, and business
in the credit.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, CICB's collection rate of interest on
individual housing loans was 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
Xie has also told all bank branches to find more effective ways
to prevent risks in new loans while expanding the credit business.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian officials are still discussing with friendly
countries whether to declare statehood on May 4, Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat said Thursday after
briefing Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on his recent tour of
the United States and Europe. His tour was aimed at garnering

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Noted Chinese writer Wang Meng
recently called teaching reform in China's primary and middle
schools, according to Wednesday's edition of Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Teaching students to use their brains to write in their own
language is extremely important", according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The former Minister of Culture stressed the need to replace
standardized test forms.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that multiple choice tests are suited to the
English language which is clearly classified by different parts of
speeches. However, he stressed that multiple choice tests fail to
accurately reflect the language level of Chinese students.
</P>
<P>
"The difference in the Chinese language is subtle and we
understand the meaning of a Chinese word through context", said
Wang.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that teachers should encourage students use their
own words to express what they see, feel and desire.
</P>
<P>
Wang, born in 1934, authored the novel "Long Live Youth",
novellas such as "Butterflies" and "Bolshevik Salute", and short
stories such as the "Sound of Spring".

<HEADLINE> UAE to Provide Aid to Kosovars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A charity group of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) will send a delegation to Albania and
Macedonia on Saturday to provide financial and material aid to
Kosovan refugees, the Gulf News daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will buy food, clothing, blankets and other
items from the Macedonian markets to provide thousands of Kosovan
refugees who have fled alleged massacres committed by Serbian
forces, Ahmed Youssuf, executive manager of the Ajman-based Human
Appeal International (HAI), was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to buy items for the 250,000 dirhams (about
68,300 U.S. dollars) we have already raised during the first
few days of the countrywide fund-raising campaign we launched to
help the people of Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a province of the Serbia Republic of Yugoslavia,
where most of the residents are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Youssuf added that the delegation will also try to gather
information about the needs of the Albanian refugees in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"Our delegation will prepare a detailed report about the
number of refugees and their needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Youssuf said that HAI had launched a UAE wide
campaign to collect money and other donations to be sent to
the Albanians who have poured out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said HAI will also organize other humanitarian campaigns
in the Gulf region "to raise as much money as possible to
bring relief to refugees in the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
The UAE last week expressed its support for NATO's on-going
air strikes against Yugoslavia, saying it was the only option
left to end the tragedy in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> China Values Talented Senior Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China is experimenting with a
market mechanism which enables talented senior citizens to
negotiate for better positions.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism is based on "competitive salary negotiations",
which asks talented senior citizens to present speeches to justify
salary requests before representatives from participating
enterprise bid for their services.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Job Placement Market in northeast China's Liaoning
Province sponsored the first senior citizens talent fair in 1998.
Various companies attending the event hired 12 talented senior
citizens for annual salaries ranging between 20,000-100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Annual salaries of 100,000 yuan are commonplace in various
other countries, but are several times the average for talented
Chinese senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Similar talent fairs have since been held in Shanghai city and
the provinces of Guangdong, Sichuan and Jilin.
</P>
<P>
Only scores of senior citizens participated in the 1998 Shenyang
fair. However, the second fair held earlier this year attracted
over 1,000 participants, with negotiated salaries ranging between
100,000-400,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Economist Lin Muxi, a professor at Liaoning University, noted
that China's effort to develop a knowledge-based economy has
created a highly competitive environment forcing enterprises to
bid for talented people. The experiment involving talented senior
citizens will have far-reaching significance, according to Lin.
</P>
<P>
According to an official, the Ministry of Personnel is
developing a scientific system to assess and determine the
appropriate salary range for talented senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province, one of China's heavy industrial bases, is
home to 10 percent of the country's large and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China's first job placement market, which was founded in
Shenyang in the early 1980s, sparked the establishment of over 2,
000 related markets nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Fruits Flooding N. W. Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- South African fruits have flooded
markets in Kenya's northwestern Rift Valley Province, as a result
of local transport problems which restricted local fruits to
reach local markets.
</P>
<P>
"We received our supplies from the interior parts of Rift
Valley province in the past, but the supply has been dropping
alarmingly since the start of the rains" in March, said local
peddler Ruth Njeri, according to Friday's East African Standard
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Many traders said the heavy rain had made roads between the
fruit- growing area and the markets in the province impassable.
</P>
<P>
The hawkers at the local markets said orange shortage was the
most biting, compelling them to travel to capital Nairobi for
imported oranges from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Consumers complained over the high prices of fruits, especially
oranges, saying the price of a 25-kilogram bag of oranges was 800
shillings (about 12.5 U.S. dollars), a sharp rise from the past.
</P>
<P>
However, traders said they have to include the costs of
transporting products from Nairobi, adding that they purchased at
a higher wholesale price compared to what they paid to their
traditional suppliers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The reliability of large Chinese-
made power-generating units operating in the country with
capacities of more than 100 megawatts has risen to over 90 percent,
up three percentage points from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The enhanced reliability represents a marked improvement in
both the safe operation and economic efficiency of the country's
large generators, according to a senior official with the China

</P>
<P>
He said that China has introduced a reliability monitoring and
management system aimed at solving common quality problems, which
has proved to be very effective.
</P>

Under the system, construction workers and power equipment
manufacturers work together on the installation and trial
operations of new generators. Both sides cooperate to solve any
defects during the test run, especially those that might lead to
accidents.
</P>
<P>
The official cited the latest statistics showing that by the
end of last year, the country's total installed capacity had
reached 300,000 megawatts, of which more than 60 percent was
contributed by large generating units with capacities above 100
megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Experts here noted that the favorable change in the structure
of generating units signals rapid improvement in China's power
sector.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh May Expect Drought This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- With little rain over the past
several months, meteorologists here are wondering whether
Bangladesh is heading for a 10-year-cycle drought this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Space Resource and Remote Sensing Organization
prefer to wait till the end of the first week of April before
drawing any conclusion. But fears of a drought is deepening,
considering the current sequence -- long spell of drought in 1979
and 1989 in an interval of 10 years, according to a report in The
Daily Star on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Quite anxiously we're observing the current dry spell and not
certain yet whether this is going to be another drought after
those in 1979 and 1989," the report quoted a source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The long spell of drought in 1979 continued till May and in
1989 it came to an end in April with a devastating tornado.
Experts fear that if the current spell of dry weather ends with
hailstorms and tornadoes, it will certainly take a heavy toll on
standing crops.
</P>
<P>
There is another strong sign of a possible drought, the report
said. Usually a flood of big magnitude precedes the 10-year-cycle
drought, as the country experienced severe floods in 1978 and
1988, and Bangladesh was hit by a worst flood last year.
</P>
<P>
But experts think it is rather premature to jump to a
conclusion. "It would be a bit premature to call the dry spell a
'cycle-drought' at this stage... We prefer to call it a
'non-rainfall' situation," a weather expert said.
</P>
<P>
Over the period between November 25 last year and March 15 this
year, only one-millimeter rainfall was recorded at Mongla Port,
Southwest Bangladesh, on February 6, and some traces of rain in
northwestern Rangpur and Dianjpur districts.
</P>
<P>
Slight to moderate rainfall was recorded in different parts of
the country since mid-March, but that "should not be misunderstood
as an end to the dry spell," according to one meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
The level of water of the country's major rivers such as Padma,
Jamuna, Brahmaputra, Gorai and Teesta has fallen sharply and
people are suffering from want of drinking water, reports said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's new and modern
pay-per-view televisions project is now going ahead after the
signing of a 35-million-U.S.-dollar deal Thursday between the
Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and U.S. Pfluger Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in the capital Harare and the money
will be provided by Sentry Financial International, a U.S.
commercial bank, the daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The project will cover the entire country and allow the
Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation the opportunity to enter into
business without an outlay of money," said Brandon Rogers, a
partner in Pfluger.
</P>
<P>
"It will be self-financing and is expected to allow consumers
an affordable option to satellite via wireless communication,"
Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe, through its broadcasting corporation, will be the
Mecca of pay TV in Africa as it will be able to access markets in
other countries through his proposition," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Paper Use Soars Despite Internet Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to predictions and
forecasts, paper use in the United States continues to swell even
as more people go online and use e-mail.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1998, annual paper consumption in the country
rose from 86.8 million tons to 99 million tons, said PaperCom., a
non-profit group that studies the future of paper-based products
and services.
</P>
<P>
"Paper is emerging as the currency of the electronic era," said
the group in a report this week. "People may read online, but if
something is important they save it on paper."
</P>
<P>
Morning newspaper sales, the use of paper checks and postal
volume have all increased as Internet usage has expanded, the
group said.
</P>
<P>
"While the Internet and paper products will surely compete in
some areas," said the group in the report, "the general pattern is
one of mutual growth and interdependence."
</P>
<P>
Morning newspaper circulation in the United States went up from
40.4 million copies in 1988 to an estimated 45.4 million in 1997,
according to PaperCom.
</P>
<P>
Mail volume rose from 166.4 billion pieces in 1992 to almost
200 billion last year, while envelope sales were at an all-time
high in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, advertising mail volume reached a record high of 82.
87 billion pieces in 1998 against 62.54 billion in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The volume of paper checks rose from 57.5 billion in 1991 to 66
billion in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Face Shortage of Arable Land: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh would soon have to face a
severe shortage of arable land which is being depleted by
increasing human settlement every year.
</P>
<P>
The total cultivable land of the country now stands
approximately at 9 million hectares, which is shrinking every year
and human settlement specially for housing has been identified as
the main reason, according to a recent study by the U.N.
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Depicting a frustrating picture of the contraction of arable
land in this South Asian nation, the study said that by the year
2025, the growing population pressure would use up 50 percent of
the country's cultivable land for settlement.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 13 persons share one hectare of land at present
and with the population reaching 170 million by the year 2020, one
hectare of land would be shared by 20 people, according to the
study, which was submitted to the Ministry of Land last week.
</P>
<P>
Unplanned rural settlement on the arable land has been causing
adverse effects on the country's total agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The industrial development and acquisition of land by the
government for different purposes have also been causing a
negative impact on the condition of the farmers and on the
socioeconomic scenario of the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, land is being fragmented in the countryside every
year due to the growing population and the law of inheritance,
creating a negative impact on the efficient use of land and its
productivity.
</P>
<P>
The estimated population of Bangladesh was 110 million in 1991
and it reached 126 million in January 1998. Rapid population
growth and little or no change in the land area reduced the
land-man ratio drastically from 0.8 hectares in 1951 to 0.32
hectares in 1991 and to 0.28 hectares in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The dwindling per capita land resource is expected to diminish
further as the population increases and agricultural land is
converted into other purposes.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's 14.74 million hectares of prime agricultural
land, 63 percent is used for cultivation, 4.38 for rural and urban
housing, and the rest is forest and cultivable waste land.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Official Faces Tricky Race for WTO Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The race for the World Trade
Organization (WTO) top post has become tricky for Thailand's
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi after Washington'
secret veto against him.
</P>
<P>
Thai government officials said however that they still pinned
hope on Supachai to win the job.
</P>
<P>
The WTO failed to agree on the appointment of a new
director-general at a meeting in Geneva earlier this week after
the United States reportedly rejected the Thai candidate, causing
a deadlock in the race.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will reconvene next week after the Easter break.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said on Thursday that
he believed Supachai, also commerce minister, was still in the
race against U.S.-backed rival Michael Moore from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"Other people might have felt disheartened by what has
happened. But I still have hope that he will get the job," Chuan
said.
</P>
<P>
The selection of a new WTO director-general has become a
two-man race between Supachai and Moore, former New Zealand prime
minister, after Moroccan candidate Hassan Abouyoub and Canadian
candidate Roy Maclaren pulled out of the race.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has been lobbying hard for Supachai to be
appointed the new WTO director-general and had made it an issue of
national prestige. But reports from Geneva indicate that both
Supachai and his rival face stiff resistance from some key WTO
member nations.
</P>
<P>
The contest to succeed outgoing WTO chief Renato Ruggiero of
Italy has dragged on for six months, missing several deadlines.
His term expires at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Decisions in the WTO are taken by consensus rather than voting
among the 134 member countries. This method, its supporters claim,
helps avoid bitterness and maintains cohesion.
</P>
<P>
But trade analysts and envoys said that unless the leadership
impasse was resolved soon it could split the group and have a
serious effect on preparations for the planned launch of a new
round of global trade liberalization negotiations before the
year's end.
</P>
<P>
There was speculation that the deadlock could open the way for
a compromise decision that would allow Maclaren, Canada's former
trade minister, to rejoin the race and win the post.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the WTO and its predecessor the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade have always been headed by a European and
developing countries have been increasingly vocal in calling for
the appointment of a figure from their midst.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has promised to bridge the gap between developing
economies and richer nations if he wins the position. He has
earned international respect for his role in ensuring that
Thailand resisted pressure to put up trade barriers in reaction to
the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has already won backing from the Asia-Pacific region,
but it seems that he needs European Union (EU) support against a
strong U.S. campaign against him.
</P>
<P>
The EU is split. Sweden has taken a strong stance against
Supachai, while most nations back or do not oppose him. Other EU
members were launching a last-ditch effort to form a united
support by convincing the Swedes to switch its backing from Moore
to Supachai before the next attempt at consensus on April 14.
</P>
<P>
Moore, who has held a range of government posts in New Zealand,
is championed by the United States and also has a good mix of
support from North and South.
</P>
<P>
After the inconclusive meeting on Wednesday, the latest of
several failed deadlines in six months of efforts to appoint a new
WTO chief, U.S. Ambassador in Geneva Rita Hayes voiced confidence
that Moore would eventually win.
</P>
<P>
Some delegates charged that she was telling many countries, in
confidence, that Washington would never allow Supachai to become
the new WTO chief and that they had better vote against him.
</P>
<P>
Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, accused the United
States of using a secret veto against Supachai.
</P>
<P>
"Any vetoes against particular candidates, whoever they are,
should in my view be disclosed to other members," he said.
"Anonymous votes" were inconsistent with efforts to ensure
transparency.

ISLAMABAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Pakistani English newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The News:
</P>
<P>
-- Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, in an interview
with The News, has vowed to "put aside five decades of bitterness

gain from such a policy."

</P>
<P>
-- A sharp drop in tax collection has punched the Central Board

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
imposed a 25-percent additional regulatory duty on the import of
sugar to protect the local industry and discourage its import.
</P>
<P>
The imposition has boosted the rate of regulatory duty on
import sugar from 10 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the total duty levied on the import of sugar will now
be 45 percent, which includes a 10-percent customs duty, sources
from the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to impose additional regulatory duty on the import
of sugar was made Thursday during an ECC meeting chaired by
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.
</P>
<P>
The ECC believed that it was necessary to protect the local
sugar industry and discourage the import of sugar as its prices in
the international market had started declining.

<HEADLINE> Major Romanian Paper Condemns NATO Bombing on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Romania's leading daily Adevarul
(Truth) Thursday lashed out at the U.S.-led NATO for its
aggression on Yugoslavia, a sovereign country, under the excuse of
defending human rights and peace.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing on Yugoslavia does not at all aim to achieve "
peace", as the military bloc has claimed, but is solely designed
to stage a war, said a commentary in the newspaper written by its
editor-in-chief Cristian Tudor Popescu.
</P>
<P>
If NATO did pursue peace sincerely, it would not have rejected
diplomatic efforts from any side, said the commentary entitled "
NATO Bullets."
</P>
<P>
NATO's insincerity was already revealed prior to Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov's trip to Yugoslavia for mediation, the
commentary said. Senior NATO officials had said Primakov's tour
would be in vain unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
agreed to "immediately and unconditionally withdraw all troops
from Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Now the air strikes launched by NATO have claimed thousands of
lives in Yugoslavia, resulting in the kind of "human disaster"
that NATO said "it has been trying to prevent," said the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
It said the reason that the United States deemed the peace
proposal made by Milosevic after talks with Primakov as "far from
enough" and "unacceptable" was that Washington could not stand
Russia's efforts to restore peace to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The life and death of people in the hinterland of Europe does
not count much to the United States. What the United States wants
is precisely to bring Yugoslavia down to its knees in a pool of
blood and submit the whole Europe so that the United States can
pose itself as one that dominates the world.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that the United States is trying to
strangle a sovereign country by the most typical means employed by
Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's remark that "Yugoslavia is
jeopardizing international support for Serb claims to Kosovo"
clearly shows that he is instigating Kosovo's secession from
Yugoslavia.

<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based China Science
and Technology Museum, the sole national science museum in the
country, opened a fractal art area to the public here today.
</P>
<P>
The 240-square-meter show area was co-funded by AT&AMP;T of the
United States, which provided 75,000 US dollars from the AT&AMP;T NEAT
foundation for the establishment of the show area.
</P>
<P>
The fractal art show includes 17 items of exhibits, which
physically demonstrate the frontier science of using mathematical
models to depict the insight of the nature.
</P>
<P>
The Museum won AT&AMP;T funding through an international bidding
process for the unique and innovative plan of its fractal art
program.
</P>
<P>
The AT&AMP;T NEAT foundation offers biennial grants to science
museums around the world to encourage them to initiate new
programs that combines science with art.
</P>
<P>
China Science and Technology Museum, located in northern suburb
of Beijing, receives more than 700,000 visitors every year. It
will be able to receive one million visitors per year after
completion of the second phase of construction this year.

<HEADLINE> Romania Provides Humanitarian Aid to Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government decided
Thursday to provide humanitarian aid for Macedonia to help the
Kosovan refugees fleeing there.
</P>
<P>
The decision came a week after Macedonia asked Romania for help.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Adriana Saftoiu said the aid, valued at
nine billion lei (600,000 U.S. dollars), includes milk powder,
cooking oil, sugar, medicine, clothing and quilts.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to send food, clothing and medicine,
which will total 250,000 lei (16,667 dollars), to Kosovans who are
taking refuge in the northwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
On March 26, Romania announced it would take up to 4,000
refugees from Macedonia in response to a request for help.
</P>
<P>
After NATO began its air strikes against Yugoslavia last
Wednesday, thousands of Yugoslav refugees have fled to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
By Friday, altogether 101 Kosovo refugees had arrived in
Romania, according to Romanian official statistics, but officials
in charge of immigration noted that the actual number is far more.

WARSAW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw

send naval vessels to the Mediterranean to monitor the situation

</P>
<P>
Geremek said at a press conference that he hopes that Russia
would not carry out this plan.
</P>
<P>
He tried to justify NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia by saying
that the NATO military action was launched to stop the oppression
of ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo and help refugees
return home.

Geremek added that Poland will airlift the first lot of
humanitarian supplies to Kosovo on Friday and is ready to give

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Jobs Abroad for Sri Lankans: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will get a further
200,000 job opportunities abroad following the visit of Labor
Minister John Seneviratne to several Middle East countries
recently, the official Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Minister Seneviratne was quoted as saying he had led a
top-level delegation to several Gulf countries including Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan and Lebanon,
where he had favorable discussions with local industrialists.
</P>
<P>
The job market in those countries for Sri Lankans was very
satisfactory and there were a large number of skilled and
unskilled jobs available, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The lack of manpower resulted in Sri Lankan workers getting
more employment opportunities in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that private job agencies had also played a key role
in helping obtain employment for Sri Lankans in those countries.
</P>
<P>
There are around 1 million Sri Lankans employed in the Middle
East and Far East countries. Migrant workers' remittance has been
one of the main sources of foreign exchange in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan migrant workers remitted 60 billion rupees (880
million U.S. dollars) in 1998, a 9-percent increase in rupee terms
over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> NATO Apologizes for Deaths of Yugoslav Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO has apologized for the
deaths of nine refugees earlier this week at two refugee centers
in Yugoslavia, CARE Australia, an Australian non-governmental aid
agency, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two centers were part of a refugee network run by CARE
Australia on behalf of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Care Australia quoted Friday the British newspaper The
Independent as reporting that Supreme Headquarters Allied Power
Europe, NATO's European headquarters, had expressed regret for the
accidental damage to two CARE refugee centers in the Yugoslav city
of Nis.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kaemmerer, spokesman for the headquarters, said, "We
are very sorry for the loss of civilian lives in this instance and
we very much regret the loss of life."
</P>
<P>
CARE Australia Chief Executive Charles Tapp said he was pleased
that NATO has accepted responsibility for the incidents and hoped
that the admission meant that the location of refugee centers
would be taken into account in future.
</P>
<P>
"Care (Australia) has requested that the U.N. agency
responsible for refugees, UNHCR, provide those responsible for the
incident with information that will help avoid a repeat of this
tragedy," Tapp said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The refugees living at the CARE Australia centers were ethnic
Serbs, mainly women and children, who had been driven from their
homes during the earlier Balkans conflict, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Thai, U.S. Experts Cooperate Over Toxic Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai and U.S. experts would
cooperate in an operation to identify the toxic chemicals recently
discovered under an airport in Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south
of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The United States has dispatched a team of experts from the
Joint United States Military Assistance Group to inspect the site
with Thai experts, sources close to the U.S. Embassy here said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The strong-smelling hazardous waste was unearthed last week
under the Bor Fai airport runway in Hua Hin of Prachuab Khiri Khan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The waste, suspected of being the deadly "Agent Orange"
chemical used by the U.S. Army to denude forests to deny
Vietnamese fighters ground cover during the Vietnam War, has
caused several Thai villagers to fall sick.
</P>
<P>
However, there is conflicting information over who brought the
substance into Thailand. Thailand's Foreign Ministry confirmed
that the six Thai military facilities known to have been used by
Washington during the Vietnam War excluded Bor Fai airbase, which
had long been owned by the Thai Civil Aviation Department.
</P>
<P>
"It had been used as a pilot training ground years before the
war and is still used for that purpose," an official said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy has refused to disclose any further details
concerning the possibility that Washington had secretly used the
airbase during the Vietnam War, saying the information currently
available does not go back that far.
</P>
<P>
Washington sent the inspection team at the request of Bangkok.
Jarupong Bunlong, deputy director-general of Thailand's Pollution
Control Department, said the chemicals should be identified by
next week. All he could confirm for now is that the five 15-liter
barrels and one 200-liter barrel that have been found originated
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Thai experts had earlier discovered the toxic barrels had a
code designating their origin, but had not said what the substance
was. The code names "Delaware" ( a U.S. state) as the place of
origin.
</P>
<P>
Jarupong said his department has built a shelter around the
area to prevent rainfall from dissolving the substance
underground.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM Suggests Deployment of NATO Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko said Thursday the only solution to the Kosovo crisis was to
deploy NATO troops in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Charles Josselin, secretary of state to
the French foreign ministry in charge of cooperation, Majko said
the situation in Kosovo was very serious and it was imperative to
find a way out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said Albania would develop its relations with
France which used to have closer ties with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Josselin promised that France would provide humanitarian aid
for the Kosovo refugees flooding into Albania and his government
was examining a request for global assistance in the Albanian
economy.
</P>
<P>
Albania backs NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia, which aims
to force Milosevic to accept a peace plan mainly proposed by the
United States and its allies at the Paris peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Albania has urged NATO to deploy ground forces in Kosovo, but U.
S. President Bill Clinton has ruled this out.
</P>
<P>
Since the air strikes started on March 24, Albania has been
burdened by a great influx of refugees as more than 22,000 Kosovo
refugees have limped into the poorest country in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Solana: NATO to Continue Air Strikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said on Thursday that NATO will continue air strikes on
Yugoslavia until President Slobodan Milosevic accepts the peace
plan proposed in last months talks in France to solve the Kosovo
issue.
</P>
<P>
Solana, in an interview with a Spanish television, said that
NATO military strike against Yugoslavia was a task of weeks
instead of a few days.
</P>
<P>
Defending the ongoing military action, Solana said that the
political aim of NATO air strikes is to give autonomy to ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, to secure the borders and promote democracy
in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
NATO's actions did not amount to war as they were directed
against military facilities of Yugoslavia instead of the Yugoslav
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether NATO will send ground troops to Kosovo, the NATO
chief said that ground troops might be deployed to help ethnic
Albanian refugees return home if a ceasefire agreement could be
reached.
</P>
<P>
He, however, acknowledged that sending ground troops would be a
difficult decision.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes Y Juan
ruled out the possibility of sending ground troops to Kosovo,
saying that it was a risky action which would only lead to heavy
casualties.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees Lowest Inflation in 5 Years in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in March in Thailand
rose year-on-year by just 1.6 percent, the lowest rate in at least
five years, according to the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of this year, the rate was 2.6 percent,
well below the official forecast of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The stability of the baht was a major factor behind the low
rate, Vithoon Tulayanondha, deputy director of the ministry's
Department of Business Economics, was quoted Friday by the Bangkok
Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The baht has been trading between 27 and 38 to the U.S. dollar
for several months, compared with 49 baht in March last year and a
peak of 57 baht in January last year.
</P>
<P>
The monthly Consumer Price Index in March also fell by 0.2
percent from February, due largely to a 0.9-percent decline in
food prices.
</P>
<P>
Vithoon said the index in April was expected to decline from
March because of the reduction of the value-added tax (VAT) to 7
percent from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The VAT cuts would reduce the prices of products by about 2.73
percent overall, the department has calculated.
</P>
<P>
The department also announced that the country's wholesale
price index in March fell by 0.5 percent from February.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of the Macao SAR Basic Law (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- This is the fifth in a question
and answer series on the ABCs of the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
How does the Basic Law reflect the "one country, two systems"
policy?
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" policy serves as both the policy
basis and essence of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law first and foremost gives expression to the "one
country" principle.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Basic Law stipulates that the MSAR is an
inalienable part of the People's Republic of China and is directly
under the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Government maintains sole responsibility
for the MSAR's foreign affairs and defense, and will appoint or
remove the Chief Executive, the principal government official and
Procurator-General for the MSAR in accordance with the relevant
provisions in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
National laws listed in Annex III to the Basic Law will be
applied in the MSAR. The Chief Executive of the MSAR, as well as
the region's principal government officials, President and Vice
President of the Legislative Council, President of the Court of
Final Appeals, Procurator-General and members of the Executive
Council must be Chinese citizens with permanent residency in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law adheres to the "one country" principle and
contains explicit provisions to ensure fulfillment of the "two
systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Basic Law stipulates that MSAR will exercise a
high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive, legislative and
independent judicial power, including the power of final
adjudication in accordance with the Law.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR's executive branch and legislature will be composed of
permanent residents in Macao in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The socialist system and related policies will not be practiced
in MSAR, and the existing capitalist system and way of life in the
region will remain unchanged for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Laws previously in force in Macao will be maintained, with the
exception of laws which contravene the Basic Law or which are
otherwise subject to amendments by the legislature or relevant
departments in the MSAR in accordance with legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
The government of the MSAR will be responsible for the
maintaining public order in the region. The Basic Law clearly
stipulated the basic rights and obligations of residents in the
MSAR.
</P>
<P>
The MSAR will maintain independent finances and will formulate
economic, social, scientific and technological, culture and
educational policies.
</P>
<P>
Courts in the MSAR shall interpret on their own, in
adjudicating cases and the provisions in the Basic Law which the
limits of the region's autonomy.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Champion Wang Nan Tops Chinese Best Ten Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- World Cup table-tennis women's
champion Wang Nan topped the Chinese Best Ten Athletes of the Year
at a poll voted by 20 media press here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who captured four gold medals at the Bangkok Asian Games,
accumulated most votes from 10 million sports fans and
sportswriters across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Out of the top ten, nine were women athletes, including Wang
Nan (table-tennis), Li Xuemei (track and field), Sun Tianni (
weightlifting), Liu Xuan (gymnastics), Lee Lai Shan (windsurfing),
Chen Hua (swimming), Ye Zhaoying (badminton), Yang Yang (short-
track speed skating) and Ge Fei (badminton).
</P>
<P>
The sole male athlete was Wang Yifu, who won four gold medals
at the World Shooting Championships in 1998 and two berths to the
2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Wang was awarded the Best Ten honour
for the third time after 1992 and 1994.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- This is the sixth in a question
and answer series on the ABCs of the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Is the Basic Law a local law?
</P>
<P>
Some people are under the misconception that the Basic Law is
simply a local law concerning various systems in the MSAR and has
no relationship with other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Determining whether a law is national or local is based on
content and the enacting legislative body. All laws enacted by the
national legislature National People's Congress are national laws.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law, adopted by the National People's Congress,
China's highest legislative body, is a national law. Therefore,
the Basic Law not only applies to the MSAR, but also to all
provinces, autonomous regions and cities with provincial status in
China.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Macao and other parts of China, as well as
national and local government agencies and people's organizations
should study and understand the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
A good understanding of the Basic Law will ensure a true
appreciation of the "one country, two systems" principle, as
provision for enforcing and upholding of the authority and
sanctity of the Law.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia to See More Bank Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A wave of bank mergers is sweeping
across Asia, where one-third to a half of banks will either
acquire, or be acquired over the next two years as a result of
industry restructuring and consolidation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
During the past few months, a merger and acquisition (M&AMP;A)
storm has already hit Asia's banking system. Seventeen thrift
banks in the Philippines are planning to merge into "a super
thrift bank."
</P>
<P>
Also, the Philippine Commercial International Bank, the
country's third largest bank in terms of capital, is putting its
shares on the auction block. A number of local and foreign banks
have expressed their strong desire to acquire a majority stake in
the bank.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, five private banks have agreed to merge into "a
power bank."
</P>
<P>
Indonesian bankers expect the number of banks in their country
to shrink to 30 or fewer by 2002, from nearly 150 banks today.
</P>
<P>
What has produced the sweeping wave?
</P>
<P>
First, two years after the financial crisis broke out, Asian
banks remain in dire need of capital, but are shut out of the
capital market.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, commercial banks suffered a loss of 12.3
billion U.S. dollars in 1998 and have to seek outside investors
for recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
Second, Asian governments are encouraging bank restructuring
and are courting foreign investments in local banks to revive the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
Third, Asian banks' 1 trillion dollars of non-performing loans
are forcing some of them to be acquired by local or foreign
investors for survival.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the banking sector needs 30 billion dollars to
resolve the issue of non-performing loans, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, necessary conditions in countries like South Korea,
Thailand and Indonesia are becoming ripe with the deepening of
banking reforms, as they are opening their financial markets and
allowing foreign investors to buy part or, a majority of bank
shares.
</P>
<P>
In the M&AMP;A process, foreigner players are more aggressive than
the local ones. DBS Bank of Singapore has snapped up banks in
Thailand, Hong Kong and the Philippines. Major global players
ABN-Amro and GE Capital have announced several deals in Asia and
are looking for more.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to be opportunistic in our acquisitions but
we will be careful about small- and medium-sized banks," said John
Olds, vice-president and chief executive officer of DBS Bank of
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Observers said foreign players are seeking to take advantage of
the current crisis to secure a growth platform in the region. In
1998, acquisitions by American and European players grew to 1.1
billion dollars from a mere 80 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The amount of M&AMP;A activities by foreign investors will
definitely increase in the next two years, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
So far the deals have been largely with strategic partners from
foreign countries, especially from the United States and Europe,
rather than so-called "venture" investors, who have no strategic
agenda but simply look for cheap assets and sell them for a
profit.
</P>
<P>
"We are investing in established businesses that are decent and
of good quality but which may be facing difficulties," said Tan
Beien Kiat, the Singapore-based regional managing director of
Newbridge Capital.
</P>
<P>
With a large-scale "foreign invasion" into the Asian banking
industry, many local businessmen do not welcome new partners as
they believe it would be hard for many of the new comers to break
the habit of running to the capital markets or banks for cheap

</P>
<P>
But economists generally believe that the increased M&AMP;A
activities by foreigners are beneficial for the restructuring and
consolidation of the region's banking system.
</P>
<P>
Without M&AMP;A activities, either by local or foreign investors,
the banking sector in many Asian countries would take much longer
time to revive, they said.

<HEADLINE> KLA: Rugova Forced to Call End to NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo Liberation Army(KLA)
said Thursday it believed that Kosovo Albanian moderate leader
Ibrahim Rugova was forced to call for an end to NATO strikes on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"If he made the statements of his free will, the KLA will
consider it an act of high treason to the homeland," KLA
spokesman Jakup Krasniqi told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Rugova's statements in Pristina on
Wednesday, in which he appealed for a stop to NATO's bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Something is not normal in the latest presentations of Mr
Rugova, perhaps out of pressure from the Serb police who allegedly
are protecting him," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that he was coerced, forced, to declare that
NATO should stop bombing Serb targets," he added.
</P>
<P>
With his latest presentation, Rugova had lost the right to
represent the Albanians of Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
Krasniqi said he was restrained in his words because he had no
accurate information regarding the statements by the Kosovo leader.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Rugova met Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade for the first time in more than ten months
and they committed themselves to peace.

</P>
<P>
The university was set up in 1996 by combining four colleges
and universities several dozen kilometers away from each other.
</P>

The distance between them causes inconveniences for staff
members and high fuel costs for transportation. Average annual
fuel costs and maintenance of buses for the regular runs between
branch campuses are as much as a million yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Czech soccer tycoon Petr
Mach has been charged with tax evasion and insurance fraud, the
state prosecutor's office said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mach, former owner of Sparta Prague, could face up to 12 years
in jail if convicted of failing to pay customs duty when he bought
a luxury BMW in Germany seven years ago, said the prosecutor's
spokesman Martin Omelka.
</P>
<P>
Mach allegedly later sold the car in Ukraine and claimed it had
been stolen.
</P>
<P>
Mach also got a 4.3 million US dollars loan from a Czech bank
to buy buses for his company and later sold the buses to another
company, allegedly concealing they were being held as collateral
by the bank, the prosecutor's office said.
</P>
<P>
Mach bought Sparta in 1992 and sold it four years later to a
Slovak steel concern for a record 1 billion koruna (30 million US
dollars). He has retired from soccer and pursues horse racing.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- French cycling federation (FFC)
chief Daniel Baal was charged in connection with the 1998 Tour de
France doping scandal in Lille, France, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Baal, the 13th person to be placed under investigation, was
charged with "complicity in helping others to obtain and use
illegal performance enhancing substances," judicial sources said.
</P>
<P>
FFC vice-president Roger Legeay and leading rider Richard
Virenque, formerly with Festina team and now with the Italian
Polti team, were charged earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Tour de France director Jean-Marie Leblanc, detained for
questioning earlier on Thursday, was not charged after being heard
by magistrate Patrick Keil later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Baal, saying he had done all he could against the practice of
doping in the sport, said: "This charge is unjust and absolutely
unfounded."
</P>
<P>
Baal said he had asked the French sports ministry for an
increase in anti-doping controls and thought some of those charged
were trying to implicate others to try to reduce their
responsibility in the affair.
</P>
<P>
Last year's Tour, won by Italian Marco Pantani, came close to
being abandoned halfway because of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Several teams were expelled or withdrew and only half the
riders who started the race reached the Champs Elysees finish in
Paris.

<HEADLINE> Mortgages Making Shanghai's Housing More Affordable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Out of 20 houses available for a
real estate sale, 18 were auctioned off on Tuesday in Shanghai in
China's first sale of houses that come with a bank mortgage.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people were present and 254 bid against each
other for nearly an hour. The auction ended with 3.62 million yuan
worth of sales.
</P>
<P>
After a dozen bids and ever increasing prices, one 59-year-old
woman, Li Xiuzhen, finally won one deal. She got a 105-sq. m.
house on the outskirts of Shanghai. "Without the Construction Bank
of China mortgage," she explains while signing the contract, "I
can't imagine how I could afford the house."
</P>
<P>
She paid 1,950 yuan per square meter, nearly 700 yuan below the
market value. "The deal was attractive," she adds, "because the
amortization dramatically eases the debt pressure."
</P>
<P>
The 18 buyers are mostly ordinary citizens like Li. Their 10-
year loans come from the Huangpu branch of the Construction Bank
of China. Zhang Enzhao, the president of the Shanghai branch, says
that the bank has provided as much as 2 million yuan in loans for
the auction and will provide more for houses in future.
</P>
<P>
Fan Ganping, the vice-president of the Shanghai International
Commodity Auction Company, the auctioneer, says that the Shanghai
branches of other banks also have mortgage services available for
real estate auctions, as part of an effort to help more local
people realize their dream of having their own house.
</P>
<P>
Real estate auctions, which only began to appear in Shanghai in
the past 2 years, grew rapidly, partly thanks to the knock-down
auction prices that were in many cases 30 percent below the market
price.
</P>
<P>
Potential buyers always faced immense difficulties in the past
with a lump-sum payment and this in turn greatly inhibited the
growth of the local real estate business, including auctions. In
the past, there were often no more than 50 bidders at an auction.
</P>
<P>
Yao Guanghai, a State Administration of Internal Trade official,
says that providing mortgages for auctions benefits both
auctioneers and citizens and that it really deserves to be
promoted in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Housing is one of the major problems for the people of Shanghai
and they have an increasing awareness of home ownership. Per-
capita residential space in Shanghai was 9 sq. m. at the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai had 16.2 billion yuan in outstanding housing loans by
the end of 1998, a jump of 117 percent from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> American Bronson Fails Doping Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- American Bryan Bronson has been
suspended after a positive doping test in Rome on July 14, the
International Amateur Athletic Federation said in Monaco on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bronson, the world's leading 400 meters hurdler, finished third
at the 1997 world championships in Athens, and clocked the third
fastest time ever of 47.03 seconds in winning the U.S. title in
New Orleans last June.
</P>
<P>
But after winning in Rome in the following month, Bronson's
urine sample was found to have "abnormal steroid concentrations",
and has been suspended on March 19 this year, said IAAF spokesman
Giorgio Reineri.
</P>
<P>
To explaine the eight-month delay between the positive test
finding and the decision of suspension, Reineri said: "This is a
very delicate case.
</P>
<P>
"After he tested positive, Bronson was asked to explain himself.
He sent to us an explanation from his lawyer and a doctor, saying
that he had some medical problem. We took the decision not to
suspend him immediately, but to await a full medical report.
</P>
<P>
Bronson, 26, was allowed to race all last season, despite the
positive test findings.
</P>
<P>
"We waited for nearly six months to receive his medical report,
" Reinari said. "The medical report was never sent, and it was
impossible for us to reach Bronson, and so we have suspended him."
</P>
<P>
Bronson is the third top athlete to be suspended for drug use
in the past month.
</P>
<P>
Vita Pavlysh, the Ukrainian who won the women's shot put at
last month's world indoor championships in Japan, was stripped of
her title following a positive test.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the British governing body UK Athletics announced
that European 200 metres champion Doug Walker had been suspended
pending a hearing following a positive test for the anabolic
steroid nandrolone after an out-of-competition test last December.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Sentences Salvadoran Terrorist to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Salvadoran Otto Rene Rodriguez
Llerena, who confessed to two acts of terrorism in the Cuban
capital, Havana, was condemned to death Thursday in a Havana court.
</P>
<P>
Under Cuban law, the death sentence will be appealed routinely
before the Supreme Court, and then before the State Council, the
highest judicial entity in the island.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez confessed to placing a bomb in a central Havana hotel
in 1997 and trying to introduce explosives to Cuba in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The trial had heard evidence not only of the Salvadoran ex-
soldier's crime, but also of his ties with the anti-Castro
American Cuban Foundation (FNCA) based in Miami.
</P>
<P>
During the trial process it was determined that Rodriguez
intended, in his second journey to the island, to place devices at
the memorial to the Argentine-Cuban guerrilla, Ernesto "Che"
Guevara, in Santa Clara city, some 270 kilometers east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
The seriousness of the events had the district attorney change
at request for a 30-year jail sentence to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Another Salvadoran man, Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon, also paid by
the FNCA, was condemned to death last week for carrying out
dynamite bombings in five hotels and a restaurant in Havana.
</P>
<P>
Cruz Leon, whose actions caused the death of an Italian tourist
and injuries to 11 others, is now awaiting the Supreme Court's
decision after the routine appeal under Cuban law.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Imports Large Amount of Edible Oil in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar imported a large amount of
edible oil in 1998, valued at 121.7 million U.S. dollars,
according to the latest official figures published by the
country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar cultivates more than 650,000 hectares of edible oil
crops annually, of which 450,000 hectares are peanuts and 200,000
hectares sunflowers.
</P>
<P>
While Myanmar's population increased by 1.84 percent annually,
the cultivated areas of edible oil crops did not expand
correspondingly and per-hectare output was lower, thus unable to
meet demand.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the development of agriculture and enable
self-sufficiency in food and edible oil, Myanmar has leased out
free of charge to private entrepreneurs large plots of vacant,
virgin and fallow lands as well as wetlands for reclamation and
cultivation.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Thursday called on the Commonwealth of Independent States
to take an united position over the issue of Kosovo, reported
Inter-fax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the twelve members of the CIS have different
positions on the issue, Ivanov said at a meeting of CIS foreign
ministers that it is very important to speak with one voice on
this matter, because a war in the Balkans will harm the interests
of all countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held to prepare for the summit meeting of the
heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States Friday.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the CIS heads of state would unanimously
condemn the NATO aggression against Yugoslavia when they meet
Friday in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting is to discuss a range of issues including
trade and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov hailed Thursday's meeting between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Misosevic and ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who
opposed NATO's bombing on Yugoslavia. After the meeting both
committed themselves to seek a peaceful solution in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Religious Leaders Seek Halt to Bombing for Easter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Roman Catholic and Serbian
Orthodox religious leaders urged Yugoslavia and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) to resume peace talks as their
congregations began Easter observances Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In joint letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, Eight Catholic cardinals called for
a cessation of hostilities between Yugoslavia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five Serbian Orthodox bishops who preside over the
North American branch of the Serbian Orthodox Church urged Clinton
and other NATO leaders to stop aerial bombing in Yugoslavia during
the Easter season.
</P>
<P>
"We implore you to suspend the bombing campaign beginning today
and at least through April 12," the Orthodox bishops said in a
statement. "This will provide for an opportunity to restart
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Serbian Orthodox Church asked a federal court in
Chicago to halt the air attacks, saying that bombs are falling on
sacred relics and icons. But a judge refused to hold an emergency
hearing, ruling the court had no jurisdiction over political and
military operations.
</P>
<P>
In their letter to Milosevic, the Catholic cardinals said
Serbian "military and police operations against the population of
Kosovo should cease immediately." They also asked Clinton for a
NATO cease-fire and said "no time must be lost in an effort to
return to the negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
Both letters urged the convening of a peace conference
involving other states in the region and the United Nations
because any settlement would require the creation of an
international peacekeeping force.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Rider Suspended for Third Time This Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to guard Isaiah Rider,
the Portland Trail Blazers lead the NBA in more than just the
standings.
</P>
<P>
Rider was suspended without pay Thursday for a league-high
third time this season for entering the stands late in Tuesday's
93-90 loss at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
NBA senior vice president of basketball operations Rod Thorn
said Rider was suspended for one game last night. It is unclear
why Rider entered the stands with about two minutes to go. He was
not ejected and finished with eight points.
</P>
<P>
All three of Rider's suspensions have been one game. The first
came after he left the bench during an altercation in a 97-95 loss
at Charlotte on February 26, an automatic one-game ban.
</P>
<P>
The second came for shoving Kings guard Jon Barry in the face
during an 88-78 win on March 18.
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers have the NBA's best mark at 24-6 and Rider
is their leading scorer at 15.4 points per game.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Cannot be a Hornet Player-Owner at Same Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan cannot play for
the Charlotte Hornets if he buys a 50 percent share of the team,
the retired superstar's agent said today.
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no truth to it," David Falk said of a
report that Jordan was considering coming out of retirement and
becoming a player-owner for the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
According to a local report, NBA league's rules forbid players
from owning teams, as Magic Johnson learned three years ago. This
would prevent any possibilities for Jordan from being a player-
owner even if he desire to do so.
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley, Jordan's close friend, said: "First of all,
Jordan is not good enough to make that team win anyway. They need
the old Michael Jordan, the guy from five or six years ago, to
make that team a contender.
</P>
<P>
"He's the greatest player to ever play the game, and he would
only do himself a disservice. I just hope he doesn't play because
he'd damage his legendary status."
</P>
<P>
Hornets spokesman Harold Kaufman said: "The Michael Jordan and
George Shinn negotiations have never involved a playing role for
Jordan."
</P>
<P>
People who have seen Jordan recently estimate he is about 20
pounds heavier than his playing weight, and he recently said he
hasn't picked up a basketball since hitting the final shot of the
game winner at the NBA Finals last year.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also recently underwent surgery on his right finger.
</P>
<P>
The Hornets have collapsed this season. Its boss Shinn has been
going through a divorce and battling numerous sexual harassment
allegations, coach Dave Cowens resigned, Anthony Mason has missed
the entire season, and the team's best player Glen Rice was traded
to the Lakers for Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
The team seems certain to miss the postseason for the first
time since 1995-96.

<HEADLINE> (EDS: Updates with more details)  Clinton Pledges to Continue Airstrikes against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton
pledged Thursday to "continue to carry out our mission" in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to service men and their families at the Norfolk Naval
Base in Virginia, Clinton warned that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic would be held responsible for safety of the three U.S.
soldiers captured by the Serbs Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic should make no mistake," Clinton said,
"The United States takes care of its own."
</P>
<P>
He said the NATO airstrikes are necessary, but he admitted the
mission is a dangerous one.
</P>
<P>
Clinton came to Norfolk to rally the troops and express his
appreciation for the sacrifices that their service requires. He
was met by Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., NATO's supreme allied
commander for the Atlantic, whose headquarters is at Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke by telephone to military personnel at Aviano Air
Base in Italy, where many of NATO's planes are based.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Clinton called on the allies and the American
public to "show a little resolve" with the air campaign now in its
second week.
</P>
<P>
Despite a growing humanitarian crisis, Clinton remains opposed
to sending in U.S. ground troops.
</P>
<P>
The president declined to explicitly rule out the introduction
of ground troops in the future, but he maintained that such a move
is not currently under consideration.
</P>
<P>
"The thing that bothers me about introducing ground troops
into a hostile situation--into Kosovo and into the Balkans--is
the prospect of never being able to get them out," Clinton said
in a CBS interview.

<HEADLINE> USTR Report Lists Unfair Trade Practices by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) released on Thursday its annual report on
foreign trade barriers, saying the country's major trading
partners continue to have unfair practices that hurt U.S. exports
of goods, services and farm products.
</P>
<P>
The report lists the so-called unfair trade practices which the
USTR said are harmful to American exports by 54 trading partners,
including its six largest: Canada, China, the European Union (EU),
Japan, South Korea and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
On Canada, the United States' single largest trading partner,
the report said that Canadian market has been opened to a
significant degree by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the
North America Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, impediments to U.S. goods and services
remain, including certain aspects of the Canadian agriculture
regime such as the Canadian Wheat Board, and Canada's failure to
provide adequate copyright and patent protection.
</P>
<P>
As for its economic relationship with Europe, "the largest and
most complex in the world," the administration said that battles
with the European Union over bananas and beef have "not only hurt
U.S. exports but have undermined the credibility of the WTO
dispute settlement system."
</P>
<P>
Despite hundreds of billions of dollars that are exchanged
unhindered in annual two-way trade and investments, the report
found that "the EU's protectionist agriculture policies are likely
to continue to cause disputes, unless addressed in upcoming
multilateral trade negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The report, in its segment on Japan, said the country continues
to make opening its markets to U.S. exports a top priority,
"emphasizing the need for implementation of fiscal stimulus and
reform of Japan's financial sector." It said the administration
would press Japan to implement further deregulation measures in
telecommunications, medical devices, housing and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The report called South Korea "one of the toughest markets in
the world for doing business." It commended the current Korean
administration for implementing efforts to put its economy on a
more open, market-oriented basis, in response to the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Resistance to key trade reforms remains, however, and many
issues have arisen on Korea's compliance with its international
obligations," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The USTR said the report will serve as a foundation for its
efforts to reduce and eliminate unfair trade practices worldwide
through negotiation of agreements and action to enforce
agreements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said she hoped
the report "will help all Americans interested in trade to work
together to develop a strategy that meets our country's needs in a
new century."

discussed how the situation degenerates in Montenegro (a Yugoslav
republic), Albania and Macedonia" because of the refugee exodus
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Apart from his discussion with the U.N. chief on the latest
situation in Kosovo, a Serbian province, the Canadian foreign
minister also met with the president of the Security Council for
the month of April, Alain Dejammet of France, as well as
ambassadors from several other countries.
</P>
<P>
Canada is a member of NATO, which is waging air strikes on
Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent member of the U.N. family.
</P>
<P>
The NATO military attacks are followed by an exodus of refugees
from Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent
of the province's population of 2 million, have been fighting with
Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the foreign minister said, "Canada has pushed for
active Security Council engagement in the Kosovo crisis... We will
continue to counsult with the U.N. on ways in which the Council
might take action on the dire humanitarian situation in the
region."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that he also met with the Brazilian
permanent representative to the United Nations, Celso Amorim, to
discuss the work of the two panels he chairs on weapons
inspections and humanitarian conditions in Iraq, as well as the
third panel dealing with Kuwaiti missing persons and property
resulting from the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
It was at Canada's suggestion that these panels were
established in late January in a bid to break a deadlock in the
Council over how to proceed on the Iraq issue.

<HEADLINE> War Murder Gets Life Sentence by British Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A 78-year-old man was sentenced to
life imprisonment on Thursday after Britain's first full war
crimes trial convicted him of killing Jews during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The Old Bailey jury in London found former railway employee
Anthony Sawoniuk guilty on two charges of murder. Sawoniuk came to
Britain in 1946 and lived in south London.
</P>
<P>
During the course of a one-year trial, the prosecution said
Sawoniuk, at the time a policeman, enthusiastically carried out
Nazi policies of genocide against Jews in his home town of
Domachevo in Nazi-occupied Belarus in 1942.
</P>
<P>
"Though you held a lowly rank in the hierarchy of those
involved in the liquidation of Jews in eastern Europe, to the Jews
of Domachevo it must have seemed otherwise," Judge Francis Potts
said in passing two life sentences.
</P>
<P>
The defence contended that Sawoniuk was forced to volunteer for
the Domachevo police force, organised by Nazi Germany, in order to
avoid deportation and forced labor.
</P>
<P>
Sawoniuk is half-blind and deaf and may serve his sentence in a
prison hospital.
</P>
<P>
Detective Superintendent Michael Griffiths, who headed the
investigation which involved a visit to Belarus by the jury and
witnesses travelling to London from Israel and Belarus, said the
conviction was a victory for past injustices.
</P>
<P>
"Today's verdict has shown all those involved in murder that
irrespective of the passage of time, justice will be done,"
Griffiths said.

<HEADLINE> UN Fears Funding Cut in Pakistan's Social Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. resident coordinator Robert
England Friday expressed fears for drastic cuts in Pakistan's
Social Action Plan (SAP) due to its economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference here, England asked Pakistan not
sit back with relief over the loan rescheduling by the Paris and
London Club.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is seriously concerned that the SAP may be
shortened under the present policy environment, which is already
only less than 2 percent of the Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. coordinator feared that SAP would be the victim of
reform program undermining long-term human development in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government should not slash its SAP's funds, he
said.
</P>
<P>
England expressed the apprehension that Pakistan's short-term
stabilization of the economy will squeeze long-term development
priorities, human development will be jeopardized, poverty will
increase and long-term development prospects will be seriously
undermined.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, needs to work on economic reforms but at the
same time it must address issues of poverty and human development.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan must come out of the debt trap, generate economic
growth and create investment and employment opportunities," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations believes that to address the
issues of poverty, the government must ensure people's access to
opportunities in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. coordinator called for a national poverty reduction
program in order to balance the reform program.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Pakistani government will put forward a
national strategy to address poverty.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the recent census showed that Pakistan is
entering demographic transition and population growth rate is now
2.6 percent coming down from 3 percent in the early 90s.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, that Pakistan's population is expected to
reach 250 to 300 million by the year 2025, putting pressure on
resources.
</P>
<P>
He described primary education as the best way to invest in
human development.
</P>
<P>
England believed that Pakistan economic reform plans under a
rescue package negotiated with the International Monetary Fund is
likely to raise the poverty levels and hinder social and human
development.
</P>
<P>
SAP seeks to provide basic education and health to the poor and
represents about 80 percent of all social development spending in
Pakistan's public sector.
</P>
<P>
England said he would urge Pakistan not to allow the spending
to slip, and hoped the Pakistani government would come out with a
national strategy to address poverty, because more than 30 percent
of Pakistan's 130 million people still live below the poverty
line.

<HEADLINE> Poppy Production in Pakistan Down Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Poppy production in Pakistan has
been brought down from 80,000 tons to 500 tons and will be
completely eliminated by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has taken effective and pragmatic steps to achieve the
goal of eliminating poppy cultivation and destruction of heroin
laboratories, said Tariq Aziz, secretary of the Interior Ministry
responsible for narcotics control.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media here on Friday, Aziz said reducing the
demand of illicit drugs through preventive education campaign to
save about 4.3 million drug addicts is the government's high
priority.
</P>
<P>
"We have almost eliminated poppy cultivation in Pakistan mainly
because of substantial assistance extended by the United Nations
Drug Control Program, the U.S. and Britain," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it is now a big headache to control drug
smuggling from Afghanistan although international agencies were
considering various proposals to eliminate poppy cultivation in
Afghanistan and its smuggling to other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said elimination of illicit crop involves alternative
development programs in order to direct the channel of cultivation
from illicit to licit crops.
</P>
<P>
The main emphasis should be on agro-based industries, food
crops and livestock accompanied by necessary infrastructure, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The government recently approved the Drug Abuse Control Master
Plan which is a strategy for control of narcotics over a period of
five years upto the year of 2003, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the plan include reducing the demand for
illicit drugs through a campaign by creating general awareness,
undertaking harm reduction treatment and rehabilitation programs
for addicts, and controlling the supply and production of
narcotics through total eradication of opium poppy crops by the
year of 2000.
