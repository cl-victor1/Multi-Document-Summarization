<HEADLINE> 3 British Tomb Robbers Sentenced in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Higher State
Security Court today sentenced three people, including a Briton to
15 years in prison for stealing and smuggling Egyptian antiquities
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Six others involved in the case received ten year imprisonment
terms. Two of them are Britons.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Tokeley-Parry, an art restorer from Devon, southeast
Britain, was convicted on charges of robbing Egyptian
archaeological sites and smuggling precious antiques disguised as
cheap artifacts out of Egypt as part of an international
trafficking network.
</P>
<P>
The Englishman, who is to serve the longest prison term among
the other Britons in the case, was also charged with tampering
with Egypt's archeological heritage in 1992 and 1993 at the
Saqqara necropolis near Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The stolen pieces included stones from the entrances of tombs
and a statue of the god Horus, who was half-man, half-falcon.
</P>
<P>
Tokeley-Parry had made off with the objects with the help of an
accomplice who traveled to Egypt six times between June 1992 and
December 1993, Egypt's MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court condemned three more to serve five years in prison
and acquited another three.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Hunter handed a 90-76
home defeat to Zhejiang Squirrels at the 19th round to keep its
top place at the Chinese basketball league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
August First Rocketes remained second following its 89-76 home
victory over Shandong Flaming Bulls 89-76.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang put up a brilliant game in the first half and
outscored the more fancied rival 41-38 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning quickened its pace in the second half. Li Xiaoyong
and Hu Qinglong, both on the Chinese national team, are heroes for
the visitors' comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
Led by veterans Adijiang and Liu Yudong, August First led over
Shandong 48-38 at the halftime.
</P>
<P>
With too many errors plus a poor percentage, Shandong saw
helplessly the host team run away on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning topped the standings with a record of 17 wins against
two losses. August First, also with a 17-2 record, had to finish
second because it had lost to Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Shandong placed third with 13 wins against six defeats.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Oriental, which lost to Lianhang Eagles 68-86 on
Sunday, was fourth with a 12-7 record.
</P>
<P>
Lianhang, trailing 33-44 at halftime, broke its rival's rhythm
with a desperately offensive game at the second half to complete
an upset victory.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other games, Beijing Duck beat Jinan Army Pegasus
81-77, Shenyang Army Lions downed Guangdong Tigers 86-56 and
Jiangsu Nangang routed Sichuan Panda 100-85.

<HEADLINE> Great Efforts Required to Solve Problems: Khalid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's caretaker Prime
Minister Meraj Khalid said today that great efforts were still
required to solve major problems facing the country despite
measures taken by his government to straighten the socio-economic
fabric.
</P>
<P>
Khalid said in his farewell address to the nation that the
nation has to "go a long way to surmount the multitude of varied
problems facing it through selfless and upright approach and
conduct."
</P>
<P>
It was a happy augury, he said, that both, the electorate and
the newly-elected public representatives, were fully conversant
with the actual problems and were determined to see rapid uplift
of the society.
</P>
<P>
Khalid said that common hind-sighted attitudes and indulgence
in petty interests as well as the prevalent evils of parochialism,
sectarianism and rampant corruption have of late eaten up the
vital elements of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Without cohesion and national integrity, political stability
could not be achieved, the caretaker Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Khalid gave a detailed account of the accomplishments made by
the caretaker set-up during its three-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
The recent general elections, he said, have made it amply clear
that the masses are wide awake of their requirements and
aspirations and the verdict given by them adequately demonstrates
it.
</P>
<P>
He said it was imperative upon the political leadership to
adhere to the necessary trait of self-accountability and see to it
that accountability remained a constant feature in the national
life, so that the plundered money is positively returned to the
national exchequer.
</P>
<P>
He believed that a new political culture is emerging "in which
the political leadership today finds itself intricately involved
and affiliated".
</P>
<P>
Khalid said, "It is a matter of satisfaction that we have
fulfilled the duty bestowed upon us to hold free, fair and
impartial election."
</P>
<P>
The observers from all over the world have termed the electoral
process transparent, impartial and peaceful, he added.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government, Khalid said, had presented a
comprehensive accountability ordinance and initiated collection of
evidence against the corrupt.
</P>
<P>
A gigantic task before the caretakers, he said, "was to counter
the economic collapse of the country and save it from being
declared a defaulter which could have led to serious consequences
for Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
There was no option left but to seek cooperation of
international financial institutions to avert the situation, he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders Indian Diplomats to Leave in Retaliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
ordered two Indian diplomats to leave the country as a retaliation
to expulsion of two American officials from New Dehli last month,
a State Department spokesman said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Glyn Davies said the two Indian consulates, stationed
in San Francisco and Chigago, were ordered the expulsion on Feb.
10 for "activities that were incompatible with their consular
status."
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Press Trust of India said one of the Americans
ordered to leave India reportedly had "unauthorized" links with a
man called Rattan Sehgal, identified as a director in charge of
the anti-espionage division of India's Intelligence Bureau. The
American was the station chief of the CIA in New Dehli.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Restructure Armed Forces: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek National Defense Minister
Akis Tsohatzopoulos has declared that the government had decided
to restructure the armed forces and implement a new defense
strategy to confront "the disputing of Greece's sovereign rights
by neighboring Turkey."
</P>
<P>
In a speech made Saturday night in Salonika and came off press
today, the Minister said that the strategy of deterrence
implemented to date would be supplemented with the concept of
"flexible response" which would, in the event of an aggressive act,
"have the highest possible cost for the other side".
</P>
<P>
"In order to attain these targets," he said, "we shall work
towards securing the necessary conditions, such as the
reorganization of the armed forces, the procurement of modern
defense quipment and modern training."
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos spoke of the creation of a special rapid
response force characterized by flexibility, mobility, heavy
firepower and readiness.
</P>
<P>
The element of flexibility, he added, would be achieved through
the cooperation of the three services of the armed forces, with a
particular role for special forces units.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Qualifies for Japanese Soft Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan has notified Egypt that
its successful economic reforms have made it qualified to ask for
Japanese easy-term loans, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that this was expressed today during a meeting between
Egyptian Minister of Economy and International Cooperation Nawal
al-Tatawi and a visiting delegation of the Japanese Overseas
Cooperation Fund.
</P>
<P>
Under a soft loan arrangement which is regarded as a
preferential treatment, the beneficiary is allowed to make the
loan payment with its local currency instead of hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Tatawi welcomed the Japanese announcement, saying that this
would increase Egypt's chances to diversify its sources of
financing to fund government and private investments.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that now the Egyptian private sector and
banks would finance the biggest part of the country's vast growing
investments in all fields, especially in the New Delta and in
Sinai.
</P>
<P>
However, Egypt would still be in need of more financing through
soft loans from donor countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The international assistance to Egypt amounts to 8 billion
U.S. dollars every year. The United States, Germany, France,
Japan, Britain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund are its major donors.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Launch Tourism Promotion Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece will launch a promotion
campaign next week to project the country's tourism product
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Budgeted at six billion drachmas (about 24 million U.S.
dollars), Greece's National Tourism Organization (EOT) will use
the mass media as the main tool to get its message across.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will start from two major markets of Germany and
UK. Approximately 600 million drachmas (2.4 million U.S. dollars)
will be spent on the German market, and will be channeled into
television -- including sponsorship of the weather report on SAT1
channel and magazines.
</P>
<P>
EOT's spending in Germany will be heavier than in any other
European country, an outcome attributed to Germany's high
advertising rates, which are the contnent's steepest.
</P>
<P>
About 470 million drachmas (1.88 million U.S. dollars) will be
injected into the UK market.
</P>
<P>
EOT will also place strong emphasis on the U.S. market, where
some 400 million drachmas (1.6 million U.S. dollars) are expected
to be spent. EOT's marketing strategy in the U.S. will focus on
high-income earners.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the aforementioned markets, EOT will also inject
significant amounts into France, Austria, Russia, Italy, Sweden,
Yugoslavia and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The promotion campaign will come in two waves, the first in
this month, the other in May at the beginning of the Summer
season, at a time when many prospective tourists make their travel
plans.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Confident of Victory in BSE Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The British Conservative
government said Sunday that it is confident of victory in Monday's
Labor-inspired censure vote on its handling of the BSE or mad cow
crisis, according to reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party has earlier called for a vote in the
lower House of Commons on Monday on whether to censure the
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg for his handling of the mad cow
disease crisis.
</P>
<P>
If the government was defeated in the vote, it could mean a
full vote of confidence in the government and an early general
election.
</P>
<P>
Welsh Secretary William Hague, speaking on BBC television,
called Labor's censure motion "a bit of a desperate tactic".
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Labor leader Tony Blair admitted that the government
is likely to "scrape through" the vote and that the Labor Party is
unlikely to be able to bring down the government and force an
early election.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Conservative Party now has 323 MPs, the same number
as the combined vote of the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that strenuous efforts are being made to ensure
the presence of every Tory MP for Monday's vote, with Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind cutting short a visit to Hong Kong in
order to attend.
</P>
<P>
A Labor spokesman said he believed that the nine Ulster
Unionist MPs would not vote against the government, saying that
they were likely to either abstain or back Hogg.
</P>
<P>
The minority Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said that
the government is likely to win Monday's BSE censure vote because
of Labor clumsiness.
</P>
<P>
He told Sky News that Labor's failure to consult other parties
was likely to mean victory for the government.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Foreign Minister on Ties with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said here today that Iran would not do anything
for rapprochement between Tehran and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Velayati was quoted by the Persian evening paper Resalat as
saying that the question of relations between Iran and the United
States is one of the most important political issues.
</P>
<P>
"The decision-making in this regard is not at the disposal of
an ordinary person or the Foreign Ministry, it is the decision
of Iran's Islamic system," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said that Iran's Supreme Leader
Ali Khamenei "has emphasized that we do not want to have any
kind of ties with the United States."
</P>
<P>
"The guideline is very clear and the Foreign Ministry would
not do anything outside the prescription," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that Velayati made the statement in a response
to media reports that Qatar is trying to mediate between Tehran
and Washington.
</P>
<P>
A senior Arab diplomat said in Doha that Qatar has undertaken
mediation efforts between the United States and Iran to smooth
relations between the two countries and reduce tension in the
Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa
al-Thani sent a letter to Iranian President Rafsanjani, urging an
easing of tension between Tehran and Washington.
</P>
<P>
A similar letter was delivered to U.S. President Bill Clinton
by Qatar's ambassador to Washington through the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the mediation efforts, Velayati said that "the
reason for the confrontation between Iran and the United States
is that the U.S. wants to interfere in Iran's internal affairs
just as before the victory of the Islamic revolution in the
country."
</P>
<P>
The United States pursues a dual-containment policy toward
Iran and Iraq. It has imposed sanction on Iran and even
threatened to launch military strike against Iranian targets.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Voices Satisfaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today expressed satisfaction with the situation
in Hebron after Israeli troop pullback last month.
</P>
<P>
During a tour of the Hebron area that remains under Israeli
control, Mordechai met with Palestinian residents and Jewish
settlers. He said basically there was no violation of the Hebron
agreement by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
"The situation now is quiet, both sides give respect to each
other and they hope the situation in Hebron will continue like
as now," Mordechai told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But the minister had a sharp exchange with settler leaders in
a short but stormy meeting. The settlers lodged a complain about
the discrimination against them, which was rejected by
Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
The minister ruled out of any deviation from the signed
Hebron agreement, saying Israel would proceed with the plans of
reopening the Shuhada street and the vegetable market in the city
center.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Jewish settlers from the Avraham Avinu
settlement and Palestinian residents exchanged abuses and threw
vegetables at each other in a dispute over the reopening of the
vegetable market. Israel allowed the reopening of the market in
accordance with the Hebron agreement signed last month.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured and no damage caused in the clash as
Israeli police and troops quickly separated and dispersed the
crowd before the confrontation turned violent.
</P>
<P>
The settlers claimed that the reopening of the vegetable
market, closed since the 1994 massacre in which a Jewish
extremist killed 29 Palestinian worshipers in a nearby Mosque,
could expose them to more Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
The settlers also complained that the civil administration in
Hebron had not permitted them to build new houses in the Jewish
settlements while Palestinian residents were allowed to do
so.
</P>
<P>
Noam Arnon, the spokesman for Hebron settlers, condemned the
discrimination against them. "The discrimination against Jews
living in Hebron is going on. As we understand, in the
Palestinian side, projects are initialed and built, but in the
Jewish quarter, even no one house is now permitted," he said
angrily.
</P>
<P>
He said that the settlers would consider new steps to wedge a
campaign against the government. "We have to consider our steps
from now on. We are going to open a campaign around this
problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> Economic Institute Warns of Recession in Eastern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Eastern German economy might slip
into recession in 1997 if Bonn fails to provide sufficient
financial support to the eastern states, the German Institute for
Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin warned today.
</P>
<P>
Bonn government had spent billions of marks mainly to stimulate
the building sector in eastern Germany. At the moment most of the
money is running out, "but the baton change to the other
industries do not work," said DIW president Lutz Hoffmann in an
interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Bonn annually provided the eastern part of
the country with about 92 billion U.S. dollars in support funds
over recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic upturn in the east lost impetus in 1996
in the wake of the slowdown in the building sector. Many east
German firms had difficulties competing on markets both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to Hoffmann's estimates, the public investments in
eastern Germany must be at least increased by 20 billion marks
(about 12 billion U.S. dollars) in next year.
</P>
<P>
"The East needs at least as much as money as so far in the next
few years. The government support cannot be cut in any case,"
Hoffmann said, adding that such a support is needed for at least
ten years in eastern Germany.

<HEADLINE> Iran Extends Deadline on Turning in Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's prosecutor general has
once again extended the deadline on turning in weapons for those
who missed an earlier deadline on October 13, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Qadiriyan, an official from the Prosecutor General
Office, said today that those who were not able to hand in their
weapons by the last deadline have to turn in their weapons before
August 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
By last year's deadline, Iranian security authorities were
able to collect only one-third of the total estimated one million
illegal unregistered weapons in the country.
</P>
<P>
After the deadline of last year, the authorities warned that
those who have refused to turn in their weapons were identified by
the police and would face imprisonment and death depending on
the circumstance under which their weapons would be confiscated.

As to the new deadline this year, Qadiriyan said, it is for
those who can "provide reasonable alibi for not turning their
weapons during the amnesty period which started from February
10, 1996."
</P>

The Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988 brought about the
proliferation of arms in Iran. Arms are smuggled in and out of
Iran through Iran's border with Iraqi Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
Light weapons produced by Iran's defense industries is said
to be smuggled out of the country because of corruption and
poor management in government bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
Some sources here said that arms smuggling has always gone
hand in hand with narcotic trade. Iran's drug dealers are said
to have the state-of-the-art weaponry and have on occasion
overwhelmed Iranian anti-narcotic squads with their superior
firepower.

<HEADLINE> UK Steps up Effort to Tackle Child Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government steps up
its efforts to combat juvenile crime as the Home Secretary Michael
Howard will next week unveil proposals to place children aged
below 10 and their parents under curfews, local newspapers report
today.
</P>
<P>
Under Howard's proposals, to be published in a consultative
document next week, magistrates will be given new powers to impose
Parental Control Orders on parents of children aged under 10 in an
attempt to stop young delinquents sliding into a life of serious
crime.
</P>
<P>
Parents who refused to take responsibility for their children
could be ordered to remain at home under curfew, fined up to 1,000
pounds (1,620 US dollars), instructed to pay for the criminal
damage caused by their children or to do community work.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans, children likely to be subject to a Parental
Control Order will be identified by police, social workers,
teachers, health services and volunteers, who would investigate
the background of the child.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office believes that the proposals are necessary as
much criminal evidence suggest that children who offend in their
early years are most liable to become persistent offenders in
their teens.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that an estimated seven million crimes which
cost one billion pounds (1.62 billion US dollars) are committed
each year by youngsters under 18 in Britain.

KUWAIT CITY, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Minister of
Petroleum Gholam Reza Aqazadeh will pay a two-day visit to Kuwait
on February 23 to discuss cooperation in the oil field.
</P>
<P>
The visit, at the invitation of Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issa

It said "Iran is ready to put its oil technical services,
engineering and experience under Kuwait's disposal."

He said the UAE upholds justice and peaceful means in resolving
conflicts, adding that Britain's stance in this respect is
absolutely identical to that of the UAE.

</P>
<P>

Ragheb has said that the kingdom is heading for intensive economic
activities with a wider opening of new markets for its products,
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The intensive economic activities are facilitated by growing
Arab and foreign investments in Jordan's agriculture, industry and
tourism, the minister said here Saturday in response to a series
of foreign media reports on the kingdom's economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister dismissed as untrue earlier press reports that

<HEADLINE> British Central Banker Doubts 1999 Launch of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Adding up to the widespread
scepticism over the single European currency, President of the
Bank of England Eddie George told a German magazine on Sunday that
he doubts the punctual start-up of the Euro by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Eddie told the German Capital economic magazine that he got the
impression that some countries had taken their participation in
the single currency Euro as a matter of prestige and few EU member
states can rush to meet the convergence criteria without second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
"There is then the risk that the Euro would become a weak
currency rather than a strong one," he said.
</P>
<P>
George also noted that he did not see any big economic
disadvantage if Britain did not adopt the Euro from its start.
</P>
<P>
The EU is targeting to launch the Euro by January 1, 1999. But
scepticism is growing over whether the deadline can be met as few
members have been able to fulfill the criteria of the European
Monetary Union set by the Maastricht Treaty due to their sluggish
economy.
</P>
<P>
One of the criteria is that the budget deficit and national
debt of a member country must not exceed 3 and 60 percent
respectively of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Germany, though upset by a post-war record jobless rate of 12.2
percent in January, seems to be the most optimistic among the EU
members.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest survey by the German public opinion
research institute Allensbach, which had questioned 600 leaders
from the German political and business circles, 71 percent of the
respondents believe that the single currency will be launched on
time. Only 27 percent said no.

<HEADLINE> Union Leader Predicts German Joblessness over 5 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Alarmed by the post-war record
joblessness of nearly 4.66 million for January, a senior German
trade union official today warned that the jobless figures could
exceed five million if government continued to cut spending.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Zwickel, head of the metalworkers' union IG Metall, told
the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that it would be a "lunacy" on the
part of the German government if it continued to cut spending and
reduce public sector demand.
</P>
<P>
Germany joblessness surged to 4,658,300 in January, or a rate
of 12.2 percent, the highest since 1933.
</P>
<P>
The German government had promised to cut unemployment by half
by the year 2000. Asked by the Bild newspaper on Wednesday if that
goal is still possible, Kohl said the government would hold on to
the goal. But he also admitted that it "is ambitious and would be
very difficult to reach".
</P>
<P>
Kohl stressed that job creation should take priority over all
other issues and called on both the trade unions and management to
make common efforts.
</P>
<P>
The German Federal Labour Office in Nuremberg, meanwhile, said
it did not expect another dramatic jump in unemployment. But a
spokesman of the Office on Saturday also said that "a lot depends
on the weather."

ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller is scheduled to leave tomorrow for Brussels to urge
NATO allies to help Turkey gain a full European Union (EU)
membership.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, also the foreign minister, is expected to meet with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Tuesday on the sideline
of the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
Brussels, local tv stations reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
It is believed Ciller would emphasize at the meeting that NATO
enlargement should be linked to the expansion of the EU and its
designated defense arm, the Western European Union.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to veto NATO expansion unless the EU
admits it into the regional alliance.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said although it is all but impossible for
Ciller to get a clear-cut promise of securing Turkey's EU
admittance at the Brussels meeting, the issue will surely attract
anybody's attention.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said earlier this month that her government will make
every effort for a full EU membership in 1997 as Turkey is eager
to be part of the rapidly growing Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission is considering the membership
applications by up to 10 possible candidates, but Turkey is kept
outside the body due to some controversial issues. Turkey made a
full membership application to the EU in April 1987.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish labor union leader
today vehemently slammed the coalition government's privatization
program, warning that this could only increase the country's
unemployment, Turkish state-run TV reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a mass rally in the northwestern town of
Luleburgaz, Bayram Meral, chairman of the Confederation of
Turkish Labor Unions, said that the coaltion government led by
Welfare Party (RP) leader Necmettin Erbakan failed to carry out
its early promises to protect state resources and to create jobs
for the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The rally, called "No to the privatization of power plants",
was organized by the Luleburgaz Democracy Platform.
</P>
<P>
Meral criticized the coalition government for ignoring the
interests of the civil servants and workers. He said the
government was trying to plunder the country's assets.
</P>
<P>
Turkey made great strides in its privatization drive early
this year by selling the shares in the three banks of Etibank,
Anadolubank and Denizbank, with a total price of 342.5 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that in the past layoffs took place whenever a
state company was privatized, Meral told the government that
"state companies are our property, and we are telling you that
you cannot sell it."
</P>
<P>
Turkey kicked off its privatization process in 1984.

social activities aimed at bridging the gap between the two
peoples and build mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
This was in sharp contract to the tense atmosphere before the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the warning issued by Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat against Israel's
building of settlements, Levy said that if the Palestinian side
insisted on raising the settlement issue in the talks, they
would bear responsibility for ruining the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
As a result of today's talks, the two negotiating teams will
break into nine groups from Monday to deal with separate
issues.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the peace talks on further implementing the
interim agreement was agreed at the summit meeting between
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron pact, the two sides will hold talks on
settling issues stipulated in the interim accord, including the
opening of safe passages between West Bank and Gaza Strip, a
Gaza airport and Gaza sea port, and development of economic and
security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to continue for months or even longer
because of the difficulties of the issues and differences
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Fogel, Director of Israel's Government Press Office, who
serves as the spokesman for the talks, said that the two sides
would face "increasing difficulties" in future talks.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that anything can be concluded easily. But I
think they can be concluded because what we want to do is we
want to honor the agreements signed by the previous government,"
he told the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman stressed that both sides should be
committed to refraining from resorting to violence in the
future, and resolving disputes only through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that both sides will understand that negotiations at
the peace table is the only option for working out the
disputes," Fogel added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Takes Measures to Save Carpet Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
took a major step to save the traditional carpet industry by
allowing dealers to retain the hard currency they earn and
travelers to take 12 square meters of rug out of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that the decision was
made at a meeting presided over by Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from the new Iranian month of Esfand starting
Wednesday, the rug exporters can keep 100 percent of the hard
currency they earn and use them to import permissible items, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that those who plan to travel abroad can take
12 square meters of rug with them now instead of three square
meters rug in the past.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iranian Parliament endorsed a bill to allow
carpet export dealers to retain 100 percent of the hard currency
they earn in a bid to save the carpet industry.
</P>
<P>
Formerly, carpet export dealers had to turn in the hard currency
they earn from the export and receive equivalent rials in export
rate -- 3,000 rials for one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But, one dollar is against 4,600 rials in the black market
now.
</P>
<P>
Iran's carpet industry had suffered a lot from the policy set
by the central bank as exporters had no interest in the business
since they could not make profit.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the export volume of carpet dropped half from one
billion dollars to about 500 million dollars last year. Many
Iranian carpets could not find market.

The order for the cranes came from the American branch of the

The cranes will be delivered to the quays belonging to the COSCG

PARIS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright arrived at Paris this afternoon from
Germany, on her first official visit to France since she was sworn
in last month.
</P>
<P>
Albright will discuss with French President Jacques Chirac,
Prime Minister Alain Juppe, and Foreign Minister Herve de Charette
a series of international issues, priorly NATO expansion,
NATO-Russia relations and Europeanization of NATO's South Command.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, said French Foreign Ministry, French
officials will again raise the issue of Europeanization of the
NATO's Naples-based South Command, which Washington has rejected.
</P>
<P>
France is expecting to solve some disputes within the NATO over
how to negotiate a charter with Russia over NATO's eastward
expansion, before a NATO summit is held in Madrid in July, said
officials.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process, the crisis in the Great Lakes
region in central Africa, and the situation in former Yugoslavia
are also expected to be prominent topics between U.S. and French
officials.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Accuses Israel of Violating Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Agriculture
Ministry has released a report listing violations by Israel of
signed Palestinian-Israeli agreement on fishing, the JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that according to the agreement, the area
allowed for fishing is 20 sea miles along the length of the
Gaza governorates coast.
</P>
<P>
However, since the beginning of 1996, the Israeli authorities
have confined the fishing area to only 12 sea miles, preventing
fishermen from operating beyond that point and even firing at
fishermen whenever they got near the 12-mile "border."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli navy boats randomly fired gunshots at Palestinian
boats even when they were not violating any regulations, said
the report. Many incidents took place in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that Palestinian fishing nets were
often ruined in points off the coast of Jewish settlements in
the southern part of the Gaza Strip. Fishermen were prevented
from laying their nets in that area despite the fact that this
area is allowed to fish in accordance with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities have also unilaterally decided to
restrict fishing near the border between the Gaza Strip and
Egypt.

enjoying a year-on-year increase of 10.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's international tourism earnings reached 10.2
billion US dollars in 1996, which also reached a new peak and
increased by 16.81 percent, China National Tourism Administration
has announced.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the majority of the tourists visiting the
Chinese mainland last year were from Hong Kong and Macao, with
their numbers coming to 42.49 million, up 9.38 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Tourists from foreign countries numbered 6.74 million, a growth
of 14.57 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parliament Urges Government to Borrow Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian parliament, worried
about the country's foreign debt of more than 8 billion U.S.
dollars, has called on the government to borrow less foreign money.
</P>
<P>
Saying in a resolution that the government has borrowed too
much, parliament deputies urged the Cabinet of Ministers to submit
a draft legislation to limit borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's foreign debt is currently some 10 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Vadim Hetman, former chairman of Ukraine's central bank, called
on his fellow deputies to set a ceiling on the foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament must get tougher on the government so that it does
not get carried away with foreign aid that must be repaid," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Agrarian faction member Serhy Dovhan criticized the practice of
using foreign loans to buy imported machinery instead of
subsidizing domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ukraine borrowed 187 million dollars from the
U.S. Export-Import Bank to buy 1,049 harvesters from John Deere
Tractors, a U.S. company.
</P>
<P>
Dovhan said the deal has made tens of thousands of workers at
local harvester-making plants jobless. And the country's huge
collective farms have great difficulties in adapting the
U.S. harvesters to local conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The budget for the 1998 Winter
Olympic Games will top 100 billion yen (800 million U.S. dollars)
but it may be offset by the yen's depreciation which will boost
television rights and sponsorship deals, Nagano Olympics
organisers said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The operational cost of the Games will slightly exceed 100
billion yen," said Makoto Kobayashi, director general of the
Nagano Olympic Organising Committee (NAOC).
</P>
<P>
"Real revenue will increase due to the weaker yen," Kobayashi
added.
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi said the NAOC hoped to upgrade a computer data system
to prevent a repeat of foul-ups at the Atlanta Summer Olympics
last year and install audiovisual equipment at venues and put in
extra seating for spectators.
</P>
<P>
NAOC vice chairman Goro Yoshimura told a news conference the
committee would not install floodlights expected to cost some 800
million yen (6.4 million U.S. dollars).

GUANGZHOU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province will work this year to resolve the food and clothing
problem of the remaining 600,000 people there who live in poverty,

<HEADLINE> US Reports on "Religious Suppression" in China Refuted (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Normal religious activities of religious organizations,
religious sites and their legitimate rights and interests are
protected by the law in China, and no one should violate these
rights, it said.
</P>
<P>
It went on to note that the Chinese criminal code stipulates in
article 147 that government functionaries who illegally deprive
citizens of their reasonable freedom of religious belief or
violate customs of ethnic groups, shall face imprisonment less
than two years or criminal detention, if the case is serious.
</P>
<P>
But the columnist, having no knowledge of these facts, has
accused China of "harsh crackdowns" and "has been intentionally
attempting to confuse black and white," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times' "concern" over China's Catholics inevitably
reminds people of the history of that religion, which dates back
more than 400 years in the country, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the Chinese Catholics as well as Chinese clergymen were under the
control of churches of dozens of western countries, and had no say
in their own affairs, the article said, adding that, for example,
in the 143 parishes in China at that time, only 20 bishops were
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
After New China was founded, the Chinese Catholics started
to operate their churches independently. According to the Chinese
Catholic Church, over 60,000 people were baptized annually since
then, and the number of Catholic followers has now reached four
million.
</P>
<P>
Over 4,000 churches and public sites of worship have been
re-opened. In addition, more than 20 theological seminaries have
been set up, in which over 1,200 students are receiving higher
religious education.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, over 600 young people have become godparents, and
more than one million Bibles and other books have been printed,
the article revealed.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Washington Times columnist, however, seemed to take a
special interest in the group of Chinese Protestants, the
article noted.
</P>
<P>
As known to all, it said, China in 1949 had only 700,000-plus
Protestants, but the Washington Times columnist alleged that the
figure has surged to at least 75 million.
</P>
<P>
"Aside from the questionable credibility of this number, it is
still far from convincing for the US columnist to use the figure
as evidence for the existence of religious persecution in China,"
the article argued.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the will of the public, the Chinese
government has always protected the rights of both the Chinese
citizens and foreigners in China to practice normal religious
activities through proper application of laws and regulations, the
article noted.
</P>
<P>
In January of 1994, the Chinese government issued "Regulations
on the Management of Foreigners' Religious Activities in China"
and "Regulations on the Management of the Places of Religious
Activities."
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time since its founding in 1949 that the
People's Republic of China had ever issued special laws on
religions, which was a significant step in the country's legal
development concerning religious affairs," the article commented.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that both regulations have been designed to
give full protection to the freedom of religious beliefs, and to
firmly safeguard social and public benefits at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Any religious activities, either by the Chinese citizens or by
foreigners in China, must follow Chinese laws and regulations, and
do no harm to the social and public good in China, it added.
</P>
<P>
While these regulations are just fundamental laws that will be
adopted in any country with a legal system, it continued,
columnists of the New York Times and the Washington Times have
insisted on labeling them as "religious suppression."
</P>
<P>
"This gives us every reason to believe that they are trying to
challenge the social and public benefits not only in China, but in
all countries with a legal system as well," the article said.

<P>
It said these US columnists hoped that the Chinese government
would adopt a laissez-faire attitude toward illegal activities
under the guise of religion, which not only would infringe on the
social and public benefits, but also surely harm the normal
religious activities.
</P>
<P>
"What on earth are the motives of these columnists of the New
York Times and the Washington Times? " the article asked, saying
it is quite possible that they are trying to suppress other
countries' religious freedom in the name of anti-religious
suppression.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times columnist expounded at length on the
so-called unofficial organizations forced to turn underground. In
fact, there is only one Catholic Church in China, which includes
both the Chinese Catholic Bishops College and the China Patriotic
Catholic Association. They share the same beliefs with Catholic
Churches in other parts of the world, and are part of world
Catholicism, the article explained.
</P>
<P>
It also said there is no need to be reticent of the fact that
in inland China, there really exist a few people who, with the
support and under the command of some overseas forces, refuse to
obey the government's laws and regulations, and persist in various
illegal activities in disguise of Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
No government in the world will ever tolerate or be blind to
illegal behavior, the article pointed out, and freedom bestowed to
any evil cult is the gravest violation of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
"It is unthinkable even for a country like the U.S., which
always flaunts the banner of `absolute freedom', to grant such
freedom to evil cults like the Aum Shinri Kyo, which take pleasure
in killing," it added.
</P>
<P>
It went on to persuade the New York Times and the Washington
Times, which it described as "mass media members with some
influence in the U.S.", to stop misleading the public by
publishing articles based on specious rumors.
</P>
<P>
"We also suggest columnists of the two newspapers write
something that can withstand close scrutiny with verifiable facts,
and that they be responsible to the readers, instead of talking
nonsense, pushing the US government to challenge the social
and public good in a country on the other side of the ocean even
on the expense of the public interests of the U.S. itself," the
article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Hiroshima Asks U.S. to Suspend Subcritical Nuke Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka
of Japan asked today the U.S. government to suspend a subcritical
or nonexplosive nuclear test scheduled for this spring.
</P>
<P>
The request, said a Kyodo News report, was contained in a
letter addressed to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Hiraoka cited an opinion handed down last July by the
International Court of Justice that the threat or use of nuclear
weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese mayor also reportedly mentioned, in his letter,
the United Nations General Assembly's adoption last September of
the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. test "will heighten international mistrust,
increase the danger of nuclear proliferation, and dampen the
efforts of the international community to abolish nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
On August 6, 1945, a U.S. atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima,
destroying 90 percent of the city and ultimately killing at least
200,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Bans Illegal Use of RMB Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Central Bank stressed
today that it is illegal to print and sell enlarged or miniature
versions of Renminbi (RMB) paper currency.
</P>
<P>
A leading official with the People's Bank of China pointed out
that RMB is the legal tender of China, and without bank
permission, no individual or unit is allowed to use the design of
RMB.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hopes people will become more aware of the law
and not buy the counterfeit bills. Meanwhile, he said people who
have information about the whereabouts of such shops that are
printing the bills have the responsibility to notify the police.
</P>
<P>
The color of some of the enlarged RMB bills found in a number
of areas is very similar to the originals, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bank's Shenzhen branch and the local police
closed four illegal counterfeiting workshops in the booming south
China city, and confiscated a large amount of printed material.
</P>
<P>
After that, the People's Bank of China issued a notice asking
all the branches to cooperate with the local police, and for
industrial and commercial administration departments to crack down
on counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 10 provinces and municipalities in the
country had retrieved over 100,000 phony bills by the end of last
August.

economic interests in the world, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba
said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a program held by Nepal Council of World Affairs
here today, Deuba said that Nepal will have to build new bridges
and lay out new avenues to the outside world on the foundations of
shared economic interests.

<P>
The government has adopted a policy to enhance economic
diplomacy aimed at expanding the country's exports, attracting
direct foreign investment and promoting tourism through
strengthening bilateral and regional cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Nepal is a country locked between India and China,
the prime minister said the country must strive to turn its
geographical disadvantage into economic advantage of readily
available markets for its products and services.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need of further cooperation in the
seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) to tackle regional problems and to maximize common
benefits of South Asian countries.
</P>

The SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

a closer and mutually complementary interaction between the
government and the private sector to achieve the country's
economic objectives, Deuba said.

According to him, an Economic Relations and Coordination
Division has also been set up under the Foreign Ministry to pursue

<HEADLINE> Top French, U.S. Diplomats to Attend NATO Informal Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette and his U.S. counterpart, Madeleine Albright, will attend
an informal meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) in Brussels on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said the
two top diplomats will attend a "special meeting" of the Atlantic
Council at the Belgian capital after de Charette meets the
visiting U.S. secretary of state later today in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"This extraordinary and informal meeting will allow one to make
the point of the on-going debate within the NATO on the reform and
enlargement of the alliance, as well as its relations with Russia
and Ukraine," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said French officials will go to Brussels "with a strong
hope that a good agreement with Russia be reached before the
(NATO) Madrid summit scheduled for July."
</P>
<P>
During a brief visit to Russia on February 2, French President
Jacques Chirac said an agreement between NATO and Russia was
likely to be reached before the Madrid summit.
</P>
<P>
How to negotiate such an agreement with Russia has become a new
dispute between the United States and France, after Washington
rejected a French proposal to hold a summit by the United States,
Russia, France, Britain and Germany to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Moscow must be treated on an equal stand with NATO members when it
is invited to negotiate a charter on NATO-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
He also said any military agreement between NATO and Russia
should have a "stringent character" to "appease the fears" of
Russia over NATO's eastward expansion.

NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda today renewed his offer of an early resumption of Indo-Pak
dialogue at appropriate level.
</P>
<P>
In a greeting message to Nawaz Sharif on his assumption of
office of prime minister of Pakistan, Gowda said, "We are willing
to have wide-ranging comprehensive talks on all issues of mutual
concern."
</P>
<P>
"I have noted the positive statements made by your excellency
to improve relations between our two countries. I reciprocate your
sentiments in full measure. We believe there are a number of
opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation. We approach
these opportunities in a positive and constructive spirit, for it
is our firm conviction that cooperation between us will lead to
genuine benefit for both our peoples," Gowda said in the message.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official dialogue between the two countries
since January 1994 when the foreign secretary level talks ended
abruptly.

Last year Gowda offered a wide-ranging dialogue with Pakistan.
During his election campaign early this year and after his
impressive victory, Nawaz Sharif made positive statements seeking
"serious dialogue" with India. "This is a very good time to have
serious talks with India. We should live like good neighbors
instead of blaming each other for our problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister welcomed the positive signals from
Sharif and offered full cooperation for resumption of the dialogue
between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese
official said here today that nothing could affect the general
situation of Hong Kong, which will surely realize smooth
transition in an auspicious and prosperous atmosphere in 100-odd
days.
</P>
<P>
Hosting a spring reception this evening attended by 3,000-odd
people, Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch, said: "After going through ebb and flow over the past 12
years of transition, Hong Kong is heading for a final point of
glory."
</P>
<P>
"In four months' time, Hong Kong will put an end to the
centurial colonial rule, return to the motherland and enter a new
era of history," Zhou said. "For all Chinese around the world, the
long-awaited moment will come soon."
</P>
<P>
The domestic and international situation is becoming more and
more favorable to the smooth transition of Hong Kong, said the
Chinese official who also pointed to the surging love of China and
of Hong Kong and the increasing confidence of local and
international investors.
</P>
<P>
Zhou noted: "Man-made obstacles are being eliminated one by
one, and some pessimistic views about Hong Kong's future are
evaporating. Now we are fully confident to say that no matter what
disturbances may occur before handover, they can not affect the
overall situation."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the encouraging situation in Hong Kong to the
full implementation of Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one
country, two systems", to the central government's policies and
principles concerning Hong Kong and to the rapid progress made in
China's reform and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Finally, he praised the efforts made by Hong Kong compatriots
in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and in
preparing the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, he called on Hong Kong people in all sectors to
render great support to the first Chief Executive and the
Provisional Legislative Council of the HKSAR, so as to ensure Hong
Kong's sustained prosperity and stability.

surveys show, the majority of the Hong Kong people have full
confidence in Hong Kong's return to China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung spoke highly of the great political wisdom embodied in the
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong". He call on Hong Kong people to take a more

drug abuse last year, 147 more than in 1995, the first annual
increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
According to Eduard Lintner, the Bonn commissioner for
narcotics affairs, since 1991 when the use of
synthetically-produced drugs such as Ecstasy dramatically
increased, the number of deaths from drug abuse had been declining.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of first-time users of Ecstasy had grown by
half and police seizures of the narcotic jumped by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of first-time users of so-called hard drugs such as
heroin and LSD had increased by 13 percent, Lintner said.

LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Eight England soccer fans were
charged with public order offences on Monday following crowd
trouble during Leicester's FA Cup match with Chelsea on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in a corner of the ground after Chelsea's
opening goal n the 16th minute of the fifth round match which
ended in a 2-2 draw.
</P>
<P>
It took 50 stewards and police 10 minutes to restore order and
separate rival supporters who were trading punches.
</P>
<P>
Football Association spokesman Steve Double said: "We will
await the reports of the match official and the police before
deciding what course of action should be taken."

Meanwhile, Derbyshire police claim advance intelligence
prevented serious trouble at Saturday's FA Cup match between
Chesterfield and Premiership side Nottingham Forest.

<HEADLINE> US Reports on "Religious Suppression" in China Refuted (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency published
an article today, refuting criticism made by some US media against
China's religious policy and its so-called large-scale
"suppression of religious activities."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times and the Washington Times published a series
of reports recently attacking China's policy of freedom of
religion by alleging that the government has launched a massive
campaign to suppress religious activities.
</P>
<P>
They also complained that the US government's attitude toward
China was "not firm enough" on the question of human rights policy
because of its "commercial interests," according to the article
entitled "Some US Columnists are Challenging the Public Interests."
</P>
<P>
Their accusations against China's "harsh crackdowns" upon
religion were based solely on billboards carrying messages that
oppose illegal religious activities, which had been posted "in a
certain town of a certain county of a certain province," the
article said.
</P>
<P>
And the newspapers determined with full certainty that China
has initiated a "new wave of religious suppression" across the
country, in order to shore up its current drive to promote ethical
and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
These allegations are groundless, the article maintained.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times stated that "last spring, thousands of
paramilitary police supported by armored car units and
helicopters" destroyed a Catholic church in Hebei Province. This
sensational description made people believe a war broke out there,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the New York Times columnist imagined the church was a
fortress, and that armored cars and helicopters were needed to
destroy it, the article said, commenting that "Isn't this rumor a
bit too strange and fantastic?"

<HEADLINE> Seasonal Factors Lead to Higher Inflation Rate in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Inflation continued to rise in
Germany last month, with consumer prices going up by 1.8 percent
over a year earlier, compared with the 1.4 percent increase in
December, the Federal Statistics Office reported today.
</P>
<P>
In month-on-month terms, the cost of living index for private
households rose by 0.5 percent from December in western Germany
and by 0.7 percent in the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts stressed that the increase was mainly due to seasonal
and weather-influenced factors and would not shake Germany's
relatively high price stability.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the prices of seasonal food grew by 7 to 14
percent and those of heating oil by 28 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Reports on "Religious Suppression" in China Refuted (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article included another example of a Washington Times
report on China's destruction of illegally-built graves in East
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Some newly affluent farmers in Zhejiang Province built the
graves randomly without plan, destroying all the green trees on
hill slopes. The local people were very angry about this. With
the guide and help of the local authorities, the graves were
removed and rearranged in areas designated by the government, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
But the Washington Times described the situation by saying "in
Zhejiang Province alone, 15,000 religious sites were destroyed in
the first six months of 1996."
</P>
<P>
The article wonders whether graves in the United States are
considered "religious sites."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times columnist was engaged in deliberate
misrepresentation by "calling a stag a horse," the article
comments.
</P>
<P>
The columnist alleged that "the harsh treatment of Catholics in
China dates to the 1950's," and the authorities "see religion as a
vehicle for political organization, dissent or outright opposition
to the Party's role."
</P>
<P>
However, facts tell another story, the article pointed out,
saying that the People's Republic of China declared at the time of
its foundation that New China protects religious freedom, which is
guaranteed ever since its first Constitution.
</P>
<P>
China is a country with many varieties of religions, and has
around 100 million religious followers. Respect for and protection
of religious freedom have been China's fundamental policy toward
religious issues, and are safeguarded by the law, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In the Constitution, the general rules of the civil law, and
laws on autonomous regions, military service, compulsory
education, election of deputies to people's congresses, and
organization of village committees, the provision has been
included to protect religious freedom, the article adds.

<HEADLINE> Army, Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang "As Close As Family" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army
(PLA) forces stationed in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region and local ethnic groups are so close they feel
like family, and are working hard together for the region's
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The PLA forces in Xinjiang have always regarded ethnic
solidarity as a key issue in promoting social stability and
development and maintaining unity, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
They have strict discipline that requires the soldiers to
behave themselves properly in accordance with the customs of local
ethnic groups, and teaches the soldiers that all ethnic groups,
large or small, depend on each other in order to grow.
</P>
<P>
The troops have assisted local economic development with a lot
of manpower and machinery, and helped complete 27 major local
construction projects, including the railway artery through
southern Xinjiang and the fiber-optic communications cable linking
Urumqi to Lanzhou, capital of neighboring Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Aid-the-poor groups formed by the soldiers have helped some
130,000 farmers and herdsmen across the region, most of whom have
shaken off poverty, while over 100,000 soldiers have been sent to
help prevent natural disasters or join in rescue and relief work.
</P>
<P>
Party committees and governments at all levels, and people of
various ethnic groups in Xinjiang have shown deep affection toward
the army. Senior officials of the regional government regularly
visited sentry posts on the border at major festivals, while
families of soldiers usually receive preferential treatment in
housing, employment and other fields.
</P>
<P>
There are also more than 15,000 special service centers and
over 10,000 volunteers' groups formed by local militiamen across
Xinjiang that take care of the soldiers' families free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the past few years nearly 1,000 units
and individuals in Xinjiang have been honored for their efforts to
promote ethnic solidarity, more than 80 of whom have even been
praised by the central government and the General Political
Department of the PLA.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A survey showed that Hong
Kong children were eating too much junk food, local press reports
revealed today.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 2,760 students' eating habits by the Chai Wan
Caritas Children and Youth Center found crisps, sweets,
chocolates, chips, chicken and other deep-fried food, ice-cream
and ice-lollies topped the list of favorite foods.
</P>
<P>
More than half the respondents spent up to five HK dollars
(0.64 US dollars) a day on junk food, and another 26 percent spent
between six to ten HK dollars (0.77 to 1.28 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Most of the snacks were bought from their school tuck shops,
the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Over 12 percent said they did not eat breakfast, and close to
30 percent were unsatisfied with their weight.
</P>
<P>
Head of the center, William Ng Man-sui, said concern over an
increasing number of young children with obesity problems had
prompted him to research the eating habits of upper-grade students
at all seven primary schools in Chai Wan, a district in the east
of Hong Kong island.
</P>
<P>
He urged schools to educate students about nutrition and a
balanced diet.

DHAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A three-day national flower
exhibition organized by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) was
opened today on the premises of Dhaka International Trade fair.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 nurseries and flower shops have set up 32 stalls
in the exhibition where varieties of roses and different colorful
seasonal flowers are on display.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that such an exhibition is taking place
in Bangladesh with a view to encouraging growth of flowers as well
as their exports.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the exhibition, Commerce and Industries Minister
Tofail Ahmed said flowers had now been included as one of the
exportable items for Bangladesh, which is badly short of foreign
exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
He said trial export of flowers has already been made to some
countries and for the first time from this year flower would be
exported on a commercial basis.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Ahmed Choudhury, vice chairman of the EPB, said there
was a good prospect for better quality flowers in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Some joint venture projects in this field had already been
started and foreign experts were assisting them now, he added.

TOKYO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A 27-year-old rightist was
arrested today after ramming a van into the official residence of
Kochi Governor Daijiro Hashimoto in Kochi, western Japan, news
reports said.

The car driven by Yuji Morimoto, a member of the local rightist

Hashimoto, the younger brother of Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, told reporters he was asleep and did not hear anything
when the incident occurred, the reports said.

<P>
BONN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and her German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, said
today they hold identical views on NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after their meeting here Monday
morning, Albright and Kinkel also said they had agreed on the
inclusion of Russia in a new security system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they both expressed reservations about a French
proposal for a meeting by France, Germany, Britain, the United
States and Russia to discuss Russia's role in NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
France proposed that leaders of the five nations meet before a
scheduled summit of the 16 NATO members in July in Madrid, Spain,
on restructuring the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The July meeting also aims to consider NATO's post-Cold War
relations with Russia, which has been against NATO expansion, and
the alliance's first recruitment of new members.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Washington counts the "substance," rather than
the procedure of reaching an agreement with Russia on the planned
NATO eastward expansion into the former East bloc.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel stressed that for the moment, Western countries must try
all possibilities to secure Russia's content on NATO enlargement.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: Efforts Continue to Free Prisoners from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN February 17 (Xinhua) - At least two Gulf Arab countries
are continuing efforts with the Kuwaiti government to secure the
release of the dozens of Jordanians jailed in the emirate, but no
definite outcome of the efforts has emerged yet, Jordan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper, citing diplomatic source here Sunday, said Oman and
Qatar are currently make the efforts in response to a specific
Jordanian request following a recent report that Kuwaiti security
forces had stormed a prison and beat up Jordanian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Omani and Qatari ambassadors visited the prison and then
told the Jordanian government that the prisoners were treated
well, and the reported violence was in connection with the
toughening of the prison administration following incidents of
drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanians are held separately from those serving sentences on
drug smuggling charges.
</P>
<P>
Since the visit, an intense effort has been launched to
convince the Kuwaiti government to release all the Jordanian
prisoners held on political charges of collaborating with the Iraqis
during the occupation of Kuwait, which ended by the Gulf War in
1991..
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, other countries friendly to
Jordan also joined the efforts to free the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent, said Saturday after
a meeting of the Council of Ministers that Arab mediation was
continuing.
</P>
<P>
Around 60 Jordanians are serving sentences in Kuwait after the
state security court found them guilty of "collaborating with
Iraqis."

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Eliminate Leprosy in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Health
Department is targeting to eliminate leprosy as a public health
problem by the end of 1998 as the number of leprosy cases
continues to decrease in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the country launched a campaign against the skin disease
in 1994, the country's leprosy incidence decreased to 1.4 per
10,000 people by the end of 1996 from 1.7 in 1995 and 2.5 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, about 2,668 new leprosy cases were detected in the
country with a population of nearly 70 million, a sharp decrease
from the 1991 level of 7,169 cases.
</P>
<P>
With this development, Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica said
attaining the elimination of leprosy in the country by the end of
1998 is no longer impossible.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department's leprosy elimination effort is further
boosted by the availability of an effective drug combination known
as multi-drug therapy introduced by the World Health Organization
in 1981. After a week receiving the therapy, leprosy patients
become non-infectious.
</P>
<P>
Currently, leprosy is endemic in about 35 of the 73 provinces
and municipalities in the country, with Sulu province in the
southern Philippines having the highest incidence of 16.2 per
10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
With leprosy treatment no longer requiring confinement at the
leprosarium or sanitarium, the Health Department is considering
converting the current eight leprosaria into general hospitals.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov has reiterated Moscow's right to defend its
interests in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO)
eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview aired Monday night, Primakov made the
standing Russian position clear again while noting that his
country doesn't have a veto power against the NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The remarks, made to Russia's Independent Television, was
broadcast in the same program as those of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who will be here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said NATO should sign an agreement to eliminate
Russia's concerns about its expansion by prohibiting the
alliance's military facilities to come near Russia's boders.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the senior Russian official said, should also
include provisions calling for NATO's transformation from a
military organization into a political one.
</P>
<P>
In her TV interview, Albright stressed that NATO's expansion is
not directed towards Russia, but is aimed at creating a new
mechanism for the security of Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Russia will have a say, not a veto, in NATO's
expansion, Albright said Russia should sign a charter to establish
a consultative mechanism with the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The top U.S. diplomat expressed her hope that Russia and her
country would maintain mutual confidence and continue to step up
cooperation after the NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. state secretary is scheduled to arrive here on
Thursday on her first official foreign tour and hold talks with
Primakov on NATO's planned eastward expansion.

ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Pakistani
Army official said here today that the army hopes the new
government will take effective measures for political and economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Pakistan's Army Staff Gen. Jehangir Karamat said that
while the masses had high hopes of the elected representatives,
"we are also equally hopeful that stability will come and national
matters will be deliberated upon and solved."
</P>
<P>
Karamat made the remarks to the media after Nawaz Sharif's
oath-taking ceremony as Pakistan's new prime minister held at the
Presidential House.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Kashmir issue, Karamat said that during the
previous era, "there were high expectations of a peaceful
settlement of the Kashmir issue. Now, again, there are high
expectations."
</P>
<P>
Kashmir, he said, was a basic problem "and cannot be thrown on
the back burner."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Karamat said that inflation was required
to be controlled first, as the element of inflation lessened the
size of the budget.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the newly-formed Council for Defense and National
Security (CDNS), the Army chief said it was up to the government
and the parliament to decide about it.
</P>
<P>
"It's a useful forum for discussion and not for decisions", he
said.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- British chemical fire experts
have flown in to fight the fire aboard the Hongkong-registered
cargo ship MV Oyster Bay in Mombasa port, the East African
Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The vessel loaded with hydrogen peroxide, among other
chemicals, was still ablaze on Sunday although Kenya Ports
Authority tried hard to control the fire.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to extinguish the fire with sea water have proved
futile as the burning chemicals are reactivated by it, according
to port sources.
</P>
<P>
The British experts were brought in on Sunday by the vessel's
insurers as experts on the scene refrained from opening hatch
number four where the fire started, saying that they could only
do so when the Lloyds team arrived.
</P>
<P>
Some of the cargo was destined for Dar es Salaam but was being
offloaded to pave the way for experts to reach hatch number four.
</P>
<P>
Marine engineers and surveyors said that if the British
experts failed to establish the cause of the fire, they would
take the vessel to dry dock.

It will also buy new aircraft to meet the demand at home and
abroad and challenges from other airlines.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Nawaz Sharif, who sat on the
opposition bench for three years, today came back to the office of
Pakistan's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League
(N), was sworn in today as the country's 8th prime minister since
1988, at an oath-taking ceremony administered by President Farooq
Leghari.
</P>
<P>
A law graduate from Pakistan's oldest seat of learning, the
Punjab University, Sharif is a wealthy industrialist. His family
owns Ittefaq Industrial conglomerate, one of Pakistan's largest
with interest in metal, sugar and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was inducted into politics in 1981 at the age of 30 when
he was appointed finance minister of Pakistan's most populous
province of Punjab.
</P>
<P>
Three years later, he became the youngest chief minister of
Punjab province where he developed a well-deserved reputation for
being an able, hands-on administrator.
</P>
<P>
He was re-elected to this position in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 elections which followed the dismissal of Benazir's
first government by the then president, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Sharif
led a group of nine parties under the banner of the Islamic
Democratic Alliance to victory.
</P>
<P>
With a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, Sharif
launched a bold economic program involving lavish spending on
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's stint as prime minister, which lasted only 30 months,
was marked by an accent on opening up the economy, energizing the
entrepreneurial skills of the people and working as a bridge
builder among the provinces of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It was during this period that Sharif showed that he was a doer
who delivers.
</P>
<P>
When his elected government was dismissed arbitrarily by Ghulam
Ishaq Khan on April 18, 1993, Sharif's defiance earned him popular
support across the length and breadth of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
As prime minister of a coalition government, which included
Pakistan's largest religious party, he pursued economic policies
with a free-market orientation and gave a nod toward extending the
influence of Islam.
</P>
<P>
However, the Jammat-e-Islami left the coalition after Sharif
supported the United States in the Persian Gulf War and backed a
UN plan to install an interim government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Since the dismissal of the Benazir government last November,
the PML chief has emerged as the likeliest alternative to his
political rival, whose popularity fell amid economic troubles and
persistent allegation of corruption by her husband, Asif Ali
Zardari.
</P>
<P>
In the February 3 general elections, Sharif's PML(N) won a
landslide victory by collecting 135 seats in the 217-member
National Assembly while the Pakistan People's Party led by Benazir
managed only 17 seats.
</P>
<P>
Sharif promised that if he comes to power, the first priority
will be to revamp Pakistan's staggering economy.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to carry on the accountability process, abolish
rampant corruption and improve law and order situation in the
country.

securities companies will be scrapped by December 1, 1998, while
foreign banks and securities houses will be allowed to establish

to open subsidiaries from December 1, 1997 and investment trust
companies from December 1, 1998, according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Pupils, Soldiers Most Exposed To HIV In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- School pupils and
members of the armed forces appear to be particularly exposed to
infection by the Human Immuno Virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
The finding was presented in a paper submitted to a doctors
conference held here recently.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that school going pupils and people in camps or
doing similar group activity were among the most exposed groups
to HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
The city of Dar es Salaam was still leading in the number of
HIV infections and in AIDS victims, followed by Mbeya, Kagera and
Arusha regions.
</P>
<P>
About 2.2 percent of patients in Dar es Salaam hospitals were
diagnosed to be AIDS affected during 1994, climbing to about
eight percent during 1995. The figure had shot up to about 15
percent for last year, the conference paper revealed.
</P>
<P>
The statistical observation showed that one out of seven
people was HIV positive in the region.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Tanzania People's Defense Forces (TPDF) had to
a large extent, been victims of the spread of the disease, the
paper mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that many people are becoming HIV victims
by getting married to infected persons without realizing it. Many
young men and women have fallen victims to AIDS in this manner.
</P>
<P>
Certain interviewed persons suggested that the use of
equipment by different people at the same time like shaving kits
in salons may also contribute to the spread of the disease, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed shavers said that they usually shave up to 10
people with the same machine. The machine habitually inflicts
wounds on the customers, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
One shaver at the Paradise Hair-cutting Salon was quoted as
saying, "Customers usually get hurt and have wounds after making
a horizontal line behind their hair to make it look straight, so
a person can get affected."
</P>
<P>
The same effect was possible on persons who shave their beards
in salons, for the same blade is routinely applied to up to five
people, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets New Oil Production Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has altered its oil
production target from the original 2.5 million barrels per day
by 1999 to three million barrels per day by the year 2000, the
"Business Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new target was recently confirmed to oil industry players
by Bashir Dalhafu, managing director of the state-owned Nigerian

member of the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
A large proportion of Nigeria's oil production comes from
NNPC's joint ventures with foreign oil firms, including Shell,

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Researchers Introduce Nitrogen Fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan researchers have
introduced a nitrogen fixing crop from Central America, and
successfully turned it over to field use, ''the New Vision''
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Frederick Alifugami, the chairperson of Ikulwe Farmers
Association under the patronage of Kawanda Agricultural
Institute, said that crotalaria ochroleuca enables soil regain
the fertility lost years ago. The upright crop with its small
root does not compete with its intercropped crops for nutrients,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The drought-tolerate crop is widely used in Central America as
a nitrogen fixer and is intercropped with maize, beans, second
season cassava or rotate with other crops.
</P>
<P>
In Ikulwe, farmers intercropped it with maize and beans.
</P>
<P>
The tropical leguminous plant with its trifoliate leaves and
yellow flowers is usually left when farmers get their harvest and
let it continue to collect more nitrogen until the next season.

<HEADLINE> Juppe: Civil Disobedience Against Immigration "Grave Act" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe today hit out at the appeal for civil disobedience against a
new immigration law.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local television RTL, Juppe said the
appeal, by some French intellectuals who are protesting the new
immigration law that requires application of certificates for
providing shelter to foreigners by French homes, "is a grave act
and it undermines the state of right and democracy."
</P>
<P>
"How can we explain to foreigners that they should respect the
laws if those important figures say that they should not respect
the law? This is an act of social disintegration at a moment when
we need social integration," Juppe said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the comparison by some French intellectuals of the
new immigration control measures with the expulsion of Jews during
the Nazi occupation and Vichy collaboration period from 1940 to
1944 "mixed up" all things.
</P>
<P>
"In France, we are a real democracy," he said, adding that the
law was voted by the deputies in the National Assembly and the
Senate under the supervision of the Constitutional Council.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the appeal for civil disobedience is a "bad
blow to our policy of integration" of foreign immigrants.
</P>
<P>
He said that registration with government for providing shelter
to foreigners, which was required as early as 1982, will let one
distinguish regular immigration and visits in France, from illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said that a lot of people in France cannot differentiate
between regular immigration and illegal immigration, which he said
would indirectly help racist and xenophobic propaganda of the
National Front.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Considers to Ban Pump-Action Shotguns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's National Security
Council has decided to discuss the issue of gun license for
pump-action shotguns because the shotguns are used mainly for
hunting people, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that from 1991 to 1995, 35 people were
murdered by the pump-action shotguns, which are considered to be
hunting rifles under Turkish law and do not require the owner to
obtain a gun license.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that 2,157 of the 40,000 pump-action
shotguns manufactured in Konya since 1994 were sold in that
province and the recent escalation of arms sales in Konya, a
stronghold of the Islamist Welfare Party (RP), has sparked
widespread concern in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Duzce town of Turkey has produced 24,000 hunting
rifles, mostly pump-action shotguns, and exported most of them
to earn a large income.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the office of Turkey's General Staff had
sent a letter to the Interior Ministry to ask for a ban on the
selling of these weapons in domestic markets and to revise the
regulations in favor of directing domestic suppliers towards
external markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Nawaz Sharif was sworn in
today as Pakistan's 13th elected prime minister since its
independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
A brief but impressive oath-taking ceremony took place at the
sprawling majestic Jinnah Hall on the fifth floor of the
Presidential House.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Leghari administered the oath.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, which lasted for about 25 minutes, started with
recitation from the Holy Quran following the playing of the
national anthem by a brass band.
</P>
<P>
As the ceremony began, Sharif, 46, donning "Jinnah cap", and a
national uniform -- white shalwar and dark sherwani, stood
shoulder to shoulder at attention with President Farooq Leghari on
a red carpeted platform to the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
President Leghari was the first to congratulate Sharif, who
looked confident and satisfied, with a warm handshake instantly
after the oath-taking.
</P>
<P>
The well-lighted and brilliantly-decorated great hall was
crowded with around 700 people, including the three chiefs of the
armed forces, the newly-elected speaker of the National Assembly,
outgoing caretaker prime minister and his cabinet members, foreign
diplomatic envoys as well as people from media group.

his government was restored by the Supreme Court which held Ishaq
Khan's action unconstitutional and illegal.

<HEADLINE> Syria Accuses Israel of Intending to Delay Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam has accused Israel of intending to delay peace
talks between the two countries by trying to resume the
negotiations from "square zero," local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam made the remarks in an interview published today by
local Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, he said Syria had held talks with former
Israeli cabinets of Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin before Binyamin
Netanyahu was elected Israeli prime minister last May.
</P>
<P>
"When the Israeli government proposes going back to square
zero, this means that we have to negotiate for a century,
because each time a new government is elected in Israel we go
back to square zero," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Syria and Israel broke off last March
following a series of suicide bombings inside Israel. Syria says
that the Labor government, which lost to Netanyahu's Likud party
in elections last May, agreed to withdraw from the Golan
heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
"We negotiate for four years in Washington and the American
sponsor exerted enormous efforts...followed with an agreement on
some issues, most notably the withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 line
and adoption of security arrangements," Khaddam was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is not logically or legally justified for the Israeli
government to request going to square zero in the negotiations,"
Khaddam said.
</P>
<P>
On whether Syria has received any gesture or invitation from
Washington to resume the talks with the Israelis in light of
Netanyahu's recent talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Khaddam said "so far, we have not received anything."
</P>
<P>
On Netanyahu's statement that Syria supports the resistance
against Israel in southern Lebanon, Khaddam said "Netanyahu wants
to distract the international opinion."
</P>
<P>
Khaddam recently toured the Gulf and some other Arab countries
and conveyed a letter from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to the
Gulf leaders. The content of the letter was not released, but was
believed to have expressed Syria's stand on resuming peace talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that all the Gulf Cooperation Council states
supported Syria to resume the talks from where it stopped nearly
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara said Saturday in
Cairo that Israel was running away from peace and that Syria was
willing to resume peace talks as long as they start from where the
previous round left off.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government is the one running away from peace and
not the Syrian leadership. Syria is ready to resume negotiations
tomorrow if Israel abides by what was reached during the
previous stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Netanyahu said Friday "we will take note of
what took place in the talks between Syrian negotiators and the
previous (Israel) government."
</P>
<P>
But he added that "we cannot be bound by conversations or by
ideas or by speculations and suggestions and hypotheses. We can
only honor signed agreements."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Israeli Assertion over "Absentee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 17 (Xinhua) - The Jordanian government Sunday
dismissed an Israeli assertion that the Jordanian-Israeli peace
treaty allows the Jewish state to continue to apply its "absentee
property law" to properties owned by Jordanians in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The comment by Jordanian Minister of Information Marwan Muasher
came in response to a statement made by the Israeli Embassy here
that Jordanians' lands and houses in Israel will continue to be
treated as absentee-owned properties under the 1950 Israeli
absentee property law, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Jordan was determined to press for
the return of Jordanian-owned properties in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Individual properties belonging to Jordanians prior to 1948 and
currently under custody of the Israeli "absentee-property guard" will
neither be modified or even discussed in the final phase of the
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to the Israeli stand, the 1994 peace treaty
between Jordan and Israel does not affect the status of lands and
other individual properties and tacitly provides for the
maintaining of the status-quo.
</P>
<P>
However, Muasher said "there is a clause in the peace
treaty forbidding any discrimination (between Jordanian and
Israeli citizens) and Israel's maintaining of the current status
of absentee properties is a violation of this clause and, of the
peace treaty."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the government's commitment to ensure a just
settlement of the issue, Muasher said that while he served as
Jordan's first ambassador to Israel in 1995, the government
approached the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs with an
official letter, calling for Israel's relinquishment of the
properties under custody of the absentee-property guard to their
original owners.
</P>
<P>
An absentee property committee was established in Israel in
1995. However, up to now, a complete list of all Jordanians'
properties in Israel and the occupied territories has not yet been
finalized by the committee.

<HEADLINE> Palace Remains Discovered in 3,000-year-old Beijing Ruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
found the remains of palaces in some 3,000-year-old city ruins in
a southwestern suburb of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The ruins belong to the capital of the early Yan State of the
Western Zhou Dynasty (11th Century BC-771 BC). They were put in
the spotlight last year because they showed that the city of
Beijing went back 3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
It is also the only capital ever found that dates back to early
or middle Western Zhou Dynasty, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
Palaces of the Yan kings were located in the northern part of
the ruins, where beaten earth, palace wall remnants, and
large-sized drainage pipes have been found. Archaeologists say
that the city was surrounded by a 10-m-wide moat, and was square
or rectangular, with the excavated northern part of the wall being
829 meters long.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists found bronzeware with a shape and designs
similar to those found previously in imperial sites of the Western
Zhou Dynasty, and pottery similar to those found from imperial
sites of the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th Century BC), suggesting
exchanges of this northern Chinese state with the central part of
the country.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account Deficit Surpasses 23 billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit skyrocketed to a record 23.7 billion U.S. dollars last
year, a whopping 165-percent increase from 8.95 billion dollars in
1995, the Bank of Korea said here today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the record current account
shortfall to a sharp decline in the growth rate of exports and a
hike in both the import of consumption goods and the invisible
trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Comparable current account shortfall figures were 4.53 billion
dollars in 1994 and 4.53 billion dollars in 1992. South Korea
marked a current account surplus of 384.6 million dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit in 1996 accounted for some 4.7
percent of the nation's gross national product (GNP), a bank
official said.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of the current account shortfall to GNP stood at 2.0
percent in 1995 and 1.2 percent in 1994, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
GNP refers to the total value of goods and services produced in
a nation over a particular period of time -- usually one year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade deficit amounted to 15.28 billion dollars
last year, compared with shortfalls of 4.75 billion dollars in
1995 and 3.15 billion dollars in 1994 as well as a surplus of 1.86
billion dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew 4.1 percent from 1995 to 128.25 billion dollars on
a free-on-board basis in 1996. The export growth rate was 31.5
percent in 1995 and 15.7 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Imports expanded 12.2 percent from 1995 to 143.53 billion
dollars in 1996. The growth rate of imports stood at 32.1 percent
in 1995 and 22.4 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's invisible trade shortfall jumped from
3.64 billion dollars in 1995 to 7.68 billion dollars in 1996. Of
the total, travel deficit accounted for about 34 percent, or 2.6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign exchange reserves increased from 32.71
billion dollars at the end of 1995 to 33.24 billion dollars as of
the end of 1996 on an outstanding basis, according to the bank.

<HEADLINE> 14 More Cattle Die From Anthrax in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The worst anthrax outbreak in
the southeastern Australia state of Victoria was expected to
spread further this week with the onset of more hot and dry
weather, the state government said today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 119 cattle have died, up from Sunday's 105, while 59
properties are under quarantine, and 25,000 cattle have been
vaccinated to try to contain the disease, which broke out in the
Tatura-Stanhope area on January 26.
</P>
<P>
Principal veterinary officer of the Department of Natural
Resources and Environment Terry Thomas said that specialists were
investigating whether flies biting infected stock were spreading
the disease.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "I don't think we have got a satisfactory
explanation yet for such a big outbreak on so many properties,
other possibilities were movement of machinery, humans and stock,
the weather and water."
</P>
<P>
Victorian Deputy Premier Pat McNamara said in the state
cabinet, "It looks like we are going to have those hot and dry
conditions for the rest of the week, so I think we could probably
anticipate that we are going to have some further incidence of
stock dying".
</P>
<P>
Anthrax causes rapid death in cattle, sheep and goats when they
eat contaminated soil or feed, but health officials have stressed
the outbreak poses no threat to public health or safety.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Asks Negotiations With India on Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's prime
minister-elect Nawaz Sharif today reiterated his offer to the
neighboring India for "a peaceful negotiated settlement" of the
Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan firmly believed in good-neighborly relations and it
was the time for India to come to the negotiating table and
resolve "the pending core issue," Sharif said after securing a
vote of confidence in the 217-member National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said that India must accept that the unresolved Kashmir
issue is the major hindrance in the way of normalization of
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It's the time to try to do it," Sharif said, hoping that India
would reciprocate in the same manner.
</P>
<P>
Normalization of relations between Pakistan and India was also
in the best interest of peace and tranquillity in South Asia, said
Sharif, who is to be sworn in later in the day as the new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
On the Pakistan-US relations, Sharif said, these have
consolidated over the past and efforts would continue to further
improve these bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said, Pakistan's relations with the Muslim world have always
remained cordial and substantive, and would improve and strengthen
further in the time ahead.

<HEADLINE> China Fighting Local Protectionism in Law-enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China's central government
will launch a national campaign to halt local protectionism and
departmentalism in law enforcement, in the second quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Local protectionism and departmentalism in law-enforcement have
become widespread and serious and have evoked strong responses from
many parts of society, according to an article in "Outlook"
Magazine published here today.
</P>
<P>
The article said that a small number of Party and government
officials support or work with departments and individuals to
protect local and departmental interests by devious means, it said.
</P>
<P>
Some law-enforcement organs compete with each other to handle
lawsuits to protect the interests of the party involved in their
own region. Some lawyers and notaries in some regions have
violated professional ethics, engaging in unfair legal practices.
</P>
<P>
Driven by local interest, some financial and administrative
departments kept the judiciary from enforcing the law in a fair
way. Some departments and personnel have used ingenious methods to
meddle with or even resist law-enforcement personnel in the
performance of their duties, the article added.
</P>
<P>
The Protectionism in law-enforcement is harmful to the
socialist market-oriented economy, China's four modernization
drive, and to the socialist legal system, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that protectionism in law-enforcement must be
thoroughly eradicated, the article said party committees and
governments at all levels should take the lead in safeguarding the
dignity of the law and judicial departments should treat
protectionism in law-enforcement as a major problem in the fight
against corruption.

<HEADLINE> CPC, Government Decision on Health Reform And Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council calls for
still better work to be done in the country's health care reforms
and development.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision by the CPC Central Committee and the
State Council released here today, China will improve its health
care system by the year 2000 to meet its goal of "Health Care for
Everyone" and to improve general public health.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the decision says, this system is expected to raise
China to the level of the developed countries or the advanced
levels in developing countries in public health.
</P>
<P>
The system includes health care services, medical insurance,
and enforcing public health laws. The health policy will focus on
rural areas and preventative medicine, Western and traditional
Chinese medicine, science and technology, getting all of society
involved in health work, and improving people's health to serve
the socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The health policy of the new period will focus on rural areas
and preventative work, pay more attention to both Western and
traditional Chinese medicine, rely on scientific and technological
progress, aroused the involvement from whole society in the health
work, and help improve the people's health and to serve the
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Health work is a public activity involving government policy
and should be coordinated with the national economy and social
development. It urges government at all levels to increase input
in the field of public health and to get society to raise funds to
improve work in the field, the decision notes.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, overall expenditures on health work
are expected to account for five percent of total GDP.
</P>
<P>
The cardinal principles for future health reforms and
development are as follows:
</P>
<P>
Adhering to the the general purpose of serving the people,
handling properly the relationship between social benefits and
cost, and making social benefit top priority;
</P>
<P>
Making efforts mainly to improve people's health and set
essential health requirements;
</P>
<P>
Making rational disposition of medical resources, improving
quality and efficiency of service, focusing on rural areas and
preventative medicine and traditional Chinese medicine to
gradually narrow the gap between different regions.
</P>
<P>
Setting up more state-owned and collectively-run medical
services and or getting supplementary privately-run services;
</P>
<P>
Strengthen international cooperation and exchanges, learning
from technological advances and managerial experience abroad;
</P>
<P>
Improving the moral and professional conduct of medical
personnel and perfecting their professionalism.
</P>
<P>
The whole Party and all of society are asked to pay greater
attention to health care and to protect and improve public
health. An important goal of socialist modernization is improving
the nation's general health conditions and to let everyone enjoy
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
In the 47 years following the birth of the new China and
especially in the past 18 years since the launching of the
country's reform and opening-up, major achievements have been made
in the field of medicine, with the average life span rising
dramatically from 35 to 70. The infant mortality rate has also
dropped significantly to 31.4 from as many as 200 per thousand in
1949.
</P>
<P>
Health work in China, however, still leaves much to be desired,
it says, and Party committees and government at all levels should
improve leadership in the field and increase reforms.
</P>
<P>
The next 15 years will be a crucial period in China's socialist
modernization drive, and public health provides a challenge, it
concludes.

<P>
The objective of health care reform is precisely to increase
the vitality of the cause of public health and give full scope to
medical institutions and individual health workers, and keep
improving both the quality and efficiency of health service.
</P>
<P>
To comply with the socialist market economy and follow what
guides the development of public health, a new mechanism full of
vitality should be established. Employee medical insurance
combined with social welfare should provide a basic medical
guarantee for all urban workers.
</P>
<P>
Medical costs will be shared by the State, the employer, and
the employee, in reasonable proportions, according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
A mechanism that provides for both constraints on doctors and
on patients should be built to halt the fast growth of medical
expenses.
</P>
<P>
The institutions and medical personnel are urged to take part
in medical reforms and to make an effort to cut waste of medical
resources, and government departments should do a better job in
making up for deficiencies in medical care.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 all cities and towns will basically have a
medical insurance system, and other kinds of supplementary medical
insurance should be encouraged, it said.
</P>
<P>
While the present unban medical service system should be
reformed, institutions at the grass-roots level should provide
basic medical services such as family planning and health
education, and health services for women, infants, the disabled,
and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, major hospitals in urban areas will mainly deal with
emergencies and serious medical problems and play an important
role in scientific and technological research and training medical
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Controls will be tightened on private medical businesses and
other medical services. Reforms should include public health
institutions and a system of hospital director responsibility to
expand their power.

Party committees and government should pay greater attention to
elementary health care in rural areas, where 900 million of
China's people live, and the cooperative health care system should
be further improved to include individual payments, public funds,
and governmental financial help, to ensure basic services for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Health care networks in rural areas should improve their

</P>
<P>
Health-care teams at the grass-roots level should be
consolidated and kept improving and by the turn of the century, 80
percent of rural doctors should have special training.
</P>
<P>
A pair-support system should be set up, where cities provide
medical support to corresponding townships and
villages. Intermediate-level urban doctors are asked to work in
county or township medical institutions for half a year or a full
year before being appointed to senior academic posts.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should attach great importance to the
health work in poor rural areas or outlying regions inhabitated by
minority ethnic groups to help cure epidemic or infectious
diseases and fight the consequent poverty. The relatively
developed areas are encouraged to provide aid and support in this
regard.

Central and local governments will gradually increase input on
health care as the nation's economy grows year by year, and the
range of spending increases will not be less than financial
expenses. The central government also encourages the setting aside

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan plans to have an
exchange program for navy officers and other personnel with
Malaysia to promote relations between the two navies, Japanese
Maritime Self-Defense Force Chief of Staff Admiral Kazuya
Natsukawa said today.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian army and air force had already sent their
officers for such programs, so now "it is the navy's turn."
</P>
<P>
The present relationship between the navies of the two
countries was confined to personal contacts between senior
officers, he told reporters after his talks with Royal Malaysian
Navy (RMN) Chief Ahmad Ramli Mohamed Nor here.
</P>
<P>
Japanese navy ships and officers have visited Malaysia in the
past few years to promote better ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current bilateral relations as good, he said
both countries share similar views on regional security and feel
the need for better relations and confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
On joint naval exercise with the RMN, he said it was difficult
for Japan to take part in due to constitutional constraint.
Japan's post-war constitution renounces war and the use of force,
but allows the country to maintain ground, air and maritime
self-defense forces.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese navy chief, who arrived here Sunday for a four-day
visit with a five-member delegation, also called on Malaysian
Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar here.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Defense Chief Dismisses Coup Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Renato de Villa today allayed fears that a military coup plotted
by President Fidel Ramos' backers is in the offing in the light of
their current moves to extend Ramos' term.
</P>
<P>
The defense chief was reacting to a statement made Sunday by
Senator Raul Roco that Ramos and his backers will use force if all
other means to extend his term, such as amending the constitution,
would be unavailing.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, De Villa said a military coup similar to those
launched by rightist soldiers during the Aquino regime will not
happen anymore.
</P>
<P>
"In so far as military coups are concerned or plots coming from
the direction of the Armed Forces, I think that is history," De
Villa said. "I believe it will not be repeated in our time
anymore."
</P>
<P>
Roco, who has already made known his intention to run for the
presidency in the 1998 presidential elections, made the accusation
following an admission from Executive Secretary Ruben Torres that
the ruling Lakas-NUCD leadership is in favor of a charter change
to extend the term of Ramos.
</P>
<P>
On February 8, Ramos himself said he wants a charter change to
clarify the separation of powers between the three branches of
government and to clip the power of the Supreme Court following
its decision to void the bid of a Malaysian firm for the purchase
of Manila Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Roco observed that once the Supreme Court, Congress and the
executive branch are caught in a gridlock on the issue of charter
change, force will be promoted as the only option to keep the
country moving.
</P>
<P>
Several days after Ramos openly expressed his desire to change
the constitution, the president went further by vetoing a
provision of the 1997 national budget which bans any budget fund
for a national plebiscite to amend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Although Ramos repeatedly said he has no intention of extending
his term by changing the charter, his recent moves have been
strongly criticized by the opposition and those perspective
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
They said that Ramos' ruling Lakas-NUCD party will push for the
extension of his term if the door is open to amending the current
constitution which provides for a single six-year term for the
president.
</P>
<P>
Against such a background, Torres, a close aide to Ramos and a
senior official of the Lakas party, admitted Saturday that his
party really favored an extension of Ramos' term because "six
years are too short for a good president."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Disappointed with Turkish-Iraqi Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has found it still
tough to benefit itself from trade with Iraq although the
oil-for-food agreement has been put into effect, local
newspaper Daily News said today.
</P>
<P>
Following the implementation of the agreement, which was
reached on May 20, 1996 between the U.N. and Iraq, nearly 400
Turkish firms proposed trade deals with the Iraqi side, but only
10 of them have reached agreements so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the terms of the oil-for-food agreement, all
contracts must be submitted to the U.N. Sanctions Committee for
approval, and so far only five deals worth 25 million U.S. dollars
have been approved.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an Iraqi official as saying that the
situation was caused by the high prices proposed by Turkish
firms, saying this made many Turkish companies uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official said that port services offered by the
Turkish side were also expensive.
</P>
<P>
However, some Turkish traders denied this claim, adding that
Iraq was using other transportation means because of Turkey's
policy on northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been the base for U.S.-led Operation Provide
Comfort (OPC) aimed at providing air protection for the Iraqi
Kurds living in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has claimed that this mission was an
infringement on Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food agreement ratified by the United Nations
allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six
months to buy food and medicine badly needed by the Iraqis, who
have suffered from the U.N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad since
its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
It was anticipated that at least half of the exported Iraqi
oil would be transported through Turkey via the
Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline, making it possible for Turkey to earn
transit fees up to 50 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, Turkey was estimated to have
suffered a loss of 27 billion dollars from the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq.

LUSAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Police detained a Zambian
newspaper editor here on Sunday on the charge of publishing false
and alarming information.
</P>
<P>
Police raided the home of Chronicle newspaper editor Lweendo
Hamusankwa and picked him up for questioning over a story
published in the newspaper about a state house police officer
driving a stolen car and another on a break-in at an army armory,
Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted his lawyer Nelly Mutti as saying
that there is no criminal libel in the story.

Last week, Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Simon Mwila
ordered Defense Minister Ben Mwila to investigate the truth
behind the story that some guns had been stolen from the army
armory in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Post newspaper special projects editor Masautso
Phiri was jailed for three months for contempt of court after
admitting that he lied when he alleged that some judge were
offered 14 billion Kwacha (about 10 million U.S. Dollars) to rule
in favor of President Frederick Chiluba in an election petition.

<HEADLINE> Israel Develops New Close-Range Radar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Aircraft
Industries (IAI) has devised a new radar for the detection of
close-range ground and air threats, The Jerusalem Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The new radar, called EL/M-2129, is a ground-based system for
security and paramilitary applications.
</P>
<P>
The radar, which was designed to detect and monitor movements
in specific areas, can automatically spot moving targets such as
vehicles, flying helicopters and even people at ranges of up to
10 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The radar could be a tool in the fight against the Lebanese
guerrilla group Hezbollah in south Lebanon, defense officials
said. The radar can also detect packages weighing as little as 20
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will install the radar on its
bases. Elta, IAI's subsidiary, won the IDF radar tender in the
competition that included several international firms, such as
Thomson SA in Paris, the U.S. firm IAL and a British
company.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Playing Bigger Role In Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region had 82.8 million US dollars in investment from
overseas last year, a record for the region.
</P>
<P>
The sum accounted for a quarter of the region's total
investment in capital construction last year, said Yao Chengsheng,
an official from the regional foreign trade department.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia approved 39 foreign-funded projects, with a contractual
value of 104 million US dollars last year. The amount of foreign
funds actually used in construction each year has risen from 14
percent to 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have shown growing interest in agriculture,
water conservation, communications, chemicals, and
machinery. Regional economic and trade departments sent
delegations to trade fairs in France, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and Oman and received business people from Japan, the Republic of
Korea and Kuwait last year.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Kuwait provided the region with 140 million
US dollars in loans last year for building a key irrigation
project, which helped one million people in need there to improve
the quality of life.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Up to 1,500 civilians
are crossing Lake Tanganyika daily to escape rebel advances in
eastern Zaire, joined by smaller numbers of ragged Zairean
soldiers, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
There are already more than 15,000 Zairean refugees in camps

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Needs "New Start": Sharif </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's prime
minister-elect Nawaz Sharif said today his party would bring the
country "a new start" and do its utmost to overcome problems
facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan "needs a new start" after 50 years of its existence,
Sharif said after winning a vote of confidence in the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The 217-seat assembly cast 177 votes for Sharif, chief of the
Pakistan Muslim League (N). Former defense minister Aftab Shaban
Mirani of Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party secured only 16
votes.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) should not rest content with the victory of the
February 3 elections, instead it should spend every minute to the
development of Pakistan and better the life standard of the
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is to be sworn in as the country's 8th prime minister
since 1988 in a ceremony to be held later in the day in the
Presidential House. President Farooq Leghari will administer the
oath.
</P>
<P>
Around 700 people, including the three chiefs of the armed
forces, the outgoing caretaker prime minister and his cabinet
members, outgoing provincial chief ministers, governors and
members of the two houses of parliament will be present in the
sprawling majestic hall of the fifth floor of the Presidency.
</P>
<P>
After being sworn-in as the executive head of the country,
Sharif will address the house, in which he would explain the
priorities of his government.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's PML(N) has won a landslide victory in the February 3
elections held as a result of the dismissal of the Benazir
government by winning a two-thirds majority in the 217-seat
National Assembly while the PPP has only scored 17 seats.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Urge to Reform Science Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Scientists and educators from
developed as well as developing countries today unanimously called
for a radical reform of science education at high schools.
</P>
<P>
Professors from China, Germany, Turkey and South Africa
attending a 5-day seminar on science education here pointed out
that science education at high schools has not drawn enough
attention from various governments and the general public.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of science and mathematics for any
education toward the 21st century, Bruce Alberts, president of
U.S. National Academy of Science, regretted that teachers in the
United States "are not teaching science, but teaching science
words."
</P>
<P>
He said that part of the problem is the quality of teachers,
citing the fact that in 1990 only two teachers out of 1,000 in San
Francisco schools had majored in science.
</P>
<P>
They said that high school teachers and students only pursue
high marks, instead of teaching or learning knowledge and skills,
which they said are crucial to their future career and even the
rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
"A high capacity for abstract, conceptual thinking "should be
the purpose of high school science education, said one of the
participants in the discussions. Students should learn "how to
solve real-world problems."
</P>
<P>
Alberts said high school students also need the ability to work
easily and well with others and the skill required to resolve
conflict that arise with colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Many speakers offered suggestions on revising textbooks as well
as the method of teaching. Alberts said that science education
should be "hands-on, inquiry-based experiences" and communication
skills and problem-solving skills should be emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Learning from a teacher who serves as a source of all knowledge
should be replaced by a much more active and noisy classroom, in
which the teacher serves as a wise "coach" to encourage student
investigation and student problem solving, he said.

<HEADLINE> North China Province Aiming High in Agricultural Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province in north
China has a goal to boost grain and cotton production this year to
28.5 million tons and 300,000 tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the Fifth Session of the Eighth Hebei Provincial People's
Congress, Governor Ye Liansong told the assembly that his province
will step up protection of arable land in accordance with the law
and reclaim wasteland to ensure steady agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
In addition to ambitious grain and cotton production goals, the
province plans to produce 1.21 million tons of oil-bearing crops
this year. The governor noted that Hebei is one of the major grain
producers in China, and is famous for the quality of its wheat and
corn.
</P>
<P>
Despite serious flooding in the province last year, Hebei had a
record output of 27.89 million tons of grain, an increase of
500,000 tons over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the province has sown 6.6 million ha in grain,
400,000 ha in cotton, and 600,000 ha in oil-bearing crops.
</P>
<P>
The province is still paying attention to the use of new
agro-technology and prevention from plant diseases and insect
pests.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Nawaz Sharif today was
unanimously elected Pakistan's new prime minister after winning a
vote of confidence in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, Chief of the Pakistan Muslim League (N), won the vote
of confidence by 177 votes in favor in the 217-member National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is to be sworn in as the country's 8th prime minister in
a ceremony held later in the day in the Presidential House.
President Farooq Leghari will administer the oath.
</P>
<P>
Aftab Shaban Mirani, former defense minister and candidate of
the Pakistan People's Party for the post of the prime minister won
only 16 votes.
</P>
<P>
Around 700 people, including the three chiefs of the armed
forces, outgoing caretaker prime minister and his cabinet members,
outgoing provincial chief ministers, governors and members of the
two houses of parliament will be present at the oath-taking
ceremony to be held in the majestic hall on the fifth floor of the
Presidential House.
</P>
<P>
After his election as the executive head of the country, Sharif
will address the house, in which he would explain the priorities
of his government.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is the second Pakistani leader who is staging a comeback
to the top executive office after a gap of three years.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's first government was dismissed on April 18, 1993, by
the then President Ishaq Khan. But one and a half months later,
his government was restored by the Supreme Court which held Ishaq
Khan's action unconstitutional and illegal.
</P>
<P>
Then a war of mutual destruction ensued between the two. It
ended with the resignation of both in July, 1993, as a result of a
deal brokered by the army to end the country's political chaos.
</P>
<P>
Before Sharif, it was Benazir Bhutto, the PPP Chairperson, who
became prime minister twice in a short span of time. She first
assumed the premiership in 1988 and was dismissed in 1990 by Ishaq
Khan.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Benazir became prime minister again. But she was
sacked for the second time by President Leghari on November 5 last
year on charges of extra-judicial killing, corruption and misrule.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's PML(N) has won a landslide victory in the February 3
elections by winning a two-thirds majority in the 217-seat
National Assembly while the PPP has only scored 17 seats.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party to Extend "Issue-based" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party on
Sunday night decided to extend "issue-based" support to the United
Front minority government instead of "unconditional" support
offered so far, the National Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Working Committee (CWC), the supreme
decision-making body of the Congress Party, made this decision
after a five-hour-long in-depth meeting on the party's relations
with the United Front government headed by Prime Minister H.D.
Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
The committee also authorized the party's President Sitaram
Kesri to talk to the leaders of the 14-party United Front and
thereafter take appropriate steps.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after the meeting, party spokesman V.N.
Gadgil said the message was loud and clear that the Congress Party
was not afraid of facing a mid-term poll, if needed, and that the
United Front government "can not take our support for granted."
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party's outside support is crucial for the
government of the United Front which occupies only 190 out of the
545 seats in the House of People (the lower house of parliament).

<HEADLINE> Italy Stresses Balanced European Role in NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said on Sunday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO)'s eastward expansion plan should be transparent and allow
"full participation of all members".
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, Prodi also agreed with Albright on the
need of Russia's "constructive and responsible involvement" in
NATO's enlargement into central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's statement was in response to a French plan for an April
summit by five nations, excluding Italy, to discuss Russia's role
in NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
France proposed that France, Germany, Britain, the United
States and Russia meet before a scheduled summit of the 16 NATO
members in July in Madrid, Spain, which is to consider NATO's
restructuring and its relations with Russia in the post-Cold War
era, and its first recruitment of new members.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the transatlantic links within the
alliance should be reaffirmed, Prodi said that Europe had a
"growing" need to map out its own security and defense identity,
according to a statement issued by the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who newly took over the office of the U.S. State
Department, said she appreciated "Italy's constructive role in the
Balkans and the Mediterranean".
</P>
<P>
Prodi's view of a balanced European role in NATO expansion was
echoed by Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who, addressing a joint
news conference with Albright, said Italy "does not accept the
idea of a few countries meeting to discuss ideas that affect all
the countries in NATO".
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the day, Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta said
he had sought to impress upon the U.S. state secretary in their
talks the need to strike a balance between North and South.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said the enlargement must not merely reflect "the
geopolitics of middle Europe", but that of Europe as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that NATO is no longer the same as it was in the Cold
War, Albright told the Italian defense minister she was chiefly
concerned with security architecture rather than territorial
defense, Andreatta said.
</P>
<P>
In a Saturday interview with a French newspaper, Albright said
that a Europe within NATO should not be "perceived as being
directed against the Russians", and talks on creating a new
NATO-Russian charter were under way, which would set up a joint
council.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has been firm in opposing a NATO expansion to its
border, saying that would endanger Russia's national security and
risk a divided Europe.
</P>
<P>
Italy was the first stop of a round-the-world journey by
Albright, which will also take her to Germany, France, Britain,
Belgium, Russia, and Asian countries of South Korea, Japan and
China before ending on February 24.

partner, was up 35 percent to 45 million dollars while the exports
to third countries amounted to 147 million dollars with a 22
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Exports of woolen carpets and ready-made garments, two major
export items of Nepal, grew 24 and 31 percent respectively during

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Ends Visit to NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
left here this afternoon at the end of a three-day visit which has
created plenty of goodwill but made no specific deals between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He held formal talks with officials of the NZ government this
morning, including Prime Minister Jim Bolger. The talks covered a
range of issues without any formal decisions made.
</P>
<P>
Bolger said after the talks that the ties between the two
countries have never been better, and Howard said he is here to
make sure that the two countries are to maintain the good
relationship.
</P>
<P>
There are now no outstanding issues between the two neighbors
after Howard became Prime Minister last year. But it is understood
Howard wants to persuade NZ to commit more money on defense by
buying two more Australian-made frigates.
</P>
<P>
However, he told reporters after the meeting that "the question
how much NZ spends on defense, or social security or anything else
is a matter for New Zealanders" and "I don't come here to give
public lectures."
</P>
<P>
To voice its opposition to buying the frigates which NZ has
already bought two, pressure group Just Defense unfurled a large
banner near the parliament this morning where the talks were held,
 reading "Mr. Howard, NZrs don't need your useless frigates."
</P>
<P>
NZ has also made no comprise on Australia's plan to extend the
stand-down period for immigrants applying for benefits in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Now, New Zealanders living in Australia have a six-month
stand-down period before they can collect the dole, but Australia
wants to extend that to two years.
</P>
<P>
Howard also met NZ Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters this
morning and Opposition leader Helen Clark before flying home.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling Party to Prepare Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main ruling party is
to prepare its campaign for the upcoming local elections in order
to maintain its control of most of local administration bodies
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress (NC) party, which has led the three-party
coalition government since 1995, Sunday called a massive meeting
of the party's central and local-level leaders for working out its
candidate selection procedures and running strategies for the
local polls.
</P>
<P>
All senior as well as local leaders of the NC party are
requested to compulsory attend the meeting scheduled for February
27 and 28 in Kathmandu, according to a press release of the party
central office here.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to bring together all local
administration chiefs on district, municipality and village level
who were elected from the NC party in the last local elections in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The NC-led government last week decided to postpone the local
elections, originally scheduled for mid-April, for two months to
wait for the introduction of a decentralization law, which is
expected to give more autonomy to local bodies.
</P>
<P>
The NC party won the control of most of the local bodies in
some 4,000 villages, 36 municipalities and 75 districts in the
country in the last local polls and it would face a fierce
competition from the opposition if it wants to maintain its
dominance in the new local elections, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Soap Bubble Geometry Presented at U.S. Science Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Could the familiar soap bubble
be a topic at a prestigious science conference?
</P>
<P>
Yes. It is one of the topics at the ongoing annual meeting of
the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences (AAAS)
with more than 5,000 attendees.
</P>
<P>
"Art, bubbles, crystals, domes, geometry in the world around
you" is listed among the 143 topics on which more than 1,000
speakers make their presentations.
</P>
<P>
Soap bubble involves a century-old conjecture -- the Double
Bubble Conjecture
</P>
<P>
Frank Morgan, a professor of mathematics with Williams College
in Massachusetts, explained that soap bubbles try to minimize
area, and it is a famous theorem that a sphere - a single round
soap bubble - provides the least-area way to enclose a given
volume of air.
</P>
<P>
When two soap bubbles come together, they produce a
double consisting of two partial spheres and a separating
surface. The conjecture says that this standard shape is indeed
the least-area way to enclose and separate the two given volumes
of air.
</P>
<P>
The single soap bubble theorem, which says that it provides the
most efficient way to enclose a single prescribed volume, was
celebrated by the ancient Greeks and finally proved mathematically
by H.A. Schwartz in 1884. But the double bubble shape continues to
stump mathematicians.
</P>
<P>
Last year, two Californian mathematicians, Joel Hass and Roger
Schlafly, finally cracked the double bubble conjecture by
computations. They proved that the standard double bubble of equal
areas has less surface area than any alternative.
</P>
<P>
The two mathematicians' proof depended on earlier undergraduate
research at Williams College by 12 students. They proved the
planar version of the Double Bubble Conjecture, according to
Prof. Morgan. They did it in 1990 in a research geometry group.
</P>
<P>
The equal volumes case of the Double Bubble Conjecture has been
proved but the unequal volumes case remains open, Morgan said.

<HEADLINE> Nawaz Sharif to Be Sworn in as New Pak PM Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Pakistan Muslim
League(N) Nawaz Sharif is to be sworn in as the country's new
prime minister after winning a vote of confidence in the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly is to meet today at 9.00 a.m. to elect
the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Elahi Bakhsh Soomro, the newly-elected Speaker of the National
Assembly, will preside over the session.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and former defense minister Aftab Shaban Mirani from the
Pakistan People's Party filed their nomination papers to the
Secretary General of the National Assembly through their
representatives on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The winner of the contest will be sworn in later in the day at
a ceremony to be held at the Presidential House. President Farooq
Leghari will administer the oath.
</P>
<P>
Around 700 people, including the three chiefs of the armed
forces, outgoing caretaker prime minister, his cabinet members,
outgoing provincial chief ministers, governors and members of the
two houses of parliament will be present at the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, whose PML(N) holds a two-thirds majority in the
217-seat National Assembly, is certain to occupy the office of the
prime minister for the second time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
It is most likely that Sharif, who is also the PML(N)'s
parliamentary leader, will win the support of more than 175
National Assembly members.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) already enjoys the strength of 135 seats in the
National Assembly besides the clear-cut support of its allied
parties including the Awami (People's) National Party (ANP) and
the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM).
</P>
<P>
National Assembly members from the Federal-Administered Tribal
Areas as well as those belonging to the minorities are also likely
to favor Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The election of the prime minister is likely to be unanimous,
in view of the gesture shown by Benazir Bhutto and her party,
during the election of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The PPP, who bagged only 17 seats in the February 3 elections
in the National Assembly, probably will withdraw its candidate as
it did in the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the
National Assembly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After his election as the executive head of the country, Sharif
will address the house, in which he would explain the priorities
of his government.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto, who is likely to be elected as opposition
leader, may also address the house.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is the second Pakistani leader who is staging a comeback
to the top executive office after a gap of three years.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's government was dismissed on April 18, 1993 by the then
President Ishaq Khan. But one and a half months later, his
government was restored by the Supreme Court which held Ishaq
Khan's action unconstitutional and illegal.
</P>
<P>
Then a war of mutual destruction ensued between the two. It
ended with the resignation of both in July 1993, as a result of a
deal brokered by the army to end political chaos.
</P>
<P>
Before Sharif, it was Benazir who became prime minister twice
in a short span of time. She assumed this office in 1988 and was
dismissed in 1990 by Ishaq Khan. She again became prime minister
in 1993 and was sacked again by President Leghari on November 5
last year on charges of extra-judicial killings, corruption and
misrule.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Brands ASEM Political Talks "Ineffective" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian foreign minister
Ali Alatas has criticized last Saturday's Asian-Europe meeting
(ASEM) in Singapore for attempting to discuss major political
issues in a cramped one-day agenda.
</P>
<P>
"How is it possible to discuss substantive political issues in
one day when the U.N. does it in three months?" Alatas told
Indonesian journalists Sunday, according to an Antara news agency
report today.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is "reluctant" to address substantive political
issues in ASEM as the exercise is "ineffective," and undermines
the discussion of "other matters of importance," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Indonesia's criticism of ASEM is shared by other
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Alatas pointed out that "there seems to be an impression among
European countries that Asia is shy of discussing political issues
in ASEM."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's principle of not engaging in the discussion of
major political issues is based on the statement made by the
chairman of the first ASEM in Bangkok last year, which read that
"all dialogs should articulate issues that have been mutual agreed
upon with the aim of fostering mutual understanding and
friendship."
</P>
<P>
Alatas emphasized that the Bangkok statement "is the principle
under which all dialogs should be held in ASEM."
</P>
<P>
One of the European countries which had openly mentioned
Indonesia's reluctance to discuss crucial political issues was
Portugal as it had from the beginning expected a thorough
discussion on the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an Indonesian delegate to the ASEM said ASEAN (the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) was united in opposing any
discussion on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N. are involved in the annual
tripartite talks on East Timor, which have been going on for the
past five years under the auspices of the world body's secretary
general.

PARIS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuban long jumper Ivan Pedroso
registered 8.60 meters to set the second best indoor performance

The Cuban recorded a 8.96-meter jump at an outdoor event in
Sestriere, Italy, in 1995, but the would-be world record was not

<HEADLINE> Wanted Assassin Surrenders To Sri Lankan Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Mahinda Ratnatilleke, former
United National Party (UNP) mayor of Ratnapura, Sunday midnight
surrendered to a Sri Lankan Court in Colombo, according to police
sources today.
</P>
<P>
Ratnatilleke and UNP District Member of Parliament Susantha
Punchinilame were wanted by the police with a bounty of Rs one
million (17,500 US dollars) being offered for the assassination of
ruling Peoples Alliance District Member of Parliament Nalanda
Ellawala last Tuesday when political violence flared up after
local government nominations.
</P>
<P>
Ratnatilleke and Punchinilame went missing after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by them to surrender through the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) failed as the ICRC does not have
a mandate to intervene in such matters, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources added that Ratnailleke surrendered through
his lawyers to the Colombo Fort Magistrate at midnight yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Punchinilame is still in hiding.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Responsible for Security In Ratnapura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan army is now
responsible for preserving law and order in the violence ridden
town of Ratnapura, the capital city of Sabaragamuwa province, 110
kilometers from Colombo, according to official sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The army's 11th brigade has deployed troops in the area
following the failure by police to control angry crowds. The
crowds had gone on the rampage, looting and burning buildings
following the assassination of District Member of Parliament
Nalanda Ellawala last Tuesday during political clashes.
</P>
<P>
The army had to rush troops in aid of police at Kuruwita on
Saturday evening when about 750 persons made an attempt to enter
the police station attacking it with stones. Police repelled the
attack with rubber bullets, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bid to storm the police station followed ruling party
activists' attack on the houses and business establishments owned
by the main opposition United National Party supporters.
</P>
<P>
When the mobs tried to storm the police station again, the
police and army were compelled to fire at the mobs during which 2
persons were killed and over 100 persons including several
policemen were injured, the sources added.

BUCHAREST, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania scored remarkable
achievements in cracking down on poor-quality and pseudo products
to protect the interests and rights of consumers in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Consumers Protection under the government has
inspected markets across the country for 56,000 times and imposed
on illegal businessmen a total penalty of 56 billion Lev (about
11.4 million U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
The bureau also seized poor-quality goods worth 886 billion Lev
(about 1.8 billion dollars), of which 52 percent were imported.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the country's markets have been flooded with
poor-quality and fake goods, especially false famous-brand foreign
wines and liquor, Romania's Libera newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bureau seized more than 4,000 litres of such
wines and liquor in the capital city of Bucharest alone.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) Sunday called off the scheduled low-level talks
between its ceasefire committee and the Philippine government,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
MILF vice chairman for political affairs Ghazzali Jaafar said
the postponement was due to an ongoing government military
operation in Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao province and the massive
deployment of government troops in adjacent areas.

decided to reset the joint MILF-government technical committee
meeting on February 25 at Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao.
</P>

Jaafar said he has informed the government peace panel chairman
Fortunato Abat of the MILF's decision.
</P>
<P>
Some Army soldiers backed by helicopter gunships has conducted
offensives on February 6, 8 and 15 on some MILF positions in
Shariff Aguak town and nearby areas, Jaafar said.
</P>

and left some casualties, but Jaafar refused to give any specific
figures on the reported casualties.

<HEADLINE> Baht Devaluation Won't Help Exports: Thai Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A leading Thai banker believes
that Thailand's economic structure has changed so much that a
devaluation of the baht would not greatly benefit exports.
</P>
<P>
Olarn Chaipravat, chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association,
said at the weekend that in 1981 and 1984 the baht was devalued,
making Thailand's main exports, agricultural products, cheaper.
</P>
<P>
However, industrial goods have today become the country's major
foreign currency-earner, and 43 percent of the raw materials and
content of manufactured exports are imported.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, devaluation would increase the costs for
manufacturers and make their exports more expensive, Olarn said.
</P>
<P>
"The result would be that Thailand would lost its
competitiveness. this is why I say we cannot devalue our baht --
not at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
In recently months the baht has been depreciating against the
surging US dollar and foreign traders are speculating that the
Thai government will have to devalue the baht to boost exports.
Thailand's exports declined by 0.1 percent last year, the first
drop for decades.
</P>
<P>
Besides the adverse impact on exports, devaluation would
increase the country's external debt, according to Olarn.
</P>
<P>
Preserving the value of the baht is the top priority, Olarn
said, adding that the Bank of Thailand and the Finance Ministry
would have to fight to the end, drawing on all their foreign
reserves.
</P>
<P>
If Thailand devalued the baht as the foreign traders wanted,
the Thai economy would collapse, Olarn claimed.
</P>
<P>
In the last few months, there have been rumors about the
possible devaluation of the baht, but the Bank of Thailand has
repeatedly denied.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Italy Agree on NATO Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and her Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini said
today that the NATO expansion should remain in process without
spoiling the relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
To avoid being in opposition to Russia is one of the goals of a
new NATO, said Albright, who started in Italy her maiden overseas
trip as the first woman top diplomat of Washington.
</P>
<P>
During her 11-day trip to Rome, Bonn, Paris, Brussels, London,
Moscow, Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing, the U.S. secretary of state will
mainly focus on the NATO enlargement plan, which has been strongly
opposed by Russia who thought the plan would threaten its security.
</P>
<P>
A "more structured relationship" will be sought with Russia,
leading to a possible "charter" or "statute" in which Russia would
have a greater political say in the process and would be more
involved in peace missions, said Dini.
</P>
<P>
The Western military alliance has proposed a charter with
Russia that envisages a joint council for intensive consultations
in an effort to eliminate Moscow's concerns about NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
NATO is expected to discuss admissions of new members, most
probably Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, at a summit
scheduled in Madrid on July 7-8.
</P>
<P>
During her day-long visit to Rome, Albright also discussed with
Dini the relationship with Libya, Cuba, Iraq and Iran, which
Washington would like to see isolated, but they remained different
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Dini hoped that the hurdles which prevent the normalization of
relations between Libya and the world community can be gradually
cleared by an effort on Libya's part and a little understanding on
the West.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military to Attack Muslim Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military is
preparing a major offensive against the Abu Sayyaf, a Muslim
extremist group, after the arrest of one of its ranking officers
Saturday, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Khadafi Janjalani, younger brother of Abu Sayyaf leader
Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani, was arrested together with six other
Abu Sayyaf members Saturday in Cebu city in the southern Cebu
province, according to the Manila Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces chief of staff, Gen. Arnulfo Acedera, was
quoted as saying that with the capture of Khadafi Janjalani, the
military has gained better chances of capturing his elder brother.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said he had alerted the ground troops of the Armed
Forces to do extensive monitoring of the activities of the Abu
Sayyaf in several areas in Mindanao island.
</P>
<P>
He said the Abu Sayyaf has been giving the government problems
in its campaign to end violence in Mindanao through peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
According to Acedera, with its membership diminishing to about
300, the Abu Sayyaf is trying desperately to regain its influence
in the southern Philippines by terrorizing civilians and attacking
religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
A 5 million peso (190,000 U.S. dollars) reward has been offered
for the arrest of elder Janjalani, considered the No.1 most wanted
criminal in the country.
</P>
<P>
The military said he was responsible for the death of hundreds
of civilians at the Ipil massacre in 1995 and the killing of Sulu
provincial bishop Benjamin de Jesus last week.

<HEADLINE> Some 400 People Seek 57 Official Posts in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Almost 400 people have applied
for 57 intermediate official vacancies in the Chinese capital
during the first two days of a 10-day application period.
</P>
<P>
Openings include those with the municipal government,
state-owned companies, publishing houses and universities. They
include bureau deputy directors and senior managers.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the main hall of the Culture Palace for Working
People to the north of the Tiananmen Square - half the size of a
football court - bustled with people asking, consulting, and
filling out applications, according to China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Three hundred people registered for the exams on the opening
day, with another 100 registering the second day.
</P>
<P>
College graduates under 45 who have been division chiefs for
more than three years or vice-division chiefs for more than five
years are eligible for the recruitment drive. The age limit can be
extended to 50 for exceptional candidates.
</P>
<P>
"Recruitment through open exams offers a wider range of choice
for those capable," Zhao Xiaoling, deputy division chief of
personnel of the Beijing Statistic Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The candidates will take writing and oral exams covering common
knowledge and specialties.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to women, ethnic minority and non-Party
member candidates over others with the same qualification.
</P>
<P>
Five bureau deputy directors were chosen this way in Beijing
last year. That was the first time since 1949 that the capital
adopted an open exam approach in recruiting intermediate-ranking
officials, an earlier report said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 provinces, municipalities and automonous regions
across the country, 25 have adopted the new methods.
</P>
<P>
The other five provinces are expected to follow suit when they
finish restructuring their provincial governments.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Inspection Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration for
Industry and Commerce (SAIC) will keep a sharper eye on corporate
activities than ever before, thanks to new regulations on annual
enterprise inspection in effect since last month.
</P>
<P>
The annual enterprise inspection is a major way for central and
local industry and commerce administrations to determine whether
an enterprise has followed the regulations and earned the right to
keep its business, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The regulations require that every year from January to April,
all enterprises must report the prior year's major activities to
the administrations for industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Pan Haimin, head of the enterprise supervision division under
the SAIC, said the old regulations, first implemented in 1993, had
played an effective role but needed to be rectified.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations include revisions which will improve
enterprise management and help creat a fair business climate, Pan
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that this year the SAIC will cancel business licenses
for unqualified enterprises and for enterprises that have not
taken part in the annual inspection in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Under the former and less stringent regulations, both types of
enterprises would probably have kept their licenses.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about ten percent of all domestic enterprises did
not join in the annual inspection, Pan said.
</P>
<P>
This year the SAIC will, for the first time, distinguish
between two grades of qualified enterprises - Grade A and grade
B. Enterprises labelled grade B because of minor violations, will
be prohibited from opening new branches, investing overseas and
expanding operations, Pan said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the new regulations also apply to enterprises'
subsidiaries, whether independent or not, rather than formerly
only to independent enterprises.

"Wool consumption is expected to increase as China enters the
second year of its Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), but the
factors restricting wool imports in the past year will not change
overnight," Luan Richeng, general manager of Chinatex Raw
Materials Import and Export Corp, was quoted.
</P>
<P>
China remains one of the largest wool importers in the world,
even though its wool imports decreased in 1996, said Luan.
</P>
<P>
China imported 198,000 tons of wool, worth 753 million US
dollars, during the January-November period of 1996, down 22.6
percent from the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Luan attributed the slump in the wool trade partly to a lack of
funds in most domestic wool-spinning enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, an increasing number of textile enterprises have
lost sales, resulting in an increase in the inventories of
finished woolen and worsted products.
</P>
<P>
The wool-spinning sector is unable to turn out the high
value-added products demanded by the market, but has a production
over-capacity for goods of poor quality, Luan said.
</P>
<P>
Another factor affecting China's wool imports is the drop in
textile and garment exports, Luan said.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics indicate that exports of textiles and
garments decreased 3.8 percent to 30.68 billion US dollars during
the first 11 months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Luan said that Chinatex, the largest wool trading company in
the country, imported 50,000 tons of wool last year, about one
quarter of the total imported by the country.

<P>
ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece has decided to form a
special Rapid Action Force (RAF) as part of its new defense
strategy, Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos announced
here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said that the new move was intended to
cope with what he claimed "Turkey's challenge to Greek
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The RAF force, which is featured with flexibility and mobility,
would be trained in a modern way and provided with powerful fire
arms, Tsohatzopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Greece must create necessary conditions so as
to buy advanced equipment for the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Greece and Turkey worsened recently over
the long-standing Cyprus issue, which broke out in 1974.

<HEADLINE> World's Electronics Users Peer into China's LCDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The liquid crystal display
(LCD) industry, an obscure and negligible sector of China's
economy a decade ago, now fills more than half of the
international demand for the screens.
</P>
<P>
The displays are used widely in the manufacture of watches,
laptop computers, calculators, pagers and miniature television
sets, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 35,000 square meters of the displays were produced by
Chinese plants, with sales worth only 73.6 million yuan (about
8.87 million US dollars). In 1995, however, 65 producers
manufactured 455,000 square meters of displays generating sales of
1.65 billion yuan (about 198.7 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Output continued rising -- to an estimated 550,000 square
meters in 1996 with sales worth two billion yuan (about 240
million US dollars), said Liu Peizheng, secretary-general of the
China Optics and Optoelectronics Industry Association's LCD branch.
</P>
<P>
Three types of LCDs are produced in China: low-grade twisted
nematic LCDs (TN-LCD), high-grade super twisted nematic LCDs
(STN-LCD) and the most advanced, thin-film transistor LCDs
(TFT-LCD).
</P>
<P>
Most of the industry's 43 production lines turn out TN-LCDs,
which are "competitive around the world," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 80 percent of the TN-LCDs produced -- equivalent
to half the global demand -- are exported, the English-language
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
NT-LCDs worth 115 million US dollars were exported in 1995. The
final 1996 figure is expected to reach 130 million US dollars --
12 times the 10.7 million in export sales earned in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, the industry supplies 80 percent of the LCD
market.
</P>
<P>
Although the production technology for high-grade STN-LCD
screens lags behind those in Japan and other developed countries,
China's LCD industry has completed six production lines for
high-grade screens and 10 more are either being built or planned.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Electronics Industry is determined to restrict
the overheated expansion of STN-LCD production capacity, according
to a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Liu echoed the ministry's stand, pointing out that the STN-LCD
market is still too limited.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the industry should give priority to scaling up
production of TN-LCDs and developing thin-film TFT-LCD
technology.

<HEADLINE> Earnings of Township Enterprises in Yunnan Hit All Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The business earnings of the
township industrial sector in southwest China's border province of
Yunnan have hit an all-time high, according to the latest
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the total earnings of these companies reached 100.4
billion yuan (nearly 10 billion US dollars), a 60 percent increase
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
To date, both the number of the firms and their employees have
doubled over the 1990 figure. And development of these businesses
in Yunnan started much later than did those in the coastal
provinces in China.
</P>
<P>
The scattered distribution of township enterprises in Yunnan,
44 of which now produce over 100 million yuan (nearly 10 million
US dollars) in annual output, has also changed.
</P>
<P>
"Some 90 zones have been established to accommodate the
concentration of township enterprises in Yunnan," said one official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total output of township enterprises
in Yunnan now accounts for more than half of the total rural
output in the province, and their employees make up 17.4 percent
of the total rural labor force.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises are beginning to play a more important
role in the province's industrial sector. "Sixty-three percent of
the province's coal output and some 70 percent of the phosphate
rocks are from the township industrial sector," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang said the township
enterprises are becoming one of the main economic forces in the
province.
</P>
<P>
"Township enterprises as a whole have brought much vitality to
the overall economic growth of Yunnan, and they are also the main
source of the farmers' income and the main place to absorb the
surplus of rural laborers," he said.

<HEADLINE> NZ to Use New Method to Fight Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Wellington Hospital
will employ a new weapon in the fight against cancer which offers
new hope to patients with certain types of tumors.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper "The Dominion" reported today that the
process, involving modifying a particular type of cell to
stimulate the immune system to fight tumor, is about to be tried
after three years of laboratory work.
</P>
<P>
The cells are dentritic cells, a highly specialized form of
blood cell.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted researcher David Ritchie as saying that
dentritic cell therapy is not a world breakthrough yet. But it
will be a significant contribution in the area of immunotherapy,
which is where most research effort is now concentrated.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we are the only ones in the world applying
dentritic cell therapy like this," he said.
</P>
<P>
The process involves removing dendritic cells from the patient
and growing them to relatively large numbers before stimulating
them with an antigen from the tumor.
</P>
<P>
The "armed" cells will then to replaced in the patient,
stimulating his or her immune system to fight their tumor, the
reports said.

<P>
LANZHOU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Villagers in a remote city in
northwestern China have benefited from the local government's
poverty-combatting drive, changing their thatched-roof cottages
for tile-roofed brick houses.
</P>
<P>
Tianshui city in Gansu province is in an outlying remote
mountainous area that has 2.8 million people, a number of whom are
badly in need. To help them the city government began a two-year
project to renovate and rebuild thatched cottages for the most
poverty-stricken.
</P>
<P>
More than 11,400 thatched cottages scattered about six counties
and districts under the city's jurisdiction have been renovated
and rebuilt, benefiting approximately 20,000 villagers.
</P>
<P>
The city government has tried every means possible to get
funds, and various government departments have gotten over 2.3
million yuan (285,000 US dollars) for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The city set up special offices at the county and district
level to handle the renovation work and to see to it that all
villagers living in thatched-roof dwellings move to new housing.
</P>
<P>
Villagers who benefitted from the move expressed their
gratitude by setting up stone tablets in their villages inscribed
with the words "Never forget the Loving-kindness of the Party and
government."

<TEXT>
<P>
DUBAI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Thomas Muster of
Austria beat defending champion Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia in the
final to win the 1 million U.S. dollars Dubai Tennis Open.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian, currently ranked third in the world behind
Ivanisevic, who was top seed here, scored a 7-5, 7-6 (7-3) victory
in one hour, 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"I played extremely well from the back court and put pressure
on him when necessary. I'm delighted with the way I fought," said
Muster, adding his next goal is the French Open. He also promised
to return next year to defend his title.
</P>
<P>
The whole mathc remained delicately balanced with only one
break in the two sets. But Ivanisevic, who served very well, made
so many errors in vital moments that kept himself away from
defending the title.
</P>
<P>
Muster, playing mostly from the baseline, looked more steady
and aggresive. He fond his first and last break in Ivanisevic's
fifth game.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, when Ivcanisevic makde a disasterous double
fault, Muster took advanctage of Ivanisevic's error and claimed a
6-5 lead. He consolidated the lead after holding his last game to
take a 7-5 win.
</P>
<P>
In the second, Ivanisevic and Muster raised their play to
extraordinary heights. Both players went for the most difficult of
winners, rallying for many strokes on some points on the hard
court.
</P>
<P>
With the set tied at 6-6, Muster raced to a 4-0 lead in the
tiebreaker as Ivanisevic's game was plagued by errors. Though the
defending champion battled back to 6-3, Muster ended the match
with an overhead smash.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic was downhearted after playing so well and only
managing to finish runner-up. "It was my best I have played for a
long time. I had many opportunities to break but I put all them
off," Ivanisevic said. Ednitem

Asia.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is on her first tour abroad since she was sworn
in last month, is scheduled to meet with German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel and Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday to discuss NATO
expansion, the Middle East peace process, the former Yugoslavia as
well as the U.S.-German differences on the controversial
Scientology sect.
</P>
<P>
Before flying to Bonn, she had met Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta and Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini. The main topic was NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
She told a press conference after the meetings in Rome that it
was not NATO's aim to oppose Russia. Russian opposition to the
proposed enlargement belonged to an outdated mentality.
</P>
<P>
Albright also made clear that Washington insisted on holding
NATO's South Command in Naples in opposition to French suggestions
that the post be transferred to Europe.

arbiter Robert Owen since it provided only a temporary solution.
</P>
<P>
SDS's acting President Aleksa Buha, told reporters in Pale, the
Serb administrative center, that the uncertainty would continue
over the next year since the decision on the fate of the town was
put off until next year.
</P>
<P>
Roberts Owen, chairman of a three-member arbitration panel,
announced in Rome on Friday that the volatile town would be put
under international supervision pending a final decision in March
1998.
</P>
<P>
Brcko, claimed both by the Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat
federation, is situated on a land corridor in northeastern Bosnia
linking eastern and western parts of Serb-controlled territory,
thus vitally important to the Serb authority. Serb leaders had
threatened to resume war if the town, which is now under Serb
control, was not ruled in their favor.
</P>
<P>
But Buha, who is also the Serb foreign minister, said the
essential facts in the international decision were respect for the
strategic interest of the Serbs to remain the town within
Republika Srpska and no changes in demarcation lines.
</P>
<P>
This latest decision also envisaged a whole series of
additional measures stemming from the obligations which Republika
Srpska undertook in line with the Dayton accords, especially in
connection with freedom of movement and the right of refugees to
return home, Tanjug news agency quoted Buha as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Owen, a supervisor would be assigned to work in
Brcko, ensuring full freedom of movement, overseeing the return of
Muslim-Croat refugees and implementing an economic revitalization
program for the Brcko area.
</P>
<P>
Buha said the implementation of the decision would be worked
out in detail at the conference in Vienna in early March.
